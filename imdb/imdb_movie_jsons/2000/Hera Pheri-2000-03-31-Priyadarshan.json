Akshay Kumar is great, Sunil Shetty is also great and Paresh Rawal steals the show and the rest of the supporting casts are good too. The songs are good, screenplay is good, storyline is good and mostly direction is also good. It's one of those classic comedy movies like Andaz apna apna and Jaane bhi do yaaro10 out 10 stars",

            "content": "I never expected much from this movie, because of the cast: Fading Sunil Shetty, sabseboringKhiladi/monkeyboy Akki and serious Tabu. The only hope i had was in Paresh Rawal. After seeing him in the hilarious Andaz Apna Apna (Highly recommended), he was to be taken notice of.So when I did watch it I was shocked to say the least. I found Hera Pheri to be one the best comedies of the decade. Just forget about the cheap attempts of David Dhawan called comedy. This is the real deal.The story is simple (as is with many good movies). The 3 protagonists Shyam (Sunil Shetty), Raju (Akshay Kumar) and Babu Rao (Paresh Rawal) are all in dire need of money. Shyam needs it to pay back an old friend (Om Puri) so he can get his(as in Puri's) sister married. Raju needs it for his mother and Babu Rao to pay back loans his father took. When a local rich man's grand daughter gets kidnapped by 'dangerous' gangster Kabira (Gulshan Grover) calls Babu Rao's number by mistake, Raju sees an end to all their problems. He suggests they play a game, do some hera pheri. And the movie is off to take you for an awesome ride.Performances by far surprised me. Sunil Shetty I never liked, but his performance as the somewhat naive do-gooder was wonderful. Akki ape also surprised me in his sense of comedic timing. But Paresh was the biggest surprise. Even though he was my only hope for this movie, he came out ten times better than I expected. He deserved the best comedian Filmfare Award, that he did receive for 2000. Tabu (Anu) as another person in need of money who fights with Shyam for a job is also competent. It is a small role but as always she leaves her mark. Asrani in a tiny role also gives some laughs. Om Puri was also excellent in his small role.So Bravo Priyadarshan saheb! Once again you've shown that you are a unique and intelligent filmmaker with a lot of tricks up your sleeve. One tip though, don't think too much about the logic of the story or the probability. Just turn off your brain for a few hours and enjoy. You'll find yourself cracking up every time you think of \"Kabira speaking\". Watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.",

            "review_title": "the best comedy i have seen in my life and i have seen many",
            "content": "Hera Pheri is a film set in Mumbai and is not your run of the mill slapstick comedy that directors like David Dhawan indulge in. The movie is directed by Priyadarshan who proved that after making such wonderful and serious film like Virasat, he can also direct a comedy with \u00e9lan.This film is a comedy of error. Set in a Mumbai slum where our three protagonists dwell, the movie depicts the hilarious moments created by the simplicity and/or stupidity of the characters. The look of the film is that of an art film. By the look of it, it seems as if it is going to be a really serious movie but it turns out to be one roller-coaster ride of laughter. The cast of the film includes Sunil Shetty who plays an unemployed guy who comes to Mumbai looking for work and a place to live. He lands up at the house of a simple man played deftly by Paresh Rawal who takes Sunil in. However, there is another person living in the house, namely Raju. Played by Akshay Kumar, Raju is the mischief monger and good for nothing. He keeps on getting jobs and losing them quickly. The story is taken forward by a phone call by the gangster Kabira who keeps on saying that he has kidnapped his grand daughter (sunil takes the call) and wants ransom. This call kickstarts a mayhem. Which ultimately leads us to the climax of the film where the protagonists end up becoming millionaires. Each and every member of the cast is brilliant in the performance of their roles. Sunil Shetty and Akshay Kumar's careers were in doldrums when this film released and both of them gave a stunning performance. Especially Akshay Kumar shows impeccable comic timing. Akshay Kumar is considered of the best comic actors of Bollywood these days after performing comic roles in films like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi, Khakee, Aawara Paagal Deewana and Waqt. However, the show stealer is none other that the unbelievable Paresh Rawal who plays Baburao Ganpatrao Apte. He is an absolute delight to watch. It will be an understatement to say that he completely overshadows the rest of the actors with his marvellous portrayal of a poor Mumbaiyya simpleton. This film changed the course of his career and he is now reckoned as a character actor who adds to the star value of a film. The music is not that good though. The song \"Main Ladka Pom Pom\" is hilarious though. The picturization keeps you in splits even though the song is irritating if you only listen to the audio. The real hero of the film is the dialogue writer Neeraj Vohra who comes up with some never before heard one liners. Anyone who wants another example of his great work must watch Aawara Paagal Deewana. In short, a film for every comedy lover. Some clean entertainment. Moreover, I can confidently say that this is the best comedy film i have seen in my life. Brilliant!",

            "content": "Look, I am a simple man. I see Akshay Kumar in a 2000s Bollywood comedy film, I watch it. And I'd blame this film for my obsession. And I'm like 99% sure I'm not the only one who thinks that way. Hera Pheri was something completely new for its time. Bollywood comedy-of-errors were not very common back in the days. And even if they were they'd rarely be good. So rare that we can practically name them (let's try - Golmaal, Andaz Apna Apna. That's it, I did it).Hera Pheri comes from a time when we were not used to this kind of a humour. After a complete decade of mindless slapsticks by Govinda, this seemed like something that was completely driven by the comic timing, phenomenal acting, the setting and the story. If any of these elements was missing this film would have also crumbled down like the later comedy movies of Akshay Kumar. What exactly makes this film special are the characters, their relatable behaviour and the situation they got in.Raju, Shyam and Baburao have now become household names. The character of Kabira has also become something staple with bad guys on phones. Amrish Puri chasing Shyam for returning his money so that he could have his sister's wedding was a very well done runnig joke. And finally the ending scene was also very satisfying. Overall there was a great performance by all the actors.I think I have heard this movie is going to get a third part with John Abraham. I'd absolutely not want that. Replacing Akshay Kumar with John Abraham will surely ruin the franchise (like Welcome and Welcome Back). I'd prefer that both of them should stay, if the planned sequel is actually very good. But otherwise a duology is perfect.",

This is one of the movies which make a permanent imprint on your mind and give you a lot to talk about. With snappy dialogs , impeccable story and a perfect combination of actors and actresses this is certainly a must see. With Indian cinema being crippled by the \"HIGH\" emotional dramas containing stories of ultimate suffering of impossible proportions, Hera Pheri was the turning point, where all the bollywood film industry saw the power of a simple comedy. Starring Paresh Rawal, Suniel Shetty , Akshay Kumar , Tabu , Asrani, Om Puri , Gulshan Grover Hera Pheri had all the ingredients of a super hit. If you hate Indian movies and are against all the high melodrama dose you get free with a DVD of Indian movie, Hera Pheri is just the movie for you. With a sequel now being aired \"Phir Hera Pheri\" which is too good for a sequel. Go watch both of these movies and have a big laugh.",

The first time I watched it I couldn't sleep most of that night because I just continued to laugh on my bed.10 on 10 for me. Although I enjoyed other comedy movies of Priyadarshan like Hungama, Hulchul & Garam Masala and thought those were no less than Hera Pheri, but later when I watched those again they were not so funny as Hera Pheri. Akshay Kumar's acting was great but Paresh Rawal with his character Babu Rao is the one who steals the show, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Om Puri also played their parts well.Hera Pheri I believe is a milestone in Bollywood because it showed that you don't always need a emotional romantic/patriotic movie to produce a Hit Movie. This movie started a much needed trend of Bollywood Comedies that relied more on stories, errors and confusions for its fun element breaking away from those clich\u00e9 slapstick comedies of David Dhawan starring Govinda. However the sequel to this movie Phir Hera Pheri I must say was disappointing, the first half was OK but the second half was really poor especially the circus scenes. That movie I guess lacked the Priyadarshan touch . Anyways there are talks about a third version of Hera Pheri and that I hope will be as funny as this one.BTW this movie is a remake of a Southern Movie...So those who have a problem with remakes and also those who lack a Sense of Humor should stay away.",

I could easily compare him to Robert De Nero, who excelled in \"Analyze Me\" and he never envisioned himself as a funny actor. The script is superb and the laughter is infectious with the venerable master of comedy, Paresh Rawal, at the helm. Akshay Kumar, who is other wise pathetic in serious roles, makes a good team with the muscle man Shetty, whose acting skills, are in the same range as Kumar's! After \"Padosan\" there has been some sprinkling of comedy, more like buffoonery, with the likes of Aaamir Khan, Johnny Lever and Shakti Kapoor, whose comedy interludes appeal to the \"sophisticated front bencher's\" who like fart jokes and toilet humor and Anti-Indian and demeaning humor produced by the \"Benchods of Bollywood\" as in films like \"Three Idiots\", \"Delhi Belly\" etc. The front benchers like filth since they live in the slums and this is the best they have seen in their life. They worship these \"Monkey's of Mumbai\" the Midget, The Ugly and The Apeman, since they are promoted by the \"Media Maggots of Mumbai\" who give glorious reviews for the price of banana thrown at them time to time. The comedy was generally demeaning, cheap and vulgar. But the audience had to put up with this, since there was no alternative, and they were not to blame since the scribes were not funny in the first place. The scene is changing with the script-writers and director the caliber of Priyadarshan. This is one funny movie that has opened the flood-gate for movies like \"Mallammal Weekly\" and others.",

But, oddly enough, this only applies when they're pure comedies. If they're comedic dramas like 3 Idiots or Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., I like them just fine. But if they're supposed to be comedy classics, they've left me cold.Hera Pheri being no exception. The story is about these three dudes. Two vagabonds and good-for-nothings who are bunking with this third dude, their quote-unquote landlord. They're all suffering from poor prospects and crippling money shortcomings. That is, until a kidnapper accidentally contacts them instead of his intended target. And they decide to insert themselves as the middle-man into this situation.It's a workable plot. I've heard much worse. Unfortunately, I simply loathe the execution. The two vagabonds, played by Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty, are insufferable. You want nothing more than to slap them on their heads and tell them to shape up and take responsibility once in their lives. Their landlord, played by Paresh Rawal, is the only sympathetic character in the movie, and even he plays it way over the top in a way that I haven't seen in a Western movie since the middle of the last century. The constant singing and dancing doesn't help.Cultural differences, I know, but it's still a rather tall order for me to ask one of my friends to sit through a comedy way over two hours long if I didn't laugh even once during its run-time.Apparently this is a beloved comedy classic in India. And if they find the film hilarious, power to them. Personally, I regret the hours I had to spend watching this.",

            "content": "Hera Pheri is a classic bollywood comedy film, directed by Priyadarshan starring the comic trio Paresh Rawal as Babu Rao, Akshay Kumar as Raju and Sunil Shetty as Shyam. This film, with its impeccable comic sense, far from vulgar or obscenity, presents, more than comic reliefs, the contemporary Mumbai city-life from the perspective of middle class unemployeds if not poverty-ridden subalterns. Raju, Shyam both sunk in the ocean of debts, comes to Mumbai, with dream in their eyes, only to earn bread and butter, in the giant professional bourgeois culture of the Indian financial capital.\nThe way the character of Raju and Shyam are portrayed, is equivalent to Freudian id and superego respectively. While Raju vows to 'cheat anyone to fill his desperate need of money', Shyam examines any work from it's socio-ethical construction. Babu Rao, on the other hand, having discussion with both the impulsive, freudian idiotic Raju and ethical pessimist Shyam, concludes and finally 'decides' whether and how to go ahead, resulting a balance between id and superego, reflecting human qualities. With the satisfaction of their desperate need of the hour - money, the film resolves to provide a poetic justice in the end, which seems utopian, miraculous to some extent. Having said that, only because the conflict resolutes to conclude with the poetic justice, it soothes the emotions of audience. Although flop in the opening days of the film, the film managed to get a whooping 8.2/10 on IMDb and successfully secured a place in the shelf of bollywood classics, as well as the fans and spectators of the industry.",

Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty do great as well, and they also did great comedy. Tabu was sort of wasted in her short role however. The script is great and iconic; so many of the dialogues like \"Kaun Devi Prasad?\" have become famous and remembered. Honestly, the only thing that threw me off was the music; it wasn't too good; only \"Jab Bhi Koi Haseena\" stood out. The direction was also pretty good; this film is what gave Priyadarshan a big name. But besides that, if your'e looking for a great time, this film gives you that for sure.",

The effusive praise by many reviewers on this board calling it the best or funniest movie ever is completely lost on me. At present, I've seen an even dozen pictures from India, and they run the gamut from excellent (2015's \"Drishyam\") to dumb and dumber (\"Andaz, Apna, Apna\"). By further comparison, 2009's \"3 Idiots\" was immensely more satisfying to watch than the three idiots in this picture. To be quite honest, the principal reason I'm drawn to Hindi titles is their placement on IMDb's 'Top 250' film lists, with a personal goal of watching and reviewing all the ones I can. This one, I have to tell you, was a chore to get through. Since we're talking in three's here, this would have made more sense to be called 'The Three Stooges of India', in which case I would have been better prepared for the pratfalls and nonsense going on. By this time I'm well aware that Hindi films often easily exceed two hours, padded by a handful of musical song and dance numbers. That was the case here as well, but my oh my, the second one in this story had to go at least ten minutes. It was so long that one of the principal characters had four or five wardrobe changes! I haven't given up on Indian movies as a result of this picture, but I have to be honest, this one was hard to take.",

There is no attempt to make it too filmy, except for the unnecessary songs in between. But all is forgiven when a film is made so brilliantly. It's a situational comedy, an intelligent one with very few clich\u00e9s.I loved the characters and performances. Paresh Rawal is the best here, with his unmatchable comic timing. He has really got into the skin of an old Maharashtrian man. Akshay is hilarious, and though he has played just too many roles of this kind, this was probably the first. Sunil Shetty is much more decent than he is in other roles. The supporting cast Om Puri (a bag of laughs), Tabu, Mukesh Khanna and all the others are fantastic. I also liked the goodness of the characters and the fact that they did this all out of their helplessness, though being selfish at times. Very real, very human.The climax of the film is the most laughter-provoking and ends the film aptly. This one should be on the list of things you must do before you die, watch Hera Pheri!",

I have seen desi movies grossly overrated or underrated on IMDb and have basically given up relying on IMDb for Bollywood movie reviews all together. If this is the kind of comedy people enjoy and support and reflect the type of movies that are to come out of Bollywood then that explains why we still have the same true and tried formulas coming out over and over 90% of the time.

It did not have much going for it. The starcast was not huge and Priyadarshan was not as big as he is today. That's when the script comes into play \u2013 and that is where Hera Pheri scored and it didn't really need to score anywhere else.Hera Pheri tells the story of 3 common men with a common goal \u2013 to survive in this big bad world. All is fun and games until one night, they get a phone call\u0085..As mentioned above, what makes this film so great is the simplicity. Also, the film does not have the best pot in the world but because we fall in love with the characters and their situations \u2013 we don't even notice the blemish. The best part of the movie is the chemistry between the trio of Akshay, Sunil and Paresh. These guys are the life of the film. You don't get bored of the movie either because there's usually something happening. Scenes to look out for:Akshay and Sunil's first meeting - Whenever Om Puri enters to look for Sunil - Tabu's entry when the trio are having a mildly violent but playful fight. - The crazy and hilarious climax. My favorite scene is when first phone call comes and Paresh picks up \u2013 Rib tickling!!!Flaws? Of course. The songs are a major drawback and come as speed bumps in the narrative. What is worse is that the songs are not even worth listening to. That is the major flaw I saw in the movie. The writing is just splendid and the major credit should go to the dialogue writer Neeraj Vora who has written some remarkable lines. The music is below average. I did love the locales and sets because they were simple but had an amazing feel to it when one sees the film. Priyadarshan has not been known for being technically brilliant but he gets the job done as a director. Even here, he's very good. Not the best but still, his direction is great. Hera Pheri was a turning point for Paresh Rawal. The man who used to play the baddie in the 90's changed his path after Hera Pheri. To say that Paresh is brilliant, to say that Paresh is hilarious, to even say that he's out of this world \u2013 all would be understatements to this man's work in this movie. It's best to just keep quiet and smile when asked about this act.Akshay Kumar is efficient and does his job well. Sunil also is in good form. Om Puri is a delight and Tabu does good. Overall \u2013 A colorful, entertaining and amusing delight is what I would call Hera Pheri. Watch it once, then again and again and again.4.5/5",

Hera Pheri is one of his best films and it is much better than its sequel Phir Hera Pheri which was a bad follow up. The film also made Paresh Rawal famous after doing several villainy acts, one of his first comic acts was praised. Sunil Shetty too deserves an applause for his decent performance, this got him career the boost he needed after his most recent Kala Samrajya got delayed and bombed at the box office. The film is so good it keeps your attention, even the melodramatic scenes are realistic and well formed, the film is flawless and never makes you cringe. It is one of the best Bollywood comedies with no silly comic scenes and actually funny elements which is why it works. The action sequences are hilarious and though the ending is a bit silly, it is so funny that it is forgiven. Compared to what crap Priyan makes nowadays, this film is one of his best. In fact, if Priyan directed the sequel to this, he would have done a good job.

Coming back to the film at hand 'Hera Pheri' is an almost classic and has good repeat value.The jokes work well because they are about everyday issues and are cleverly written. The characters are relatable as ordinary people trying to meet their daily ends. This is also why the first half of the story works beautifully but it is the second half that goes slightly haywire as it treads the formulaic part (the kidnapping plot which has been used in numerous other comedies such as 'Andaz Apna Apna' and 'Waqt Hamara Hai'). That is not to say that it was devoid of entertainment. Quite the contrary as entertainment is plentiful in 'Hera Pheri'.The cast deserves full marks. It is their playing off each other that worked brilliantly. This was during the time when Paresh Rawal was hilarious and his comedic flair was refreshing and amusing (unlike the staleness and repetition that he approaches in current movies). This was also among the few films when Sunil Shetty actually did act. Tabu is excellent in both the comedic and intense scenes. She's a delight to watch as is Asrani who is awesome. But, 'Hera Pheri' is Akshay Kumar's film. The actor displays his flair for comedy to the fullest and it makes one wish had only more directors cast him in such good comedies that would let him shine as an actor. For Kumar, this was the year when his acting (not stardom) peaked as 'Hera Pheri' was preceded by 'Sangharsh', where he breathed fire into his role, and followed by 'Dhadkan', where he does a splendid job.The songs aren't much of note. The first song is downright boring. I liked the song visualized on Tabu, Sunil Shetty and Asrani. It's one of the funniest songs. The item number does not contribute to the film but Namrata Shirodkar sizzles. The rest of the songs fit well with the story even though some of them are too long.'Hera Pheri' has been recognized as one of the best comedies of recent time. Although I don't want to use the word best here, it is a highly enjoyable film that I have already watched a couple of times.",

Now when I have learned a few things about cinema and watched it again, I didn't like it.None of the two characters, Raju or Shyam are likeable initially. Add Anuradha to that list too. There's a lot of melodrama in the first half. All four major characters have had a bad past and we have to sympathize them.In second half, they are given a chance to be rich . And they grab it. But what they are doing is a henious crime. They are as big criminals as Kabira but the plot seems to put them in a good light.Despite it's cult status, I didn't even like the basic idea of the story. In India, it's the biggest meme material. There's possibly a hera pheri meme for every situation. Almost every one on net has watched it atleast a couple of times.As far as comedy is concerned, there are more than a few funny scenes. If you just want a laugh riot ignoring the plot, you can definitely enjoy it.",

Probably just served her purpose of getting a pay-check for her efforts.Om Puri - As usual reliable and spot on.

Anuradha needs Shyam to give up the job demand so that she can take it for herself. Shyam refuses but Raju comes up with a scheme.Bollywood is not my thing. More specifically, the comedy is not translating well and the dancing is not acrobatic enough to be thrilling. It is choreographed song and dance that goes on too long. It's not the fun that it is supposed to be. Aside from that, the characters fail to grab me out of the gate. I find Shyam somewhat whiney and the job situation is perplexing. Is that even a thing in the year 2000? Raju is downright rude. I expected them to be buddies in a buddy comedy from the beginning and these guys hate each other in a non-fun way. I do like that they go into a scam together. It would have been better to steal from the bank and make the manager the fall guy. As for comedy, I only really laughed at the pickup joke early on. The caper is quirky chaos with no big laughs. I don't like climaxing in an empty warehouse. I would prefer a more fun location. All in all, Bollywood comedies and musicals are going to be tough.

Apparently his father died in a fire that broke out in the bank and he claims that the bank owes him the job. He badly needs the money for his friend Khadak Singh's (Om Puri) sister's marriage. A young woman, Anuradha Panniker (Tabu), is also in the running for the job, her father having died two minutes after Shyam's. Shyam meets Raju and a misunderstanding causes Shyam to think that Raju is a pickpocket. A fight ensues between the two, and Raju escapes, leaving his wallet with Shyam. After Raju leaves, Shyam discovers that he had his own wallet on him all the time. Unfortunately, this realisation comes just as Raju returns with two policemen, insisting that Shyam has robbed him.Later that evening, Shyam reaches Star Garage. Baburao agrees to take him in as a paying boarder, although he warns Shyam that he will have to share the place with another boarder and will have to help with the household chores. Unfortunately for Shyam, the other boarder is Raju, who has not paid Baburao a single penny of rent in the last two years. The two men come to blows again the minute they see each other. Raju vociferously objects to Shyam's presence and threatens to move out. Baburao is nonplussed by Raju's indignation and calls his bluff. Eventually, Raju backs down, claiming that he's only staying because he owes Baburao and he hates to leave debts. The two men are constantly at each other's throats, and poor Baburao often ends up suffering the physical consequences of their conflict.Raju manages to trick Shyam into signing a document that says he will give the bank position to Anuradha. When Shyam discovers the fraud, he threatens to sue both the bank and Anuradha. Panicked, the bank manager tries to get Anuradha to seduce Shyam, but he's having none of it. Eventually, she makes a deal to give him the position in exchange for money. Shyam is unable to get the money, and when he goes to bluff his way through the deal, he discovers that Anuradha is living with her mentally ill mother in abject poverty. She admits that she discovered that Shyam's own financial situation was as bad as her own, and that she didn't have the heart to go through with her plan, so she gives him her resignation letter. Shyam refuses, insisting that he could never live with himself if he accepted, and that she should keep the position. The two of them become friends and even begin a romance.Meanwhile, Khadak Singh shows up at the bank looking for Shyam, whom he believes to have stiffed him. The bank manager gives him Baburao's address. Raju is only too glad to put in a \"good word\" for Shyam with Khadak Singh, and it is only thanks to Baburao's intervention that Shyam escapes being throttled by Khadak Sing. Shyam, however gets even with Raju by shaking him down for gas money in front of his mother, threatening to reveal to her that he isn't really earning good money as he claims to be.Baburao is constantly getting called by people who want to speak to a Mr. Deviprasad (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), which annoys him no end. One day, however, things become serious when a kidnapper named Kabeera (Gulshan Grover) asks for Deviprasad. Only, this time, he's asking for a ransom to be paid for Deviprasad's granddaughter Rinku (Ann Alexia Anra of Avvai Shanmughi fame). The trio figures out that the phone numbers for Star Garage and Star Fisheries, of which Deviprasad is the owner, have been mistakenly transposed in the telephone directory.Now, Raju decides to benefit from this situation and has Shyam call Deviprasad posing as Kabira and demanding double the amount asked by Kabeera so that they can pocket the other half themselves while satisfying the ransom demand. However, when the rich man's employee realizes that Deviprasad's granddaughter might have been kidnapped, he involves the police. Angry that the police showed up at the exchange spot, Deviprasad threatens to shoot Inspector Prakash (Mukesh Khanna) with his own revolver, thereby allowing Raju, Shyam and Baburao to escape in the confusion. Kabeera's plans are thwarted, and as punishment for involving the police, he calls the trio again and doubles the ransom.Following their brush with Kabeera and the police, Shyam and Baburao inform Raju that they're out of it, but Raju eventually shames them back into helping him. They tell Deviprasad to meet them at the rendezvous point an hour before Kabeera's appointed time. When they meet with Deviprasad, he demands to see his granddaughter. Eventually, the trio are forced to admit that they are not actually the kidnappers, just three guys in over their heads, but that they will get hisactually Deviprasad's granddaughter pretending to be her kidnapper and saying, \"Kabira speaking\". The film ends with the trio breaking into uncontrollable laughter",

Raju, the intelligent among them is the catchy character.The trio Baburao, Shyam and Raju from different backgrounds live together. The need of money does shakes them but not their morals, except Raju. But he too acknowledges his wrongdoing under emotional stress. Then the closed door of money opens up and everything changes. This part is the gem of the movie, the sheer adventure that grips the viewers attention until climax. Through a series of hilarious events the trio despite hard attempt, loses almost everything. But not their morals. So, they, despite their desperately motivated crooked plans, are rewarded. The statement reminds--\n\"When God gives, it is huge\".The movie is remade from Ramji Rao Speaking, a malayali film directed by the same director Priyadarshan. The subplots towards the climax i.e taking the child from the kidnappers seems a little different from the original. Hera Pheri is well scripted in its entirety though. It's the same director btw. 9/10 is due to a little serene mood left out to be set up in the movie. Some funny parts will seem unappealing in global standards, but it's fine as a whole.

He remakes films of himself, which are also written by him in most turns, and of other film makers... Siddhik and Lal are a famous film making pair in Malayalam film industry.

The manager of the company(Shankaradi) tries to make Balakrishanan to fall in love with the Rani to solve the dispute b/w them. Gopalakrishnan and Balakrishnan were always in making trying to make problems to each other. Gopalakrishnan was mocking in front of his mother(Sukumari)as a millionaire. All the three had so many problems, the only solution is MONEY!!!! Once a phone-call came to Urvashi Theaters from a kidnapper who introduces himself in the phone as \"Ramji Rao Speaking!\".....

You can even saw a classic comedy, with three fabulous actors. It's good to know, they are making a sequel with the famous trio again. Part One had a brilliant Con, Part Two's con is a copy of the great British Gangster movie Lock Stock and two smoking Barrels.",

Most of you who have seen believe that it's because of Indian culture is why you didn't liked it but the reason which made this movie amazing was because of it's humourous dialogues and the manner and the language in which they were spoken,but if you are watching this movie with the help of subtitles you will never in a million years experience the feeling that this movie wants to display.",
