            "content": "I will give this feature length take on the popular old animated television series this: The makers of the movie do deserve an \"A\" for effort. You can really sense the director pumping in the energy and the screenwriter rapidly writing one joke after another. Sometimes all this energy does work for the movie's benefit, being that there are some amusing gags and the cast gives it their all. But all the same, the movie doesn't work in the end. The reason why the movie fails is its inadequate script. While I said there were some jokes that worked, there are also a lot of jokes that feel really lazy and unfunny. But bigger problems can be found with the characters and the narrative. ALL the characters in the movie are really thin, and seem to assume that you'll already be familiar with them. People who have not watched the show may be kind of lost. Just as big of a problem is with the story. The story is quite thin, frequently content to just move from one vignette to another with little to no advancement in the story. This is clearly padding, though at the same time there are some really big leaps in the narrative that suggest that some key plot turns got cut out before being released. Maybe kids who are familiar with the old TV show may get more out of it than I did, though I sense even they will get a feeling that the movie doesn't get anywhere near its full potential.",

            "content": "First of all, it should be noted that the film makers here had respect and affection for the source material, and it shows. Rather than just enticing audiences with known characters and titles, then assaulting you with a worthless script (as happens all too often in TV show \"adaptations\"), this movie pays due homage to the irreverent satire that was the original Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoon, by staying close to its theme.Much of the original schtick is here: the frantic narrator, the inside jokes, the brutal political satire, the cluelessness of \"our heroes,\" and of course, the wonderfully awful puns. The oaf super spies from Potsalvania, Boris and Natasha are here, as is their \"Fearless Leader.\"On top of that, several celebs drop by for some clever cameos, in a \"Muppet Movie\" style way. There are some good one-liners, and everybody seems to be having fun doing the movie.But it just doesn't click. Jokes seem to be presented in an \"in your face\" manner, slapstick routines are overdone, and end up just looking like pale impressions of the original. The story and script seem contrived just to set up situations for the \"comedy.\" The animation of Rocky, and even more so of Bullwinkle, look awkward, almost eerie. I almost felt like asking Moose and Squirrel: \"Wassamatta U?\"Sincere but misguided. Gets lost somewhere between Pottsalvania and Frostbite Falls, and just isn't worth the time to find it again. Rent compilations of the original cartoon series instead.",

The first thing that springs to mind after watching this crap is What was De Niro thinking when he accepted a part in this kids film? This is without a doubt the worst film he has ever been in and it would be extremely difficult to make another film as bad as this. Ok this is a childrens film but is there a child out there who actually likes this? i dont know  but i expect the answer is no. This also stars Pipa Pirabo who for me is a highly over rated actress that is more famous for her stupid grin than her acting. So if you are Man,woman , girl or boy i urge you to something more interesting than watch this , maybe sit in your garden and watch your grass grow or stick pins under your finger nails. I promise it wont be as painfull as watching The Adventures or Rocky and Bullwinkle. 1 out of 10.",

Better than most of the others, but it still doesn't work, even with the decision to keep Rocky and Bullwinkle as toons rather than use, say, people in animal costumes.A full-fledged cartoon version would have been far better. The human actors don't fit in with their cartoon counterparts. Robert DeNiro certainly didn't fit the part of Fearless Leader (they should have given that role to Nicholas Cage, who had a more suitable physique). We could have done without \"Nothing But A Dreamer\" by Supertramp either (the cartoon didn't have music, other than the theme and some \"dramatic effect\" chords at times) This effectively spoiled the old cartoon atmosphere, and the story itself was meandering and ultimately boring and pointless. For the running time, they could have done so much more.Intended for fans of the old cartoon, but probably won't satisfy most of them.",

Rocky, Bullwinkle and the narrator are kind of fun, but unfortunately there is always a flesh and blood human being around and each one of them is absolutely horrible. The absurd dialogue spoken by Jay Ward's characters just does not work when spoken by an actual human being, in which case it just comes off as stupid. Maybe instead of matching up Rocky and Bullwinkle with human beings, they should be pulled out of reruns and be given new animated shorts to appear in. In fact I would welcome a general return of animated shorts to run before feature presentations. I don't know why it doesn't happen anymore.",

Most of the lines are by an unknown name: actress Piper Perabo (\"FBI Agent Karen Sympathy)\" and the two cartoon characters.This is another one of these live-action cartoons in which some characters are real-life and others are cartoons and the all interact on screen at once. This comedy has a lot more subtle than laugh-out-loud lines. It's decent, and does have a certain appeal but is not as good as I expected after reading a couple of reviews prior to its release.

I enjoyed \"Airplane!\" and am hardly one of those film school arty types who can't take a joke. If Rocky & Bullwinkle had been campy, dumb, but fun, I think I would have enjoyed it.Unfortunately, the only good thing I can say is that I was hoping to hear a lot of bad puns, and I did. But there the similarity ended.Taking Rocky & Bullwinkle out of its cartoon format into a 3D realm didn't work for me. The plot stuttered and didn't make any sense. Even starting from the attitude that this is a cartoon, so things will be wacky and nonsensical, it still didn't make any sense.Worst of all were the syrupy and melodramatic interactions with Karen Sympathy, the FBI agent. The emotions and decisions of the characters didn't make sense.Finally, there's something about comedy that involves timing. I don't know what it is. But the build-ups and physical pranks didn't work for me. Something was really askew in the presentation.Who should see this film:-- nobody, even kids, and especially if you've seen the original series, it will just make you sadI'm forced to give The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle a 3 out of 10.",

            "content": "My Take: Yet another lame attempt to put animation into flesh-and-blood reality.\"This is not a cartoon, this is the real world!\", claims rookie FBI agent Karen Sympathy, played by Piper Perabo, and I wish I can say the same thing about THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULWINKLE. It has a big budget, which it spends on fancy cartoonish sets and other bizarre gimmicks, for what? To make it look like a cartoon! This results into a lot of things that we could prefer seeing in a Saturday morning cartoon. But as a movie, it's pretty hard to see why this was such a favorite cartoon during the early '60's. This is one of the most ineffective and unfunny movies I've seen in a while. And if your not convinced, lets move to to the casting. Lets see, Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader and Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as his bumbling minions. Okay, now your convinced.The film uses the technique of putting animated characters in real-live settings and real actors. This was done many times since films in the 80's like WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and, recently SPACE JAM. And like SPACE JAM, although not quite as bad, ROCKY AND BULWINKLE enjoys too much with the playfulness of its cartoon characters that they forget that they're making a feature film here. So, it has not much to tell and can't even afford to make jokes that really work.The film is basically a cartoon on a live action movie (which is made just as cartoonish as the animated world). Animated evil mastermind Fearless Leader (De Niro) and his henchmen have crossed the boundaries of an animated world and arrive in our 4-dimensional world and start a TV company called RBTV, meaning \"Really Bad Television\" (how prophetic), and turn people to mindless drones with their horrible cable shows. The FBI sends a rookie agent (Perabo) to protect still-animated Rocky and Bulwinkle from being zapped, allowing the megalomaniac from ruling the world.And as the story goes, the laughs and silliness get even worse. The film hardly made me laugh, and no head-hitting, car-crashing and any other mishap to change my mind about that. They should know they're making a motion picture here, not a an episode of Bugs and Daffy (which, at least, is better than this). Despite its budget, director Des McAnuff instead spends it on silly cartoonish gimmicks that, joined in with the corny laughs (if you'd call it laughs) and embarrassed leads, it can all be summed up in a 30 minute animated feature for TV, not an 88 minute film.Still, I did find one thing that was quite bearable in this walking disaster waiting to happen, and that is the entertaining cameos. How many movies can you see well-known (and then well-known) talents like Whoppi Goldberg, John Goodman, Kenan (Thompson) and Kel (Mitchell) and Billy Crystal just to name a few. Their cameos thankfully lightens up my high criticism for the film, but that doesn't stop me from giving it a big thumbs down.Still, I won't discourage you from letting the kids see it, for it's mainly made for them and they might be the only ones who'll enjoy it.Rating: * out of 5.",

As sad it is to say, it seems any attempt to resurrect him has been futile. I wonder why?As to what I can say about this movie, Rocky was sort of making a comeback in the 1990s, and this movie was suppose to boost his return. Instead, it pretty much buried him.Although I play a Rocky video game once in a while, I can't say that I'm a fan of that flying squirrel. However, I do thought restoring his popularity a bit. As to what suggestion I would give to whoever owns that moose and squirrel, perhaps it's to pick a kid actor to be that buck-toothed flyer. Maybe that'll help.",

            "content": "What is it about cartoons failing financially at the movies? What is missing in the transition from the TV to the big screen? Is it the lack of substance? Or could it be that a cartoon's charm is only limited to a twenty-minute time slot? I'm not quite sure myself but it is disappointing that most adaptations to the big screen end being a flop. Thankfully there are some that try really hard to stick to the old and not involve the characters in a non-cartoony plot.A movie that can mirror this kind of description would be The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Sure this movie has not gained a whole lot of appreciation but for the fans who truly respect the original series, you can see why this movie is one of those live action cartoon movies that stands out from the others. How come? Because the film uses its goofiness from its original episodes and uses it throughout the film. This movie is similar to The Muppets (2011) movie plot. Over a certain length of time, Rocky and Bullwinkle have been forgotten in the past until they are needed again 35 years later. So has anything really changed character-wise in this movie, absolutely not. Rocky, Bullwinkle, Fearless Leader, Boris, Natasha and even the narrator are all in this movie. Even the screenplay between all live action characters are like the original. After a misunderstood conversation between Rocky and Bullwinkle, the narrator states, \"Yes even their word play had become hackneyed and cheap\" and then Bullwinkle replies to the narrator, \"No, it was always like this\". Oh how right you are Bullwinkle!Aside from the main cartoon characters, Piper Perabo who plays Agent Karen Sympathy is given the assignment to get the daring duo out of the cartoon world and into the real world. The mission: to stop the nefarious Fearless Leader played by Robert De Niro. De Niro is actually a wise choice for the role of Fearless Leader. I truly can't imagine another actor playing that part. Fearless Leader is a difficult cartoon character to mimic verbally and physically so I give De Niro credit for that. Jason Alexander and Rene Russo team up as the Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. They too both mimic their cartoon characters fairly well.So what is there about this movie that makes it a good cartoon adaptation? Well besides the main cast, there are many famous actors that make cameo appearances. A couple that come to mind are John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Don Novello. Some play multiple characters while others play only one. Either way, this movie has a lot of star power.The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle may look like another worthless cartoon adaptation but it sticks to its roots and gives all that it has. Thanks to a good cast of actors, not only are the cartoon characters supported but it also makes its cheery screenplay work well too.",

I believe my nephews and niece would have enjoyed this film much more than I did.The basic plot was thin and basic (as expected in a film like this) but the jokes did nothing to let you forget this.  At the very least the storyline should have been created around well thought-out moments of humour.  It wasn't.  Robert De Niro was the best part of it but not even he - or the many cameos - could save what was primarily a bad film.

Here, he acquires a German accent and all, and it really doesn't suit him at all. There was a attempt to liven it up, but here DeNiro seemed ashamed of himself, and it showed in his delivery, though I did like the \"Are You Talking To Me?\" bit. Also the plot, it was a nice idea, but the pace was uneven, sometimes it dragged, and other times when it felt rushed. It is pretty much the same with the script, which could have been so much better, had it been more focused, as far too many times it went off target, particularly with the syrupy \"romance\" between Karen and the prison security guy. I felt also there could have been a little more of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and less of Boris and Natasha, though I liked the enthusiasm that Jason Alexander and Rene Russo put into the roles. There are comments saying that these two were chosen because they looked the part and that's it. I personally don't think that's true, because some of the funniest bits were with these two, especially the part when the computer falls on Boris's head. Piper Perabo was good also as Karen Sympathy(most of the jokes are in the characters' names), though she has been better. I really liked the girl in the eye, that is contradictory of her adult counterpart, which causes Rocky to say \"There's something in your eye\". There are some very good visual jokes, though lots of them are retreads of other films, and have been done better. I really liked Rocky and Bullwinkle- Bullinkle was funnier, when he says \"...forgot the line,\" and I liked the aeroplane scene. The joy were the cameos by the likes of John Goodman and Whoopi Goldberg. In conclusion, a good film, but could have been much better, with better casting and more inspiration. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was set up as a low-budget parody of television and film animation. It was rife with in-jokes, sardonic comments on the media, bad puns, occasional feints at adult humor. It was not your average kids show. It wore its poverty-row production on its sleeve. It mocked all our expectations, and a good many of our cultural shibboleths - contemporary academia and small-town middle-America both felt its sting. Having avoided this film for a decade (presuming that Hollywood would bollix it up the way they had with the Warner Bros. cartoon characters and Casper the ghost), I at last found a cheap copy and said what the heck. Well, I was very much - and very pleasantly - surprised. The film is quite true to the original program. I love it when Whoopi Goldberg is referred to as \"the honorable Judge Cameo\". I love the sun bouncing up and down at sunrise and sunset. I am glad they dealt with Rocky's 'fear of flying' again (and getting over it) without any sentimentality. The in-jokes and sarcastic cultural references and media lampoons are all intact - those who complain about the animation and special effects miss the several remarks on the poor animation from the characters themselves - the animation and SFx are supposed to be borderline, that's part of the joke! So too the over-the-top characterizations and acting. (The real illusion of cinema's 'art of illusion' is that generated by an audience expecting the illusions to 'look real' - it is this illusion - the audience's - that the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, and now the movie, mock.) The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was kinda like Jazz - you either got it or you didn't. The low rating on this film only indicates that this is true for the movie as well. The original show largely survived because of its low cost, and through syndication allowing it to be re-edited for marginal time slots, e.g., 5 am. It was only years after it ceased production that it's real strengths began endearing it to millions. In like manner, I suspect this film is on its own quiet, gradual way to becoming a cult classic. Parents will play it for their kids who will wonder \"WTF?!\" - then, ten years later the light-bulb will click on for those same kids, and they will 'get it' - and another generation of Rocky and Bullwinkle fans will come of age.",

Admittedly, I didn't think much of it when it was first released. When I finally saw it, I found myself surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This is a goofy and likable comedy. It is wonderful entertainment.I think the decision to keep Rocky and Bullwinkle as cartoons was perfect, because it would be hard to make a convincing live action talking moose and squirrel. Also, the casting helped. Robert DeNiro is the perfect Fearless Leader and part of the fun is seeing this brilliant actor lampoon himself. Jason Alexander is serviceable as Boris, although Danny DeVito would have been a better choice and Rene Russo is well cast as Natasha. But the standout is Piper Perabo, making her debut in this film. Unfortunately for her, \"Coyote Ugly\" was her followup, but seeing her in that film was like finding a diamond in a box of Cracker Jacks, to paraphrase my favorite critic Roger Ebert. She is a real talent to watch for.The script by Kenneth Lonegran, is full of injokes and pot shots at modern society and is in the style of the cartoon show. That is a beneift because taking this stuff seriously would badly damage this lightweight comedy.\nSee Rocky and Bullwinkle with a light heart and the brain in neutral and you will enjoy this film.***1/2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "I really, really REALLY wanted this movie to be great. I loved the show as a kid, and still can recite many lines from various characters and skits. I also am fond of the human cast here, and I admire them.Alas, I was a bit disappointed with \"Rocky & Bullwinkle.\" It wasn't bad-- in fact at almost any given moment in the movie I would be hard pressed to actually identify a flaw. Looked at in tiny little portions, it was virtually \"right on\" and almost perfect as a rendition. But pasted together-- it was slow. It never quite took flight. True, the original series was a brain thing, and not a \"visual fest,\" nor a high energy, MTV-like barrage (which didn't exist back in 1960-64 anyway). The original show celebrated its bad animation as an art form, made self-observational criticism, and much of the humor was cerebral, including puns so bad they were extra funny-- So the new movie's many attempts to \"droll up\" were noticed and appreciated. Much of that spirit was at least sought, if not actually conveyed. Thus the movie comes across as earnest and good natured. But overall, I must say the total vibe of the original show-- the engrossing entertainment of it-- was missed. Just barely, but to be truthful, missed.\"Rocky & Bullwinkle\" as a movie is still watchable-- just be prepared to not really laugh. Maybe a snort now and again-- but neither myself nor any of the few audience members I sat with laughed much. And that's not enough to make it a good comedy. It seemed kind of tired, or too slow, maybe even depressed at times.Also, note that this movie is WAY better than the \"Inspector Gadget\" movie last year, and \"Dudley Do-Right,\" even though both of those recent renditions of old cartoon shows into movies also had great cast members (and \"Dudley Do-Right,\" of course was actually a part of the original \"Bullwinkle\" TV series way back when).  I gave this movie a reluctant and disappointed 7 out of 10.",

All he can resort to is mugging up for the camera and making fun of his old movies again -- here we get \"You talking' to me?\" which was funny the first time he did it. It's become his calling card now -- it's like the first thing he says when he walks on camera is \"You talking' to me?\" and the director expects everyone to laugh because, hey, it's Robert De Niro, and that's FUNNY.Rene Russo is wasted too although then again I don't think she was put in the film for her acting skills - they just got her because she looked like the character. Ditto for Jason Whatshisname (from \"Seinfeld\"), who tries too hard -- I guess he was pretty desperate after the show ended.Overall this is a disappointment because it begins so promising and turns into a dud.",

That's exactly what made the original cartoon so great.R&B's observations on contemporary society are hilarious. The film also pokes fun at politicians, the legal system, and our addiction to TV, with a riotous sendup of \"Cops\".The film is quite satisfying whenever R&B are onscreen. When it's just the human actors, things get a little dull. DeNiro, Alexander and Russo all are decent, but these performances would be criticized no matter who was playing them, with the possible exception of Jim Carrey. The best human performer is Piper Pirabo, a total hottie. She has been criticized for a bad performance, but I thought she did a great job.It's not Oscar material, it won't gross $100 million, and it's not deep social commentary, but it sure is fun.

If you found some charm in the original cartoons, good for you; apart from the fact that some people found them charming there's not a lot to be said for them.  It was too self-conscious and self-absorbed to have any real bite.  If it HAD been sending up the cold war, as some critics claimed at the time, its brisk slickness and the cleverness of its scripts (seemingly concentrated into a few minutes, in reality spread thinly over an entire season) might have made it funny; but in fact it was parodying works of fiction of ephemeral appeal that were themselves only loosely related to the cold war, and there is no lesser form of wit than that (certainly not puns; the puns raised the tone considerably).This is the PERFECT \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" movie.  We see an actor delivering Robert DeNiro's \"Are you talking to me?\" monologue word for word, but in a different context and an absurd Slavic accent - and the actor in question is Robert DeNiro himself.  That's the kind of contorted in-joke which was always nestled between the puns in \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", and it's absurd to complain that the series has somehow been betrayed.  As always, it's sometimes clever and fitfully funny - and, since I happened to see the movie immediately after \"Shrek\", this came as a breath of fresh air.I'm also bound to admit that the mix of hand-drawn animation, computer rendering and live action is pretty amazing - just as well done, in its way, as in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\".  Squirrel and moose have all the expressive fluidity of good hand-drawn animation but they're rounded and rubbery and they look as though they're really interacting with our world.",

In fact I never knew until I read about cartoons with similar styles, and some of the actors of the Rocky and Bullwinkle show.Many years after the characters made a name of themselves in a 1960s TV series, some people who probably liked the show a lot decided to give Rocky and Bullwinkle an encore through this film. Had the film been commercially successful, the franchise would have been revived to a great degree. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case as the movie bombed at the box office.Because I'm hardly a fan of the 1960s show, what become of the feature film almost doesn't mean anything to me. But if I were fan, I'd probably beg the filmmakers to make another film. And to make the film more appealing to moviegoers, my advise to the filmmakers would be that they should use a young boy to perform the role of Rocky.",

I have never seen the 60's cartoon, but found this movie at a good deal ($5) and picked it up. I popped it in the old DVD player one Sunday afternoon and felt a little guilty and embarrassed. Why? Because this movie was so beyond kiddie. I'm watching a movie with a squirrel and a bull! And loving it.Very over the top performances..but works very well in this format. I happened to watch Robocop 3 last night, and yes that was very over the top and became cheese! This film does it and succeeds. Robert Deniro does a wonderful job as he did in Dick Tracy. Sure, its no Casino or Heat! but he apparently understands the material and plays the role to fit the film. That's a good actor. No B-movie here. Shame this film is so trashed! Pure entertainment.",

I subsequently realized that she was more than just a pretty face, she is a real talent that will go far in Hollywood if she puts forth the effort.Another aspect of the film that impressed me were the puns and play-ons the writer came up with since it were that made the film that much more enjoyable to watch as they were able to poke fun at others and yet still be funny enough where it didn't become silly.\"The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle\" far succeeded my expectations of being one of the best made from a television show.

As most kids films take themselves really serious, and they are just plain lame - The Mummy springs to mind, good guys get chased by bad guys but the good guys just escape in time... yeah yeah yeah... boring. back to the film, it really doesn't take itself serious, and if you watch it in the frame of mind of watching a normal cartoon, it sticks to that formula really well, even using real characters - using the best actors in the industry certainly helped, to make it not be cheesy. The film is also littered with references to other films. The moose is nearly the same as Homer Simpson, so if you like him, you'll love the stupidity of the moose. I never watch stuff like this but was mightily impressed that it was spot on in what it was trying to be.

DeNiro turns in a surprisingly good turn as Fearless Leader, Renee Russo is on-target as Natasha, Jason Alexander is a credible Boris Badenov, and the newly invented \"Karen Sympathy\" and \"Minnie Mogul\" are not troublesome.  The heavy use of sardonic asides is particularly faithful to the TV show, but perhaps are not a universally-enjoyed device.

            "content": "Movies that aren't serious can be really fun, this one however is an exception from that statement. I know it's supposed to be silly, to be wacky and hilarious but it just doesn't do it for me. The green/blue screen effects are extremely bad and throughout the movie I never felt that the animated characters were \"real\". The puns in this movie was over-used as well along with the bad script and I think that's what destroyed it the most for me. Now don't get me wrong: an unserious storyline can still make the watcher believe it by using the right tools. But a script that bad made the storyline completely unbelievable and breaking the fourth wall is something you should not over-use even if you want the comedic effect to become stronger. Why is that? Because breaking the fourth wall is a great way to make the audience get shocked since the actors are breaking a rule there, which catches their attention immediately. If you over-use this, however, the effect gets worn off to the point where it just gets annoying.In some shots there's some filming-errors as well such as too much headroom, unnecessary space where it's not needed since it doesn't provide any information, lack of contrast balance between the green/blue screen shots and the objects/people and etc. Perhaps something you don't think about too much, but can be extremely annoying if it constantly occurs. This is also the reason why it looks like a really really bad B- movie from the 80's personally. The acting overall was pretty okay, even though there were in some places in the movie where it was noticeable that the actors didn't really did their roles seriously which made it harder to believe the story.All in all, a bad movie.",

However time moves on and I beleive the new producers of this film tried to do the best they could  with this film given the change in time and the advent of new technologies.I think the real critics of this film worth noting should be todays grandpas and grandmas who 35 years ago sat down next to their kids for the odd original rocky and bullwinkle show. They probably can make the best judgement as they are not compromised by a natural bias of of living in the 1960s and watching Rocky and Bullwinkle as a kid and hence getting so sentimental.Its a shame that this new version did not do better at the box office.

So I have seen the show.  I think that the movie does a good job in being faithful to itself and its \"brand\" of humor.  Unfortunately, not everyone sees it that way.The movie is supposed to be irreverent!  It's supposed to make fun of everything!  Generals Store, Foods, and Admission are exactly the gags the original had in mind.  If it (as some say) lost the \"road trip\" part of the movie, there wouldn't be much to have fun with now, would there?  It's not exactly biting social commentary, but the idea of television turning people to zombies, well, it's not a new concept, but R&B takes it to a different level.  The only part that I thought was a bit of a stretch was how Bullwinkle got to New York, but it was still funny.I especially enjoyed the self-referential bit in the courtroom, which I think does its part in quelling (some of) the critics.  It's the rules of pulling cartoon characters into real life, only in this case, the movie makes its own rules.It may not be the best movie ever, and it may make De Niro a mockery of himself, but 4.4?  Come on, people.  It's not THAT low.  Maybe those who liked it in their comments didn't vote, I don't know.

They love the \"evil villaaaiins\" and understand the simple plot. The jokes are just their style. And isn't that what innocence is all about? Bullwinkle is totally naive and the kids understand that too. He bumbles around (much as they feel they do) in an adult world and just gets by somehow... The people who tend to write comments on these boards only see movies from their own perspective. That's fine.

It's not exactly a good plot, but the movie needed a premise. Moose and Squirrel look great as CGI characters. Rocky is so lovable and Bullwinkle is so... uh...Anyway, I will admit that DeNiro's performance was a *bit* over the top and Borris and Natasha's accents were a *bit* fake, but you could tell that the actors were having fun.

The thing is the movie KNOWS the jokes are bad and acknowledges it constantly--and it's always funny!  The jokes are nonstop and were so knowingly dumb that I couldn't stop laughing...you're laughing WITH the movie not AT it!  The only real drawback was making Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader humans.  Jason Alexander, Rene Russo and Robert DeNiro are good actors...but not here.  They LOOK the parts but they're portraying two-demensional characters (in every respect) and have NOTHING to work with.  Other than that this is a very funny, very silly movie...SEE IT!",

I'm not normally a fan of \"in-jokes\" or movies that wink at the audience, but this one really had me in hysterics in its first 20 minutes.I was never much of a fan of the cartoon (not when I could get Transformers or G.I. Joe on the other channel), overall I'm not a big fan of animated movies and I wasn't overly thrilled with Roger Rabbit, so I wasn't excited about this one, but I decided to give it a whirl based on some good reviews I heard. Glad I wasn't disappointed.Good performance by all. Perabo as Agent Karen Sympathy is cute as a button. She looks scenes between her and her \"inner child\" are a riot. Alexander is funny, Russo looks incredible (as always) and De Niro does comedy with ease. Is there anything he can't do? I couldn't believe that they convinced him to do an impersonation of what is probably his most famous passage of dialogue ever, the \"You talkin' to me?\" scene in Taxi Driver. This is one of the most imitated scenes in film, but then I found out the movie is from De Niro's own producton company, Tribeca, so I guess he decided to give it that extra something.This movie does not disappoint. The laughs in the second half aren't quite as fast and furious as in the first, but it is still far smarter a film than anyone would expect. Way to go, guys! 9/10 stars! G'night!",

It's as though someone took the Rocky and Bullwinkle lines from a reasonably good R&B serial, and then wrapped an amateurish script around it. The Rocky and Bullwinkle parts really are pretty good (June Foray still has it, for sure), but the live action / cartoon integration is very poor, and only Randy Quaid and John Goodman (in a bit part as a Highway Patrolman -- \"You're an FBI agent? Right -- and I'm John Goodman....\") seem up to the challenge of playing to badly-blocked spaces where actors ought to be. Russo and Alexander are wasted on this script. And Piper Perabo comes off as miserably inept. I found myself feeling sorry for the Moose and Squirrel for having to put up with all this nonsense.In many ways it seems as though the cartoon and the live-action movie are -- well, different movies, written by different people. Almost all the cartoon stuff is funny (if you do see it, look for cameos by a character from Roger Rabbit); almost all the live-action stuff falls miserably flat. If you do see this, I suggest getting friends together and making a party of it. Just don't expect too much, and you'll probably be OK.",

And what a kick in the crotch it must have been to them both when this screenplay was dreamed up in their Honor. Rocky has forgotten how to fly, just as the screenwriter forgot how to write a decent screenplay. Bullwinkle is busy writing letters to the President, but those letter most likely do not involve resigning. The evil Fearless Leader plans to take over the earth using Real Bad T.V. Perhaps he should give everyone free tickets to this travesty then since it is clear that no one will pay to see it. Director Des McAnuff remains faithful to the cartoon despite evidence to a limited budget. Fearless Leader is a lifeless villain despite Robert De Niro's amusing performance. Jason Alexander and Rene Russo as henchmen Boris and Natasha are likely hoping that this film doesn't resurface during any career tribute since it isn't their best moment. Piper Perabo plays the young heroine who has the mentality of someone of age five. Randy Quaid plays an idiot named Cappy von Trapment. Why not rename him Crappy von Trapment? It couldn't be any worse than any other stupid idea in this junk. This film should learn to fly...off a building. Score: 1 / 10",

This is totally different!\"Someone else noted the similarity between \"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\" and \"Last Action Hero\" in that both involve people escaping from a form of film (cinema, TV) into the real world; I'd extend that to take in the short-lived TV show \"Once A Hero,\" about a comic book character who finds out that people are losing faith in him and goes to the real world to set it right. There's one crucial difference, however - the latter two didn't really work, and ultimately neither does this movie... but it comes a lot closer than the other two, and certainly closer than any other of Universal's lamentable attempts to bring TV shows to the big screen.Kenneth Lonergan's script has promise, but he and director Des McAnuff never really realise it; it's frequently quite funny, and more than a little strange (the sight of Robert DeNiro as Fearless Leader dancing after the successful RBTV (Really Bad Television) experiment has to be seen to be believed) - it's best not to think over it, but to just go with the flow, watch for the in-jokes and place names (Crymia River? \"J\" Ward?), and enjoy the legendary June Foray and Keith \"son of the late Bill\" Scott's vocals (Scott is also the narrator, in for the late William Conrad).\nThough not really as memorable as the show itself and suffering from some attempts at sentimentality that don't work (and are at odds with the whole ethos anyway; compare the vomitous sub-Disney end credit ballad to Mark Mothersbaugh's energetic variations on the Steiner theme and tell me which one works better) the endless puns abound, and DeNiro and Russo are great fun as Natasha and Fearless Leader. (Because the cartoon is mostly unknown in Britain - unlike Scooby-Doo, alas - a lot more notice was given over here to the great man \"dumbing down\" somewhat.) Jason Alexander isn't quite so effective as Boris, though; and Pink Power Ranger-lookalike* Piper Perabo must be the least likely FBI agent in screen history. Then again, perhaps that was the intention. And Coyote Ugly she is NOT.\"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\" could have done with less cameos (\"But I'm the real Karen Sympathy!\" pleads our heroine. \"Yeah, and I'm John Goodman,\" says a traffic cop played by John Goodman), the effects aren't all they could be, and it's hard not to think that Pinky and the Brain could have done a better job in a third of the time; but while it's never as enjoyable as \"George of the Jungle\" it's infinitely better than \"Dudley Do-Right.\" And \"The Flintstones.\" And \"The Flintstones In Viva Rock Vegas.\" And so on.

            "content": "Released in 2000 and directed by Des McAnuff, \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle\" is a live action cartoon based on the early 60's animated show. Rocky and Bullwinkle are CGI (voiced by June Foray and Keith Scott) while Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader are played by actors (Jason Alexander, Rene Russo and Robert De Niro respectively). Piper Perabo stars as a klutzy, sympathetic FBI agent who's assigned to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world and bring them across the country in order to stop the diabolic scheme of Fearless leader to hypnotize the American populace through RBTV (Really Bad TV), compelling them to elect him as president. Numerous actors are featured in peripheral roles or cameos, like Randy Quaid, James Rebhorn, Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman, Jonathan Winters, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, amongst others.To enjoy a movie like this you have to be willing to enter into its goofy world and roll with it. If you can do that, it has its amusing moments and is noticeably better than \"Dudley Do-Right\" (1999), but it's nowhere close the quality of the \"The Flintstones\" (1994) or its almost-as-good sequel, \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,\" which was released two months before \"Rocky and Bullwinkle.\" The original Rocky and Bullwinkle TV show was never as popular as The Flintstones show and this might've contributed to the movie flopping at the box office, but its main problem is that it's overall mediocre despite its undeniable fun energy.This was Perabo's second feature film and her first in a major role. She's the main protagonist and pretty much carries the movie, which is surprising in light of her lack of experience up to this point. Later the same year she starred in the semi-iconic, but shallow, \"Coyote Ugly.\"The satirization of the lamestream media's power to dupe people into supporting a dubious candidate (or vilify another) is well done and reflects reality. How else could someone like HeyLIARy Rotten Clinton get so many votes? (Disregarding the millions of fraudulent \"votes,\" of course). The film runs 92 minutes and was shot mostly in California, but also Washington DC and New York.GRADE: C+",

Something attracted established film and television stars like Robert DeNiro, Randy Quaid, Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Rene Russo, Jason Alexander and many others to the project, and it wasn't just money.It's bristling with hundreds of in-jokes, and self-referential comedy. In fact the first twenty minutes concerns itself with getting a studio green light for the film you're watching. The bad punning is acknowledged constantly by the characters. Moose and Squirrel have entire conversations about the terrible quality of the jokes. Having said that, most of the jokes Rocky derides are indeed funny, and the ones that aren't make you smile because they're so (intentionally) bad.The CGI is flawless, (save for one brief moment when the flying Rocky carries Agent Sympathy, and even then it's not bad). The interaction between the actors and the animated characters is similarly impressive.The voice actor playing Rocky does an especially fine job, infusing this CG squirrel with far more depth and emotion than reasonable audiences have a right to expect.DeNiro clearly enjoys himself, hamming it up magnificently as the tyrannical villain. He's both a fool and frightening - a difficult thing for a writer and actor to accomplish.Piper Perabo delivers a lovely, charming performance that while not technically great is perfectly fitting for the tone of the movie.It also has a final message that the film's many detractors should have paid more attention to - don't be so eager to grow up. Take a moment to see things from a child's perspective. Enjoy yourself. Have fun. The message is delivered in a heavy-handed way, but that fact is acknowledged in the film. Everything about the film is over the top, so it makes sense that the sentimental aspects should be likewise. Like Perabo's performance, a flaw becomes an asset.Even the two songs that play over the end credits are good. First, a funky child-friendly rap about \"being yourself\", then a nicely-delivered ballad about seeing the world from a child's perspective that reiterates the film's central theme.Evidently this film is not for everyone - too many people hate it for me to feel comfortable recommending it unreservedly, but whether or not you saw the TV show, if you're capable of enjoying silly comedy you can do much worse.",

            "content": "Having seen most of Robert De Niro's films and believed he could do no wrong, I finally stumbled upon his one hammy performance. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle sounded so good on paper that I thought there is no way this could be a total dud. There are some funny moments but it's usually a bad pun from the cartoon character Bullwinkle, who is unknown to me. The best one was when the FBI-agent KS asks: Can you rapell? and the answer: Sure, I been repelling people for years. Well, back to De Niro. I think he made a mistake playing Fearless Leader. He seems ill at ease most of the time and when he finally parodies his most famous line: \"You talking' to me\" it almost makes you wanna duck for cover. Sure, he is entitled to do so but with a German accent? He sounds like Dr. Nick Riviera (not German but still annoying). The constant smirk he has on his face is also disturbing.As for Rene Russo and Jason Alexander, they actually do a pretty good job. They are silly in just the right way and also a little touching in the scene where they consider giving up evil. Randy Quaid gets worse and worse in every film he's in (who would have thought that he once played Lyndon B. Johnson in the 80's). When he hikes up his pants at the end of the movie and says: \"Good job.\" ... well, the less said about that the better. Finally, we get to Piper Perabo, who is completely unknown to me. She was in Coyote Ugly but I haven't seen that one. She could be Julia Roberts long lost sister. Same look, same smile, just with blonde hair. Like Roberts you can't really judge her before you have seen her in something more challenging than this.The cameos through the whole movie is mostly decorative, although i liked John Goodman's as a highway patrolman in a parody of Cops. Whoopi Goldberg as a judge named Cameo going nuts over Rocky and Bullwinkle is just plain stupid and finally Jonathan Winters in three different cameos is rather dull. So to sum up, the movie could have been great but silly puns and famous people does not a good movie make.",

            "content": "Thirty-five years after being canceled as popular cartoon characters, Bullwinkle J Moose and Rocky Squirrel leave Frostbite Falls, MN to talk to the President of the United States about all the trees having been cut down. Along the way, they run into FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), who enlists them in attempting to stop an evil plot masterminded by Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) and in the process of being enacted by those Cold War fiends, Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo).All right, where do we start? I know! How about the cover of the film that features the bad guys and not our heroes? Although the dry humor involved in the 1960's was achieved here, sometimes I feel like the real people who like the moose (the kids) won't get the jokes. Yeah, Rocky doesn't want to fly anymore, Bullwinkle's just as stupid as he was thirty-five years ago, but I was barely out of diapers when this show used to come on every Sunday morning, and, although I never got the jokes, I understood Boris and Natasha and that they always lost, but here they win the cover of the DVD.The big change between this film and the cartoon series is just that: this film gets all of the prime characters out of cartoon land and into the real world, where politics still reigns supreme, and the bad guys in politics only care about supremacy. They were my heroes back in grade school, but they're only an hour and a half getaway from MY real world. It's light, it has funny moments, and it can be a good escape for anyone who wants to get away from it all for a bit, but that's as far as I'd let it go.3 out of 10 stars.",

I grew up without the delights of Rocky & Bullwinkle as a kid and, thanks to this film, I will NEVER seek out any episodes of that cartoon, EVER! But I was able to view the film without any preconceptions.To say this movie is a waste of time is beyond understatement. It has no saving values whatsoever. When will the film companies get it....you can't make a successful live action/cartoon mix movie.R&B is just crap, plain and simple. There is only one interesting point, which I'm sure is pure coincidence. The plot of the film (and I use the word \"plot\" only because I can't think of one that adequately describes how badly written the story is) centres around Fearless Leader's attempts to brainwash American society. Given the fact that a lot of well-known actors and celebrities gave up precious moments of their lives to take part in this turkey lead me to believe that some real brainwashing has gone on here.Anyhow, its a crock. Bad acting, bad dialogue (even when its intentionally bad, its just plain bad!), the most awful puns assaulting you every second of the film (again, they're supposed to be bad, but in actuality they are just plain teeth-gratingly awful). And stupidity and dumbness at every turn.It's difficult to see who this movie was aimed at. Even little kids will find the humour puerile and for adults, its just an awful assault on the senses. The humour, if I had to give it a rating, is about on the same level as Christmas Cracker jokes. In other words, vaguely amusing for a few moments, but you wouldn't want to be subjected to an hour and a half of it. That amounts to torture. The Convention on Human Rights ought to cover things like this and make them illegal.To sum it up then, this movie is $hite and not worth watching under any circumstances. I'd rather watch Jungle Book 2 again than this monstrosity. Avoid!",

It is full of the sly comedy and sarcastic references. I would have liked all the characters from the cartoon to remain in their 2 dimensional animated look. It's probably a mistake to have real actors play the cartoon villains. No matter how hard the three actors try, they can never get the cartoon feeling into their characters. They feel flat and rather tiresome. Piper Perabo is adorable and works well with Rocky and Bullwinkle. However she gets separated from them and the chemistry dissipates.

Jay Ward's classic cult cartoon comedy team of Moose & Squirrel are back and this time they're larger than life on the big screen in  this rather flat-footed attempt at a resurrection for two of the most beloved animated characters of all time. This time screenwriter Kenneth Lonegran employs the standard trademarks of the series (breaking down the fourth wall directly talking asides to the audience, ironic dispositions, silly puns and on-the-sly knowing winks at their familiarity) but does so in a largely mirthless endeavor.   The plot, such as it is, has our heroes Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voiced by Foray who has been Rocky since the get go and Scott doing the honors for the moose and replacing the late, great William Conrad as the smart-aleck narrator) enter the virtual reality from 'toon land when a development girl in Hollywood inadvertently enlivens their notorious arch nemesi Boris Badenov and Natasha and their evil despot Fearless Leader (played with gusto by long-time fans Alexander, Russo and De Niro, who also co-produced) who find themselves longing to rule the world by incorporating the masses to be hypnotized by Really Bad TV.   This leads to involvement by the FBI to seek help from our heroes with their emissary being the young, impressionable and darn right plucky Agent Karen Sympathy (sexy newcomer Perabo) to get the denizens of Frostbite Falls to New York as they race the clock and overcome the pitfalls set up by the dastardly Mutt & Jeff team of Boris & Natasha.The premise is weak with the fact that the Cold War is over and is about as timely as the villain trio's out-of-it attempts to plot in overruling the free-world but then again so are the James Bond flicks.  What really doesn't translate well is the fact that the animated heroes interacting with the real world a la `Roger Rabbit'.  They work better on the small screen in retrospect and a lot of the interaction seems forced (except with the gung ho energy to spare by the lissome Perabo, who actually breathes a fresh presence into every scene she's in).Alexander and Russo make for an amusing pair as the rotund Boris and statuesque Natasha and De Niro even is passable with his thick accented Leader (even aping his `Are you talkin' to me?' icon moment from `Taxi Driver').  But the pointless cameos by comedy stars like Crystal and Goldberg seem perfunctory (although it's always a guilty pleasure to see Winters at his battiest, although he's surprisingly sedate in this setting). Maybe the next film they'll let the duo work in their natural state of just animation.",

Elsewhere Rocky and Bullwinkle former nemeses Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), Boris (Jason Alexander), and Natasha (Rene Russo) are forced (literally) underground from their Soviet satellite of Potsylvania after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The three travel to Hollywood where after duping a mid level executive into acquiring the rights to the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show escape cartoon world and enter the real world intent on taking it over. When the FBI is alerted to Fearless leaders activities of buying up cable airtime for mind control, young and eager FBI field agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) is tasked with bringing Rocky and Bullwinkle to the real world and foil Fearless Leaders plans.Released in 2000, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle was Universal's second attempt at making a Jay Ward adaptation following 1999's Dudley Do-Right. With Disney's George of the Jungle, based on another Jay Ward produced cartoon, a surprise hit in 1995, and Rocky and Bullwinkle re-entering the public consciousness through reruns on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network in the 90s as well as appearing in various ads such as Taco Bell. Much like Dudley Do-Right, Rocky and Bullwinkle was a failure upon release but not to the same level as Dudley Do-Right. Rocky and Bullwinkle is slightly better than other cartoon adaptations like Inspector Gadget, Mr. Magoo, or Dudley Do-Right, but it doesn't really elevate itself to good or all that watchable either.The opening sequence where we see the titular Duo in the stylized environment that mimics the original budget conscious aesthetic with smoother more contemporary animation I actually rather liked. While I didn't think the sequence was all that funny (though a pun involving Veronica Lake got a chuckle from me) it felt at least somewhat in line with the original TV series. Once the movie brings in the live-action elements with going into the \"real world\", that's where things stumble. While the plot of Fearless Leader trying to take over the world through TV isn't an awful concept and probably could have even been a plot used on the actual show, the humor and approach the movie takes feels very awkward and strange. The movie exists in this odd state where it's simultaneously playing up the corniness of its own premise, but at the same time tries to unironically go for pathos in matters such as Karen Sympathy denying her inner child or Rocky going through an arc about not being able to fly. Part of the original show's appeal was in how fast paced its dialogue exchanges were contrasted against the stiff budget conscious animation, also Rocky and Bullwinkle was part of a variety package with other shorts such as Peabody and Sherman, Fractured Fairy Tales, or even Dudley Do-Right keeping the pacing tight and the humor on point. While not every joke landed, the pacing was fast enough on the show that the clunkers never left too huge of an impression. Rocky and Bullwinkle the movie on the other hand is much slower and because it's trying to play some parts of itself for emotional resonance while in other instances trying to capture the approach of the original show it just doesn't come together.The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a misfire, but it's a well intentioned misfire. There's a clear understanding of certain elements from the cartoon and there's certainly more care and craft seen here than with Disney's Inspector Gadget misfire, but at the same time I didn't laugh nearly enough to justify a viewing and more often the humor of this movie felt more confusing than legitimately funny.",

            "content": "Somewhere in the heart of Frostbite Falls, our heroes save the world on a daily basis, thwarting both by design and sheer luck the nefarious plots of Fearless Leader and his cohorts, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. The plots of those old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons were tantalizingly simple. Helium-voiced Rocket J. Squirrel and terminally stupid Bullwinkle J. Moose had all the sense of an Eskimo in a desert sandstorm, but the cartoons were loaded with adult-oriented jokes (Veronica Lake??) that would please Mom and Dad, while the kids were easily hooked on the appropriately cartoonish violence.There have been movies that have taken old-time cartoons and made them - or tried to - into live-action films. This doesn't always work. Sure, The Flintstones was a good-enough movie, but what about the more recent Flintstones movie in Las Vegas? The creators of this movie tried the same thing, and they even made Rocky and Bullwinkle trying to adapt to the 'real world' - that is, they knew the difference between their cartoon home in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota and three-dimensional life.\nBasic plot: Fearless Leader and company have left the cartoon world and are going to take over the real world. Whoa, THAT sounds familiar. So an intrepid, young, cute FBI agent (Piper Perabo, miscast and unnecessary) is assigned to the case by her boss (Randy Quaid, misused), and it's up to her and the cartoon moose and squirrel to right the wrongs of the day.I will say this much for the movie - aside from the now ho-hum special effects of making the cartoon animals seem real - it seems to stay pretty close to the spirit of the original. There are in-jokes (Nickelodean's Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchel play \"Martin and Lewis\" - Dean and Jerry, anyone?) and some fun cameos that don't detract from the movie itself. But it's nothing more than a road movie with a little panache. The saddest thing is that the movie becomes less about Rocky and Bullwinkle as icons and more about the superfluous FBI agent. It seems like there were several writers in on this escapade, but only one (Ken Lonergan) is listed - either he's REALLY schizophrenic, or the other writers wisely decided to be anonymous.There's also leaden pacing in some parts, not to mention a real herky-jerky filming style. Oh, but all is not lost. I DID laugh a lot. Ok, maybe not a lot, but some. It's just an uneven movie - sometimes you laugh, and sometimes you sit there in silence. All in all, it's not as good as the original, but since that almost never happens, you might walk away from it almost satisfied.",

I thought the voices of Rocky and Bullwinkle were done perfectly, and Bullwinkle is really funny when he's dumb. While no one really gave Oscar-worthy performances, for what this was, many of the live-action actors did a good job. I wasn't that happy with Piper Perabo as Karen Sympathy except in one scene which I won't mention where she was upset with Bullwinkle's innocence and stupidity). Jason Alexander and Rene Russo made a good team as Boris and Natasha. I enjoyed Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader but this was just a fun role for him, not proof he can really act. I did like John Goodman in his brief appearance as a cop, Whoopi Goldberg as a judge, and Kenan and Kel as students at Bullwinkle's alma mater.Of course this movie made plenty of use of 'breaking the fourth wall'--admitting to being only a movie. Many of the jokes using this technique were hilarious. And even though it wasn't a cartoon, such gimmicks as having characters suspended in the air just before falling--these were great simply because it's not supposed to happen in the 'real' world.This was great, even if some might say it's not in the same league with the animated TV version.",

The original cartoons didn't have them.  Looking for something that brings back the free-wheeling spirit of the originals?  Keep looking.Basically, R&B is a good idea that wasn't quite developed properly.  The idea of bringing Rocky and company into the real world was inspired, but the movie's idea of a real world is one in which yes, R&B are cartoon characters, but the movie's \"real\" people could easily inhabit the cartoons without missing a beat.  I think the real fun would've been to make the real world slightly more real (a suspension of disbelief among the people who encounter R&B was necessary, but you'd think appearances by cartoon characters was a normal occurrence in this world) and have people deal with the idea of an animated moose and squirrel coming to life with less acceptance and more apprehension.  And if the characters were going to inhabit our world, it should've been our world.  No \"no falling until you look down\" kind of things.Additionally, Boris and Natasha should've been given more to do.  Where was the cheap disguise that Boris would always don to trick R&B into a trap, neither of them recognizing their enemy? Alexander and Russo were wasted as not much more than window dressing.  DeNiro was a hoot, though, although his \"You talking to me?\" joke was forced.Ultimately, it's hard to maintain the manic pace of the cartoons over the course of a full length movie, and this film doesn't do it.  The need to tell a story over two hours instead of in seven minute bits was its weakness.But the strength of the movie is that, for all the problems, there are a number of strong laughs in it.  Puns and groaners fly all over the place, and that's always been what I watched R&B for.  Go, don't expect much of a story and just watch for the jokes.  It's worth it.PS to Hollywood: stop with all the cameos already!  They're forced, they're distracting, and they fall flat.  (Usually.  John Goodman's wasn't bad, for reasons that are clear when you see the film).",

I don't really care much for the negative feedback it received, even if I agree with a few.This is another movie with Robert de Niro here playing as the title characters' archenemy - alias of Fearless Leader who's some power-hungry dictator attempting to brainwash the country with his television system called initials RBTV. Fearless Leader sends two spy tropes of Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.This also has the FBI agent Karen Sympathy who's another pretty female and seen her in those Cheaper by the Dozen movies. I really don't like the pointless romantic subplot she has with that so-called good-looking prison officer who helped her escape (certainly corrupt). And Bullwinkle really was a student at Wossamotta U.This is also another movie with a likeable soundtrack which I remember this movie whenever listing to it - it's \"Dreamer\" by Supertramp.",

            "content": "Is it possible for a movie to be so intentionally silly and contain so much dried humor that the utter insanity of it distracts us from actually looking at the story and characters seriously enough to except it as a comedy? As the live action version of the classic cartoon proves, it is possible. \"The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,\" based on those jolly characters created by Jay Ward, is so incompetent that the audience really is distraught by its craziness. The entire story is built over a series of unbelievable coincidences coming in a variety of forms. This production is sprinkled with special cameos by Janeane Garofalo, John Goodman, Whoopi Goldberg, Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchel, David Alan Grier, and Billy Crystal, as well as the infatuating performances by Robert De Niro, Rene Russo, and Jason Alexander, who are curiously inspiring. However, I was more concerned about the production's extremely annoying and overused voice-over narration than the popular names present in the credits.What story there is features a trio of diabolical villains, Natasha (Rene Russo), Boris (Jason Alexander), and their fearless leader, Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro-what is he doing producing a movie like this?). They manage to burst out of their enclosed TV world in to reality, where Rocky the flying squirrel and Bullwinkle the moose must also enter the real world to stop them before with the assistance of special agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo), before the scoundrels take over the world using bad television programming.The film, directed by Des McAnuff, does not take advantage of its title characters. Even in a movie about the adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, those characters are not the focal point of the movie, but the zany and loony humor takes center stage here, which is more groan inspiring than laugh inducing.Like \"The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas\" and \"Inspector Gadget,\" this movie is so completely senseless impossible to critically analyze it, even on a professional level.Considering the fact that the film targets an age of audience much younger than myself, and the fact that it is not meant to be an Academy Award nominee, the humor is still unfunny and the plot ridiculous. I spent most of the time laughing at the pure insanity of the movie's ridiculous qualities. The producers are aware of its silliness, however, which makes the film shallow and meaningless, rather than agonizing and painful. ures.",

            "content": "Ouch. I was really looking forward to this movie, but I must say, it disappointed me on every level.First of all, they didn't put any thought into anything. A big deal is made over cartoon characters becoming real people, but then they can still do cartoony things like running off a steep cliff and hovering for a few moments before falling. The rules in this universe are never established, as far as what the characters can or can't do.That would have been okay if they were too busy throwing jokes at the screen like the original TV show did, but this movie has none of the wit or pacing of the show. Once Rocky and Bullwinkle get into the real world, they don't do anything. The first half of the movie all they do is ride in cars. It's like the film makers were thinking, \"Look, we've got cartoon characters in a live action setting! That's amazing! People will be so captivated by that we won't have to have them do anything or say anything interesting!\" Yeah, well, we already saw cartoons in the real world in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", and they did and said funny things (to further the Roger Rabbit rip off-ness, this movie has a cartoon weasel character that looks just like the ones in that movie). Bullwinkle can't even manage to have good puns- I wish they just had him repeat dialog from the original cartoon.But I can't put all the blame on the cartoon characters. The live actors aren't that great. It's great to see Robert DeNiro in a children's movie, and he didn't disappoint. He's pretty funny, but Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are kind of inadequate, but that's really because of the material. They could've been funny, if they had a lucid plot to fall back on and if they had more screen time. Too much time is spent with Piper Perabo, as a good-hearted FBI agent who teams up with moose and squirrel.This movie was very embarrassing, and I really wish they had put some thought into it, had really funny jokes and sight gags, and had stayed true to the characters on the show, making them as funny and clever as they were in the 1960s.  I cannot recommend this movie, as it was just painful for the most part.",

            "content": "It's amazing how special effects have improved over the years.  My parents told me that when they first saw MARY POPPINS back in '64, the audience was amazed when Dick Van Dyke was dancing with some penguins. When I saw WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT on opening day, I was blown away by the effects of the humans and \"Toontown\" residents put together.  Now with the ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, Universal tries it's part to put both animation and live action together.  And it is impressive and cool to look at, but the movie itself sinks. This is a modern story of the famous t.v. series from the 1960's.  I always watched Moose and Squirrel as Moose is always trying to pull a rabbit out of his hat... and fails.  While Squirrel helps and aids the dim-witted Moose.  With this version, the animated Boris (Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro) escape the cartoon world and are in the real world.  Fearless Leader wants to device bad television shows that would hypnotize it's viewers (like most of the UPN prime time lineup) so Leader can control the world.  FBI boss Cappy Von Trapment (Randy Quaid) assigns a top secret mission to the young and pretty Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to get Rocky and Bullwinkle out of the cartoon world and to help save the world. Leader finds out about the release of Rocky and Bullwinkle, so he assigns Boris and Natasha to stop Moose and Squirrel before they arrive in New York City.  But Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Karen are in a hurry, because they only have three days before Leader brodcasts his bad shows. At times I enjoyed this movie, and at other times I just covered my face and shook my head in shame.  I thought the animation and characters of both Rocky and Bullwinkle were cool. They were funny and fun to watch and it did add excitement into the movie.  And I did enjoy the characters that were played by Piper Perabo and the huge cast of cameos, from Janeane Garofalo to John Goodman.  But what really made this movie bad is the villians!  I never thought that I would say this, but I didn't enjoy DeNiro in this film.  Robert DeNiro is my favorite actor of all time.  I pretty much own most of his movies on DVD.  But he was BAD in this movie. I know that it's suppose to be fun and a satire, but I think it was DeNiro that was having fun, and the audience was being made fun of.  And Alexander and Russo were also annoying.  Where the characters are suppose to be like cartoons, but just come off as a embarrassment. Here's a example, seeing DeNiro, Alexander, and Russo dance to the annoying 1960's hit \"Secret Agent Man.\"  I was shaking in fear when I saw this scene. But what also had me confused is who did director Des McAnuff make this movie for?  It's too witty for children and too juvenile for adults.  So maybe it's for the TITAN A.E. and INSPECTOR GADGET crowd, young boys between the ages of 11-13. So that is probably why it failed at the box office, since most boys wanted to watch ME, MYSELF, & IRENE.  So the people who did see it, had the kids question the jokes, and the adults roll their eyes. That pretty much sum up this film.  It doesn't have a wide target audience.  If these Hollywood directors want to make a successful film, have it appeal to a wide audience, not a small selective age group.  Look at THE CREW, it's made for old folks, and it did poor box office business.  But PERFECT STORM, SPACE COWBOYS, GLADIATOR and X-MEN had appeal to kids, teens, adults, and senior citizens, since it had something for everybody.  With ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, when teens, adults, and seniors saw the trailer, they said, \"it looks stupid/silly\" only the kiddies were excited.  And while watching the film, the kiddies in the theater wouldn't stop squirming.  It's a shame, had director McAnuff made the villians more mature and not sophmoric, it would have been a good film.  But it instead turned out to be a so-so film that could have worked, but it didn't.  **1/2 (out of five)",

Well I am in this age bracket, the movie is in fact true to the original. You can blame why the movie flopped on that reason. It is simply that the core audiences simply changed. A lot of well known actors and actress are in here, DeNiro, Rene Russo, Johnathan Winters, John Goodman, Whoopie Goldberg. The best of all is Piper Parabo.Now let us discuss what is technically wrong with the movie that has gotten so much bad reviews. The movie had a weak central story which keeps audiences attention. There is also the lack of spacing where audiences needs some mental rest. Remember, today's audiences with all the mercury and aluminum in the brain simply just don't have the attention span as the movies of the 40s and 50s where the audiences at the time were quite verbal. Even the verbal reflex people of today just don't have the nimbleness to enjoy some of the early Bob Hope's movie one liners joke to get it as quickly as it once were.What the movie is excellent for as I realized is a test for mental attention span and interpretation and interplay of social satire that they watched. How many have noticed that Whoopie Goldberg was doing a satire of the famous O.J. Simpson's court case? That celebrities are above the law? It just makes you think. Or that Johnathan Winters is up to his old tricks in earlier movies of playing so many roles behind his costumes? If you don't have the long attention spans for this movie, then this is simply not your cup of tea. Today's audiences grasps more action, camera movement, much like The Island, or Doom, or somewhat shaky camera of \"you were there thing\" such as Bourne Identity or Bourne Supremacy. The techniques of this movie is somewhat outdated to go along with the 60s era movie style which not surprisingly failed to pique the audiences. If being true to the original get this bad reviews, how about Godzilla in NOT being true to the original that got bad ratings. The secret of this paradox lies in core audiences who will be watching the movie. A large majority of Godzilla have a large core audiences, while a children's show the Rocky and Bullwinkle show the core audiences only the late 40 or 50 year old people like me. Therefore the R&B should be geared more to new audiences while Godzilla is geared to the core Godzilla audiences! My movie business IS complicated! The movie was more of a light social satire true to its original However, audiences taste at the time of release and to today didn't have the pulse on today's audiences, which leans more heavily on visual, sounds, action rather than verbal. Take for example the movie Doom which is quite well rated by the audiences of Doom, but had hardly any script. The entire movie looked a lot more like an arcade game show.However, for some reason it is my bad habit to give scores quite high before any actors or actress goes \"mainstream\" for some reason or another despite the poor ratings of the movie they were presently watching. Angelie Jolie was a total hottie in Cyborg 2 or Hackers. Piper Parabo was a total hottie in the Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, and Tom Hanks was totally hot in the movie Big. And for some reason or another once they go mainstream, there's no steam left, at least for me anyway. For example Parabo went big time with Coyote Ugly, but I don't like her that much anymore, nor did Angelina Jolie inspired me anymore when she received her best actress Oscar or supporting actress in Girl Interrupted.",

This is all like a bad rip-off or sequel to WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT that was definitely one of my most greatest movies as a child, it's like a WHO SOUGHT ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE. Watching this slut early in the morning was stupid, they're trying to make a rip-off of a good show and make it into a animation-life movie and it's just all stupid. Don't watch this Rocky & Bullwinkle, this one is bad.

I was impressed by everyone in this film especially DeNiro because this is quite a departure from his dramatic and action roles.\nNewcomer Piper Perabo looks a lot like Renee Zelwegger and that is what I first noticed about her. I subsequently realized that she was more than just a pretty face, she is a real talent that will go far in Hollywood if she puts forth the effort.Another aspect of the film I was impressed with were the puns and play-ons the writer came up with. These above anything else made the film that much more enjoyable to watch because it was able to poke fun at others and yet still be funny enough where it didn't become silly.Few films that are made from television shows are successful. There are those who look for certain things to occur in a movie that they saw as a child on a television show and they base their opinion of the movie based upon that fact alone. \"The Adventures Of Rocky & Bullwinkle\" far succeeded my expectations of being one of the best made from a television show.

At least Rene Russo looks something like Natasha.The story, what there was, just didn't make much sense.  And I really don't know who they were trying to target this movie to--at the screening I went to, the audience was filled with parents and children, but most of the humor consisted of wordplay and puns which would sail over their heads.  The movie doesn't aspire to an adult level of comedy and I can't imagine it would appeal very much to fans of the original series, unless they're in a serious nostalgia phase.The film was only 90 minutes long, but that was about 70 minutes too long. Any time I start looking at my watch, I know it's a bad sign and I checked the time more than once.  I have to say that, after growing up with Roger Ebert's reviews and finding I often was in agreement with him, more and more recently, I'm discovering that our tastes in movies have started to converge.  I went to the film based on his recommendation and his 3 and 1/2 star rating, but this is more of a 1 star film, if that.  I have to say I was very disappointed!",

It was probably the biggest cinematic letdown I have ever experienced in my movie-going lifetime! (I still want my money back.) I felt sorry for the animated characters having to be in such a horrible film beside such terrible real-life actors. Imagine that, feeling sorry for the ANIMATED characters! I also saw on some late-night talk show Steve Martin explaining away about how he came up with his 'original' character in the movie. He even made physical gestures to justify his claim. Well...it just so happens that earlier, the very same day, I happened to be flipping through the cable channels and landed for a few minutes on Turner Classic Movies. \"I Was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\" from about 1931 was showing. Guess what? It was right on a scene where Paul Muni's character's wife, a blonde, floozy, cheating, bimbo, received a phone call that he answered. It was one of her college-boy 'boyfriends' asking her to come out for a good time with them. He was the very same character that Steve Martin claimed he had totally and originally created himself!!

The sly satorical elements are cleverly tucked away so that when kids watch it they won't notice, whereas anyone older will be able to pick up on the media and social comments.

So I saw it again with an open mind. It was still awful.I liked the in-jokes like the process used by studios to choose scripts (throw away the intelligent ones).  But other in-jokes seemed more designed to cover up bad plotting than give a laugh.  For instance there is one exchange querying why they have to go by road to  Washington - as time was of the essence - when going by plane would be a bit quicker.  The answer is \"it's a road movie\".  No, the answer is \"take a bit more time coming up with a more convincing answer\".  The other example is why Rocky and Bullwinkle are still cartoon but the cartoon baddies take human form. A joke is made of this late on but by then it was far too late.  I'm not a grouch, really. I'm prepared to believe any world as long as it is set-up right. Even if the world involves a cartoon moose and flying squirrel wandering around it.  Who Framed Roger Rabbit had a similar premise but it was consistent and so became an instant classic.I admit that the characters in Rocky and Bullwinkle were consistent and good value but that wasn't nearly enough to compensate for such lame story-telling and plotting.And for God's sake don't tell anyone I saw it twice.",

(sorry Danny...) Okay, the movie, right...Well, let's just say I was hoping for a little bit more than what I got.  The cameo appearances look great in the credits but in the movie itself one has to wonder \"why?\".  Keenan and Kel try so hard to pass as geeky nerds but their chemistry and humor works almost too well for them in this picture.  Whoopi Goldberg's motivation for her hip-harsh judge is somewhat lost.  (Sorry Whoopi, we'll talk later) Robert DeNiro is interesting as Fearless Leader and I wish that he had a smaller part in the film until the end and a do a grand finish.  But either way it works.  And it does, because after all, while it looked cute, we are really here to see the famed duo from long forgotten right?  Rocky and Bullwinkle make it fun.  Not funny.  But fun.  After all, were Rocky and Bullwinkle ever funny?  Yes! They had those awesome puns and slapstick humor! And the tradition continues through the whole movie!!! All the talk about digital this and that weighs it down some but overall, I felt somewhat satisfied when I left and am sure that if I were to see it a second time (and I will because I know I will buy it on video, I am always a sucker for those tapes, and soon the dvd...when i get around to it)I will love it. \nOkay, outside the dimension of critic:  This is hilarious! Ultimate stupid humor!! and I love stupid humor! Not like Ace Ventura stupid humor but like sweet innocent just plain stupid humor that you laugh at and then with! Because deep down, you know that's really the way things are. So dumb, you have no choice but to laugh.  And you do!!! On a rate of 1 to 10 I'll give it a 6.5-7 which would make it like 6.5745978 or something like that....Anyway, go see it sometime (preferably in the theatre..they're losing money on this one...help em out a little, let em know innocence still has a place in the world!) and GO SEE IT!",

As I grew older I watched it in reruns. Even as an adult, I enjoyed the puns and silly situations.Tomorrow, November 19, 2020 is the 61st anniversary of the premier episode. I did not know that there was a holiday devoted to Rocky and Bullwinkle. When I found out I checked out IMDB for an update and was unpleasantly surprised at all the negative reviews about The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle. I had to speak up.Early in the year 2000 I was in a movie theater waiting for a movie to start. A couple of trailers had already come on. Then, a trailer started with a view of crowds. People started pointing to the sky. \"Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane...\" For a second I thought \"Oh, another Superman movie.\" Then, a life sized Bullwinkle J. Moose standing amid real people, followed by Rocket J. Squirrel flying through the air. \"Incredible, a live action Rocky & Bullwinkle movie.\"The movie was released in June 2000 and I watched it with the enthusiasm of a 13 year old and the wisdom of a 54 year old. It was awesome. Was it silly and stupid? Of course. Even the characters self-deprecatingly admit it. Narrator: \"Even their wordplay had gotten hackneyed and cheap.\" Bullwinkle: \"No. It was always like this.\" Therein lies the charm of the movie.Today, at the top of the IMDB page I saw a 4.2 star rating. I thought \"Did I miss something 20 years ago?\" I just finished watching it again. No, I didn't miss anything. It was just as awesome now (I'm 74) as it was 20 years ago.It's the naysayers that missed the whole point of the movie - FUN. To them I quote FBI agent Karen Sympathy: \"What you believe in when you are young can still be true when you grow up.\"To the rest of us who love the franchise, young or old, \"Hooray, we have a holiday.\" Watch the movie every year on November 19.",

(i.e. \"all celebrities are above the law!\") I'd see it again. if you paid me.",

Actually, I'm not suprised that their comments usually include, \"...and though I'm not a fan of the original show...\".  Well, there you go. I've noticed that the humor of Rocky and Bullwinkle is an acquired taste. Either you like it, or you don't.  If you like it, then you'll like this movie.Instead of talking about the details of the movie, let's go over the arguments that the critics make, shall we?\"Nobody was laughing.\"  Ok, there are few big belly laughs in this movie, but that's because the humor is subtle; I heard a lot of people chuckling, and that's what people do during regular Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, not loud obnoxious laughter.  Why?  Because if you laugh too loud, you risk missing another joke.  Another point: I've been to other movies and have noticed that the belly laughs seem to always stem from jokes dealing with sex, drugs, or grossness.  I guess R&B doesn't live up to these \"standards\", but that's a GOOD thing.\"The live actors didn't play their parts well.\"  Do you have ANY idea how difficult it is to play a cartoon character well?  There's a balance between trying to be believable, and being too copy-cat.  I don't like it when people make drastic changes to a character, but I also don't like it when the character is a dull carbon copy of the original, with no new material. The balance is in the middle, and DeNiro, Russo, and Alexander walk that line well.\"The movie slows down near the end.\"  Ok, maybe a little, but I didn't mind. I guess I'm just one of the people who was actually interested to see how the story turned out.  A few dramatic pauses don't hurt; every movie has them, and that's what sets them apart from television.  In television, you have a half-hour to do as much as you can, so they have to cram everything in there.  They can't AFFORD dramatic pauses.  So just because the original show didn't have them, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be there.\"The animation was lacking.\"  Say what?  I was worried before I saw the movie that the animation wouldn't be that great, that Rocky and Bullwinkle would look grossly out-of-place.  But they don't, not at all.  I think they did a wonderful job on the animation.I definitely recommend this movie if you were a fan of the original show. When I saw it, the people in the audience applauded at the end, and I think that's a good sentiment.",

I really wish that I could be writing a glowing review....... especially after all the fanfare and positive publicity, which preceded the debut of this movie.As a big fan, of this animated series, I do feel that this film really betrayed the spirit of the original producers, Jay Ward and Bill Scott.  To do this type of film should have only been done if the finished product was to be a true and genuine TRIBUTE to this great show.The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle was brutally self-deprecating to the point of being DESTRUCTIVE.  The lines of this film continuously reminded the audience of what a bad series this was......how terrible the dialogue used to be, and that nothing had changed since 1964.....(Hello?!?......was this really true.....how could the series have ever lasted five years if it was THAT BAD?!?).Being totally objective, I can recall, as an adult, watching some episodes, in which I groaned out loud, but in all fairness, the majority of the time I found it delightful and ingeniously done!!  I can forgive a few bad shows, here and there, for a TRUE CLASSIC like this.Phyllis Diller's self-deprecating humor was endearing and incredibly funny. This movie's style of such humor was a terrible injustice and an abominable tribute!  What this destructive bent did was to make many of us, in the audience, feel like we were CHUMPS for being there!!  I think that a lot of us could have forgiven the script, or been a little more conservative in our criticism, had the film not constantly reminded us how bad the movie was.I did not feel so badly, for myself, sitting through this movie, but I was accompanied by two young ladies, around my age (all of us being single, for the record) who had agreed to see this film because I wanted to see it.  When I saw how much they were not enjoying it, I just could not wait for the movie to end!  I think I suffered through the film, more than they, since it had been my idea, and I felt guilty about it.Finally I will say that I really had had high hopes for this movie since I had chosen to forgo seeing several other recent adaptations of Jay Ward's shows (Boris and Natasha, Dudley Do- Right and George of the Jungle).  I had skipped all of those films because there was no animation, included, at all. I had even gone to this movie, after having read some lukewarm to bad reviews.....I guess you could say that I was hoping against hopelessness......",

            "content": "This was a very noble attempt to bring Moose and Squirrel into the new Millennium.  The animation was very good, and the classic full-cartoon sequences were (if anything) TOO well-animated (Remember how clunky the animation and backgrounds were in the classic series?)  Even the color was exceptionally vibrant.  The many sight gags and puns were a treat, as were the numerous cameos (including \"Judge Cameo\" played by Whoopie Goldberg). Who would have thought of bringing a cartoon character to life by getting Hollywood to \"Greenlight\" the movie?But this film still left me wanting.  Rocky and Bullwinkle always put the plot and cliffhanger ahead of puns, animation and cheeky gimmicks.  Here, the story is kind of second nature.  I find it hard to believe that even the most die-hard couch potatoes would want to watch a network dubbed \"Really Bad Television - RBTV\".  They have too much to choose from on satellite, cable, home video, and the big five networks.  And if not, they can always log on to the Internet or play Nintendo!While the writing was funny and clever at times, they missed several opportunities to be even funnier.  There were three VERY funny lines shown in the trailer that somehow never made it into the final cut:1. When Rocky & Bullwinkle launch themselves through the air in the live-action convertible, Bullwinkle can be heard yelling \"I'm the King of the World!\" ala Jim Cameron's \"Titanic\".2. When Bullwinkle crashes his plane on the White House lawn, he staggers out and mumbles something about wanting to \"use a lifeline, please...\" in homage to \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\".3. When Rocky and Bullwinkle are leaving Washington at the end of the movie, Bullwinkle lowers his shades, looks into the camera and shouts \"WHASSSUUUUP!\" in homage to the Beer Commercial popular at the time.(These lines were used to help promote the movie, but they never made it into the final cut. DVD owners can catch these lines in the film's trailer, but personally, I consider this to be false advertising!  If you're gonna have stuff that funny, leave it in the final cut of the film - don't tease us and then withhold the payoff!)Deniro, Alexander and Russo are very good, but do not get the screen time they rightfully merit.  (Remember, in the TV show, we usually saw more of Boris and Natasha than we did Moose and Squirrel!) But even here, Natasha gets to do some serious soul-searching (about making \"leetle boris's that we can teach to be rotten\").  Sorry, I don't need angst from a gorgeous lady spy from the sixties, I need her to do what she does best... be sneaky!And how did the producers possibly miss the opportunity to cast John Ratzenberger (\"Cliff\") and George Wendt (\"Norm\") as Chauncey and Edgar; those two old simps who sit on a park bench every episode and invariably point out \"Well there's something you don't see every day...\"?  I hear both actors are available and without a sitcom right now!  Wake up people!And Piper Perabo?  Adorable.  Funny.  Cute.  But a waste of screen time! Her character was overwritten.  This is not \"The Adventures of Karen Sympathy and Her Friends\".  Don't get me wrong, I think she will make a fine actress in the right part.  But here, she is just plain unnecessary.Jay Ward's legacy is capable of so much more than this (see the 1990s version of \"George of the Jungle\" to see what I am talking about!).  I highly advise the production team to get back to their drawing boards for a sequel - one that really works...",

If you are desperate for something to do with your child on a rainy day, it might be worth seeing at a second-run theatre... but just barely, and then only for the (brief) appearances by Jonathan Winters (although your child will probably be more thrilled by the Keenan and Kel appearance in the middle of the movie.)Rating: 3 out of 10",

Jason Alexander plays the role of Boris in such an exaggerated manner that its hilarious watching him act. He reminds me of that Russian voice you hear in Vodka commercials, only he's more retarded.De Niro does a surprisingly small role as the fearless leader. I guess we've seen him in so many serious films that we are not used to this level of mediocre acting from him. Nevertheless, he ends up being OK in the movie, not really getting in the way.Of course, there is the ever so awesome flying squirrel Rocky. He was always the best part of the show and even in this film coming off as a 3d character, he's still as furry and as lovable as in the original cartoon.Finally, a story line ripped of Roger Rabbit and a narrator which interacts with the characters bring a small smile from the audience. That smile however, is a result from the over retardness of this movie. I guess that was the biggest flaw in the film, it made so many bad jokes and had so many predictable gags that the retardness just got blown out of proportion.WAIT! NO! I take it back! the retardness was not the biggest flaw, i'll tell you what the biggest flaw in the movie (and the cartoon for that matter) is: BULLWINKLE.He is the most annoying, not funny, not cute, ugly, dumb, clueless character in the HISTORY of cartoons. His voice makes you want to hang a puppy and he is useless when it comes to solving problems.If they would have killed him at the start of the movie, it would have been a good movie, instead, its a mediocre movie.Drop dead you LSD addict moose.5/10P.S.

Thankfully that's not the case with Rocky and Bullwinkle.Yes, it's silly enough to entertain the youngsters, but it also has a witty, sardonic edge that can enthrall the most jaded adult, an A-list cast with cameos by old guard faves like Carl Reiner and Jonathan Winters, and copious use of the 1970s Supertramp single \"Dreamer.\" What more do you need?DeNiro, always a delight to watch, looks like he's having fun, particularly with his send-up of the classic Taxi Driver \"Are you talking to me?\" scene. Rather than playing the role of Fearless Leader as broad camp, DeNiro keeps the character within the boundaries of straight comedy and thus remains a reasonable threat. After all, we've suspended disbelief regarding flying squirrels and walking mooses -- the master villain can't be unduly silly, or the piece falls apart.Where we need unduly silly are in our foils Boris and Natasha, and Jason Alexander and Renee Russo do not disappoint. It's tough to play a cartoon character believably yet remain true to the original interpretation. Alexander and Russo maintain perfect balance walking that tightrope and deliver entertaining performances.My 5 year old insisted that we give this movie a 10. I would have been more comfortable with an 8, but either way we're toward the top end of the scale.

There is a moment where one villain says to another \"there's no way to kill a cartoon\" and the other asks \"What about Roger Rabbit?\" in which of course the plot hinges on the arch villain having discovered a way to permanently eliminate otherwise indestructible cartoon characters. This movie has an alternative which is soon revealed, which itself has some technology reversal jokes, as well as a technology exploitation joke identical to that in Inspector Gadget: the absolutely vast manual that you have to read before you can use it properly, but which no protagonist ever reads.The other technology exploitation joke is that the expert who explains it all is a girl (Sydney, excellently played by young Lily Nicksay), implying that all adults are too old to understand this new stuff. We saw a suggestion of this in the much darker War Games, and there are child boffins in movie gangs or communities entirely of kids (e.g. The Goonies), but I can't recall another where the rest of the organization where the young boffin rules are adults. They may be college kids (a clich\u00e9), but not this young, and perhaps never before a pre-teen girl (a good anti-stereotype).IPH",

Odds are, the same people who did this are the same ones who watched the show on television for the exact same reasons when they were younger. The show, often compared to \"The Simpsons,\" was based on horrible puns, unbelievable plots, and awkward scripts. This film does a masterful job of recreating the television series. So, if the movie doesn't strike you as quality, you probably also will dislike the cartoon series. And if you weren't too crazy about the cartoon, the movie is not going to be any better. However, the film is basically one long version of the cartoon. The only thing that disappointed me was that there was no interrupting \"Fractured Fairy Tale,\" Sherman and Peabody didn't make an appearance, and the film ended without awful puns referencing future 'episodes.' Otherwise, this is a delightful film that will bring back fond memories of the classic television show.",

A real remake of the show's scatological humor would have been at least interesting. This movie was missing many of my favorite characters like time traveling dogs and dashing mounties as well as the Fractured Fairy Tale schmuck.

I LIKED the different celebrity cameos, and though the script was a little too subtle for the younger audience (I went to see it with a 7, 4, and 1 year old), the mere concept that here are cartoon characters turning into people, and here are life-sized talking animals did it for them too.

I really didn't see the need for the character, except the \"be yourself\" moral at the end, and she didn't impress me with her acting. (Although i guess it's hard to imagine cartoons around you all the time).

The picture might have worked better as an animated feature. If you've never seen \"moose and squirrel\" on television you might get a few laughs out of this, but you'll wonder how the show ever got such a following. Diehard fans will definitely be disappointed, although Robert DeNiro is amusing as Fearless Leader, and June Foray and Keith Scott are excellent as our heroes' voices.

Superb, because this is a knowing self-referenial film where all the knowing self-referenial comments further a gag, or the story, or character.  They don't just stick out and say, look, I'm self-referenial!  Daring, because everything in the movie says that these are the values of Moose and Squirrel and we are going to explore them, discuss them, and even critique them, all in a story that is funny and big and filmic.  Original, because it's not just gags and animation, it's a story of a young person who has to face her own shortcomings and look for strength in an immoral world.  And she finds it...you guessed it, in the values of Rocky and Bullwinkle.  Bullwinkle J. Moose is childishly logical and quite brave in his fashion, and Rocky is full of the rules of the adult world, and maybe a bit too careful, yet somehow still wanting to do good. Russo, Alexander, and DeNiro play the villainous trio not too well, but well, because the focus is on Rocky and Bullwinkle, and the young person who's character name I dare not give away,  because it's funny.  And the measure of the film is that it's done well, not steriods well, just a light touch, enough to make the comic duo funny and engaging on the big screen. And that is a trick that you may not want to believe can be done.  But the chemistry works, between Rocky and Bullwinkle and the heroine of the picture.  So that's why I liked it.",

(Renee Russo's Natasha being the other one.) I like Jason Alexander, who seems miscast as Boris. He didn't do a dreadful job, just never seemed to get to evoking the Potsylvaninian villain.The biggest problem with the film is with the writing. Adding the palling Karen Sympathy as the focal character was a big step right into the center of the cow pasture, from which this movie fails to escape. I understand that this was probably a ploy to bring in viewers who weren't fans of the original series. As a fan, I have no use for these people. What I want is something close to the original feel, almost anything that the non-fans want will most likely detract from that goal. However they might want to dress up the movie, the \"sympathetic\" FBI character who loves Rocky & Bullwinkle is a limp character and subtracts from the movie from the start.It is ironic that the writer chose a theme about keeping the kid inside alive in a film that is about a cartoon that was never intended for kids. Yes, adults might have needed to be somewhat childlike to enjoy the original series, but the series aimed its jokes at adults, and included a modicum of material for kids. The reason that I love Rocky and Bullwinkle is that I noticed that the cartoon grew with me. I heard Jay Ward explain it like this. When you are young, you have physical action and slapstick. For an older kid, there are puns and bizarre situations. For an adult, satire and subtler adult humor.The writing also had very few jokes or gags that made me feel like I was watching Rocky & Bullwinkle. There is a sequence where Boris steals the narrator's map and another where Natasha explains Boris's reference to \"Potsylvainian Hospitalability\". That's it. For one thing, the script needed more \"inversions\" in order to invoke the proper spirit of the cartoon villains. Boris and Natasha are satirical takes on one-dimensional melodramatic villains. Everything that is \"good\" is \"bad\" (The cartoon refers to the Potsylvanian magazine \"Bad Housekeeping\", for example). That is why it is so wrong for Natasha to tell Fearless Leader that he is so GOOD to them.It seems that the writer only had consultants who had actually seen the show. He was only told the type of gags that R&B had. \"Oh, they typically did fourth-wall jokes, so they need to talk to the camera and narrator.\" \"Throw in some word plays.\" It does not seem that the writers never did a side-by-side comparison to the original. Had they done this, perhaps at least the movie would be more satisfactory to Rocky and Bullwinkle fans.",

I personally have never found him to be quite deserving of his many accolades. The reason -- while he plays it very well, he has been playing the EXACT same character since \"Taxi Driver\". This was the FIRST time I've ever seen De Niro actually ACT (i.e. take on a new persona and ACT like someone else). He was brilliant. Unfortunately, like many other versatile actors (such as Jim Carey and Robin Williams) the public is only happy when he hashes out the same, tired routine.I wish so much that more people had found the same joy in this picture as I did. It was brilliantly self-referential, aware, bright, quick and funny as heck. If you can relate to anything I've touched on in this review, and there probably aren't a lot of you, see this movie.",

I am 51 and have tapes of most of R&B's TV shows and I think this is just as good.  The three voices were splendid and the animation/live action mix was terrific.  If you didn't like this film you should get your head examined, by Dr. Bullwinkle J. Moose, himself!",

It's got a lot of puns, stupidity, and social commentary.  It also has a theme of truth and doing what is right.  For those that liked the old Bullwinkle series, you'll love it.",

Some of the humor may be lost on people under 30, but I thought it was sharp and funny all the way through.  The cameos were fun, and the puns were great in their stupidity!  I liked the Crymia River...",

            "content": "I have read previous comments people have written. It always disturbs me that people look for that hidden message and take things way to serious when it comes to movies eg. \"Godzilla\" people comment as if that would happen. Come on folks it's a 20 foot lizard rampaging through Manhattan its not supposed to be real. Same with this movie. This is a spin off of a cartoon done long ago. You thought it was great then because you were a kid. Now you are all grown up so of course your not going to look at it from the same perspective. This movie was a lot of fun, don't take it so seriously. (Its a cartoon) The actors were good. They looked like they totally enjoyed them selves making it, which help make this movie fun to watch. Please remember you go to the movies to escape real life and lose yourself in the movie magic. Just go and enjoy. Also it is really aimed at kids.  But all in all I thought this was a lot of fun to watch.",
