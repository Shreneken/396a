            "content": "Maybe not. Les Parapluies de Cherbourg is one of the most beautiful movies ever made with an enchanting and haunting score by Michel Le Grande, and totally focused, sharp and creative direction by Jacques Demy. Catherine Deneuve gives a fine performance in pinkish white makeup with her blonde hair pulled away from her famous face, at twenty playing a seventeen-year-old shopkeeper's daughter who falls in love with a garage mechanic. He is called away to the war in Algeria after making her pregnant. Will she wait for him as the award-winning song proclaims? Will their love endure the long separation?All the dialogue is sung. The script is terse with nothing extraneous to the bittersweet story. Because the dialogue is stripped to the barest essentials, the singing seems natural and enhances the dream-like quality established early with the rain falling on the umbrellas and the cobblestone streets of the seacoast town. The sets are splashed in vivid color. Everything is superficially romantic, but the events are the starkest realism.When a young girl if forced to choose between love and security, which does she choose? It depends on the circumstances, and sometimes circumstances and the passage of time can change her heart.I was a teenager in France when this was made in the sixties. The backdrops of the white Esso gas station, the red and yellow passenger train cars, the bouffant hair styles on the girls, their eyes heavily made up with mascara and black eyeliner, the ubiquitous bicycles and the little French \"cigarette roller\" cars all brought back vivid memories of youth as did the musical score. A question: what ever happened to the \"other\" girl, Ellen Farner who played Madeleine? To be honest I found her more attractive than Deneuve who of course went on to become a great star and an acclaimed international beauty.Farner was never heard from again.Some scenes made more effective by their simplicity: When Genevi\u00e8re (Deneuve) returns home after a late evening with Guy, her mother (Anne Vernon) surveys her daughter and exclaims, \"What have you done?\" Genevi\u00e8re retorts sharply, \"Mama!\" and it is clear what she has done. Also, as Guy is going off to the army Madeleine arrives upon the scene as he is saying good-bye to his stepmother who is ill. They exchange glances that reveal Madeleine's love for him. And then she sings out softly in the heartfelt regret of parting, \"Adieu, Guy.\" We know these are not the last words that will pass between them. Additionally, the brief, beautifully structured, final scene at the shiny new Esso gas station is not to be forgotten.The scenes with Roland Cassard (Marc Michel), the suave, traveling man of means who sells Madame Emery's jewelry so she can pay the taxes on her umbrella shop, are nicely staged so that we can see at a glance that he is enormously taken with Genevi\u00e8re and that the mother will do everything possible to further his case. It is agreeable for those identifying with Genevi\u00e8re that Roland is not only well off financially, but is as handsome as the garage mechanic. But will he still want her when he learns that she is pregnant with another man's child?Jacques Demy who also wrote the script is to be commended for the effortless pace and tight focus of this romantic tale of star crossed lovers. I wish every director had such an ability to cut the extraneous and concentrate on the essentials without intrusion. The tale is an atmospheric tour de force of love lost and gained, of bourgeois values triumphant.This might be a bit precious for some, but upon seeing this for the third time, I can tell you I was enchanted anew.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "In 1957 France a 17 year old shop girl (Catherine Deneuve) is in love with a gas station worker (Nino Castelnuovo). Her mother is totally against the romance. He's called off to serve in the war for two years. They must part but have sex before he leaves. Then she discovers she's pregnant...Sounds terrible but it isn't. All the dialogue is sung and the film is done in just breathtaking color--all the sets are decorated to take advantage of this. The colors just leap out at you and some of the scenes are unbelievably beautiful. The musical score is haunting and Deneuve (who became known by this film) and Castelnuovo make a very attractive, sympathetic couple.The film is just gorgeous--I can't stress enough how beautiful it is and the music (especially the title theme) is so moving. It all leads up to a finale that has me crying every single time I see it. It IS a happy ending (sort of) but the emotions of the two characters really tear you apart.The acting is good, the film moves quickly (90 minutes) and--quite simply--this is one of the best foreign films ever made. It's not for everybody but if you're a romantic (like me) you'll love it. But be warned--have PLENTY of tissue handy for the end. I've seen it four times and I STILL cry at the end! A definite must see. A 10+.",

Remy says he was inspired by American musicals, and yet a more non-American could hardly be imagined. Can we really pretend that an American studio in 1963 would endorse the story of pre-marital sex and the romance of marrying a 17-year old girl pregnant with another man's child and not feel the need to moralize or condemn? Only in France, and thank God for it. All the cast are brilliant - charming and charismatic; the production design looks like a psychedelic gingerbread house; the score is exceptional; the singing genuinely heart-felt and moving; and the whole thing is carried off with such effortless confidence and unreserved joy that it's impossible not to fall in love with it.",

Can their love survive the many obstacles in its way? --Other than that, I'd rather not reveal the plot or the twists, as I'd hate to spoil it for the reader.Suffice to say, this is an absolutely beautiful film throughout--especially the incredible cinematography. So beautiful and engaging that I found myself in tears as the movie concluded--and the ending is one of my favorites in film history.

I have two films I turn to at these times. One is Singin' in the Rain; the other is this little gem. Both transport me to a world of colour, joy and heartache, yet both stay just the right side of sentimental too.Of course the plot is a little convoluted; of course the entirely sung script makes it a little jarring at first - but just sit back and let Les Parapluies do its magic.

            "review_title": "Bold Series of Uninterrupted Recitatives Constitute Demy's Brightly Colored But Sad Love Story",
            "content": "In 1964, filmmaker Jacques Demy made an audacious move by directing a deceptively simple love story completely in song. I would be hard pressed to call this movie a musical, opera or even an operetta since there are neither show-stopping production numbers nor soul-bearing arias on the soundtrack. Instead, we are presented everyday dialogue in a series of recitatives that bring a dramatic urgency to the most mundane of events. Why it works is that the story is not the happy-go-lucky romance one would suspect it will be from the bright colors of the production but rather a melancholy tale of love unfulfilled and the tenuousness of longing in the face of harsh realities. It is a Gallic version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" by way of William Inge's tale of teenage lust, \"Splendor in the Grass\" (in fact, Demy's ending bears a striking resemblance to the last scenes of Elia Kazan's film three years earlier).The plot focuses on teen-aged star-crossed lovers Genevieve and Guy, who develop a relationship through clandestine meetings despite the disapproval of Genevieve's mother, who thinks a gas station mechanic is beneath her daughter. The lovers eventually consummate their relationship once Guy finds he has been drafted to serve for France during the Algerian conflict. With Guy away, Genevieve discovers she is pregnant and must decide whether to wait for Guy's uncertain return or marry the rich diamond dealer, Roland Cassard, her mother's preference given the failing business of her umbrella shop. The story develops in subtle strokes almost like a Yasujiro Ozu film in that there aren't really any melodramatic confrontation scenes but instead moments of revelation. The wondrous Catherine Deneuve, all of twenty, had her first important role as Genevieve, and it's no wonder her career seems assured from her ethereal performance. With his earthy good looks and open-hearted manner, Nino Castelnuovo complements Deneuve as Guy, and their romance is palpable even in an amusingly contrived shot where they are obviously on a conveyor belt moving down the street. Anne Vernon lends a robust presence as Genevieve's mother as she plots her daughter's fate, and Marc Michel is appropriately bland as Roland.Along with the vibrant colors faithfully recaptured in a 1996 restoration, such artifices really add to the film's charm. However, just as essential is Michel Legrand's score with his swooning romanticism at its most cinematic (and a precursor to the music he composed for Barbra Streisand's 1983 \"Yentl\"), as it fills the dramatic arcs from start to finish. You will likely recognize the lounge standard melodies for the Americanized translations, \"I Will Wait for You\" and \"Watch What Happens\", as they are pervasive through the recitatives. I enjoyed the movie very much but realize this will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially those already alienated by the musical genre. One can see this as an even more exaggerated form, but you can probably tell by the first two minutes whether you will be enraptured by it. The DVD also includes an excerpt from Demy's widow Agnes Varda's illuminating 1995 documentary, \"The World of Jacques Demy\".",

And the music (especially main theme) is so hauntingly beautiful it really does make you want to cry when you hear the first notes.The coloring is like in no other film. The clothing and background have been matched in every single scene of the movie. That's real cinema, that's beautiful! And if that's beautiful already, then what comes when the 20-year old Catherine Deneuve is in the lead role! Just WOW! Once again I don't bother explaining any of the plot, because there's no point really...but one of the saddest scenes in movie history, is the Esso-scene in this one.

            "content": "The first of the three segments is perhaps the sunniest film ever made. It's a totally original film (at least from what I've seen); so original, in fact, that at first it's kind of off-putting -- the artificiality of the bubble gum colors (in the first segment, as they change slightly as each moves into the next), the constantly moving camera, and the fact that all of the lines are sung makes it hard to get situated within the film, for the same reason that you turn the car radio down when you're driving down a street trying to read house numbers. (\"I can't follow the plot, they keep singing...\") And yet Demy isn't satisfied with just being sunny (and his brightness is never garish); each segment has a specific feel, the grandest being the last, with an ending that's just right. (Though it should be said that Demy never once sacrifices the pleasure he creates, nor does he fall into any stale conventions, even while his story is based on the oldest of movie clich\u00e9s -- wait for me!).I hesitate to use the word melodrama, but that's essentially what the film is, both for the meaning of the word \"melo\" (music) and for the heightened emotions brought on my the music. It feels like we've got our head in the clouds, not least of all because the acting is aided by, well, the singing. The music, which is nearly always splendid (and never song-and-dancey), compliments the actors. At first the acting is very plain; or at least, it seems that way. I think that's due to the unconventional approach. Deneuve's loveliness as a young woman keeps us from responding to much aside from her beauty (and she starts off as a typical love-struck sixteen year-old), but by the end she's quite a different person, and to overuse a term applied to Deneuve, she becomes elegant. (I kept looking at her handsome costar thinking Alain Delon would have been perfect in the role; then I learned his most noteworthy film aside from this one was the Delon-starring Visconti film, \"Rocco and His Brothers.) Surely some people would probably vomit at a film of such shameless exhibitionism and style, but I was left astonished, thinking, How in the hell did they pull it off? 9/10",

            "content": "A glorious film just a few things to add to what everyone else has said[NB SPOILERS towards the bottom of the page - not that the plot is exactly a suspense]It's a \"realistic\" story on the face of it. The whole thing is reminiscent of the \"verismo\" Italian operas from the end of the 19th century, like Cavalleria Rusticana, where soap-opera plots about ordinary people are set to emotionally stunning over-the-top drama-queen music - inherently a democratic kind of style, saying that shopworkers and little old ladies have as much right to passion and glory as kings or gangsters or movie stars.Yes, the singing is silly. But the film knows this - in the very first scene the men in the washroom joke about \"Carmen\" (another example of the same style) and one of them sings something like \"I'm going to see a film, I don't like Opera, I can't stand all the singing\". Its a film that *knows* mechanics don't (usually) sing arias while they check the oil, and makes a joke about it. Buffy fans will have got the same point from \"Once more with feeling\" - the Fundamental Problem of the Musical is: \"why is everybody singing?\"But there is something unrealistic about it, the beauty. Everyone and everything is good-looking. The people are beautiful. The dirty old town is beautiful. Cheap bars are beautiful. Squalid damp flats are beautiful. Abandoned hulk ships are beautiful. A garage forecourt with petrol pumps and a canopy is beautiful. All the men are good-looking. And as for the women - someone asked why more men than women like this weepy film. The obvious answer is Catherine Deneuve. But Anne Vernon playing her mother is cuter than anyone her age has a right to be. And as for Ellen Farner... Guy has not one but two stupendously attractive women after him, which is about 1.99 more than the average member of the audience.The costumes match the background far too often for it to be anything but deliberate. At first its even more confusing than the singing. Madame Emery dresses differently to match the wallpaper of the shop and her flat, sometimes her clothes even seem to change colour for no reason other than to match the scenery. Genevieve stands in front of a window while a truck that's exactly the same shade as her cardigan pulls up behind her. When she tries on her maternity dress it has the same combination of royal blue background and pink flowers as the wallpaper behind her. When she walks past the docks with Roland they are both wearing different shades of off-white - hers matches the rusting paint on the old ships, his matches the cliffs visible in the distance. When Guy and Madeleine sit next to each other outside the cafe her orange-brown clothes and even her lipstick match the door behind her while his dark brown jacket matches not only the wood behind him but also her hair - exactly the same trick we've seen when he was sitting next to the prostitute Jenny with her red dress on front of the red screen inside the other bar. We are in fantasy land here, even if it looks a little like Cherbourg. but this is all the same as the singing. To ask \"how does a poor family afford such clothes?\" or \"why is the delivery van exactly that shade of yellow?\" is to miss the point as much as to ask \"why does a shopkeeper sing to his customers?\" or \"why does it always rain when we say goodbye?\". In this movie, in this fantasy land, the world is turned upside down, the meek can inherit the earth (or at least look as if they might), small-town Cherbourg is as romantic as Paris, sailors and truck-drivers sing while they work, the poor wear clothes that money can't buy, the scenery changes colour to match your wardrobe, every man looks like a leading man, and every shop-girl truly is as beautiful as any duchess. This is \"Singing in the Rain\" set in the backroom of a shop instead of the back lot of a Hollywood studio, this is \"West Side Story\" without the violence, this is a small-town \"Moulin Rouge\", this is \"Brief Encounter\" on acid.It's not a tragic ending, any more than the endings of Casablanca or Brief Encounter are tragic. It's the right ending. We're not so much sad for Genevieve - even though we are crying - as we are happy for Roland (who deserves a break. Even though we know he's probably a crook) If we are crying its because Guy needs to hug Francoise. We expect that the marriages will work out in the end - maybe they have worked out already. If these people are not going to be happy its not because they married the wrong partners. and what other film has had hundreds of thousands of viewers in floods of tears watching an aerial shot of an Esso service station?",

I finally got to see it 40 years after its debut and it remains as fresh and enchanting as I imagined it to be. The film is quite heartbreaking because Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) did not persevere in her love for Guy. I can only imagine what pain Guy had to bear facing war in Algeria knowing his fianc\u00e9e back home was pregnant with his child and he couldn't do anything about it. The blaze of colors in the movie was a contrast to the somber atmosphere of infidelity and lost love. I suppose they both had fairly good marriages but we can gleam that they did not reach the pinnacle of joy and had to settle for second best in the end. It sort of reminded me of Elia Kazan's \"Splendor in the Grass\"--Warren Beatty's character and Natalie Wood's character--they did not \"live happily ever after\"--they just settled for second best. It is very clear that Genevieve continued to carry the memory of her lost love--otherwise she would not have made the detour to Cherbourg and meet Guy \"accidentally\"...It was such a heartbreaking scene--they meet each other after many many years and they have named their children with the same name--the name they planned to give their first-born as they made their future plans together before he leaves for his army stint. I wonder, would it still be as beautiful if it ended happily? In any case, it is one of the most unforgettable films I have ever seen. Try to get hold of the DVD copy for your collection. :-)",

When her former lover goes back they are several surprises . But when they meet once again will their love be rekindled?. A film for all the young lovers of the wide , wide world...A Valentine for All the Young Lovers of the World , in Song and Color .Pretty good musical movie considered to be a classic French movie , set in Cherbourg where the famous Umbrella Shop still exists at 13 Rue Da Port . Wonderfully evocative musical score and glamorous cinematography enhance the story . It is well set for 1957 to 1963 in Cherbourg, actual town that Jacques Demy took over for shooting . The exciting tale deals with a bittersweet and downbeat romance in which a beautiful girl falls really in love for her equally young boyfriend but both of whom are separated by his military duty in Algeria. It is divided in three parts : Depart, Absence and Le Retour. The picture is very well starred by Catherine Deneuve as the abandoned young woman who is expecting, Nino Castelnuovo as her garage mechanic lover , Marc Michel as the wealthy Roland and Ann Vernon as unfortunate but stubborn widow. This candy-colored fantasy drama to be watched in French language with subtitles, though is also available dubbed in English, but being inappropriate, no having the same effectiveness . It is followed by a similar film : \"The young girls of Rochefort\" by Jacques Demy with Catherine Deneuve, her real life sister Francois Dorleac , who a bit later on she died by car crash , George Chakiris, and Gene Kelly. It contains a colorfully brilliant cinematography by cameraman Jean Rabier, the gorgeous photography influenced really on subsequent French films , along with a marvellous soundtrack by Michael Legrand.The motion picture was original and competently directed by Jacques Demy. It won Gold Palm in Cannes Festival and Oscar nominated to best foreign film. Demy was a good French director who made all kinds of genres and getting successes in Musical ones . His first big hit was Lola . Shooting nice films as The seven deadly sins , Bay of Angels , Peau D'Ana, Una chambre en ville, A slightly pregnant man, Lady Oscar, The pied piper, Donkey skin, Parking and \"The young girls of Rochefort\" that is Demy's followup to Umbrellas of Cherbourg , it is equally an atractive and charming musical in similar style .

            "content": "This must be amongst the most distinctive, idiosyncratic and exquisite films I have seen in a long while. There is nothing particularly new about the plot, which is a straightforward and uncomplicated love story divided into three acts, but the beauty of this film is in the telling of it.All the dialogue in this film is sung, which at first is a little unsettling, but it actually takes very little time to adjust to. The verse/chorus format of popular music and the musical genre is eschewed for an approach more resembling a modern opera, as the characters croon their lines to each other over a continuous score. This gives the most banal of lines a rhythm and cadence of their own. Because of this I found the French a lot easier to understand than with more naturalistic films, which was fairly handy for me as the print I was watching was with Dutch subtitles! I must confess, I did find that the music (written by Michel Legrand) began to grate towards the end of the 87 minute running time but even so there is still much to admire here. Visually it's stunning, with a bold and vibrant colour palette of almost hallucinogenic intensity and sumptuous costume and set design (that wallpaper!). The opening credit sequence sets the mood perfectly: a birds eye view of the inhabitants of Cherbourg in the rain beneath their umbrellas as they walk across the frame is reduced to a colourful abstraction. Catherine Deneuve is predictably gorgeous and the first act of the young couples courtship is one of the most beautifully pure pieces of cinema I can think of. It reminded me a bit of 'Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris', a film which I saw in television a long time ago and would do absolutely anything to get hold of a copy. 'Les Parapluies de Cherbourg' is a wonderful, sincere and uplifting film that everyone should go and see at least once, and preferably on a big screen. Once seen, never forgotten.",

            "content": "\"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" or \"The umbrellas of Cherbourg\" is a French/West German co-production from 1964, so this one already has its 55th anniversary, which shows you how old it is. However, despite the film's age many of the people (especially actors) working on it are still alive today. This also includes the actress who played the female protagonist's mother. But first things first. The director is Jacques Demy and he also wrote the spoken/sung words and the exact plot. You can say that for him, but also many other cast and crew members, this is the defining work of their career. It is a pretty famous film. Best example is that Chazelle stated this film the main inspiration for \"La La Land\". Well, this one here may not have reached the same awards recognition like La La Land, but it sure was a big success as well and it sure is not too usual for a French film to scored no less than 5 Oscar nominations, even if it did not win a single one eventually. But also it was Oscar--nominated in two different years, which is quite an interesting achievement. It got Demy no less than three nominations and same is true for Michel Legrand, whose music truly made an impact here. And I can see why. The story was okay for sure too, but the music was the overall highlight without a doubt. Some good songs and a great soundtrack with a marvellous main theme that can be heard on several occasions and it is kinda sad, yet epic and positive at the same time I would say. It may sound a bit like fanboying, but no it really is that good and it would have been nice to see this film win an Oscar in one of the categories where Legrand and Demy were both nominated preferrably.Now as for the cast. The defining name here is of course Catherine Deneuve and she is very famous to this day unlike all her other cast members you could say. It is the story of a young woman (17 in the movie, 20 in real) who falls for a young man and gets pregnant, but before she tells him he has to leave for the army. No war or anything, there is no plot about life and death, even if one early quote made me think maybe there could be like when it was how people in certain situations only die in movies with the film making a bit fun of itself. It os pretty light frequently, but overall still a drama for the most part. Don't be confused because everybody is singing here. It's lifechanging stuff going on on many occasions. Take the male protagonist's mother for example and her ailing health. I also thought she was my favorite singer from the cast, but that is entirely subjective and everybody probably has somebody else he really likes there. I did think though that the supporting actors were usually better singers than the two in the center of the movie. But they obviously also had to do more acting, soo it's understandable they had to take other factors into account during casting. The singing only felt a bit strange early on I would say. You get used to it quickly that all the spoken language is presented via music this way, an approach that could have been pretty cringeworthy without a doubt if not executed properly, but the professional approach they took in here was just working out really well from beginning to end of this not too long 1.5-hour film. Another parallel I found interesting was how the male protagonist leaves great weather, hugging the one he loves, she constantly singing je t'aime, but when he returns, it's raining, he is alone, no joyful melodies and she is married to another man. And he finds somebody new too eventually. I actually had a feeling with the focus being on him then in the last chapter.. oh wait there are 3 chapters I must add that, the first with the two being together, the second her being alone and the final chapter what happens when he returns. So yeah, in this last chapter it would have been an unusually interesting idea to just leave her out completely. We find out she gave in to her mother's attempts to have her marry the rich guy (funny somehow how they keep singing his full name), she even moved to another city, so chances were there they would never see each other again. But eventually they do, a bit of coincidence, maybe not entirely and we have them reunite at a gas stop. Will they get the typical Hollywood ending of getting together again? Nope, Demy instead took the far more realistic approach of how things turned out and I really loved it. It was certainly among the best parts of the film what happens when the two let each other go again, he does not want to see his child, she leads a wealthy life now and they just are too different at that point. The camera moves away as we see him with his new family and we hear the beautiful soundtrack. Now that was amazing, also not everybody may see it like that, but i would definitely say it is a happy ending. I mean nobody is unhappy right? Ellen Farner is really stunning too, so certainly no loss for the male protagonist that he got her and not the mesmerizing Deneuve (I am saying this as somebody who is usually more into dark-haired girls, so it means something). Shame Farner's career was so short-lived, but at least she is still alive and hopefully having a sweet time in her senior years. Okay that is pretty much all I have to say about this movie. I think it is really worth watching and if you like musicals, then definitely give it a go. It is in color, which makes it feel a bit more modern than mid-60s. You should not expect too much comedy, even if here and there there is a bit of a moment like the mailman running gag or also the one moment when asked about her pregnancy and how it happened by her mother, the female main character answers just like it happened for everybody else with a smirky smile. Sure it is a film that wants to be taken seriously, but the good thing is it has the right to quality-wise and still in-between it offers nice little distractions from time to time, also the very first scene really with the guys at work. All in all, no hesitation for me to give this a thumbs-up. See it with your loved one.",

            "review_title": "The Tears of Cherbourg...",
            "content": "Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\", Golden Palm winner of 1964, is a deliberately simple and straight-forward story sublimated by the music, I guess that's a way to put it simply.Still, I was never in a rush to watch this film, forgive my bias but the premise of one hour and half of all-singing made me expect some syrupy nothing-specialness \u00e0 la \"New Wave\" sauce that I couldn't take seriously. I thought I would endure the film more than experience it. And to be fair, it's hard to get used to the all singing 'gimmick' (for lack of a better word) at first and the opening make you wonder if it's not unconsciously intended as a sort of spoof but the film finds a way to set its tone, making the singing a sort of natural background, allowing you to focus more on the story.First, there are the first notes of Michel Legrand's penetrative score (the \"I Will Wait For You\" theme) that started to resonate during the opening credits. I knew I heard that tune before and then it hit me, \"Jurassic Bark\", poor Seymour waiting for Fry... \"I Will Wait For You\", one of the saddest melodies ever, that was meant to be used for the saddest TV moment ever. Now, knowing that it came from Michel Legrand and that it would be the defining theme of the film made me realize that in terms of emotions, \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" 'meant business', and within the right context and served by the right lyrics, the score reached unsuspected levels of poignancy.Secondly, when the film starts in a jazzy upbeat mood, there's an exchange between Guy, the mechanic played by Nino Castelnuovo and his friend about their plans for Friday night. The friend says he doesn't like operas, all the singing gets on his nerves, he prefers movies. What can you say after that? Such a line so early in the film can't be innocent, this is Jacques Demy's anticipating the natural resistance of some viewers, toward what can be perceived as a gimmick. Demy basically tells us that even movies can work like operas and that maybe this film can help us to consider singing as a language as adequate to film-making as facial expressions in a silent movie.In fact, it's not exactly singing buy lip-syncing with other professional singer's voices (which is a wise choice because I can't imagine these melodies with amateur singers) but progressively, the musicality becomes such a natural aspect of the movie that any line said without any melodic intonation surprisingly rings false. The music becomes part of the background, and in total osmosis with the art-direction, the costumes, the photography. If you pay attention to the way some women's dresses always fit the patterns or colors behind, you're tempted to interpret that as a foreshadowing of their chameleonic nature, their superhuman capability to adapt to any situation or predicament in their lives.The visual delights also lay on the depiction of Cherbourg which, depending on the season, the weather or the general mood, can be either cheerful or depressing. One day, the two lovers dance a mambo behind the red walls of a nightclub, it's red, passionate, lively, and the day after, they're in a depressing and neutrally grey train station saying goodbye to each other. Even a cute and cozy little umbrella shop can become a cold and depressing washing-machines' stores. The film is as competent in conveying emotions through visual than musical delights, but the raw core is still the romance between Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve played by a beautiful and young Catherine Deneuve, without it, this would have been one of these 'all flash and no substance' film. (Spoilers in Next Paragraph)The story isn't a revolution, two young enamored people make plans for the future then comes the call of duty, they have one last night together, promise to wait for each other ignoring that the \"harm is done\" already and then there's the absence, the separation, and throughout her pregnancy, Genevi\u00e8ve is courted by a providential rich man named Roland Cassard (Marc Michel) which she finally marries, so her baby can have a father. When he's back, Guy is wounded physically before being hurt emotionally, he sinks in bitterness and alcohol before being rescued by his friend Madeleine, they marry and have a child. Finally, a few years after, the former lovers meet in an Esso station and the film concludes with the right notes of realism, foreshadowed by Genevieve's mother (Anne Vernon) who said that times fix everything and only in movies, people die from love. If I wasn't so emotionally overwhelmed by that ending and how daring it was to contradict the then-romantic tropes, I would have kept thinking of a certain movie that almost won Best Picture last year. I just wish I saw Demy's \"Umbrellas\" before Damien Chazelle's \"La La Land\". Now I know where he got the inspiration, it's all to his credit to revive the magic of this classic for a contemporary tale, but now I see the ending less as a masterstroke of originality than a well made homage to Jacques Demy. The last time I had a similar regret is when I discovered Fellini after Kusturica's \"Undeground\", another Golden Palm winner.So, what I loved about \"The Umbrellas of Cherboug\" is how misleading it actually is, these jazzy musical interludes, the playful way characters recite their lines by singing, you wouldn't believe this film would be so dark and so realistically bold, dealing with pregnancy, financial problems, not much war traumas than the disillusion of homecoming soldiers and of course, broken hearts. It's like a strawberry-flavor candy with a lemon bittersweet taste in the end. The film is well-made, well-edited, and well-written. Of course, the singing can get on people's heads but hey, the film is one hour and twenty something minutes long, it's not too much patience demanding.And the final minutes will reward your patience anyway, listening to it, I know why Michel's name is Legrand.",

The film boasts one of the most beautiful colour palettes ever seen on the screen, right from the opening scene of umbrellas in primary colours rushed by anonymous people through a rainstorm.And the film has the young Catherine Deneuve. She is of course as luminous and colourful as her surroundings. As Genevieve, her love affair with Guy represents the first part of the the film, the second and third parts following each of them exclusively.

It is such a beautiful movie, in the gorgeous music- one of my favourite movie musical scores actually-, the colourful visuals, the charming and touching(if slightly convoluted occasionally)story and Catherine Deneuve at her most irresistible. And it is also a unique one, not only in the sparkling sung dialogue but in how it's sung too, it always surprises me at how interesting the singing is and how the singing is done. The cast are uniformly excellent, though it is Deneuve that makes The Umbrellas of Cherbourg so good, the film moves quickly and the direction is sharp.

Just as a warning, it may leave you tingly at the end and humming the main song \"I Will Wait for You\" for days. All of the dialogue being sung seemed a little gimmicky early on, but it ultimately works, giving the film a lightness and charm. The acting isn't affected by it either and is solid throughout; look for Catherine Deneuve in the scenes where she truly looks distraught. Director Jacques Demy hits us with bright, bold colors in scene after scene, and the sets seem artificial but dreamlike. He also captures some really nice images amidst all that visual pop. When the young woman (Deneuve) and her mother (Anne Vernon) are wondering if her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) is in danger fighting in Algiers, we see joyous street partying outside during Carnival, and I liked how subtly he did this. My favorite though was the shot at the gas station, with him in the background, out of focus, but clearly staring at her, which was just wonderful. The film hits us emotionally by reminding us of young love and those big moments that may send us down a very different set of tracks in life. There is a sadness in thinking what might have been, but also a resilience and strength in moving forward, which really hit home.",

I had liked Jacques Demy movies in the past so I had no doubt about it that I would like this movie as well but what I didn't expected was that this was an actual musical. Something that Jacques Demy had never done before.And not just any musical; this movie has only sung dialog in it. It's a non-stop musical, in which even everyday lines like 'hello' and 'is the tea ready' get sung. This was something i really had to get used to and to be frank, I also didn't really liked watching the movie at first and probably also wouldn't had liked it by the end (at least not as much as everyone else seems to), were it not for its story.Of course it has a sweet romantic story in it but what I especially like about it is that it really isn't a standard formulaic one. Even though the movie looks very bright and cheerful, the story is actually quite dramatic and also doesn't progresses in a way that you would expect from a romantic musical. You expect the two main characters to remain together, no matter what all of the obstacles are and what people opposing them throw in their way. But the movie really doesn't pick a standard approach and also lets its characters do some unexpected things, which all really makes this movie original and also really unique of its sort.Once you really start thinking about it and start analyzing the movie you'll notice how big the contrast actually is between the movie its look and atmosphere and its actual story. But somehow these two completely opposing things strengthen each other and make the movie work on all kinds of different levels. It works as a charming and happy, harmless movie, as well as a more dramatic and heartfelt one.But it remain mostly the visuals of the movie that stick with people. It's an incredibly bright movie, using deliberately bright colors for mostly the movie its backgrounds. And yes, the movie is visually impressive to look at and features some nice camera-work as well. It just only seems to make people forget what a great story \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" actually does has in it.Just stick with it, even if you don't like it at first.

            "content": "Okay, here's a superficial smart-ass take on this entry: We're in a French port, there's a guy who loves a gal and a gal who loves him right back, arguably she loves him just a tad more than he loves her. He goes away for a couple of years but not without leaving her pregnant. There's an older guy, richer guy in love with her for whom until now she had no time. She levels about her situation and he marries her anyway and raises the child as his own. Now, hands up all those who said 'That's \"Marius\" by Marcel Pagnol, the first part of his great trilogy'. While you're wiping the egg off your faces I'll try a less frivolous take. IF Pagnol had been born in the North instead of the South of France it's just feasible that he may have written a story set in the Northern French port of Cherbourg, called his male protagonist Guy and not Marius, had him conscripted into the army for his obligatory two years National Service spent in Algeria and called his female protagonist Genvieve instead of Fanny. Jacques Demy may well have had Marius in mind albeit subconsciously when he wrote and directed The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg - and it was, incidentally, just about the same time that Harold Rome wrote the words and music for a condensed and musical version of Pagnol's trilogy which, as 'Fanny' was produced on Broadway by David Merrick - but nobody creates in a vacuum and Demy has come up with a charming, not to say enchanting movie. How referential it actually is can be left to the quasi-academic pseuds but it might be worth noting in passing Demy's self-referential nod to his earlier equally romantic movie 'Lola' in which the character of Roland Cossard (played here by the same actor, Marc Michel) was the protagonist in love with Anouk Aimee's eponymous Lola, the background music was also by Michel Legrand whose main love theme turns up again here. Younger viewers will most likely be unaware of the two half-decent lyrics that were written for the two main themes of Umbrellas and enjoyed no little success as respectively 'I Will Wait For You' and 'Watch What Happens' and those who DO remember will marvel at the banality of Demy's original words - 'lyrics' may be stretching it. It might be interesting to discover which came first, Demy's pedestrian words or Legrand's lush melodies. It's fun at that to imagine Legrand, faced with something like 'pass the salt', 'it looks like a nice day', 'the girls are wearing their hair shorter this year', etc and coming up with those gorgeous melodies (I'd rather not dwell on the opposite). Ultimately this is a movie it's hard not to like, from the muted pastels, reminiscent of Les Grands Manouvres, to the Audrey Hepburn-lite sub-Givenchy outfits worn by Deneuve and Ann Vernon as her mother. Cynics may say that it's just one large chocolate-box full of soft centres and they'd have a point but it's not too long and it does offer both entertainment and escape.",

            "content": "Considering La La Land is one of my all-time favorite films, surely I have to see the film that inspired it, right? The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a beautiful and melodramatic take on a French romance in musical form. Just as it was the case with La La Land, I have a feeling this film will get better on repeated viewings. With every word sung, and in a different language, sometimes it's difficult to follow what is being said and what the emotional intentions are of each word. Watching romances in another language is always a fascinating experiment. On one hand, you could say that the language doesn't ultimately matter because what is meant is often shown through facial expressions. But at the same time, not being familiar with the native language can make it difficult to understand the exact tone of each spoken word. After all, how do we really know how well the actors can act if you aren't familiar to their language?With all that said, there's no escaping the beauty to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Jacques Demy crafted this story in such a unique way, through imagery and framing devices. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo resemble last year's Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone by being an honest and charismatic couple that you can root for. Just the pure emotion that both of them pour into their characters is admiring. Only, I wish we did get to see a little more of them doing things together, instead of just gush over each other through song after song.Getting lost in the music, colorful imagery, and dreamy sequences are probably why this film became so popular, and further inspired La La Land. Although nothing really compares to the latter, 'Umbrellas' works on other levels because it's a contained, quiet, and sincere love story told through beautifully arranged musical numbers. This is one for the ages.8.6/10",

            "content": "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg was a film that screened in a modern European film class at my old college. This is the ideal setting to see the film (even if, as happened to me, the teacher talked and laughed incessantly throughout), since it's the kind of movie that transcends the academia setting and just lets you escape into the clouds in terms of a cinematic experience. The funny thing about the film, directed by the inimitable Jacques Demy, is that it's not entirely a \"light\" story, but it's told and expressed in such a way that you can't help but smile from first frame to last. Not every line of dialog sung clicks, but most of them do, strongly, and what would otherwise be a very sad story is elevated to a pure melodrama beat.There's credit obviously due to Michael Legrand, who has to be as painstakingly detailed in his movements with the notes and beats as does the director. Whereas if the lines and emotion were delivered as in reality, there wouldn't be a lot of hubub and sentimentality. But Legrand and Demy latch on to exactly what makes it sentimental and gives it uplift and pathos. At the same time in the story of Genevieve and Guy's romance, and the downers of unplanned pregnancy and Guy's induction to the army, is told with some humor mixed in with the drama, Demy films it as if he wants to make every color bounce off into the audience. It's the direction, not so much the story, that should garner attention for most film buffs, as it embraces color film in the same mold as did the Hollywood directors when color could first be utilized to beautiful effect in the 40s and 50s. Its subversive quality as an opera is conflated by it being very basic and very alive in every moment.But wait, what about Catherine Deneuve in her debut? If you don't see her appeal here, right before she broke out as a huge star with Repulsion and Belle de jour among many other classic or not so classic films of the 60s, then you never will. This is Deneuve with a light but totally affecting beauty, delicate enough that she can be loved (for lack of a better or more accurate description) by the camera; she looks and is very young here, and it serves the character and the story while cementing her own iconic status. Other actors like Nino Castelnuovo Anne Vernon fare well, but if there's a reason more people watch the film today it's for Deneuve, and maybe for the bright colors and ironically sunny music. 9.5/10",

If anything, this movie encapsulates in its purest form what a musical motif can do. Remove the soundtrack from the final scene and what would you have. But include it as the final and most intense instrumental reprise of a song we've already come to understand, and you have one of the greatest endings ever filmed.This movie is wonderful. There's a very archetypal simplicity to the plot, such that a lesser filmmaker could have used the same story to create something quite forgettable and dull. Demy takes such a mundane story, however, and with a splash of candy color and expertly arranged music manages to craft a timeless, heartrending masterpiece.It's a short film. Don't miss it!",

Um, no thanks! But it came on after a movie that I _was_ watching, and I was elsewhere in the house and didn't bother turning of the TV, and on came \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\". About 10 minutes into it, I found myself loving the music. The French was so beautiful, and the voices were so clear and melodic. I went back into the TV room and rewound the movie to the beginning (thank you Tivo!) and watched the entire thing. It was just that captivating! The music, the singing, the bold colors, the attractive actors, the sweet and sad story ... it all hooked me and reeled me in. I would imagine this is a film that you'd either love or hate, as it's so \"out there\" style-wise.The story is told simply -- not simplistically, but simply. Like with a good silent film, we don't need tons of dialogue to understand what's going on -- we can supply the details and the emotions ourselves, and that makes us part of the picture ourselves, not just mere observers. I felt that somewhat with Umbrellas as well -- the singing dialogue briefly touches on the underlying emotions, and we fill that in with our own experience and emotions. And of course helping with this is the music, which has its own language and touches you in places words can't reach or describe. I found the whole \"conceit\" of the movie to be quite effective, and not gimmicky at all ... it was a genuine, artistic, and powerful means of conveying an all-too common story and making it so much more.

            "review_title": "Stirs echo at the bottom of music",
            "content": "Demy challenged himself in a simple way here; portray an ordinary life of hindrance and difficulty as we might know it, so a melodramatic plot about a love affair that is quashed by distance, and layer this through the desire to flow to a further distance than just hurt; release.So he makes opera, the plot is fully sang, colors are fierce and bright in celebration of a life that we would like to be in this other way, more musical than it is and yet this desirous life breaks down on the way. None of this interest me overmuch, that is to say as artifice. But it achieves an airy feel; French is such an airy language, full of vowels, unlike the marching sounds from the other side of the Rhein. It grants the cinematic breath free passage.Oh there are melodramatic obstructions the characters face, obstacles in the path of love - the girl's beau has to spend two years in Algeria in the army, there's a lot of dismay over absence, his at first, hers when he gets back. But even more important is the evocative finale where they meet again after years one night, these last two minutes are everything; there could be friction, recrimination, ego and drama, but the film lets go, grants free passage.Indeed if you decide to track this it shouldn't be just for mellifluous song and bright colors, mere aesthetics; it should be also to contemplate release in the last gesture. Demy does it as best he can without a transcendent tradition to work from, which the French don't have.But something lingered in mind after watching. How much release is there, or how much drama that goes unspoken and is carried after they part? No clear answer other than what you embody of course.But see now. The film is an extension of a previous one by Demy, Lola. The protagonist there returns as a character here, there are other parallels. Previous knowledge isn't required of course. But the choice, to deliberately echo things we may have known from a previous life (if only we have lived through that previous life), factors in what we're saying, about drama - internal narrative - that continues to echo.And more tantalizing is to note how a third film, Le Bonheur, annotates this one and the last scene, made by the wife of Demy, Agnes Varda, obviously inspired by the work of her husband and released a year later. It's not a scholarly connection I'm after; here we have work by soulmates for whom love and romance were things they shared in life, not tropes. In Bonheur we see a husband and wife who could be the boy and girl of this one had everything worked out, whose married life is as blissful as the romance here hoped to materialize. Both films are about happiness and betrayal. Even more pertinently; both are about distance, empty space, in which internal narrative begins to form.Here every emotion is externalized in earnest, the distance is explicit; he goes away to Algeria, she to Paris. There, every emotion is externalized too - by the man - and yet the distance is implicit, masterfully so, in the women keeping silent. Varda creates empty space in which we pour our internal narrative of betrayal and come to disbelieve our senses; hauntingly rendered as an ambiguous scene of death that viewers anxious for certainty interpret unambiguously.Varda goes beyond but in my eyes the inspiration is founded on Demy's marvelous last scene where everything - we presume - is let go of; except all that lingers and you carry in life only you'll know. For a few nights of marvelous introspection you will see this together with Lola and Le Bonheur.",

            "review_title": "Excellent musical",
            "content": "A wonderful musical film from Jacques Demy. Set in a fantasy Cherbourg (a French seaside town famous for its rainy weather) during the late 50s and going on for several years, it consists in three acts. First act: Genevieve (a very young Catherine Deneuve) is a teenager living with her mother, with whom she works in a shop that sells umbrellas. She fells in love with Guy (a car mechanic, played by Nino Castelnuovo), who is only a little older than she is. Her mother opposes the romance, as she sees Genevieve as too young and Guy as too poor. Guy is drafted to the Algerian war for two years, but not before leaving Genevieve pregnant. Act two: Genevieve's mother not only has now an unwed pregnant daughter, but the financial situation of her shop is dire. Fortunately for her, a diamond dealer in love with Genevieve agrees to pay her debts. He wants to marry Genevieve (despite being pregnant with other man), and eventually Genevieve will agree. Third Act: Guy returns from the war with a limp in one of his legs. He goes to Genevieve's shop, but sees that mother and daughter have gone. He becomes bitter, is soon fired from his job. His beloved aunt dies, and after that, he marries her caretaker, Madeleine. With his aunt's legacy, he is able to buy a gas station. He and Madeleine have a boy. Final Scene: Christmas Eve. Genevieve, now married and with a daughter, arrives with her car to Guy's gas station. Surprised to see each other, they decide to go inside the station to talk, but they both soon realize that their relationship belongs to the past. She goes away, and soon Madeleine and their boy arrive, and they celebrate Christmas by throwing each other snow balls. End of movie. All this is done through sung lines (rather than songs proper). It's an extremely entertaining and amazingly fluid movie, despite not having the traditional happiness of musical movies. Demy tried to repeat the magic a few years later with Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (also with Deneuve), but he couldn't; that's a much weaker movie. Only quibble with Cherbourg: Isn't the constant product placement for Esso a bit too much?",

Nino Castelnuovo is very good as Guy, particularly in the first part, where his portrayal of unalloyed joy is wonderful. I love the scene with his aunt before he goes to the theatre. I'm surprised this film did not make him a star. Perhaps he was unlucky to have Deneuve as his co-star.Genevi\u00e8ve's mother (Anne Vernon) is fabulous, and so is Roland Cassard (Marc Michel) who does a great job as the tentative and kind substitute husband.

            "content": "Young love becomes thwarted by circumstances out of their control in Jacques Demy's musical masterpiece THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, and released at the bracket of years when Hollywood was turning out behemoths like MY FAIR LADY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, and MARY POPPINS, among others, this one remains the most experimental of them all. Where the traditional musical features pauses in between songs and have energetic dance numbers (a style Demy would exercise in his companion piece THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT) UMBRELLAS is about as close as anyone can get to an opera without having trained singers a la Maria Callas and Placido Domingo ever appear. All the lines are sung (dubbed by singers who replace the actors). As it is, it predates EVITA by thirty years, and is most important in succeeding in its innovative style. Another crucial difference between UMBRELLAS and its American counterparts is the fact that despite the explosion of color from all sides, it's a fairly tragic affair; a sad story that at times becomes heart-wrenching, particularly in two key moments: when Genevieve says good-bye to Guy at the Cherbourg train station, and when they finally meet up again years later, both clearly changed individuals who have set up families with a vague remembrance of a lost chance at love and happiness. Even so, it's not a depressing movie: UMBRELLAS simply doesn't decide to go overboard with an delusional attitude towards love and relationships -- that would happen in YOUNG GIRLS, where the movie would shriek out the longing and the exuberance that is absent in the former. Young love sows its seeds, even when the parties involved may have to part ways. This film marked a breakthrough for Catherine Deneuve who at age 20 is ethereal and luminous and nobly suffers throughout the entire story; after this she would set forth a career that continues alive today.",

The accolades awarded this remarkable achievement have been duly expressed. I can only concur and sing this film's praises, too.  It is a one-of-a-kind work, with all elements of the production uniting into a masterpiece.\nLegrand's score weaves its through-composed themes utilizing leitmotifs, recurring patterns, Faure-like harmonic designs, and structural forms into a hypnotic flow.  His recitatives are perfectly blended into the rich texture, and move naturally and beautifully, recalling such ingenious French opera realizations as Bizet.  Yet, Legrand's main songs are likewise woven into the score, like arias--haunting in their simplicity and sweetness.  The singers on the soundtrack are excellent, and the choice of actors to match the vocal work is done to perfection.  Nowhere in the annals of cinema can one find a work like this lovely creation.  Thanks to the painstaking task of restoration, all can once again thrill to the original French version of \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\"",

While this style could be expected to be under threat of being too sweet, the film avoids this by approaching sentimentality with heart-wrenching reality, which the musical aspect of the film highlights. It's a love story. And the film is aware that it begins as a movie love story, addressed by the fact that the protagonist genuinely expects to die if they are parted. Instead of dying, the film explores one of my favourite deep subjects in art, by comparing the expectations of love brought on by pop culture with the harsh reality without being overdramatic. It's nostalgic and extremely genuine.As expected, the omnipresent music is absolutely wonderful and can speak for the film's emotion even without translation. How they managed to fit in the dialogue so fluently is incredible, let alone perform it. The set decoration and costume design is another highlight as well, with bright and bold colours, which the sweeping camera movement compliments perfectly. Despite the broad story, the film is surprisingly small scale with a limited use of sets, but the colour palette makes the world feel huge. There's some incredible use of match cuts as well. Though this film has a fantastic and charming atmosphere, it's the simple and effective storytelling that makes it, particularly the heartbreaking and subtle end. Bona fide classic.9/10",

Basically seventeen year old Genevi\u00e8ve Emery (Catherine Deneuve) lives in an umbrella shop in Cherbourg with her widowed mother Madame Emery (Anne Vernon), and she is secretly in love with twenty year old auto mechanic Guy Foucher (Nino Castelnuovo), and the two of them want to get married. She reveals this to her mother however, and she objects thinking that her daughter is too young and that he is not mature and well-established enough, and he may be required to do military service, and shortly later he is sent to Algeria after being drafted to serve in the war, but before leaving he and Genevi\u00e8ve consummate their love. Following this Genevi\u00e8ve is pregnant, while he is away he hardly communicates and they have drifted apart, so she listens to her mother's strong encouragement to accept a marriage proposal from Roland Cassard (Marc Michel) (he previously appeared as the same character in the film Lola), the affluent gem dealer who is in love with her and promises to bring her child up as his own. Guy is discharged from service before his two year term is up due to being wounded, he returns home and finds out Genevi\u00e8ve is married with a child and has moved away, and following this he sinks into deep depression and anger, which he struggles to control. But Guy recovers from his state when he falls in love and married young Madeleine (Ellen Farner) who had been caring for his aunt \u00c9lise (Mireille Perrey), who is now deceased, and she left him an inheritance which he uses to fulfil his ambition to open a service station. Years pass, and Genevi\u00e8ve, who is now discernibly wealthy, has returned home with Fran\u00e7oise (Rosalie Varda), her and Guy's daughter, and have an accidental meeting at his service station, their short conversation is obviously filled with unuttered fondness and regret, and in the end they finally part ways. Also starring Jean Champion as Aubin and Harald Wolff as Monsieur Dubourg. Deneuve is beautiful and gives a great delicate performance as the young woman longing for love from one man until fate changes everything, Castelnuovo is interesting as the man who is in and out of her life, and Michel is likable as the wealthy man with good intentions. The story is relatively simple, complicated romance, but what makes this musically distinctive is that every scene has singing, from the most mundane conversations to emotionally charging moments every word is spoken and sun in tune, and the picture has good use of vivid colour and design as well, it is a fantastic musical. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for \"I Will Wait for You\", Best Original Music for Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy, Best Music Adaptation or Treatment for Michel Legrand, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen for Demy and Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film.

            "content": "As I sat down to watch this movie, I did not expect to like it. First of all, it is the worst kind of foreign film, which is to say, it is French. I won't elaborate. You are either with me on this or you are not.Then I discovered it is a musical. I like musicals well enough, but when I realized that every line of dialogue was going to be sung throughout, I groaned. One of the great improvements of Hollywood musicals over operas is that in the former, ordinary dialogue is merely spoken, whereas in operas, everything is sung relentlessly, even if it is just a husband asking his wife, \"What's for dinner?\" There are a couple of real songs in the movie, but by the time it got to them, I was a little worn out from all the singing that preceded.Finally, the story promises to be a clich\u00e9. Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve want to get married. However, he is drafted to fight the war in Algeria. On his last night before leaving, they make love. And you know what that means. When a woman in a movie has sex with a man just once, she gets pregnant. We then figure that either Guy will forget about her and fall in love with someone else, or he will be killed in the war. Either that, or she will be so desperate about covering up the shame of her pregnancy that she will marry someone else.Much to my amazement, I actually became engrossed in this movie, especially when the story went against my expectations. After only four months, Genevi\u00e8ve starts to forget about Guy. She says it feels as though he has been gone for years, and that she is losing the feeling she had for him. She has to look at his picture to remember what he looks like. It is true that she has only received one letter from him in four months, but you have to figure that a man fighting a war might not have the luxury of writing regularly (in fact, he is wounded by a grenade).And so she ends up marrying another man. The movie could have given her the standard motive of a woman desperate to cover up the shame of her pregnancy, but it does not. Neither she nor her mother seems unduly concerned about the matter. And in the one letter she receives from Guy, he writes that he is looking forward to coming home after his military service is over, marrying her, and seeing their child. It is unlikely that she would have married the other man had she not been pregnant, but we still get the sense that her decision to opt for a marriage of convenience was made possible by the brute fact that her love for Guy had faded.Before Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve separate, they sing the song we in America are familiar with as \"I Will Wait for You.\" The lyrics in the movie are a bit different, but the thrust is the same. The two lovers express their undying love for each other. It reminds me of the movie \"Oliver\" (1968), in which Nancy sings the song \"As Long as He Needs Me,\" referring to her lover Bill, who has no need for her at all, and ends up murdering her. We have a similar irony with the song \"I Will Wait for You.\" Although the lyrics in the American version of the song say, \"If it takes forever, I will wait for you,\" Genevi\u00e8ve does not even manage to wait more than four months. But the movie does not condemn her. It merely states the cold truth about love, that it creates an illusion that it will last forever, and then simply dissipates, despite our efforts to hold on to it.Guy eventually returns to find that Genevi\u00e8ve has married another man. Eventually, he marries too. When Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve finally meet again by accident, we see that they still have feelings for each other, but it is more a feeling of a love that was lost than of a love that still is.",

            "content": "The first time I rented this movie, I fell asleep. I was not ready for singing gas station attendance in an absurd world of extreme colors. The one thing I picked up from that partial viewing was that this movie was unique.Years later I gave Umbrellas a second chance...knowing what I was in store for. Once I got past that 'god this is silly' feeling, the movie started to grow on me. The movie kind of meanders with trite situations, almost setting the story up for three peak moments: ***SPOILERS*** The first masterpiece scene is of course \"I Will Wait For You\". The song is beautiful, and by this time in the movie you're perfectly willing to accept the fact that the couple can 'glide' down the street...they don't need to walk, they're in love.The second great scene is the closing of Act One at the Train Station. I love the fact that it's short and without the overkill Shakespearian dialog. \"My Love\" and \"I love you\"...simple and painful.The ending of this movie may very well be the best ending to a movie ever. Part of it's brilliance is that it just comes out from nowhere...December 1963 is the only warning. It looks like another random scene at the gas station, then a car rolls up and that familiar music begins to play (it's like the music to Jaws...you just know something is about to happen.) The tension is as thick as any war or action movie...I mean just the guy asking what type of gas she wanted was stressful. It's perfect, probably because it seems so real (and they're still singing that crazy dialog.) This movie is not for all taste. But if you can get into it, it's magic. I've seen the movie now over 10+ times...it's sickening how it grows on you.",

It tells a very simple story of love lost but not forgotten in such enchanting, unusual, and ambitious way with such delightful results that no other musical or romance was able to achieve since. The beauty of the film lies in the unique combination of color and sound. Every word is sung with no spoken dialogs, and every scene has perfect harmony in colors with the clothes of the characters matching the interiors and exteriors of the sets. The movie made a superstar out of 20 years old Catherine Denueve as teenager Genevieve, a girl madly in love with Guy (Nino Castelnuovo), a garage mechanic. I have not seen the film for long time and should admit that while re-watching it last night, for the first ten or 15 minutes, I had some doubts and reservations about constant music and singing that make The Umbrellas of Cherbourg more of the filmed opera than a musical. But the more I watched, the more I became overwhelmed by its kind and sweet tenderness and I enjoyed with all my heart the unique romantic delight.",

All the dialogue is sung with no spoken words.After a sixth viewing, I still find this to be one of the most charming and endearing films ever made. Jacques Demy does great work as a director especially during the opening credits. (Yes, back then, opening credits were mandatory in every film.) He ably creates a mood of genuine melancholy especially in the end of the first of three sections as well as the finale. He is greatly assisted with the superb music of Michel Legrand. Some songs are brilliant especially \"I Will Wait For You\". When this song is used in the film's saddest moments with loud orchestrations, it's hard to restrain the emotions.The film covers many other themes including bankruptcy, terminal illness, social climbing, war drafts, and other forms of heartbreak. With a final image of an Esso gas station on a snowy night, the film ends on a perfect note. One to be treasured. - dbamateurcritic\nRating: 10 out of 10Notable Achievments:1) Directing by Jacques Demy\n2) Music by Michel Legrand",

Essentially an opera, it depicts the romance of some young French people in the late '50s and early '60s.What caught my eye about it - and was apparently the case with most of Jacques Demy's movies - was the use of color. Almost every scene features some stark color, often involving people's clothes and the walls. It reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies that way.I don't know if I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but it IS an impressive piece of work. And damned if Catherine Deneuve isn't a real babe here! I recommend it just so that you can appreciate the work that they put into it.As for the part about the man having to fight in Algeria, I recommend reading about the atrocities committed by the French army there, and also watch \"The Battle of Algiers\".",

In a category all by itself, this admittedly flimsy narrative has remained a perennial favourite, partly for its swooningly lovely music and for its moving, tear-jerking qualities.

Also the music does create interesting mix of jazz, instrumental and classical tunes, which are merged with the spoken language of the characters.The characters of the movie reveal tragic social changes in lives due to different social status (mechanic, the daughter of the lone mother, the jeweler who had tragic love affair, the ill old woman). On the one hand it looks that the love affair of the mechanic and young daughter is romantic, bears resemblance to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet story, but on the other hand it is shown that young people do not have patience to fight for their love ignoring social status, money. Because of that it is shown that young people suffer.The work of the film director, and other people is interesting to watch because of different camera angles, very colorful interior of the houses, and atypical for the French or American musical end of the love story.A musical worth watching and thinking about the message.",

I remember that I thought the singing dialogue was weird at first, but after a very short while, it appeared natural, and I didn't think about it anymore.

I remember how the wonderful tune of the main character touched my heart and stayed with me ever since.I only saw the movie again a few days ago. So many films from the 50's and 60's loose their magic when you see them again after many years. Not so with Les Parapluies de Cherbourg! The dialogue is not quaint like so often felt. Perhaps, the singing dialogue keeps it forever young. The words ring true and fresh like ever. The dilemma of love and life is present as a real and forever relevant question. The acting is subtle and discrete, underplayed almost, free of theatrical overacting and dramatization. The music is amazing.

Not because it's French- some of my favorite movies are French (THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, BELLE DE JOUR, JULES ET JIM, SMALL CHANGE). That was because every line in this film is sung, something that made me love and hate EVITA. Watching it, I discovered one of the most lovely and beautiful films ever made, and also one of the most realistic musicals. If the characters talked instead of singing, this would still be a great film. But the music adds a charming, irresistible atmosphere that is never cheap or schmaltzy. Deneuve never looked better as the girl whose passion for a young man suffers all kinds of trouble. The ending will make some people cry, but naturally.

In fact, this actually made this beautiful movie more of a treat. With severe hearing loss and trouble keeping up with rapid fire dialogue and captions, I found the movie a positive change from many reality shows that totally ignore the need for some of us in the viewing audience to hear clearly. The story is about a lovely young woman, played by Catherine Deneuve, who works with her mother in an umbrella shop in the wet, coastal climate of Cherbourg in France. Deneuve's character is wooed by two men who are literally too good to be true. Her first love is sidelined for two years when called up for military service. This absence results in another suitor who has more money and is just as sincere but he cannot replace her first love. Needless to say, circumstances change. How will it play out? Without giving anything away, it ends very naturally. With this movie, I can appreciate the satisfaction that comes from taking time to catch up with a little gem from the past.

Demy shows an impressive restrain of not including any fiddly,overly complicated words,but to instead go for something much more brilliantly simplistic,that allows the viewing to be completely caught,in the pure joy of Genevieve and Cassard's dates.Sharing almost every scene with each other for the first half the film, the beautiful Catherine Deneuve and Marc Michel each give splendid performances that perfectly compliment each other,with Deneuve showing Genevieve to have stars in her eyes every time she looks at Cassard,whilst Michel shows Roland to be someone who desperately wants to see the same stars that Genevieve does,but is sadly unable to get away from the harsh reality taking place around them.",

The film is slickly divided into three parts: departure, absence and return, Guy is mandatorily drafted in the army in 1958, two lovers have to be split for two years. In the second act, told in Genevi\u00e8ve's perspective, she is pregnant with Guy's baby, but gradually persuaded by her mother to marry an affluent man Roland Cassard (Michel) and they left Cherbourg after the wedlock; and in the third act, Guy returns from the war, becomes despondent of Genevi\u00e8ve's betrayal, but life must go on, he inherits some fortune from \u00c9lise and marries Madeleine, and they have a boy named Fran\u00e7ois.Years later, they inadvertently meet at the gas station owned by Guy, Genevi\u00e8ve is accompanied by their young daughter Fran\u00e7oise, always the most awkward reunion for two former lovers, the film ends in a more rational note when they gingerly trade conversations, leaving too many unsaid undertones flowing torrentially, and a timely farewell is a befitting coda to the lingering blues. The story may be a bit sad and nondescript, but the biggest asset is its varicolored locale settings, costumes and coiffure \u00e0 la mode, even for the not-so-rich protagonists. Guy's brown suit ill-matches his black shoe, nevertheless his azure and pink shirts are divine, as for Denueve and Vernon, the daughter-mother pair dominates the show every time with their distinctive flair for haute couture and color compatibility.Also, let's not forget it is an out-and-out musical, singing voices are all dubbed at post- production nevertheless, French is already mellifluous in speaking, so the singing part sounds like an unremitting bombardment of chansons, which inconveniently degrades into monotony soon after, thus it does demand a more tonality-friendly ear to revel in the excessiveness, after all, it is a love letter to the sentimental romantics, a lovely treat for eyeballs and eardrums equally.",

            "content": "A quick bit of personal history: I first saw this in May 1996 theatrically, in a newly-restored print. It was about a month after breaking up a 6-year relationship which I didn't want to end, though I should have. She was probably the least-romantic person I've ever met - not that she didn't have \"romantic\" notions in the larger sense, nearly everyone does, but the romantic part of relationships she didn't get. Or her idea of romance was just so remote and unexplainable that I could never figure it out, and she could never have told me. Why 6 years, I'll never know. She probably hated this film. I, on the other hand, am as enraptured by it now as I was on that first viewing 13 years ago and the couple of times in between. From the first shot of the harbor of Cherbourg panning gracefully down to an overhead shot of candy-colored umbrellas in the rain, to the final mirroring shot of an equally artificial-looking Esso station in the snow five years later, it's pure sentimental, stylized magic. Some have mentioned that there isn't much in the way of character development in this admittedly very simple story of young lovers parted by war and ultimately finding new relationships and lives apart from each other - but I think they're missing the point. It's not supposed to be terribly real, or rather it is suffused throughout with a sense of heightened reality, exemplified most obviously in the entirely sung dialog and in the brightness of the color scheme, but also in the intensity of emotions that could, after all, be experienced by any of us. It doesn't matter that I don't really \"know\" Genevi\u00e8ve or Guy - they are any young lovers and what the film is about, it seems to me, is that bittersweet feeling we all have towards our first loves. At the end of the film, both are married and it is fairly clear that they have made the right choices - one thing I find fascinating is that the two leads are both rather weak and passive, and in both cases they end up with stronger, more aggressive and more competent partners. Had they ended up with each other, what kind of future would they have had? The music - well, you can't take the music out, or it does, in fact, show its thinness. Here's a great quote from Jonathan Rosenbaum's long review regarding composer Michel Legrand's contribution to the film: \"Though Legrand isn't credited as the film's co-writer, his collaboration with Demy, who wrote the lyrics, suggests that he may well deserve to be, for this is a film in which the score and the narrative are inseparable, shaped to the same architecture. Demy once noted that Umbrellas should be described as a film 'in song' the way that some films are 'in color.'\" If one can't get past the notion that this is, in fact, a romantic fantasy amped up to the nth degree through color, through its plot absurdities (one night of passion resulting in Genevi\u00e8ve having to marry the diamond merchant, Guy's beloved godmother dying on the same day he learns of Genevi\u00e8ve's marriage and quits his job, etc) and most of all through the hyper-romantic music which runs the gamut from jazz to chanson, then there's not much I can say. You have to fall under the spell and take it as it is, not ask for what it doesn't provide - asking for more realism in the relationships seems to me to be missing the point. For me the only real flaw in the film at all is Deneuve, who at 21 really is a little too old for the naivet\u00e9 of Genevi\u00e8ve, but this is a very minor point in a film that I can never grow tired of. I like Demy's next musical, \"The Young Girls of Rochefort\", possibly even more -- and I'd suggest all who love this to make that a priority. All who hated this of course should avoid it like the plague, unless they can find a way to put themselves under the spell that they somehow missed in watching this sublime confection...",

            "content": "I liked the Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but was acutely aware that it was gimmicky. The American musicals of the 1950s obviously influenced this film quite a bit, and that genre was already nearly dead in the world as filmmaking began to move into the more artistic (American) films of the 1960s, like Bonnie and Clyde or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The gimmick, to have every line, no matter how mundane, sung by the actors, is interesting at first, but after about 30 minutes, it gets old. The music is never all that great in the first place, and it is really repetitive. Also, the actors aren't very good singers. What I did like was the art direction and the costumes. The color schemes are very interesting throughout the film. But even this, the best part of the film, owes a lot of debt to the American musicals of the 1950s, especially An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain. Remember the color schemes in the extended \"musical number\" sequence near the end of Singing in the Rain where Gene Kelly proposes the grand finale of the film they are making? It involves a goofily dressed Kelly trying to find a job as a dancer. Especially memorable in this scene is his dance with Cyd Charisse, decked in a gorgeous green flapper dress. Basically, the Umbrellas of Cherbourg constantly looks like it takes place in the same world as that scene in Singin' in the Rain. I would suggest renting those two films before The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. And if you want a French musical, I suggest Le Million.As for the rest of the movie, i.e., the plot, the dialogue, etc., it is extraordinarily light. It is very two-dimensional and it is instantly forgettable. It isn't very romantic, and it is very predictable. It reminded me a bit of Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass in its plot, but it doesn't produce the same feelings in me that Splendor did. All in all, I would still recommend it if you're a lover of world cinema, but I'd just warn you not to expect the masterpiece that it is often touted as. I give it a 7/10.",

If you watch THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, which came out about the same time as UMBRELLAS, the terrorists win. On the other hand, though the French misadventure in Algeria plays the pivotal role in the lives of UMBRELLAS' lead characters, life goes on for them with only the amount of bad karma they collectively deserve for living in such a country. Americans may best understand the distinctions between these two cinematic approaches to the French war against Algeria by viewing BATTLE OF ALGIERS as that conflict's THE DEERHUNTER, while UMBRELLAS takes the position analogous to GOOD MORNING, V1ETNAM! But apart from any parallels, UMBRELLAS is an incomparable feast of ear- and eye-candy that should not be missed.",

I enjoyed the singing and melody.I think it's interesting that they never stop singing, because it probably is fairly difficult and needs a lot of talent. And that's what they indeed have! The singing becomes so natural, that you even stop thinking about it! I was surprised to hear someone talk after the movie. Also, the colors are extremely bright. Especially the pink wallpapers in the heroines house and her green dress she wears in the beginning. It's also interesting how it starts with the hero, then switches to the heroine, and ends with the hero. Catherine Deneuve has a charming charisma, and is a real treasure. She and Nino Castelnuovo have a nice chemistry, which makes the film successful in the romantic elements. The heroine's mother is a typical way of portraying parents in films, but Anne Vernon pulls it of so well that it didn't bother me at all. All characters are believable and even the end is realistic. I won't tell you how it ends, but believe me, it ain't no stupid Hollywood ending! Everyone I know have dedated whether the endings sad or not- personally I don't think so. I have to also say, the translation is perfect! I have come across a few fairly awful ones, so it was a pleasant surprise to see that they had really tried with this one. The directer, Jacques Demy, impressed me with his brilliant, superb, moving writings and directions. He has created one of the most beautiful love stories. And I just don't like any romance stories, so believe me, this one works perfectly! It's also one of the most spectacular musicals. It a movie everyone should see, from youngsters to adults.",

In other words, it is not about the surprise's force\u0097but about the meaning of the acquirement. The film's force comes from its conception, from its aesthetic principles. The content is skillfully distributed. Excellent and satisfying shape, that uses but six characters\u0097a minimum of characters.It is Deneuve's film, undoubtedly. Exquisite and even thrilling beauty, Deneuve made the '60s her decade. She had several opportunities\u0097she used them fully. Les Parapluies De Cherbourg came when Catherine Deneuve was 21. Throughout the movies, she looks stunning. By then, she was already a mother\u0097she had a son with Roger Vadim, Christian Vadim-- born in '63. (Roger Vadim was the first of her more famous liaisons , followed by other four men--David Bailey, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Marcello Mastroianni and Pierre Lescure).It's also obvious that the director understood well the advantages of this highly stylized dramatic form, and he gave it a decent content. When Demy used them, these melodramatic devices were no longer real internal necessities\u0097on the contrary, as conventions they were a luxury. It is Demy's merit that he abstained from turning them into whims. He made them work is this film. He gave them some meaning. Demy gave his stories and intelligent and unconventional air. It is known that each frame is a plastic and color composition. The musical theme that signals the couple's scenes knows a deserved fame. On the other hand, there aren't any other songs worthy of mention in this film. Les Parapluies \u0085 is one of the giant machineries conceived by Demy, and meant to startle, amuse and amaze. Here the canvas is very small \u0096only a few characters, as I said, and a masterful pace--,yet the impression is of a big machinery , a big machine made by Demy for it's own sake, a pure demonstration of the virtues of a genre. In this sense, Demy's reputation is fair, he is rightly perceived as a creator of such intelligent delightful machineries that have as purpose the grand fun. Demy's whole career as a director was a project\u0097an experimental project. Fortunately, it was also a successful one. He achieved to manage this fancy genre he had patented as if it were a popular genre, though it obviously wasn't. In cinema, I love bold projects, experiments, large scales, the dynamic continuity, the identity. I like the achievements, the ideas that manage to be transformed into a functional work of art. Demy's career is one of the success stories.The masterpieces\u0097or at least very good movies-- that Deneuve made in the '60s are well known\u0097several delightful classics\u0097between '64 and '67-- Les Parapluies De Cherbourg, Repulsion and Belle De Jour\u0097or, in other words, Jacques Demy, Roman Polanski, Luis Bu\u00f1uel. Her best roles are, I think, in the last two of the films indicated. In Les Parapluies \u0085,Deneuve is not required, of course, to give any extraordinary creation; on the other hand, she looks quite glamorous, and there are some moments when she is endearing. The role doesn't elicit much _expressivity, and the performance given by Deneuve is understated, of a praiseworthy undertone.",

So let's take this as another sign of my lack of intelligence then, because I did not find Umbrellas of Cherbourg to be as great as many suggest. There is a lot to love about it though. The great colors and style throughout; it is dated to a time and place that maybe didn't ever exist \u2013 and it looks great, and feels so effortless in its coolness. This quality is very much part of the ending too, however the conclusion to the film is much more than the beautifully shot moment that it is \u2013 it carries an emotional weight and honesty to it that really works well.The score adds plenty of color, and fits the production design to a tee. Unfortunately, though the singing left me cold \u2013 which understandably had a massive impact on how I was able to enjoy the film. I did not like the singing style throughout. The way it was done seemed to make all the delivery sound the same. It also seemed to reduce the narrative in nuance and detail, leaving it rather broad most of the time. It still had strong moments, where the actors gave more than the material offered them in the dialogue, but mostly it felt limited.For sure it was still a very cool watch, with several great moments \u2013 the best of which is a very strong ending \u2013 however too much of it failed to land with me.",

I've seen three of Demy's films thus far, all of which have featured my favorite actress, the pulchritudinous Catherine Deneuve (\"Repulsion\"), but out of all of those, \"Umbrellas\" is by far my favorite. While \"The Young Girls of Rochefort\" provides some of the best music in his whole oeuvre (which, I might add, was incredibly influential to Damien Chazelle in his production of \"La La Land\"), and \"Donkey Skin\" provides a delightful spin on a classic French fairy tale, it's this film that I'm drawn back to, over and over and over again.

It's about young love that just can't be because of a disapproving mother, a war, and a mild surprise in part 2.The film in one way is a novelty since ALL of the dialogue is sung.  It's not just a musical with spoken dialogue and musical numbers.  But it's not a greatly original concept.   It's really a filmed opera with fancier sets. Like an opera, the story is told in 3 acts (or parts).  And like an opera, all of the dialogue is sung.   A typical opera usually consists of an overture, preludes to acts, arias, recitatives, and choruses.  There's little to any in the way of recitatives (i.e. monologues) or choruses, but is plenty of the rest.Michel LeGrand had the unenviable task of scoring all but about 30-seconds of this 87-minute film.   That said, he did a fantastic job, and managed to use probably no more than 6-8 themes for the entire film.  Of course, this means you may get tired of some of the music after a while... but at the same time, you become familiar with the music and are able to pay less attention to that, and more attention to the story as it develops.By no means, is it the greatest film or even musical, but it is very enjoyable.

It seems they must be headed for a happy ending, but there is more to the story than that. The snowy scene at end is a real tearjerker. Every stylish frame of the film is like a work of modern art. \"Umbrellas\" is the middle film in an informal \"romantic trilogy\" of Demy films that share some of the same actors, characters and overall look; it comes after \"Lola\" (1961) and before \"The Young Girls of Rochefort\" with Gene Kelly (1967), both interesting to watch for many of the same reasons.

All the dialogs in the film are in a musical way. You start to feel funny and irritated at the same time. The story is a very general, so do not expect much from it. It is just one normal love story that has a neutral ending with a good message. But what makes the film a must watch is its colorful cinematography. If for the first few minutes you are feeling irritated because of the musical dialogs then just wait some more and you will find yourself completely immersed in the film. After a time the dialogs, with music and everything look so normal that even such a predictable story can make you feel happy. It needed a lot of faith to make a film like this.

It is the circumstances that are acting here as the obstacles. The film made me remember the films of Ghibli studios by Hayao Miyazaki. The film won the Palme d or in its time. But this is not the reason why you should be watching this, but that it is very much watchable in its own weird way.MESSAGE: \"Life\"VERDICT: \"A recommended watch.\"",

            "content": "\"Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" is a very critically acclaimed French musical film but it is also very overrated and not nearly as enjoyable as people make it out to be. The musical score is very weak and limited in scope and use. All of the dialogue is sung acapella in soft voice and monotone which makes for a very dull movie, and which doesn't allow proper emotive expression and variability in the dialogue and action (of which there is little). The plot is too basic and the characters too wooden and undeveloped causing the viewer to care little for them. This 90 minute film felt very long and was a challenge to get through. Really the sole positive here is the nice cinematography, colors, and visuals. But not a film I would recommend except to real cinephiles and lovers of obscure arty films. I rate it a 4/10. I enjoyed \"The Young Girls of Rochefort\" much more and gave that a 9/10 rating. If you're looking for an engaging musical see Rochefort instead.",

I was in high school the year it came out and remembered the theme music which enjoyed a fair measure of radio play at the time. And, I had seen other films by Catherine Deneuve, so I was pleased when I happened on it. The non-stop singing and the vivid colors were a bit much at the beginning - I was a bit reminded of Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge although that had much larger sets and more obvious camera movement. Following sub-titles is also a challenge - three and a half years of studying French in school has left me with a limited ability to read French and almost no ability to follow a conversation, let alone songs. And yet, the music is so good and so much of the film just makes sense emotionally that you could almost figure out what is going on without any words at all. The use of explicit titles to identify year and month as the story jumps across several years helps to keep the audience on track with the development of the characters and there relationships, as does the obvious clues to the seasons (flowers in spring, snow in winter). The snow falling in the final scene just before Christmas helps to set the mood as snow makes everything perfect and new and covers all the hurts of the past. BTW, I don't know if they did product placements in films in those days, but a few scenes (especially the end) almost look like a commercial for Esso petroleum products.",

            "content": "The emotion I had still remains in me. The melody of the theme music still remains in my brain, and I can't help singing it. I don't know any other film in which the theme music is that important. It is as if the theme music is the film itself, and the plot and acting are adjunct to it.All lines are sung, but complete music is the theme music only. By this format, you don't have to care about the logic behind the plot or about detail of acting. The whole film invokes strong empathy of the audience. And you may recall the memory of your own love affair long ago.Personally, it is why I was so moved that the memory 38 years ago came back. One day, I met my former lover at Tokyo station with my 3 years old son. Watching the film, I recollected the complicated, wistful, awkward feeling of the time. I could not help tearing at the last scene.By the way, the most outstanding point of the film is that all the lines are sung. Even the line \"I don't like Opera, I can't stand all the singing\" is sung. Is it successful? Yes it is. By singing all, the lines have to be blunt. But this enhances the emotion of the love story, because love does not need reasoning. After Guy's aunt died, Madeleine says she is leaving the house. Guy asks her to stay, and she soon changes her mind. The conversation is so simple, that you know they are already attracted to each other.Another point is that everything is beautiful in the film. How beautiful Genevi\u00e8ve's mother is! And this town looks so beautiful by raining.",

Especially after an old colleague who went to film school told me it's one of his favorites.Full transparency: I don't generally like musicals, but that doesn't mean I automatically hate every single one of them. But is this really a musical? Granted, every single line, no matter how mundane, is sung (sort of) but are there any songs? It's as if every actor freestyled whatever they felt like on set and then it was up to some poor composer in post to try improvise some non-descript light jazz to fill in the gaps. I finished this movie five minutes ago, but I'll be damned if I could hum even one tune or theme.The story is paper thin, and so are the characters (a generous use of that word). The movie might just as well have been a silent movie, because everything in the acting is BIG.I worked as s lighting technician and designer as well as a photographer in the 90-00's and I have to say that this movie has some interesting shots, especially in the beginning. But that's not enough to save a movie.I'm giving this movie an extra star for an unintentional piece of humor in the end which made me laugh.

It does sound a bit silly at the beginning, with all that singing in the garage, but then it just takes over you entirely. A word of warning though: don't watch it with your girlfriend. Because, sorry, but it is not about her, it is about the past. About things that were happening once, that were so great while they lasted, but that did not last long. That you want to forget, and yet don't want to forget. If you were ever young and full of love, and then the world collapsed, and yet you now feel masochistic enough to actually want to re-live every single moment of it, then this film is for you.What amazes me most is that this film is actually so incredibly simple. Despite all the singing, there is no high poetry, dying of love, pompous gestures, and all that stuff. But that's precisely what gets you, what makes it so true and so how it actually happens. You just come, and she is gone, and then nothing makes sense any more. End of the world is actually amazingly simple, the world just ends.And about what happened to the Guy next. One might say that he moved on too soon. But I can tell you that the most unbearable thing at this stage is _not_ having someone next to you. When it used to fill all your life and now there is just void, it is simply beyond what you can comprehend or live with.And the finale! Wow. And again, there are hardly a few words there, \"How are you\" - \"fine\". Yet that's exactly how it happens. You want to say so much, you want to bring it back all over again. And yet you don't want it, you know that it won't do anybody any good, and it won't really happen. You cannot walk into the same river twice. The river is not the same, and you are not the same.And I haven't even mentioned the music. Which is absolutely magical. And again (did I mention it), it is so simple, yet it completely blows you away. It pours with rain, with snow, with sunshine. It promises, it worries, it straggles, it swipes with all the rain and sadness, it brings the past back. Every time you hear those accords, it just brings the tears to your eyes.It is so sad and yet so beautiful.",

There are a number of very distinctive musical themes - most of which have been recorded by other artistes with completely different words - but at no point do we get an intended show-stopper - and there's definitely no dancing! So a first viewing can be a complete culture shock. I almost didn't persevere past the first ten minutes, but, if nothing else, the presence of Catherine Deneuve (whom I would watch singing the Paris phone book) persuaded me to continue. I did start to get the measure of things, but had it not been for the dramatic, sad, and possibly ambiguous last few minutes I'm not sure I would have returned to the film again. I did however do so, again taking a while to adjust to the 'rules' but getting increasingly involved again as it moved to the the conclusion. It was only on a third viewing after a break of several years and being ready for it that I fully enjoyed the whole enterprise - the bright colours, the town of Cherbourg which I know from a long time ago, Catherine Deneuve (I may have mentioned her already), the music with its restrained orchestration, the plot, and that ending.",

After a while of watching the film you forget the dialogue is entirely composed of song, and even though there were no songs that i went away humming from this picture, the images slowly became something other than film, and the songs became something other than song.With Les Parapluies de Cherbourg, Jacques Demy created something entirely new, something no other film maker has been able to achieve with film and music. Sure the great silent films of cinema's early days were able to achieve an atmosphere of people worship to which the entire film making industry the world over still suffers and although there was no dialogue and very little music, sometimes accompanied live with the showing of the film, silent films were never as Magical as this, simply because i have watched a few... and we always knew we were watching a film no matter how impressionable we were...Not only does Demy manage to create a world in which nothing is real seem real, he creates a place, love and a film along with A song that you wish were a part of. No!!! that isn't what I want to say...what I want to say is this... If you see this film it becomes a part of you and you will become a part of it.

I knew they sang, I knew Catherine Deneuve was in it, I'd heard the theme song. When I watched it, however, I was still pleasantly surprised. This movie is truly original - I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. It's a Musical/operetta (and they sing ALL the time) but with a very realistic and quite dark storyline. The story could very well have been told as a regular drama, totally without music, and would probably have worked very well. This does not, however, mean that the operetta treatment is superfluous. Rather it adds a dimension, something eternal and bittersweet, which only enhances the poignancy of Guy and Genevieve's bleak story. This would probably be a good starting point for everyone out there who claims not to like Musicals. First, there are no transitions (people bursting out into song) since every line is sung. Second, the music never causes you to lose track of the story or the feelings it conveys. Technically, I can wholeheartedly recommend the Tartan edition from 2001. (\u00a0ASIN: B00005B5YE, Catalogue Number: TVD3326). It's letterbox, the colors and picture quality are great for a forty-year-old movie, as is the sound (quite important).

The simple plot is carried along, at least in the first half, by the convincing nature of the relationship between Deneuve's character and her mechanic boyfriend.The film is slightly spoiled, however, by the rather disjointed plot in the second half, and the lack of variation in some of the sung dialogue (in fact there are no spoken words in the entire movie).

He's in love with Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) an Umbrella merchant. After a night of passion Guy is drafter to fight in the War at Algiers and Catherine now pregnant gives up on seeing him again is persuaded to marry Roland (Marc Michel) a wealthy business man.You know how in bad musicals of the 50s-60s people break into song elongating a short plot with 6-12 songs that do not forward the story at all? Normally they can be about people in show business, or heightened situation where breaking into a random song sort of makes sense. You watch because your mom or girlfriend love the show, and therefore you humor them.It's rare a musical has songs that serve a purpose more than a variety show moment... at least to me.Umbrellas of Cherbourg is not one of these movies.In a Hollywood movie I could see this plot turned into a farce or upbeat musical comedy with an added 30 minute long dream ballet danced by Gene Kelly giving the movie a 2 hour plus award fodder length. Also not the caseThis is an opera essentially about two realistic characters living realistic lives and dubbing along to music. FYI: it was very common to dub everyone in musicals.The beauty in this movie is in its simple mundanity of setting and character. It's a bittersweet snd realistic love story where the main character finds what needs and desires not in the person he thought, but in the person life presented him. Madeleine is truly is true love. She knows the real him and is a poignant match.Favorite sequence: The end. Not because it's over, but a chance meeting reconnects Guy and Genevieve. In the end he owns his own gas station and mechanic shop. Genevieve accepted the belief Guy would amount to nothing and accepted a prosperous yet empty marriage based on this belief, which is sad because Roland is a good guy, means well, but isn't Guy. But here a Guy is, back from the war with his own gas station purchased by the inheritance from his godmother and pension. And here is his old flame, at his place of business, with the daughters she kept from him. In the end Guy makes the correct choice.Loved it. Real people in an opera. No Gods.

She's the daughter of a shop-owner who sells umbrellas in the town of Cherbourg; he's a handsome 20-year-old service station attendant who's been drafted and will be gone for the next two years. Demy cleverly trims his picture with amusingly arty accouterments, which is a good thing considering his thin story (separated into three chapters) has very few characters, an abundance of mother-daughter confrontations (set to music) and simplistic story contrivances. The picture did give us the Oscar-nominated song \"I Will Wait For You\", which is more memorable than the actual film. *1/2 from ****",

            "content": "I first happened on this exquisite jewel of a movie several years ago after my teenage son told me he'd watched an unusually poignant episode of Futurama featuring a song called \"I Will Wait For You\". Intrigued, i did some research and found that it was written by Michel Legrand and Jacques Demy and was from a cult French musical movie called The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, in which every word of dialogue was sung. This i had to see, so I ordered it up on DVD. From the minute i first started watching it i was entranced, and i still am today. My son watched it with me, and so was he. This unique film is almost beyond criticism. I don't agree with the often levelled objection that the central theme is slight. The pain of young love, and the dawning realisation of how the world really works, these are things of universal importance. I love the way the movie raises so many questions that could have so many different answers. Did Genevieve ever really love Guy? Did she/will she ever really get over him? Did he/will he ever really get over her? I love the way it creates the drama using believable characters who in their own ways, despite the mistakes they make, are all actually rather likable. The use of colour and attention to detail are amazing, the music striking and memorable, and the English subtitles are terrific. A lot of films are let down by their subtitles, but these are literate, witty and often quite subtle. (At least they are in one of the two versions I've come across. The other, which from its reference to gasoline rather than petrol I assume to be American in origin, is considerably inferior.)For all those reasons i would already have considered it my favourite movie ever, even before i recently and belatedly bought on DVD Demy's earlier film Lola. Watching that movie has brought a whole new dimension to Umbrellas. It features one of the characters in Umbrellas, Roland Cassard, and his love for a dancer, which is recapped briefly in the later film. We learn how although Lola has a good heart and cares for Roland, she can't return his love because her heart belongs to another man, Michel, the father of her child, who left seven years before and has never come back. She has never quite given up hoping that he will, but tells Roland she plans to go away for a couple of months to think about things, implying that there may be a chance for them when they meet again. Roland meanwhile is himself about to go abroad on business, so will also have a chance to put his thoughts in order. The situation is further complicated by Roland's friendship, mirroring what happens in Umbrellas, with an attractive widow who is obviously interested in Roland and has a precocious teenage daughter (though this one is 14 rather than 16).Lola the movie ends with Roland about to leave for Johannesburg, unaware that Michel has just returned unexpectedly and Lola has committed her future to him. Roland has spent most of his life up till now in his home city of Nantes drifting through a series of unsuitable jobs, and in desperation has agreed to a decidedly dodgy assignment involving the smuggling of diamonds. When we next see him a few years later in Cherbourg, 200 miles from Nantes, he's a rich and successful businessman in the jewellery trade who's always away on mysterious business trips. So what is he doing in Cherbourg? Has it got anything to do with the fact that the widow's daughter Cecile went there when she ran away from home? Was he bitter when he found out about Lola and Michel and how did it alter his view of the world? Is his wealth based on the proceeds from smuggling, and if so is Genevieve at any time aware of this? Why can't Roland aspire to anything more than a marriage of convenience? What's the real significance of the parallel between the two widows and their daughters? Could Umbrellas possibly have a darker subtext than is commonly suspected? You could keep returning to these questions again and again over the course of a lifetime, and that, more than anything else, is why i like this movie so much.",

            "content": "Shot on location in Cherbourg in northwestern France, the Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a tale, told through sung dialogue, of young love and separation. Winner of the 1964 Palme d'Or and favourite film of La La Land director Damien Chazelle, it has come to be regarded as a classic. The strengths of the film are plain to see but so are its flaws, notably a surfeit of sentimentality and its elementary story.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is atavastic even for a film released in the 1960s. Its social conservatism and depoliticization stand in marked contrast, for instance, to films of the French New Wave. Set in the present, the film offers no criticism of modern life and reinforces traditional gender roles. The film interprets the actions of characters solely through the lens of old-fashioned sexual mores with the result that the characters' lives follow a predetermined course that is arbitrarily restrictive and unrealistic. Indeed, the plot is so simple and trite as to resemble a fairy tale. The ending departs from the formula slightly but is nonetheless predictable. Jacques Demy probably had every intention of making an uncomplicated, old-fashioned musical but intentions are no excuse for weak storytelling.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a veritable ode to colour. Almost every shot is awash with an array of luridly bright colours both contrasting and complementary. These colours amplify the intense emotions of the characters and reinforce the cheerful, light-hearted tone of the film. A skyward tracking shot of a blue sky dotted with clouds along a street lined with blossoming planes is particularly breathtaking, albeit comparatively restrained in its use of colour. Contemporary directors take the widespread availability and low cost of colour film for granted by overusing colour combinations, composing monochromatic shots, or simply paying little heed to how they use colour in their films. Demy, on the other hand, provides an extravagant feast for the eyes that will leave the viewer feeling satisfied and delighted, if perhaps a little bloated.The actors are suitably charming and attractive like almost everything in this film. Catherine Deneuve throws herself into the role of Genevi\u00e8ve which she credits for making her a star. She succeeds in bringing a rigidly stereotyped character to life, for instance, through her strategically-inserted bouts of emotion. Nino Castelnuovo shines as the jovial and amorous mechanic. Encumbered by the unimaginative writing, he is less persuasive when emulating the malaise Guy experiences upon returning from military service. The primary consideration in casting was evidently not singing ability. To be sure, Deneuve and Castelnuovo are capable singers in spite of having thin voices. Deneuve in particular is successful at conveying a range of emotions with her voice.Demy elects to have the actors sing every line of dialogue as opposed to having songs interspersed with ordinary dialogue. Sung dialogue sounds like a song but lacks the characteristic structure, such as the reiteration of certain sections, that can make a song catchy and appealing. Demy succeeds nonetheless in crafting a screenplay with rhythmic dialogue that effectively communicates the film's simple story. Like the film, the jazz-hued score, with its soaring strings and pleasant melodies, is appropriately maudlin.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a delightful but excessively sweet confection, replete with je'taimes and mon amours, laughter and weeping, vivid and kaleidoscopic colours, and charming and beautiful people. Its undeniable charms will take hold of but not transport you.",

What makes this fantasy-musical-grounded-in-reality so watchable is Demy's graceful mise-en-scene, pastel palette, and uniformly attractive cast. The soap-opera plotting is nothing special, and Demy doesn't even bother to stay in period -- his 1957 looks just like 1964, the better to show off Deneuve's wardrobe. (And how does she afford those clothes on a shopgirl's budget?) But carping over details is useless in an endeavor as unique and sublimely romantic as this. The bittersweet ending feels just right. And you'd probably end up humming \"I Will Wait for You\" if Legrand hadn't programmed about forty reprises of it.",

Wanna teach someone the possibilities of great mise-en-scene? Almost every frame in this film could serve your purpose.Then there's the film's gimmick: all the dialogue is sung. When I was watching this film, I kept thinking one could write a really great paper comparing this film to \"Moulin Rouge\". Both unorthodox musicals. Both quite melodramatic. Love is the main theme in each. But to me, \"Moulin Rouge\" was multicolored whip cream compared to the sumptuous sundae, with rich ice cream, fresh fruit, and tasty chocolate syrup, that is \"Umbrellas\". I preferred the latter film in a major way. Of course, there are some who would prefer \"Umbrellas\" before even seeing it. Rare French New Wave flick vs. hyped Hollywood production? For elitist moviegoers, the choice is already made. That's not me, though. It's just, \"Moulin Rouge\"'s in-your-face approach represents the excited overachiever and Demy's film represents the calm ACHIEVER. See both and tell me you disagree.What makes \"Umbrellas\" so rich? It's a package. The story may be melodrama, but it is fascinating, beautifully-structured melodrama that holds you in its grasp as it unfolds. The story is extremely well-done and the movie has THE best ending I've ever seen in a romantic film. I won't reveal it, but let's just say that those ready to dismiss the film as sentimental before seeing it are missing out on pure genius. But the sentimental will enjoy this film as well. You have these baby boomers who look back fondly on stuff like Zeffirelli's \"Romeo & Juliet\" when this is 10x better. Anyway, characterization - amazing. Each character is fleshed out well and engrossing in their own way. Add to that impressive, touching, memorable performances as well as striking attractiveness (that last one is not something I look for in a film's characters, but for those who do...). Then there's the realness of the story - the way it touches on the politics and current events of the time (the war with Algeria, etc. - French colonialist pigs!).As I said, it's a package. Any complaint this movie could inspire would sound petty. I'll come out and say it - it's a masterpiece. If I made it, any slump I hit, I'd remind myself, \"I've made a masterpiece. I've made a valid contribution to the world of art. I am satisfied.\" If you get the chance, check it out. Without a doubt.",

Merely on a musical level, the score of the film is a wonderful achievement, with the lyrics and melodies feeling completely natural and appropriate to the situation. In fact, this film could be characterised as an opera since the recitative runs throughout. The themes are continually varied from situation to situation to fit the mood of the scene.Aesthetics is one of the strongest suits of the film, and the design of clothing and sets in the scene is brilliant. Bright, colorful visuals give the film an unique look, not faded with age or technology. It seems to capture the essence of the 1960's, of when it was filmed.When it comes to the plot, one can consider it cliched, but it is effective and well written. Young girl called Genevieve, from a rich family, is in love with a car mechanic Guy. She is even having a child with him, but just as he is preparing to take care of the child, he is called into the army to fight in the Algerian War of Independence. Meanwhile, Genevieve marries a rich suitor, while expecting the child of another, and breaking her promise of waiting for Guy.The film achieves near perfection with its ending scene. Guy, now a successful owner of a service station of his own, is visited by Genevieve wanting to fuel her tank with gasoline. The gaze and meet each other, exchanging a few trivial words of politeness with one another. The wistful memory of the earlier memory plays in the background, in the form a melody of a song they used to sing.",

And that is NOT saying that the ending is bad, it isn't; it's just that this film might be a little longer than it needs to be. But the beautiful colors and glamor of the actors make this movie enjoyable, and the music is very nice to listen to. It sort of is like a modern day (well, 1960s) opera. No words are spoken; they are just sung. And it works, and the characters are interesting and the scenario is interesting. It's just that as it god near the end, I was looking at my watch a little more and more. It is worth checking out, and it is adorable, and it is a piece of film history.

Superficially it has a simple storyline: garage mechanic boy falls in love with umbrella shop-girl; girl gets pregnant; boy is drafted to Algeria, love tragically compromised; boy returns; girl has begun lifeless marriage to jewel dealer, film ends on snowy garage forecourt. But from these banal `quotidien` details emerges Demy`s brilliantly  willful blend of continuous jazz-score, hyper-real colouring and sheer French style. A critic at the time commented that even the wallpaper should be Oscar-nominated, and viewing the wonderful 1996 re-print one can only concur. The music undeniably drives the film along, and central themes `I will wait for you` and `Watch what happens (theme de Cassard)` went on to be hits for Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennet and Jack Jones. Michel Legrand`s imaginative use of traditional orchestra with big-band jazz lead him to be approached for similar duties on `The Thomas Crowne Affair' some years later. Notable also for Catherine Deneuve`s cinematic debut as shop-girl Genevieve, the film simply dances in front of your eyes. (No mean  achievement for a story set in Cherbourg.)A film for lovers, and for lovers of film. If you want to know just what stylish direction looks and sounds like... you will be enchanted.

Bewildered by how this movie managed to invoke such strong emotion in me. It isn't a particularly sad movie. I'm not a even French movie buff. I'm not sure if I've even seen a French movie before. The movie is set in the small town of Cherbourg, France from 1957 to 1963. The walls are still all brick and mortar, covered with vibrant colors, hand painted on. Young Genevieve (Catherine Deneuve) lives with her protective mother (Anne Vernon) and together they run a quaint Umbrella shop in Cherbourg, France. Genevieve and Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) , a car mechanic at a local garage, are deeply in love and contemplate marriage but they are forced to put everything on hold as Guy (prounounced Gee in Geese) goes to serve his mandatory two years in the French army. Can their love survive the separation while she is being pushed by her mother to marry a rich jewel merchant by the name of Cassard (Marc Michel) in Guy's absence? It is a quintessential love story.Catherine Deneuve is breathtakingly beautiful. The characters are memorable and their personalities distinct. You might find that their relationship interactions a bit funny by modern standards but remember, this is set in the late 50s. Back when it was normal for ladies to lean on their partner's chest and caress his hands lovingly with their face.....while being pet like a cat. Still it added to the charm of the movie. The daintiness of the Genevieve that is, not the petting. The movie breaks down into four acts. After each act the movie fades to black and you are briefed on the next act. If you went and saw this movie upon its release, you went to the theater to watch......theater.One thing to note is that this is a different form of musical. ALL of the dialogue is sung instead of having musical numbers fitted in between spoken dialogue. The only other movie I've ever seen that has all the dialogue sung is \"Repo the Genetic Opera\". Imagine a gothicized Paris doing a musical number; Enough said. This one's much better.Back to the movie at hand, Michael Legrand could not have composed a more beautiful and fitting orchestral score. I must mention that the score is continuous throughout the whole movie from beginning to end. And it led to a beautiful song covered many great artists. The definitive and most haunting version by Connie Francis; Titled, \"I will wait for you\".The cinematography translates the charm of Cherbourg to film, wonderfully. The shots are simple and effective. My favorite shot in the movie is that of a departing train. I have seen my share of train scenes but I don't remember seeing it ever done this way.I recommend this movie, unless you despise theater, can't stand orchestral music and refer to French fries as Freedom Fries. I recommend watching it with your significant other (for maximum effect) and staring into their soul after the movie ends. Then put on some Marvin Gaye and get it on while keeping in mind that tomorrow may never come.",

The boy tells her he's going into the army.Demy more than redeemed himself with THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT three years later. Great, great movie, finally available on DVD.Buy the CD. Avoid the movie, unless the DVD allows you to play it without any subtitles at all.",

            "content": "I have been to France but never to Cherbourg. Even though it is not a port, my own hometown in New Jersey could have even served as the setting, although I don't believe that it has the charm of Cherbourg. While few in Union, New Jersey spoke French and the people did not sing on the streets, I was amazed when I realized how much the two towns have in common. Even Ms. Daneuve's hairdo in the final and very compelling scene was a very prominent fixture in my 1967 yearbook. I didn't say Ms. Daneuve. I said her hairdo.This is a film, directed so inventively by Jacques Demy, which may be difficult to accept at first watch, but it is one that actually improves with each subsequent viewing, at least for me, and that is a very rare phenomenon. If you don't like musicals in the first place, this may not be your cup of tea. If you may ordinarily accept musicals but don't like this musical score by Michel Legrande, a score which I have grown to love, you will probably dislike this movie. If I don't like the score of a musical, there is no way that I will like the film adaptation. The theme song, \"I Will Wait For You\", so highly ironic when we consider the story's outcome, has probably been covered by more than 50 artists since 1964, and every time I see this movie, it remains with me for days afterward, and that's a good thing. For me, it is a song that has certainly withstood the test of time, especially since it immediately evokes images of this ingenious film.Much has been written about the color scheme, including the matching of the characters' costumes with the scenery and the significance of specific colors to the moods and to the transition of action, which is unique and very creative in itself. Throughout the film, the candy colored images dramatically contrast the starkest, even the most brutal, elements of real life, including the pain of separation, the psychological upheaval and physical injury of war, the suffering of a terminal illness, an unexpected pregnancy, parental and employer conflict, the heavy weight and pressure of financial debt, and, most of all, the struggle to make a living and to provide for oneself and one's family. All of these experiences are universal challenges that we all may be forced to face in life.Without revealing too much about the ending, I was very moved by the last scene, which was brilliantly designed, but, at the same time, I wasn't sad for the future of Guy and Genevieve. We make decisions in life and learn to accept the consequences. We suffer, but we learn not only how to survive but how to thrive. It's a wonderful message from an outstanding movie that I will see again and again.",

Filed as a love story, it also makes my top three. And Catherine Deneuve? She's definitely in my top three most beautiful actresses of all time. Then there's Michel Legrand, my second favorite composer (after Chopin, and if you must know, the third ones would be the Lennon/McCartney collaboration). How does one get so willingly hooked to a movie? Just sample the first five minutes of it, you don't even wait for the first lines of song to realize you're in for a gem of a film. Before you hear any of it, the sets are bound to get you. For the colors, those vibrant, palpable colors are a veritable visual feast. And have I mentioned the divine Catherine Deneuve? If there's anything most likely to distract your attention from the sets, it would be her presence. And last, but not least, for long after you may have forgotten the plot, you will never forget this: that melodious, hummable music, a song most of us associate with having heard from childhood, that beautifully threads the scenes of the story together--and you have the perfect musical. The most poignant love story (reminiscent of Splendor in the Grass, another coming-of-age film with a most genetically- blessed lead actors), with an ending that breaks the heart, but one which I completely approve of!",

            "content": "Demy's musicals are spaces of fantasy, identification, sentimentality, to be sure. Yet they also attain their unique flavour through a kind of realism. For Demy, escapism is not always the creation of an entirely alternative space, a willed blinding to a reality, but a transformation, in the brightest of colours against the richly drabbest of backdrops, and the most soaring of songs, that returns that reality, both as it should and should not be. What's easy to overlook about this charmed and each time tear-jerking ode to first love and missed opportunity is that, for all its undeniable surface sentimentality, is how non-judgmental and unsentimental aspects of it are. In particular, though this is far less obvious than in a film like Resnais' 'Muriel' from the same period, it's in large part a film about the Algerian War and the destruction of a generation in the vain thrashings of empire, the bourgeoisification of social climbing and its interleavings with romance: its lovers ending the film as small businessman, a garage owner, selling American oil, and the coiffured wife of a bourgeois barely pausing to get out of the car. That's what you hear when Legrand's second, or is it third, hanky moment occurs as Deneuve is left behind on the station platform-'I will wait for you'; and again when the camera tracks out from the garage in that devastating final scene. No one's waiting here; no one can, for to moulder in dreams would be worse than to nourish them in the sustaining space of fantasy. For all his attachment to the sorrows and joys of romantic love (though even those are bittersweet), Demy doesn't present it as a kind of goldfish bowl of redemption or aspiration, but as a deep part of the contradictions deep within the social fabric of an unjust society. It's this, as well as the deeply manipulative, but no less affecting presentation of romance, that make 'Les Parapluies' such a great film.",

            "content": "Imagine an American producer coming up with an idea like this: \"Let's do a boy-dates-girl, boy-loses-girl type story. But, instead of having ordinary spoken lines, we'll have everyone SING their lines to music composed by Michel Legrand. Not highbrow or poetic or witty operatic lines, but really mundane prose. Like, when the mother asks her 17 year old daughter how she got pregnant, the daughter will say, \"Well, just like everybody else.\" We'll cast it with the most attractive actors we can find, and have the dialogue dubbed by people with decent singing voices.\"Then, to keep the audience's eyes busy, not only will we have Catherine Deneuve at the height of her beauty, but we'll add some dazzling color to the movie sets. We'll paint walls and doors and building in impossibly bright crayon colors, and the interiors will be covered with brilliant,almost psychedelic, floral and striped wallpaper. And,hey! Let's not end the movie with the usual \"Boy Gets Girl\"formula----let's have them both end up with somebody else.\" Sounds like a potential flop in the making, doesn't it? And yet it works. I don't know why it works, but it does. The gaudy colors and sung dialogue actually enhance rather than distract from the story----and it stays with you for days after seeing it.An achingly beautiful young Catherine Deneuve plays the impoverished bourgeoise Genevi\u00e8ve, and the Italian actor Nino Castelnuovo her poor working class lover. Marc Michel, who starred as Lola's admirer in Jacques Demy's 1961 \"Lola,\" reprises his Roland Cassard role, several years later, as Genevi\u00e8ve's wealthy admirer. Will she settle for unconditional love from a man she doesn't love? Will she find happiness with the father of her unborn child? Will her dress coordinate with the brilliant wallpaper in the dining room? The end is no more formulaic than the sung dialogue or the brightly colored sets. But somehow it's satisfying, and a movie to watch again and again.",

I've hardly watched any French New Wave movies and even as I appreciate this amazing film has to be total one-off, what an imaginative, remarkable, uplifting movie it is.I can see that its colour and vibrancy echo the great big-screen Hollywood movies of the recent past, but the mundanity of the subject matter, the naturalness of the performances and of course the bold step to employ sing-speak dialogue to tell the story all make it a truly remarkable movie experience.The story is simple and down-to-earth. It's 1957 and a pretty, seventeen-year-old girl Genevieve lives with her single mother in Paris. Together they struggle to make their umbrella-shop business pay and this time when the quarterly rent bill comes in, the mother despairs of being able to pay it.Her daughter meanwhile is caught up in the first throes of love with her handsome young mechanic boyfriend. He lives with his elderly, ailing aunt who's visited every day by a dutiful if slightly dull young woman who clearly loves Guy but he can't see it.Genevieve goes with her mother to the local jeweller where the mother hopes to sell some of her valuables to help make ends meet. Although the jeweller turns her request down, also present is a smooth, rich merchant who takes a shine to Genevieve and opportunely bales the mother out, but has ulterior motives on the young girlThen, disaster for Guy and Gen as their plans are turned upside down when he's called up for the then-compulsory two year French Army National Service. There's just time for one last tryst between the young lovers with the inevitable outcome. From there to the end we follow the couple's separate paths as each compromises their future to meet the path of least resistance before one last Christmas-time bitter-suite reunion at the conclusion.I was caught up immediately by the colourful set design, natural acting by all and in particular the chemistry between the handsome young couple. Behind the musical tilt to proceedings is a credible, natural story of young love combatting everyday obstacles of disapproving parents, money worries, teenage pregnancy and, very much a factor at the time, the dread draft notice arriving through the door.I'm not saying that after the movie ended I was whistling tunes from the Michel Legrand soundtrack which oddly for the time, makes no reference at all to either the prevailing rock and roll or jazz styles of the day and yet I loved the novelty of every cast member bursting into song to express even the most banal of utterances. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuevo are terrific as the latter day Romeo and Juliet but they get strong support from all the supporting cast. The direction by Jacques Demy, right from the wonderful opening shot looking down at the rain falling on the Parisian general public, is super-stylish and has moments of genuine flair.This is a film to bring sunshine to the rainiest of days. Walk between the raindrops, if necessary, to watch it, c'est tres magnifique y jolie.",

Without the music this film would be all nonsensical drivel. But the music gives it a spirit of beauty that not only is kept sustained all the way but which constantly is heightened in gripping authenticity and sincerity. The music gives these most ordinary humdrum characters a soul of eternal life. Neither Jacques Demy nor Michel Legrand would never again make anything like it, although their next film, \"The Girls of Rochefort\", was technically more advanced and architecturally more brilliantly composed, but in this film the music also adds poetry and the infinite beauty of infinite sadness. If you listen to only the music without the film, it will give you more than the entire film. Although only recitatives, the tunes will stick, and as they are repeated throughout the film like real \"leitmotifs\", they will make the music create a deeper and truer impression of the feelings and passions involved here than the actual film. It is a masterpiece unique of its kind, there is no other film like it, and no one ever even tried to make something similar. You will cry more for the music than for the matter of fact of the tale and the characters.",

            "content": "Like Tati, Jacques Demy knows how to create beautiful sets and scenery. And yes, just like Tati, he doesn't know jack about writing a good story that can keep us entertained. While Americans were making classic after classic during and after the Golden Age of Cinema, the French filmmakers were experimenting with dialogue, with sets, with pacing, and with the way films are made. In this case, we have a musical that runs from the beginning to the very end. Every word of dialogue is sung, every last word. Only the French language (and maybe Spanish) could craft such a type of work, since their language tends to roll off the tongue easier than English and especially German. However, with that being said, it becomes quite tedious, and the musical becomes irritating when the dialogue refuses to mature past (\"It's cold outside,\"\"Come inside,\"\"Its warmer here\").Les Parapluies de Cherbourg follows a relationship of two people (Guy and Genevieve) that suddenly deteriorates for various reasons as Guy heads off to war. This sets off a series of events that chronicles Guy's attempt to mentally and emotionally recover as Genevieve is nowhere to be seen. It's the average love story with a bitter twist, and it never quite dwells any deeper than it should. He loves her. He is happy. She loves him. She is happy. It does not dig any deeper, there is little dialogue that shows these two were in love and were meant to be with each other forever and ever. All the dialogue is little bits and pieces of obvious observations (\"It's cold now\"\u0097if you see snow and have it fall on you, how else would the weather be!?!?). It has been decades since romance classics like Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, City Lights, etc., and you still don't realize that the heart of a love movie is the chemistry of the main characters? There's about as much chemistry here than a math problem.The singing itself isn't bad, and they could have taken advantage of this if they had reduces a bit of the singing and worked on the actual emotions. There are about four facial expressions throughout the entire film. Catherine Deneuve and Nino Castelnuovo could sing, but can't really act. Maybe that's why they turned it into a full-fledged musical. Then again, it's hard to truly showcase your skills when most of your sentences tend to be five words or less. Dialogue can kill an entire acting performance, and in this case hinders the performance of everybody involved.Jacques Demy repainted an entire town for the natural look of the setting in this film. The sets themselves look magnificent and contain plenty of detail. The mere idea of using an already-developed area for a colorful film was smart; since it doesn't require as much money to fix a city rather than build one from scratch (Jacques Tati probably wouldn't have hit bankruptcy if he had followed this formula). The walls, the umbrellas, the houses, they all looked magnificent. The French nailed it in terms of eye candy back in the 50s and 60s, something the American filmmakers at the time didn't focus on as much. If there is a reason to keep your eye on the movie, it's because France looks beautiful throughout the film. He isn't too bad at moving the camera around to capture the beauty. The idea of the whole life-is-one-big-musical thing isn't exactly terrible, but the execution was extremely poor, as when you sing all the time with little raises and dips in tone, it fails to create any sort of emotion or ability to elicit a reaction from the viewer.The musical score itself was shooting for epic, but comes off as laughable as the music tries to match the emotions running through during the scene, resulting in some hilarity. When you shift the tone of music from happy to sad to depression in mere seconds, it doesn't sound good to the ears, and comes off as melodramatic. Of course, there is one well-known piece that has stood the test of time, which is \"I Will Wait For You,\" the best musical number in the film. But, aside from the sets and little bit of music, this film is a total mess. Just more pathetic, overrated garble that's praised to the high heavens from stuck-up critics and film snobs that turn their backs on anything modern and fall in love with anything old-school. Experimentation with music can be entertaining, with Silly Symphonies from Disney being an older example, but Silly Symphonies had a bit of heart and personality along with the testing of what music can do to film. Les Parapluies de Cherbourg has about as much heart as a ruthless dictator that eats souls and kicks puppies as a hobby.Bottom Line: This film is an utter mess, because it's another example of French eye candy dwelling as deep as a kiddie pool. Film is about visually telling a story, not incoherently deciding to make everyone sing about obvious observations that the audience can figure out. Film is not about being able to predict the next line of dialogue or the next major event that occurs. Film is not about showing people resembling wooden puppets and creating no entertainment value whatsoever. Why else would we remember the American classics but none of these so-called masterpieces from overseas? Because the Americans built likable characters, grand epic stories, and tales that we hadn't seen or heard about time and time again. Demy proves that people can sing a whole movie\u0097but nothing more. We can't dissect this film into multiple layers, and we can even do that with some action films of today. There's nothing to dig here; what you see is what you get\u0097and that is singing, singing, bickering while singing, and showing an eternal pout face while singing.Sing this with me: This movie reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeks!",

            "content": "\"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" is essentially a pulp fiction story and nevertheless it is a beautiful film.The film is willful in several ways. The way the complete dialogue is sung, mostly as a recitative. The use of bright, candy like colors. But also deliberately using of artificial montage. When the two lovers Guy (Nino Castelnuovo) and Genevi\u00e8ve (Catharine Deneuve) walk home for their last evening together it seems that they are standing still while the scenery behind them is moving. Just like in a 50's movie when the car is standing still but movement is suggested by projecting a moving landscape in the rear window. Sloppy technique by director Demy according to 1964 standards? Not at all. By using this effect the characters seem to float instead of just walking. They are madly in love after all.Through all the choices mentioned above director Jacques Demy made a film that is clearly artifical. It must have been an atrocity for the directors of the \"Nouvelle vague\" movement, then dominant in France. Even today films that are so utterly artificial are scarce. However different from \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" I can only think of \"Dancer in the dark\" (2000, Lars von Trier) and \"8 femmes\" (2002, Francois Ozon).\"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" has a very powerfull final scene. It is a happy and an unhappy ending at the same time. The scene contains an explicit message about Guy and an implicit message about Genevi\u00e8ve. When you see how the spontaneous girl from the opening scens has been transformed in the expensive lady of the final scene you know that materially speaking all is well. But what about emotionally speaking?\"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\" made Michel Legrand, who did the music, famous. Above all however it was the breakthrough of Catharine Deneuve. Twenty eight years later she was still the \"Grande Dame\" of French cinema in the already mentioned \"8 femmes\" (2002).",

            "review_title": "The First Film Musical Ever Produced",
            "content": "One fundamental and innovative feature of this movie may be difficult to detect by present-day users. Even in 1964 many professional experts overlooked it. 'LES PARAPLUIS' STARTED AN ENTIRELY NEW GENRE, viz. THE FILM MUSICAL. Without any exception, the music of every previous musical was created with the aim of functioning appropriately in the theatre. By contrast, in 'Les parapluis' the team of the director (Jacques Demy) and the composer (Michel Legrand) for the first time decided to produce a work in which the sound should be 100% film music. No one had previously attempted such a task. - This innovation may seem less conspicuous today, because theatre musicals and cinema musicals have reciprocally learned from each other. But note! Even though some musical techniques and phenomena may function well in both the theatre and the cinema, this is by no means true of all techniques and phenomena. - Today it is no revolutionary view that 'West Side Story' and 'Les parapluis' belong to the ten best musicals ever made for the screen. But Swedish reviewers in the 1960s had limited musical competence. Leonard Bernstein's contribution to the former movie was called 'a heap of banal hits', and the latter movie was depreciated as 'a sugary Hollywood melodrama'. - It is definitely not my intention to belittle the non-musical merits of the movie. Even if all music had been deleted, I would still consider it a great movie. Nevertheless, I asked myself whether the music of any other film is of a comparable quality, while being at the same time congenial with the action and situations. I think there is one and only one rival, viz. 'Phaedra' by Jules Dassin, with music by Mikis Theodorakis. However, in 'Les parapluis' all music reaches the highest quality, from the first to the last note. In 'Phaedra' the same thing is true of at most two tunes, among them the love theme. - The DVD version is 31 seconds shorter than the cinema and the video versions: the penultimate 31 seconds have been cut away to ensure that the picture and the music should finish at exactly the same time. It would be vainly to complain about such re-editing. However, the technique with a rotating playback-and-record-head has existed since forty years. If this technique had been applied, the cut would not have been annoying to musicians. But most regrettably, the cut is performed with ordinary scissors. - Users who do not love music, or not this kind of music, would more often than not be disappointed by this movie (although not necessarily so). - The action is very simple. Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve love each other. He is a motor mechanic, and she works in her mother's umbrella shop. When he is enlisted and sent to the North African colonies, she is pregnant. Continual war activity makes it difficult for him to write many letters. Genevi\u00e8ve's mother is worried about her pregnancy. Her pressure eventually makes Genevi\u00e8ve marry a jeweller, whose love may well be as sincere as Guy's. But we are not told whether Genevi\u00e8ve feels more than gratitude because he saves her from becoming an unmarried mother. - When Guy returns from the war and Genevi\u00e8ve has left the town, he becomes very depressed. But he eventually marries the nurse who had for years taken care of his godmother. All the time she had secretly been in love with Guy. - After some years Guy and Genevi\u00e8ve accidentally meet again, but nothing much happen at this meeting. - What so many people admire is the moods and the atmosphere of each scene; not least the transparency and depth of the emotions of the persons. Some people even feel as if they themselves experienced the events and situations on the screen.",

The Umbrellas of Cherbourg finds that balance better than any other movie ever made, and reaches a tipping point in the representation of any technical aspect.I think we all go to the movies not just to enjoy the technical aspects, not even to listen a story; well, yes, but we go to the movies to feel, to get excited, to be moved. Jacques Demy knows how to play with that.This movie will leave you with a lump in your throat, with a tune in your head, and with a pretty clear and confusing idea of what is love to you.Even if you don't like the opera (movies are better), you've got to see this movie.",

Demy as a director was heavily influenced by the musicals of the forties and fifties, as well as his native France.  His meticulous attention to detail, however, took the concept of the musical to new levels with this film.

This so called singing annoyed me so much that I couldn't even think of the possibility of liking it.Because of all the positive (story, frames, camera movement, cinematography and acting) I will not give it a 1 nor a 2.

The first 20 minutes is a total joy while the rest is just a tragic event after the other which leaves you by the end of the film totally wrecked.I'll start by saying that I have enjoyed every second of this film visually, every single frame is near perfection, and all of the colors present in each frame pop and shine which makes this film one of the most visually satisfying films I have seen, there was not a second watching this film I thought \"that looks kinda ugly\", the best way I can describe the color palette and the production design is that if you were to taste it, it would have a sweet candy-esque taste, basically all you want from eating candy.I believe that the screenplay deserves a lot more acclaim, as the entire dialogue in this movie is sung which is a fun twist from the usual musical medium, but to be able to write a good screenplay and have it work as a series of songs is something else, and the screenwriters deserve more praise for being able to make this screenplay work as a series of songs. It brought some really replayable and gorgeous songs and was effective storytelling-wise. I ended up seeing the film twice in a row just because of how catchy the songs were, and how mesmerizing Michel Legrand's musical score was.In other aspects, the movie delivers too, Catherine Deneuve's performance is great as a conflicted teenager having to choose to wait for her lover's return or to marry somebody else, it isn't necessarily award-worthy but it is still an entertaining and charismatic performance. The same goes for Nino Castelnuovo and other supporting actors giving good and charismatic performances as their respective characters.Being a musical, it delivers in terms of sound design, when real-life sounds fade in and out in between tunes or tracks, which is done wonderfully, and I felt pretty much immersed into this world despite the lack of real-life sound during conversations and some of the tracks, giving this movie a little bit of a fantastical feel to it (setting-wise).Overall, I certainly did not expect a movie this heartbreaking but I still enjoyed every minute of it thanks to the musical numbers, the writing, the performances of Deneuve, Castelnuovo, and Vernon, and of course its color palette and set design.It is definitely an all-time classic in the musical genre but also in the romantic tragedy medium, and should be watched by all movie-lovers especially those who enjoy musicals such as Singin' in the Rain or La La Land.*SPOILER EXTRA:*Storywise, this is maybe where it hurts the most, as this film's main story reminds us of the harsh realities of life, and how a sudden event or decision can have heavy consequences. In this film's case how Genevieve (Deneuve) and Guy (Castelnuovo) are separated as a result of unfortunate events (Guy joining the army, Genevieve getting married to someone else after being asked by her mother to support her financially). The most aching part is the ending when they cross paths many years later, both having moved on from the previous relationship they shared at the start. The point is that how real-life constraints can have heavy costs in this case their romantic relationship and their ideas of a happy life together.",

Infused by jazz melodies as well as thumping percussion for an added flair, featuring eye-candy pastel-coloured set and costume design on full display, and cycling through seasons in a way thematically suggestive, Chazelle's musical is definitely not far removed from this one although each has its own approach to its distinct story. What grabbed my attention the most is how Demy progressively jettisons the fantastical, iridescent world in favour of an otherwise grounded one. From the opening sequence of an aerial view of raindrops pitter-pattering on cobble stones and the titular umbrellas, to the bold, bright colours, to the constant singing, Demy muster all technical tools, congregating to lend a lulling effect that sent me into a delightful stupor, and to kaleidoscopically play up the emotional union and jovial state of Genevi\u00e8ve and Guy who're enamored with each other.Cherbourg is almost presented in pink, before giving to brown-ish and blue hues to emote Genevi\u00e8ve's feelings of forlorn and sadness respectively, and fuchsia and red to suggest warning and uncertainty, when Guy leaves to Algeria due to his conscription, leaving Genevi\u00e8ne facing a tough decision that threatens their relationship. Even colours brimming with joy at first, such as yellow, gradually wane and pale, giving way to some of their dull and faint derived shades. All these create melancholic undertones along the way that ground the film in reality while portending its bittersweet ending where there isn't a dry eye to be found. But The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a film of the of vicissitudes of life and how one has to resign to fate so long as latching onto hope becomes more and more difficult, and it's more than just a matter of counting the days.The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is also of teenage love and recklessness, and it's here in particular where it sets itself apart from the rest with its sense of verisimilitude. \"People only die of love in movies,\" said Genevi\u00e8ne's mother who neither believes in love at a young age nor love at first sight. She's pragmatic and even cynical, and maybe that's her main impetus for wanting her daughter to get married to the wealthy jewellery merchant. Yet, her happiness at seeing her blear-eyed daughter a bit cheered up when handed a letter from her lover is real and indicative of a true motherly affection. Make no mistake, this is far from the flawless film I was expecting. The editing is a bit clunky, which shows most in the continuity of music. It also took me a while to adjust to the dialogue, entirely being recited and sung, but soon I started to appreciate the unconventional lyricism of it all. A visual and emotional stunner that's not to be missed by all the fools who dream and lovers of musicals in general.",
