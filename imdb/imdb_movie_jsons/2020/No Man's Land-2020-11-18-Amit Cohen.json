            "content": "I found this series by accident while reading a biography of James Krishna Lloyd ( The Good Karma Hotel) and sat up all night watching the story told from a non US side. The lukewarm reviews might be from American critics unaware that the US isn' t the only player in the Iraq,/Syria debacle. They just started it. The story follows two separate themes, a young Frenchman looking for his missing sister who was presumed dead, and three young boyhood friends in working class London, who never really fitted in due to the Arab ancestry of two, who go to Iraq to join the fight for Islam. Throw in a deceitful foreign agent, a few converging plot twists, and the Kurdish female fighters and you get an engrossing series showing some of the reasons that many Europeans went to join the cause, whether it be for excitement, alienation from the countries where they had grown up, or genuine patriotism, set against the desperate fight for survival of the Kurds. The fact that the series is French/European gives it a quieter feel than the frenetic 'Homeland' or similar US shows. I sincerely hope to see a season 2.",

            "review_title": "Why you can safely ignore the negative reviewers - this is an amazing show",
            "content": "I will keep this completely spoiler free.After finishing the season, I was surprised (and disappointed) to read so many negative reviews criticising the show for being too 'soap-like' (as in revolving around characters' emotional dilemmas) and not really being 'about' the Syrian/ISIS conflict. This is a ridiculous criticism to make. Here are some examples to help you appreciate why: \"Designated Survivor is terrible, because its not really about Washington or the government\". \"Homeland is a bad show, it wasn't really about the CIA or the war in Afghanistan\". \"Die Hard is awful, its not really about LA or the Nakatomi corporation\". You see what I mean? Stories ALWAYS need humanly relatable elements - which means emotions, personal conflicts, interpersonal dilemmas and dynamics. Its laughable that some critics literally compared No Man's Land to actual documentaries! If you want to learn more about Syria, the Kurds, ISIS etc - then yes, by all means watch some documentaries. No Man's Land is a fictional show that tells a very engaging and compelling story but in this CONTEXT.And what a context it is. The closest parallel that emerged for me was Sicario - yes a different context entirely, but also similar in dynamics - a person out of their depth, moral ambiguities, shadowy leaders pulling the strings, having their own agendas etc. And of course the continual threat of random, brutal violence. Again though, Sicario wasn't really 'about' Mexico or the war on drugs - it was about one persons struggle to make sense of something so complex and futile - like life itself - something we can all relate to at times, and the same essential core as No Man's Land.The story is hugely engaging and relatable, uncomfortably so at times, which is perhaps why some people were triggered by it. Who are you really, what do you really stand for, and why? Who would you be if those causes didn't happen or exist? How do you feel, knowing that your whole personality and life trajectory has been steered by events and experiences outside of your control? How do you then navigate that? These are deeply universal fears and quagmires that should plague anyone capable of thought, and are explored in various ways in No Man's Land. It's top-notch emotional character-driven story-telling, told in a brilliant way, set in the most uncompromising context imaginable.I'm so thankful I stumbled upon this show, while actually looking up the Porsche stealing 80s movie of the same name (which is awesome in its own, very different way!)",

            "content": "I enjoyed this series immensely. The story just of the Kurd women fighters is interesting and inspiring on its own, but the show also has a few different viewpoints and characters to make it truly engaging. There seems to be three different character focuses towards the start, and there is a convergence that I did not see coming. I had some predictions in my head, but I was wrong and where the story went was even better!A few of the professional television critics wrote relatively lukewarm reviews of this new show, and I think they are way off and I didn't agree with a single one of their criticisms. One of the best complete first seasons of a new show I've seen in quite some time.Even if you think you are not a fan of \"war stories\" and wouldn't be interested, I urge you to watch this. I'm truly hoping for a season two! The story of season one is somewhat told, yet there is so much more to tell, and we are left at a natural yet not annoying cliffhanger.Phenomenal television: Season one \"No Man's Land\" 9.5/10(I rounded to 10 for IMDb ratings)",

            "content": "It's so incredibly cool to see awsome Kurdish women taking up arms to fight the terrorists. I love a good badass movie female, so I'm surprised we get so little of actual historic or contemporary examples of such in media. How about the soviet night witches? Keeping lil' nazis up at night, because they're scared of some lil 90-pound Russian girl. If I understand it correctly, there have been attempts to make a Night Witches movie, but aside from one Soviet one back in 1981, they've not gotten anywhere. Then there's the Soviet sniper women, or angolan women fighting with axes, or viking shield maidens? Got a little of that in \"Vikings,\" but mainly a woman, as opposed to lots of them.I like this motto by People's Protection Units (Yek\u00eeney\u00ean Parastina Gel (YPG)):\"YPG dimese, erd \u00fb ezman diheje\" which means from a translation of Kurmanj\u00ee to English: \"YPG is marching, and the earth and sky (or heavens) tremble.\"I've always believed that YPJ could lead to treasure trove of powerful stories and they are all true. The show is entertaining, and they clearly did their homework in some regards. I dig that they actually speak Kurmanji. However, the situation is very simplified for the sake of being entertainment, and trying to avoid too much controversy. Nonetheless, it's cool that they weren't afraid to directly use YPJ, instead of making up a fake name, or something to avoid triggering people.One thing I disliked about this show is that they picture Syria as a desert, and it's generally like that in media. This is just part of it.Some background: The United States destroyed Iraq, and turned it from a secular state into an Islamic state, affiliated with Iran, and now it is doing the same thing in Syria, and the purpose of that is to steal oil and enter the Middle East in total darkness. A lot of Kurdish lives were shed in destroying ISIS.",
