            "content": "Laxmmi (2020) :\nMovie Review -It's been almost a decade now that we saw Akshay Kumar in Horror Comedy in Bhool Bhullaiyya (2007) untill he come with Laxmmi. This is very much upto the fictional ghost story than Bhool Bhullaiyya which was more of a psychological thriller and both films are remakes. Kanchana directed and led by Raghava Lawrence was a sensation in it's regional industry but somehow on pan India level it looked cheap due to limited standard of that small industry. So when Bollywood remake was announced then it was obvious that those cheap things would be polished on large scale in Laxmmi. But unfortunately this shoe get more dusty while trying to polish the original layer.Laxmmi is about Asif, a happily married man working in organisation to clear the superstitions from society's mind. He transforms into Laxmmi, a ghost of a transgender who wants to take revenge against evils who stopped her from making something big in male oriented society. The scipt has seen a lot of changes from the original Kanchana and actually it should have worked as advanges but here it goes in opposite direction. Mainly couple of changes in the motive of the transgender looks much weaker than it was in the original. Music is decent where 'Burj Khalifa' tops the list while other songs are either bad or average.When it comes to remaking a popular film there is always an obsession about bringing something different in the story or else people won't like the copy paste so Laxmmi tries the same but fails and it fails exactly at it's strengths. The climax scene tries to make the hero look real hero of the story and not the Laxmmi which is terrible and somewhere it misses the chance of showing devotional powers. Usually, in horror films the devotional and God's powers things works and then there is Laxmmi which completely deletes this folder. The screenplay loses the grip the first half itself because cheap comedy doesn't help much nor any scene is scary enough.Akshay Kumar as Asif disappoints but as Laxmmi he's a big Bomb. Sharad Kelkar as Laxmmi gets only 4-5 scenes and still manages to overtake rest of the cast. Sharad's acting in speech scene is terrific, just brilliant. Kiara Advani looks beautiful and does nothing else. Supporting cast is decent and you can take it as an overstatement. Raghava Lawrence directed the orginal and he did some mistakes there too but now he had a chance to overcome his falters but he even forgot to make it to basics. Overall, Laxmmi is an average flick saved by two things, one is Akshay Kumar and Sharad Kelkar's performances as Laxmmi and two the social message it provides for transgender community with little bit emotional support.RATING - 5/10*",

From inessential inclusion of songs to emotions falling flat most of the time. An obvious bunch of missed opportunities.Other than a disheveled narration, the writing had its fair share of sluggishness too.\nEspecially on the characters.\nExcept few; others had discouraging sessions.\nKeeping all negativities aside, thankfully some of the performances kept me going.\nA praiseworthy attainment of Akshay Kumar as a transgender & a surprising act from Sharad Kelkar brought glimmers of hope and a nervy smile on my face.So to conclude, I adore Akshay Kumar's versatility and sheer audacity to deliver social messages through his work. But this time, his venture has witnessed a failure. I'm not opposing its appearance as a mainstream entertainer, but when the crux of the concept held that much of an importance; If it was to me, I would have picked a more streamlined method.",

If not for superstar Akshay Kumar leading the show, this film would've probably been dismissed as a B grader.Not that its core concept is poor, the original Kanchana - it is second favorite of Sony MAX after Sooryavansham (1999) - blended horror and comedy perfectly to deliver chills and peals of laughter in equal measure. Surprisingly, director Raghava Lawrence who also helmed the original, falters badly with Laxmii, particularly the first half is filled with cheapo jokes and some ill placed songs. Farhad Samji's additional screenplay and dialogues are to be blamed here.Akshay Kumar is a mixed bag While he hams it up as Asif who swears to wear bangles if he ever came across a bhoot, the superstar is effective as the possessed avenger Laxmii in the later parts of the film. His expressions and body language in the climactic sequence are superb. Kiara Advani has absolutely nothing to do here and trust me, Ashwini Kalsekar has bigger role than her.Speaking of the supporting cast, it shocking to see everyone from Ashwini to Rajesh Sharma to Ayesha Raza ham outrageously as if their life depended on it. The slapstick tone reeks of Sajid Khan's sensibility where mocking a devotional song is expected to induce laughs. Sorry folks, thats pathetic!!!Any positives then? Well, for one, the 'Bam Bholle' number is brilliantly executed to give you goosebumps. And lastly, aapla Sharad Kelkar in a cameo delivers a knockout performance overshadowing everyone else. He is truly graceful, dignified and outstanding in the role of the transgender. Laxmii isn't!!Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni.",

Laxmii(Bomb) is another epic disaster of high level which 2020 has been providing every time. God knows how Farhad Samji is still getting to write films and how people are even approving such trash, what's worse audience loving it more and more. Houseful 4 was disaster, Baaghi 3 was even worse and Laxmii turns even worse here!Remaking Kanchana itself was a disastrous idea as it wasn't a masterpiece either except it did give a good message about treating transgenders and LGBTQ people with respect while Laxmii gave same message while mocking them at the same time. Although I'm not really concerned about Hinduphobic content all the time even if I find it problematic, here Hinduism was mocked openly making it into a joke especially by someone like Akshay Kumar who has always respected every religion here he's making joke out of it, like seriously? What was the point of naming his character Asif if original one was Raghav? Why Pandit couldn't remove the spirit but Maulvi did? And what about Baba Baba Vaishnavi ka Dhaba or Sabka Time Aayega Inka time aayega all that rubbish? Laxman was removed from by his family but not some Ramu kaka but Abdul Chacha nurtured her and named her Laxmii(Most of it was in Kanchana itself but not openly mocking Hinduism unlike Laxmii). Jokes were literally sexist, cringeworthy, homophobic(ironically), songs were even worse(except Bam Bhole which wasn't originally this film's) and performances were even worse by all except Sharad Kelkar. Seriously the makers gave plot number '6' to the land where a transgender ghost existed, like WTF! Farhad Samji what the hell were you thinking while 'symbolically' highlighting 6 for ghost of transgender? How the hell did Raghav Lawrence did agree to this? Or is it as always producers like Tushar Kapoor and Shabana Khan added their 'creative' influence to ruin it whereas Lawrence could've made it better than Kanchana also.Performances wise this can be Akshay Kumar's career worst and best performance, maybe not career's but in past decade it is. As Asif Akshay was just boring and often overshadowed by everyone around(including Kiara) while in second half his effeminate act was horribly cringeworthy in which he hammed every scene. Only in Bam Bhole song and climax portion as Laxmi Akshay showed his class act but it became too late by then. Kiara Advani, though decent as an actress was given zero scope to act here, badly written(perhaps more like a prop) character just added as a filler. In Kanchana Raghav and Raai had decently written characters and performances again in Laxmii I smell Farhad Samji's job. Rajesh Sharma and Manu Rishi Chaddha who're of almost similar age as Akshay are literally playing father son and son in law respectively, like seriously! This isn't some YouTube sketch or Kapil Sharma Show where same age people be shown as father son! I bet Akshay must be older than both right now! Ayesha Raza and Ashwini Kalsekar hammed badly here, actually each and every actor here have hammed badly, trying to compete who's worse actor despite of all of them being respected for their profession. The only saving grace in this hot mess was Sharad Kelkar, wished to see more of him in the film as his part was the only good thing about this trash. In fact in climax he should've been there as well alongside Akshay like in the original but Akshay seemed to be insecure about his co actors like always which is why Akshay didn't let Sharad act in the climax.The animation and VFX used in Laxmii doesn't seemed to be even slight improvement from Kanchana at all, instead it's even worse here. 9 years back Kanchana had bad animation and VFX due to budget constraints yet it was an entertaining one at that time, now Kanchana seems more like mediocre work except for its message and performances by the cast then but Laxmii instead of upgrading it downgrades even worse! Going 1 star only for Sharad Kelkar besides this film is a complete trash all thanks to God of horrible writing Farhad Samji!",

Another aspect is that if you say this movie copied than other movies like Dil Bachara, Kabir Singh are not copied. This movie rating on IMDB is 2.2/10. Wow!! Dil Bachara, just because in that movie Shushant Singh Rajput is there so, it will get a good score and the movie is not copied. And on the other hand, Laxmi will get so much hatred.

Hindus are always shown in bad light as if they are the devil & the other religions are saints like it was shown in the movie the father-in law dislike son-in law, because he is from different religion. They will never dare to show the anger or hate this other religion has towards hinduism as it will hurt their secularism. Earlier I used to think its the backend team such as their creative director or producer who are hinduphobic & deliberately create such scripts to hurt the sentiments of hindus, but now I feel they all are on the same boat be it an Actor or actresses as they well aware of the fact that with what intentions the scripts are written & they still prefer money over their own beliefs.",

Moreover, they were rumours about promoting love jihad in this movie and defaming Hindu Religion's Sentiments which created more curiosity to me. When I was watching it I found the rumours true in few scenes like. At start of film, the Hindu Sadhu was portrayed as Imposter for treating the possession of witch and then the same problem was solved by Maulvi in the film before the climax. Although i don't care about who removes the possession of laxmi but if you watch movie from religious angle you'll find most negative charaters are Hindu and most good charaters are Muslims. This is not secularism. Completely disgusting mentality for promoting such hate towards Hindus. After that, in the climax scene they portrayed Devi Maa protecting the Villain by not letting enter others inside temple. I don't think Bollywood is Unbiased anymore. This is completely my opinion. I don't support any political party or organization.",

I decided to see Laxmii yesterday and it kept me gripped the whole way. It was nicely directed, good suspense and hilarious.\nAkshay Kumar was Fantastic, his comic timing has always been top notch. Kiara was good and looks pretty. I wanted to add that most of the supporting cast (Kiaras family members) were very good. Ashwini Kalsekar was Brilliant, after a long time i laughed so much, she is a true talent.Its blantantly obvious that majority of the 1 star reviews are fake, as most of them were reviewed before the film came out. There is no secret, that there is a large percentage of mis informed brainwashed people who think the whole of Bollywood is evil due to lies spreaded by some individuals (Evil Kangna).\nIts unfortunate that hard working actors like Akshay Kumar who has built a successful career by his own Hardwork with no friends/family in industry to help has been made a scapegoat and has to tolerate such nonsense.\nIndian people need to accept that SSR killed himself and he took drugs at his own will. He wasnt murdered by Bollywood, its like saying Amrish Puri killed him, People need to take a break from stupidity and move on.The other reason the film got 1 star is because of racism. Sadly India, a country that was much loved around the world has lately been known for dangerous racism (also high rape cases). Laxmii has scenes where a Muslim is helping and is successful and a Hindu fails to help. Due to this scene, its obvious that many racist people got hugely offended.

But HELL NO\nI am severely disappointed by Akshay Kumar sir who wished to show off himself as a politically and religiously correct man but ended up being hilariously Muslim favourite....\nThere was a scene in the beginning of the film where a Hindu pundit was called out for being \"dhongi and pakhandi\" for he was faking the existence of a ghost inside of a girl...\nBut in the latter half of the film when our Baba's were beating women for being allegedly possessed by spirits!\nNot hilarious but hilariously stupid and illogical film....I won't discuss the parts here as it would be a spoiler but I know this that you would for sure be able to notice a Void Of good story and logic but what you would find will only be MUSLIM FAVORITISM in this film throughout it's running minutes.\nYou can read about everything else that is Sharad khelkar's Master class performance and A good performance by Akshay Kumar in the final minutes of the film...but that's only worth 2 stars for me.... I am highly dissatisfied by this film and I think that Kanchana should have been left alone and this remake was completely unnecessary.",

I know it's a horror movie anyway, but still there were situations that could have been made more real than just drama!Laxmii has some advantages over Kanchana, in terms of variations and realism. Although it stars Akshay Kumar who is one of the big actors in the whole Bollywood, it is much lesser 'hero centric' than Kanchana.I am really into horror movies, and that's why I get disappointed in most horror movies. Either the movie should be realistic(logical) or a tight packed story without realism. Most movies I've watched usually scares us by utilising our reflexes like a sudden sound. I personally prefer conscious build up of fear.Finally, in that experience Laxmii is a mix of little bit packed story with some drama. I feel it is better than several horror movies in the entire Bollywood, hence I give 7 stars.",

The story is more suited to the 90s era or early 2000s, but not the time of 2020 where theres so much good content to watch on the streaming services, they want to offer this crap to the masses. I'm sure if it released in cinemas the audience would have booted this right out. The time of just making a film based on star power is over. The audience these days want some good quality cinema to watch. Where small screens are doing way better, why would someone waste there money to watch this garbage on the big screen. Akshay normally does do really good films but its stuff like this and mindless comedy like housefull let him down. In my opinion it was the right move to release this on hotstar.

            "content": "Laxmii is a horror comedy but the film has neither horror nor comedy. Scary tries to scare the audience by showing faces and director Raghava Lawrence fails here. Like a ghost licking a drop of blood. But the way to scare the genre was abandoned by the films in the 90s.'Laxmii' also underlines sensitive issues such as narrowness of thinking about transgenders and their spontaneous acceptance in society.However, between these issues and messages, the story of the film definitely staggers and at times there is a clear contradiction in its original spirit.The film picks up pace in the second half where Akshay Kumar finally appears in the character of Lakshmi. But Akshay will once again be seen disappointing you in the role of Lakshmi.Your disappointment will increase when the film will have the entry of the real Lakshmi as she is completely different from Akshay Kumar.The action of the film seems childish even in Climax. Neither does the film scare nor bring sympathy for Laxmi in your mind.Laxmii is completely Akshay Kumar's film. Akshay with his strong performance and energy has helped cover all the shortcomings of the film. In Akshay's transformation scenes as Lakshmi, Akshay's expressions are amazing. His spontaneity in these scenes makes him effective. Kiara Advani is frozen in her character. Kiara has been balanced in emotion.The rest of the actors of the film have performed their respective responsibilities according to the expectations of the story.However, the track with geomorphic has been used in improvisation only. The writers also did not pay much attention to that.Sharad Kelkar has done well in the role of the real Lakshmi. His role is small but important. He really deserves applause and praise for this role.If you want to see this film, then watch it for Sharad Kelkar. But for that, you will have to wait a long time and by then maybe your sobriety will answer. So if you see Laxmii, then watch this film keeping your mood in mind.",

Akshay's awkward attempt to melt the father in laws heart just becomes a little more difficult as he gets possessed by a vengeful ghost.The acting by Akshay Kumar is electric, the comedy is great without being vulgar and has lots of references that a regular Bollywood film viewers would appreciate. Kiara Advani looks her best. She is like a doll in the film. The lady playing Kiara's mom (Ayesha Raza) is amazing, her comic timing is incredible. Sharad Kelkar just nails his role.One of the best if not the best of India's horror comedy films. I have watched lots of horror-comedy and I can say that this was done with lots of heart and great professionalism.\nLoved the songs, Start Stop song is silly but catchy, Burjkhalifa is a good dance number but Bambholle oh my god what a song! Since its release I have heard the song over 100 times, love it.Anyone who has not yet made up their mind by uncalled for negative reviews give it a shot. If it was rated with no prejudice it would have around 7.5 out of 10. The film offers great performance with a heart touching story.",

            "content": "Laxmii is promoted as a remake of the director Raghava Lawrence's own film Kanchana but it isn't really a remake. It is actually an adaptation of the whole Kanchana series. I have seen the original films and though they weren't that great, they were good for their time. Laxmii in today's time is nothing new. But having said that, the film is entertaining in parts. Also Raghava Lawrence has tried to double the social message quotient by not only questioning the behaviour of the society towards the transgender community but also adding the communal harmony angle. There is a scene where Laxman/Laxmii (thrown out of his parent's house because of being a transgender) is begging for food. A muslim named Abdul notices that and takes him to his house. When Laxman curses himself for being a transgender, it is Abdul who compares him with Ardhnarishwar (Hindu God) and gives him a new name Laxmi (Hindu Goddess). Some people might find it unrealistic coming from a muslim's mouth but it isn't impossible (Google APJ Abdul Kalam, Rahi Masoom Raza and Zakir khan if you disagree). Now the communal harmony angle isn't limited to that. Akshay is shown as Asif, a muslim who is married to a hindu woman. Both are trying to convince her family to accept them. Her whole family is actually nice to him apart from the father. But even he accepts them in the end. The problem with this angle is it has already been seen multiple times in other movies and it might bore some people. One scene in the beginning where Akshay exposes a fake hindu godman might hurt some hindu's sentiments. Remove that and majority of the hindus will love this film due to Bambhole song, the Ardhnarishwar statue and comparison, the liberal hindu family that accepts a muslim man as their son-in-law which might be unrealistic again for some people but not impossible (Google search Kareena Kapoor, Gauri Khan, Kiran Rao). But all of this doesn't entertain fully. It is entertaining only in parts. The fans of original will be disappointed. It is largely due to the dialogues and screenplay that aren't as good as original. Those who haven't seen the original might like it but others will find it lacking the spark. Also the actors aren't able to impress due to the writing. Akshay is the main lead and he is okay but it is Sharad Kelkar who impresses even in less screen time due to the combination of a great character getting great actor (the guy played Chatrapathi Shivaji in Tanhaji the unsung warrior). The music is average except the Bambhole song. Overall watch it only if you are a big Akshay Kumar fan or haven't seen the original.",

Kovai Sarla was explosive in the original movie and Sharad Kumar's performance was phenomenal. Now this is really hard to duplicate. Having said that they have been able to fairly pull it off.. although the original ending was far better. Sharad Kelkar's role although short has been very nicely performed and hats off. Akshay Kumar's comic timing is good as usual but does not match Lawrence's from the Tamil version. They have changed the story a bit which helps reduce the comparison slightly. The movie is not as good as the original, but not exactly a bad watch. Its good for one time watch and a decent family entertainer.",

That is Sharad Kelkar acting. Brilliant in Laxmii role and suited just perfectly. He stole the show with limited 15 minute part.\nKiara is usual, nothing special.

Thanks to 2020, it may have opened my eyes in few ways that I don't get excited for every Bollywood anymore.\nComing to the point, just a day before Laxmii was made available to stream, I happened to watch Kanchana (in Telugu). Kanchana isn't a great movie either. It's okayish but the flashback part of the ghost is the highlight of the movie. So, is the case with Laxmii. But what separates Laxmii from Kanchana is the way the lead characters portrayed their roles. Raghava Lawrence - the hero as well as the director in Kanchana - tried to do his best and made the movie watchable. Raghava is not a good actor let alone great, but he did a good job in Kanchana whereas Akshay Kumar made a mess of the entire movie. Not even for a single moment, he was watchable in the role he portrayed. Bcoz of that, other actors also didn't appear to interest me in any particular scene. Kiara is a highlight because I don't think she looked as beautiful as in Laxmii in any other movie (sorry Kabir Singh, Good Newwz & Guilty). It felt like she was just there in the movie. Probably, her worst choice so far.\nMy suggestion would be to rather watch the original (especially at night), bcoz I assure you would have some fun watching it instead of this.",

Just throw him out of India.\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21",

Might be if you have seen few series also like in mirzapur they have shown hindu criminal family, Aarya again hindu family as drug peddlers, Patalok Hindu family criminals, & many more such things.

Seriously disappointed with Akshay Kumar. Hes one of the most sought after Superstars of this generation although he may not be an Al Pacino when it comes to acting but off late his choice of movies and the hard work he puts into it had really gotten mu respect. But for me he hit an all time low with this movie. Kiara as good as she was in Kabir Singh she looks like a debutant wanna be im this movie. The one and only saving grace of this movie is Sharad Kelkar. Its only because of his sincere and dedicated efforts I could complete watching this movie. For me the real hero of this movie was Sharad Kelkar. Fans of horror and comedy genre please stay away from this movie trust me you not feel like watching horror or comedy movies for days to come.",

And this is just the tip of the iceberg. It's as if the remake was made with the sole intention of showing hindus on a bad light in the garb of transgender plight, which is lost in the movie.\nThe script, no surprise, is as weak as it gets. It has nothing to offer except a copy paste of original with non creative hinduphobic sections. Acting was below par, save Sharad Kelkar who was a bit relief and my 1 star is exclusively for him, and for Kiara who was just a pretty face to have around and does that part well.

            "content": "What the hell was this movie ??Despite the clich\u00e9d storytelling and similar use of stereotypes, Kanchana was not short on humour. It spawned a decade full of horror-comedies in Tamil cinema, a trend that has recently evolved into adult-horror comedies. What worked in its favour was Raghava, the lead character, as someone who was inherently afraid of ghosts. It allowed for many slapstick comedy moments to be added to the screenplay.Raghava was also the continuation of a character established in a previous film; so, Kanchana was a franchise fully in the making. Laxmii doesn't have that advantage; it also doesn't have a strong supporting cast that whose antics complimented the central protagonist's arc.",

Every person in the world is Same i.e man, woman and transgender.It represented the social cause at it's best.I have watched kanchana a lot of times.Laxmii lacked it's rawness and also performance of artists except Akshay Kumar sir.The only reason we can watch this movie is AKSHAY sir's performance. His scenes and the final song were excellent.Except that nothing is better than kanchana.The back story in kanchana is the best by the performance.The Climax is not even near to Kanchana.Finally can watch the movie once for Akshay sir's performance.

            "content": "LAXMII....THE DEFUSED BOMB.\nThis movie was awaited for sometime because people wanted to see Akshay Kumar's daring transgender look in a saree. Released on OTT platform of Disney Hotstar on the 9th of Movember 2020. There were some fantastic promos, great posters, super trailers. All of which pointed to an entertaining masala horror movie with good dose of comedy put in to make it a universally watchable. There was also the controversy about its name which was then changed just before release from Laxxmi Bomb to Laxmii. All this was a sureshot formula for success at the hustings. No such luck though as it turned out to be a damp squib. A bomb that never went off. One sat through the whole movie for that moment to come, where the pent up expectation were answered but it never arrived. The start was punchy and it did give a scare down the spine. Then the scene with Akshay busting the myth of the tantrik baba that was also picturised well but that was it and these two instances came right in the beginning. From the time the family bit was thrown in the movie, it was only downhill from there on. There are many things that don't work for the movie. First the casting, why, because the Kiara and Akshay chemistry does not work though she is all over him. Age shows on Akshay and Kiara appears mismatched for his character and imagine, they are shown as elopers! Secondly the Mother and daughter-in-law bit does not evoke any laughter as it is over the top hamming, even slap stick would have done, but no go there. The other two characters of the house the men, look lifeless in their own right, you draw out nothing from their performance. I don't know why Akshay's character is named Asif, does it change anything, don't know, maybe apart from some social message in the time of CAA may have produced results, but we have all moved on and it falls to one side. It cannot be called a tribute to the transgender community either as it appears very late in the day and irrelevant. Well one has to really think hard to come up with the salient points or saving graces of this flick. There are three though . One: Sharad Kelkar in a minuscule role does appear effective as a transgender and Two: Akshay in some parts specially when possessed. Three the fx where three personalities spring out from Akshay's character. But all these three instance are so filmsy that the whole movie cannot be held together by them. A rich subject utterly guttered. Promised to be a hyrdogen bomb but turned out to be what we call the past Diwali 'fuski'. Being the remake of the hugely successful Tamil film 'Kanchana' the prospects seemed immense from it, but no go. Even the music or the highly anticipated transgender song, though it had some excellent choreography, it falls flat as it is hardly hummable. To be strictly seen with a forward button at hand and on the a lazy Sunday, when you have nothing to do and you have a lot of Data to spare. In hind sight one can say 'Thank God they removed the Bomb from the name' and changed the spelling and wisely released it on OTT rather then wait for a theatrical release in India. Go figure what would have been the fate.",

The film is good VFX shots except for the Scorpion VFX shots. BGM is the mindblowing of this film. It mimicked a Pennywise scene from the 2017 Hollywood film \"It Chapter 1\", which I did not like at all. Rather I am disappointed after watching that scene. There is no comedy at all in this film and in it, Bhajan sung in Mata Rani's Jagran is revealed as Apna Time Aayega song in front of us which I have not liked at all. I liked or did not like some of the changes made in it. The first song of this film was that except him, the other two songs were fine. So in the last I would just like to say that this film has disappointed me a lot. Anything making and keep it in front of the audience.",

Or someone makes a completely inappropriate facial expression for the situation. Or every time the uncle (???... idk what he was) screams like a 3 year old.The parts that were supposed to be scary were AMAZING.... the SFX throughout the film look like it was done by high school kids on Tik Tok. It's not cheese or camp... they were clearly TRYING to be scary.\nI think there are parts that are supposed to be funny... and I laughed, but probably not for the reasons the director wanted me to.\nThe parts that were supposed to be normal were just... odd (so they were funny).Everything about this movie was STUPID.Even before it starts there are intro graphics for about 37 companies who contributed to the production... lol\nWhy are there THREE DIFFERENT opening credits scenes? You get opening credits 15 MINUTES into the film after some random Vegas pool party music video.\nWHY ARE THERE RANDOM MUSIC VIDEOS THROUGHOUT A HORROR MOVIE???\nI dont know... but they're great(as in awful) and the first one at the pool party is just... well, you have to see it. For a country with a billion people, you'd think they could at least find attractive ones for the pool video... comedy gold! Maybe the director just used his friends.\nWatch it with or without the subtitles. It doesn't really matter. I switched back and forth and it was funny either way.Reading reviews, it seems people in India almost universally hate this for a number of probably justifiable cultural reasons, but since I'm not Indian or well versed in the culture clash there, it was just laughable stupid idiocy for the first 1:35... then it takes this weird transgender turn that comes out of left field.\nThen I got mad at the movie. I'm not sure if it was TRYING to be protrans or just transphobic, but they used every trans-stereotype that rednecks in an Alabama bar would use to describe a trans person.\nAnd then turned her into SUPER-trans... like a trans person bitten by a radioactive Jean Claude Van Damme who then, after being murdered, becomes ghost-trans-Van-Damme who takes revenge on her killers at a random 10,000 participant trans-only beach party (after a music video, of course). It was gloriously awful, so bad that I still wanted to laugh, but I was mad that the terrible quality and portrayal made me want to laugh at what is a real issue of concern.\nBottom line: it is NOT good. You will laugh AT the movie, not with it.",

Series like - Scam 1992, Mirzapur, breathe, asur, panchayat, pataal lok, special ops, criminal justice, sacred games etc. And movies like Stree, andhadun, Badhai ho, bala, manjhi, special 26, jolly llb, bajrangi bhaijan etc. have real content, they r not copied thats y people liked those movies, i think akki deserves better movies.

And most importantly, there are attempts of comedy in serious situations which didn't fit well.Mr. Akshay Kumar has added his own flavor as far as comedy goes and his experience in the film industry shows in his character when he turns Laxmi.A good message in the movie, but I understand this story has been used before in a south Indian film.Regarding Laxxmi's powers, I think there are unnecessary exaggerations, like change of clothes when the main character is possessed, and superhuman powers like vanishing and appearing somewhere else. After all the main character is human, and power to vanish and re-appear seems rather childlike. Writers should take note of this.The scenes are well knitted and it will keep you glued except when songs and dance numbers appear unecessarily.Overall, you should watch this movie at least once.

The brother who does mata ka jagran : Funny man ..and in various instance fun made of mata ka jagran.\n2. Hindu tantric at the first scene : a Fraud tantric who uses tricks to fool people ( Asif exposes such baba)3 : HINDU Priest : who himself says that he is not much capable and can't handle ghost ( it's said his license must be cancelled..then made fun..he is not a doctor whose license can be cancelled..but just a priest)\n3. Orthodox HINDU father : Who hates Asif just because he is Muslim..later realize that Asif is the best Man for his daughter..no other man in the world would be more perfect.\n4. The Villans : Hindu family who are also very religious..\n5. A Hindu priest who helps the Villans to tackle ghost.\n6. Hindu temple is Safe House for Villans..and good ghost laxmii can't enter it( though he/she was seen dancing infront of lord Shiva a minute earlier) then Asif enter the Temple to catch the criminal and bring him out of the Hindu temple.B. Next comes the positive Characters and places:1: Asif - finds out fraud Hindu tantric and exposes them. A dedicated husband. An emotional man who in the latter part voluntarily let's the ghost come inside his body so that the ghost can take revenge.\n2: Peer Baba : Much Much more powerful than The Hindu priest ( who surrendered that he can't handle ghost) and also much powerful than the Christian priest that Ashwini mentioned.3. Abdul chacha : Only good man whom laxmii respect..as he is the only man who gave laxmii shelter inspite of knowing that he/she is a transgender.4 : Darga : Full Hindu family has only faith in darga/ peer baba and not in the Hindu priest or Christian priest (Ashwini mentioned of) Darga is so powerful place that laxmii fears to enter.Ps: please use Telegram or Torrent if you really want to watch the movie .. don't use Hotstar even if you have subscription..!",

Kiara Advani was decent.The communcal angle displayed in the movie is pathetic and senseless. Climax is very poor. Script, story telling and performances are extremely bad.The original Movie (Kanchana) was way better. Rating on a scale of 1-10. Kanchana get 7 and Laxmi get -7. The movie is a big disaster and this movie has beaten Sadak 2 to become the worst written and directed movie.I liked him very much in Gabbar, Holiday, Baby, but regret to see his acting in Laxmi. He looks tired, bad on most of the parts and looks pathetic while portraying the role of Laxmi.Somewhere during the movie I just cross-checked if the movie was directed by Sajid Khan, because he mainly has such pathetic humour and direction skills.",

Hindu Panditji shows the way to detect ghost in the house but can't cast it away and the female characters come out of temple bad mouthing him.

They have tried to portray one religion as good and other as bad or incapable for example showing that Hindu priests and people are incapable or fraud or bad while muslim priests are powerful and people are caring. Instead of showing human nature in general, the makers have tried to show lies and use the movie to spread false messages.

I don't know what creators were thinking when they started this project.(Kanchana - horror - comedy - acting - action = Laxmii ), Reasons :1. The Hindu-Muslim (inter-religion marriage) angle could have avoided to be introduced in the plot. Instead of that, they could have easily shown other issues like parents of girl have problems of love marriage, but no, showing Hindu-Muslim type of propaganda was far important than that. And suddenly father of the girl started thinking the boy is best choice for his daughter out of nowhere and without any specific reason. Really, even if both, girl and boy, were from same community, it would not have affected the plot/storyline. Don't know what's the point to introduce the love-jihad type of angle unnecessarily.2. A Hindu priest himself say that he can not ward off or control the evil spirit, even though he is one who helps the family to check whether there is an evil spirit in the house or not. Whereas, a Muslim baba easily controlled the spirit. Feels like the movie is doing some kind of Islam promotion. And the Mata bhajan is a parody of a rap song, really? (showing Hinduism in low light)3. The Genre of the movie according to the creator are : Action, Comedy, Horror. But sorry to say, there is no horror, no comedy. And action? LOL. Funny scenes are horrific and Horror scenes are funny.4. We all know acting skills of all the star cast, but one can easily notice none of them was actually acting. Not even average acting. Worst performances.5. The only good thing about this movie is Sharad Kelkar. Good acting.Please do yourselves a favor and watch \"Tarak Mehta ka Oolta Chashma\" instead. \ud83e\udd23P.s. : DEAR BOLLYWOOD, PLEASE DON'T COPY IF YOU CAN'T PASTE.",

No one could have played this role better than him. And that Bam Bholle song was a treat what an energy man!!! Sharad Kelkar was a riot. Kiara was sweet needs to improve but was a fun. Burj Khalifa song played and the theatre audience cant keep quiet but cheer loudly.First half dialogues are childish. Direction by Raghava Lawrence is superb.\nI didn't like the South's Kanchana because of its childish camerawork and below par execution but Laxmii is much matured one. Absolute entertainer not to be missed at any cost. Would have easily done 250cr at Indian box office. HARD LUCK AKSHAY KUMAR.And trailer was a big time disguise this is much much more than a comedy.",

In my opinion the original movie was far far better than what this is. But none the less Akshay and Sharad's acting gave the movie really nice touch but, it doesn't matter that you have the best cast when story is not that good written.\nThat's why I'll give 1 star for actors performance and 1 star for the last bam bholle song that's it.",

He is in race to beat another group of mindless actors (Khans), but so far really didn't have any success to reach their elite \"multi core club). So to make up for that he does 4-5 movies per year, while other khans do one or two and make what he makes with 4-5 movies. So anyways in this movie he plays real life Kumar, where he is man in the morning and woman at night. His wife twinkle twinkle little star become big star and he becomes little kumar. So it's another mindless movie about so called superstar turning to woman in bed and wife turning to man. I have heard it's inspired from his real life stories.",

Storyline was very poor, comedy dialogues are not so laughing, it's look like someone is trying me to laugh by force. So the most waited movie of the year fails to keep its mark. Acting was good by Akshay as always, others are avvarage. But in a small screenplay and role Sharad Kelkar is outstanding. At the end of the movie everyone will remember his acting. Songs are also unbearable. I haven't seen The original one Kanchana but this one I can't take.",

            "content": "As a liberal and secular citizen of India, I was expecting that this movie will do justice to the \"COMMUNITY\" that has had to deal with so much shame and mental trauma throught their existence.But I was wrong!The list of problems:1. Portrays women as weak:Akshay says, \"Agar is ghar mein bhoot hua toh maa kasam main churiyan pehen lunga.\"Dude, calm down with your toxic masculinity. Bangles are beautiful, and this shows the mentality of the director who thinks that women are a weaker section of the society.2. Making hurtful and false slogans.Slgans like \"Na mard, na aurat. Main dono hun\" are a major problem.There are trans people who identify as men, there are trans people who identify as women, and there are trans people who identify as trans, it is as simple as that. To say they are nothing but they are both is to just perpetuate all the misunderstandings that have existed about them all this while.3. Cultural lies!Among trans folks, especially hijras or aravanis (as they are called in Tamil Nadu), Lord Aravan (one of Arjun's son from Mahabharata) is regarded as their patron God. It was for Aravan that Lord Krishna took the Mohini avatar and married him just a day before he died a heroic death. The Koovagam festival in Tamil Nadu is celebrated by trans folks for the commemoration of this moment from the Hindu epic. The climax scene in the Tamil version of Laxmii takes place in front of an Aravan statue. However, for the Hindi version, the filmmakers have taken the creative liberty of replacing it with an Ardhanarishvara (a composite form of the Hindu deities Shiva and Parvati) statue. Not only is this meddling with the trans culture but also with the trans identity because again the trans identity is projected as a mixture of male and female and not an entire identity in itself.4. The Curse Of The LaxmiThe film has dialogues referring to how a kinnar's curse can ruin a family. In the film a priest tells the film's villain MLA Girja (played by Tarun Arora) that things are going bad for the family just 'coz he killed a kinnar.Things should be going wrong for anyone who kills anyone but the movie propagates that it happens due to the transgender curse.5. Zero CONTINUITY!From childlike VFX to zero continuity, everything happens in the film in the most haphazard way. The film has nothing in the name of continuity and the eye soar of a song 'Burj Khalifa' has literally been smashed right in the middle as subtly as it takes to sew a yellow patch on a red cloth!Want to waste your hard earned money on a movie that does no justice to the TRANSGENDER COMMunitt and actually makes FUN of them?Go ahead!",

Much questions need to be asked of the OTT platform which aired this putrid bile. Netflix, Prime, Zee, etc. bolstered with subscriber additions (mostly Hindus) do hardly any to disprove their increasing anti-Hindu brazenness, either.All said and done- This remains a worthy movie to watch if you prefer self-flagellation.",

There were instances that made us laugh, and there were instances which made us shiver out of fear. Lawrence attempted to recreate that perfect combo in Bollywood aiming a wider audience with a bigger budget and starcast.\nThis however failed miserably , as with most Bollywood remakes. Neither scares nor entertains.\nIt is quite surprising since Raghava himself made the original and even starred as the lead.\nAlthough the remake is almost a frame-to-frame copy, what falls short is poor dialogues which doesn't give justice to the screenplay. Dialogue writing is an art. Quality of a scene can be elevated with good lines and delivery. Most original films in respective language does throws a punch with every lines. Hindi, Tamil, Telugu , Malayalam, Kannada does have movies which had great scenes let down by poor lines while dubbing. KGF was good, but listening the lines in Kannada provides you goosebumps, so does Baahubali. This film sounds more like a Hindi dubbed south Indian film. Thats the quality of dialogues.\nAkshay did justice to his role and so did Sharad Kelkar. Kiara Advani did the same as Rai Laxmi in tamil. Look pretty and be on the film. Devadarshini and Kovai Sarala proved they are pioneers in physical comedy and comic timing in Kanchana. Sadly that's what is lost in remake. Much of the comedy in original was by the legendary Kovai Sarala whom we followed blindly in her laughs and screams. Here, sadly the replacement cast is not upto mark. They are not sure if they need to be serious or comic in this film, swithcing between the two even in the same scene. Rajesh Sharma was the only proper comic relief that too only for a while.\nThe entire blame should be directed to Raghava who like other south directors tried to do the same as he did in Tamil entirely ignoring the fact that taste of audience is different and so is their culture and beliefs. Raghava had no control over the dialogues which he mindlessly dubbed to Hindi. He also rushed throughout the film, not allowing time for audience to connect with horror elements or the lead characters. Maybe he got too excited with big stars and budget. Better he sticks only in Tamil.\nOverall it is just a decent movie.\nWhy poor reviews? Radical Hindus / andhbakts are too involved emotionally with their religion. Laxmi bomb is a diwali cracker in market not insult to Laxmi Devi. The day these buffoons grow a brain, the nation will prosper. Else, everything is entangled with caste and religion. The world is miles ahead and yet we are stuck in the web of narrow minded morons.",

In hollywood it's the recent fascination of forcing in colored characters (Black) and asian characters(Chinese) whether they fit the role or not. All in the name of equality, feminism etc.. A trend has also started to make male characters female. Realllyyyy. Same here. Let me elaborate one scene:\nThe Hindu priest doesn't have the power to control the spirit (even though the spirit is hindu) but the 'peer baba' does ? And the same priest later conveniently tells a method to get rid of the spirit. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against any community but when u force this mockery down people's throats it will be pointed out. The Hindu Muslim angle in marriage is being milked by many filmmakers, I can live with that. But tell me exactly how introducing 'peer baba' (again no disrespect) was constructive to the movie. I also have a problem with the temple scene at end. Revenge can be understood. But the scene shows 'Asif' who had no business being there forcing the 'villain' out to be killed by the spirit. If the villain was killed while the spirit possessed asif body it would not have stood out. But he was in control of his senses and decided to participate in bloody murder. What message is this sending. That whenever u feel someone has been wronged, take matters into ur hands and commit bloody murder.\nNever expected this sort of movie from a guy like Akshay Kumar whom I consider one of the few patriotic filmstars in the industry.\nIn a nutshell the movie is a poorly made up 'khichdi' of horror & comedy with appeasement ( to target a particular audience) thrown in.",

Laxmii could have been another bhul bhulaiya but seems the writers were not so interested in dialogues but more on subtly promoting hinduphobia and repetitive displaying muslim characters as messiah! It would have been absolutely fine if it was once or twice but this happened throughout the movie repetitively which made it extremely evident.\nAkshay Kumars Acting is good but dialogues are literally silly! Comedy is non existent in the movie! We were literally looking at each other throughout these dialogues and wondering if the writers felt these lines could make anyone laugh! eg: there is a mother drinking alcohol! Is that the best you could do to make people laugh?\nForced hinduphobia & muslim worshiping:\nLead character is a muslim! Which was unnecessary but still fine!\nThe lead character goes on to show some hindu baba making fool of people! Which was also ok!\nThen the girls dad is a kattar hindu and hates muslim! Which is also fine!\nThen Asif is teaching girls dad about Islam and. Dad is suddenly impressed! It seemed so wierd! Cz it was clearly forced into the script! Was a total fail! Still ok!\nThen the guy gets possessed and they go to a hindu priest to get rid of it! Guess what? He says it's not in his power to get rid of the ghost! And then they go to a maulana who is 1st promoting ajmer dargah and then comes and gets rid of the ghost! The latter part is still okay but why would anyone want to show that a hindu priest is powerless but maulana is powerful? Clearly something is being promoted subtly!\nThen again hindu family kicks out the trans kid from their house and a guy named Abdul wearing a cap takes care of him! Again completely unnecessary! Is they wanted to promote religious unity they could have chosen a Christian or sikh character but seems muslims are the only good people according to the filmmakers!\nThe worst of all is the lead villian! He's character is introduced with him calling up a hindu priest and asking for a pooja (completely unnecessary and pointless) basically kattar hindu with Shiva murti in the background! But guess what he's the worst person of all!\nNo matter how hard you try to ignore the Hindu phobia in this movie it just bounces back even stronger! Clearly the writer/director had a motive but Akshay Kumar chose to completely ignore it!Only good part: watch it for sharad Kelkar! He's a gem! And his 10 mins acting made me forget how senseless this movie is atlst for those 10 mins when he was on screen!",

Then to top it off with some mata ka jagrata with a joke that let's say I personally did not get. Another point I want to make is that I for one thought we are past making these kinds of films. This is a 70-80s film to be honest just shot with a better camera. People are deliberately trying to give good performances but seriously the writing is very bad! I really do not know who was deciding what is correct for the movie! Listen to this - 'Aatma kisike khoon ki pyaasi hai' turns to '100% confirmed(scream)', I mean who signed off on this? Throughout the movie a girls laugh, ghungroo, bangles and crying are used for horror effect - Classic. Some shots have really great lighting and are extremely well shot but then they are few ( but then a well shot music video also has them in today's day and age ). Did i mention for one scene the mom is shown to be very well Urdu speaker????? Yes my expression exactly why??? What's the joke??? Then the movie loses sense and well who signed off on this???

I don't know how I sat through the movie even with the 3 breaks that I took because I couldn't handle the poor performances, plot, narrative.\nIt is a combination of bad performances, poor jokes, overacting by all and just way too long a build-up which leads to am even more disappointing end.The female lead, Kiara Advani almost makes you believe that she is a real person unlike her past performances.

Please try to cast actresses atleast in your age range or maybe a decade younger. Not half of your age! Kiara was a lamp. No idea why she was there. Comedy movies or horror in this case shouldn't be preachy. We already have enough of that in our lives. The only plus point is Sharad Kelkar as Laxxmi. He reminded me of Sarat Kumar. I guess the 1* is for him and maybe 1 more for the climax. But I saw the original and -1 for a really messy creation",
