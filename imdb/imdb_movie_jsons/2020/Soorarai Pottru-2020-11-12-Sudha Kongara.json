Entertainment value next level, which I can say even I haven't watched a movie like this in Hollywood or any other industries. If someone say this movie doesn't have a good story plot, then probably that person doesn't know what is an epic story. Music in this movie does its best with unbeatable sounds that makes you amaze. In whole movie I didn't even saw a single scene which doesn't have no logic. This should hit The Indian Best film ever. Such a superb emotional beats that even made me cry. Suriya and all other cast had made their best action to make this film best. Beginning, ending, pacing, dialogue, editing, cinematography, camera work, costume design etc. had done their best to make this movie \"Nothing better than this Soorarai Pottru\"",

And, his character 'Nedumaaran Rajangam' is full of \ud83d\udd25. #AparnaBalamurali is amusing in a terrifically-written character. The chemistry between the lead is something to talk about, there are multiple sequences between their sparkling eyes that creates magic. All the supporting artists have a purpose and have done complete justice to their roles.Easily brings in the emotional attachment from the very beginning, gets us highly invested and feel for the characters. Tears and goosebumps guaranteed. Whatever mood the scenes carry gets transformed to the viewers too, which is a crucial part of the filmmaking art, loud applause to director #SudhaKongara and team. Cinematic liberty is utilized to the perfect level, knowing the limit to which audience will be okay to believe, placing an important part of the flashback in the President-Meeting scene is a perfect example of that. The film never loses its focus from the story, on-point. Intensity-level of certain situations is sure to increase our pulse rate. There's so much that is going on-screen and the beauty is it's so clearly conveyed and the flow is seamless. Dialogues add so much value to the subject and they are very naturally placed, word choices and the slang too. Amidst the bunch of memorable scenes, business meet with villain in his flight, Udipi Hotel sequence, All India Radio interview and the climax stand out.#GVPrakash's musical treatment is rich. The songs have impressed already, visually-good too. Except for a couple of minor facts that the opening number could have choreographed in a better manner and some songs have been cut-shortened in the film. The camera work is outstanding. Set work, costumes and make-up are apt for the timeline of the setting. Some tiny jump cuts looked odd, otherwise, the film has been neatly-edited. Feels slightly stretched towards the end. Also, VFX could have been better in the flight-in-the-air shots.\nDirect #OTT release,\nnow streaming on #AmazonPrimeVideo.",

He does take you on a rollercoaster ride, makes you cry and makes your blood boil.\nAparna Balamurali finally gets something to show off her ability. The character she plays is not just another woman character to romance the lead. She is a pillar that props up the lead. The other pillar? The mother, played by the great Urvashi.\nKarunas, Vivek, Krishna Kumar, Gnanasambandham have been incredible. No matter how short the roles are,they do make an impact in the story, perhaps guide the protagonist and support him in his journey.\nMohan Babu as Naidu was a pleasant addition. Adding goosebumps when the protagonist lose all hopes.\nParesh Rawal- in his Tamil debut- does a brilliant job as the ruthless cunning antagonist.\nVijay Kumar- the dialogue writer- deserves an applause- every line was fuel to the fire that burns up in veins of viewers.\nSudha Kongara- the director- shows us she can make biopics that can give you goosebumps, a film that you ll remember, a story that can inspire you to dream the impossible, a movie that engages you for two and a half hours without letting your attention go astray.",

            "review_title": "Roller coaster ride of emotions just aweome.",
            "content": "Plus PointsSuriya gives one of his career-best performances with this film. The intensity which we have been missing in Suriya's recent performances is brought back superbly by the star actor. From scene one, Suriya is magnificent as the restless soul who wants to fulfill his dreams. Be it in the interval scene where his dream is shattered or the climax episode, where he goes through a roller coaster of emotions, Suriya steals the show and will arrest you with his performance.One of the biggest pillars of the film is the heroine Aparna Balamurali. She gives solid support to Suriya and plays the doting wife's role supremely well. The way she looks, expresses her emotions, and showcases solid chemistry with Suriya is the major asset of the film. Mohan Babu does not have much screen time but in the three scenes he gets, the legendary actor impresses and brings depth to the film.One can not forget the emotional aspect of the film. Sudha Kongara's writing is so strong that every emotion works in the film. The husband-wife angle, mother-son relationship, and conflict between Suriya and Paresh Rawal, all these episodes have gripping emotions.Paresh Rawal is classy in his role and brings a lot of depth to the film. The production design is solid and visuals of the bygone era have been showcased in a superb manner. The film is filled with several goosebump oriented scenes and will impress you with its engaging narration.\nMinus PointsThe film runs on a very serious note and that is the reason some of the regular audiences who expect something from Suriya will be disappointed. Also, the pace of the film is a bit slow as the story unfolds leisurely and in detail. The first ten minutes post interval becomes dull with too much melodrama. There are no special twists or turns in the story and the proceedings are straightforward.Technical AspectsThis film is super strong in terms of its technical Aspects. Music and BGM are a major plus as GV Prakash fills life into the proceedings. The camerawork is astonishing as the village set up and aviation backdrop are showcased nicely. The VFX used for the film is also top-notch. Satyadev dubs for Suriya and it takes at least ten minutes for you to adjust to his voice. But once that is done, Satyadev does so well. The lyrics, Telugu dubbing, and costume design, everything falls in place perfectly.Coming to the director Sudha Kongara, she has proved her worth once again. The manner in which she mixes facts with nice fictional elements was so good to see. Sudha stays true to the emotions and showcases gritty drama which is the biggest highlight of the film. She makes us root for Suriya's character right through the film and this is where you get connected to the emotions of a man who dreams big and shows how things are achieved.\nVerdictOn the whole, Aakasam Ne Haadu Ra is one of Suriya's best performances to date as he lives in his role and takes us on a roller coaster of emotions. The setup, amazing performances, superb production values, and engaging drama light up the screen from scene one. Barring a slightly slower pace, this is one of the very well made films in recent times and makes up for an inspiring watch. Don't miss it.",

Yes, it was - mainly because it has played to many formulas - an overly idealistic male protagonist, love that blooms against all hardships, a super brutal villain, blow after blow to good people, and good triumphing over evil. This is the basic hero victory plot that many movies try to follow - but thanks to tight writing, good actors, and other camera elements, it succeeds here.That said, to follow this formula, the writer has taken huge liberties with logic and realism. I don't expect movies to have complete logic and be totally realistic, but I do expect a good portion of these in a semi-biopic. Also, by following the cliched arc, the director has let go of a more nuanced character development. The protagonists are all oh-so-perfect. The antagonists are laughably over-the-top horrible. The wife is loyalty and encouragement personified. The villagers are all touchingly generous. Please give us a break.I am okay with people saying they liked the film. I am just concerned that most of them claim they identify with Maran and they are inspired and such bs. Anyone who wants to become an entrepreneur or \"change the world\" or some trope like that - please take this film with a pinch of salt. Everything is a lot more grey in reality. Also, please don't go around claiming this is the best movie of the decade and such. It sounds too funny.",

            "content": "Soorarai Pottru (2020) :\nBrief Review -A Major achievement for Tamil Cinema and Suriya in making a Perfect Biographical Classic. Just one word for this film AWESOME. A biographical genre which mostly lacks correct sense of inspirational content (refering to negative characters), emotional intelligence and perfect dramatic value finally gets the most balanced product in Tamil industry. Soorarai Pottru is inspired from a true story of a common man who dedicated all his efforts just to make common people fly in airlines and finish the casteism of rich and poor. The writing is top notch not just because it is a tale of heart-touching journey of one man but because it is a film of all people who supported him and had faith in him. The struggle level in this film is on such a hectic level that one might have given up long ago but this man was blessed to have highly supporting wife, mother, friends and his own troops who stood with him against powerful enemies. Every character in the film is beautifully written with detailing to the core and easily connectable nature whether it is positive or the negative one. Suriya in lead role is unstoppable right from the first scene. His different looks, different reactions, difference situations and different expressions could be felt as if he was living the character in real. I haven't seen him doing so deep study of a character in any of his film. Paresh Rawal and Aparna Balamurali are terrific in strongly written roles. The music is good too and unexpectedly not cliche as we see in most of south films which ruins the tempo and mood of film's concept. This amazing script needed a skillful brain to handle it skillfully and to not ruin it by making it typical commercial film of south and god bless Sudha Kongara, who had exactly the same skills. The only thing missing was structural development during airlines constructions, it didn't show much about it when it was the most vital part of the story. Overall, A FILM OF THE YEAR. This unheard story MUST BE SEEN BY EVERY INDIAN. A CLASSIC !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

But its for the fact that the way south Indian movies are made no one can leave the movie by getting offended on any scene. They are true to the audience, complete family movies with rich touch of religions and traditions.\nStarring suriya, soorarai pottru is a genius masterpiece. A rag to riches drama had every emotion blended so beautifully that anyone can be mesmerized in movie even after 20 mins of it.\n150 min long film are seen as lengthy now a days but if make correctly it gives a gem like this one.Every actor did a splendid job, specially suriya. His bonding with his father is shown se beautiful. The way movie is directed is so good, songs are blended very beautifully within the film and even being a non tamilian, i can feel the importance of those songs on that occasion only with the way those are created. This movie is pure magic.Honestly, i have never seen much from tamil industry, might be some movies which are greater than this but for now it is definitely my favorite tamilian movie ever.\nPerfect Diwali gift from the south",

            "content": "Roosevelt once said, \"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams\". Surya's new movie Soorarai Pottru can be handily deciphered using that quote.Well, the story is loosely based on the life of G.R Gopinath, the founder of Simplifly Deccan, formerly known as Air Deccan. But the story penned by Sudha Kongara took the liberty of changing the whole atmosphere to suit the cinematic language, where Gopinath became Maaran along with the portrayal of other characters.The story is no different from the usual inspirational movies that garner the viewer's appreciations. The story goes like this. A man from the lower section of society tries to achieve his dream, and while striving to make it a reality, he had to follow a path of thorns and sharp stones. Yes, it's the same old story.However, the characters are strong and their profundity makes the movie engaging. The stellar performances from the likes of Surya, Aparna, Urvashi, Paresh, Mohan Babu and many others take the movie to another level. The music by GVP is also worth mentioning. The soul of the movies like this finds the way with tunes like this.The presence of bold female characters and depictions of lower Indian society tries to talk more than the story of a person trying to fly high. Certain caricatures like Ballaiyya (Vijay Mallya) and the likes of many others are in the movie.Since the movie is loosely based, let's say that these characters are arranged for enhancing the cinematic experience. Wait, there is a scene from one of these characters that give goosebumps. Watch the movie and experience it. Let's keep it a secret.Apart from prominent features, I felt a lack of WOW factor at times. Especially, the climax should be more worked in that way. But Sudha's version went for melodrama in those places. As mentioned earlier, this story is meant to be an inspirational one, and when such a story is presented on-screen it should be able to provide in full with horripilation. But that was missing from the climax.Meanwhile, when we look at the bigger picture the movie as a whole is thought-provoking and enthralling that compels the viewers to experience the hardships that Maaran confronted in his way to achieve his dream.This is a movie that deserved a theatrical release. Sudha Kongara's directorial debut provided a quality OTT release among the likes of many who provided lacklustre experiences to the viewers. As a fan of the OTT platform, I expect much more quality movies to reach the comfort of our home.",

            "content": "The very first scene itself was like any Vijay movie. The airport does not give permission to land Surya's flight (due to Villain's influence) in Chennai Airport. If they still land the plane in Chennai Airport, their plane might be impounded (again due to Villain's influence). So, Surya advises to land the plane in Tambaram airforce runway. Surprisingly, by the time the flight reaches from Meenambakkam to Tambaram, Surya somehow reaches Tambaram just in a bike.\nI thought only Rajni and Vijay could do this. Now, welcome to the list, Surya! Surya himself drives the plane at a point of time, he is also a flight mechanic or engineer, he is also CEO. What not!\nAfter seeing an overwhelming positive response, at least expected the movie to be realistic. Do know that some heroisms are added to make the movie lively, but since the movie is based on real-life incidents, too much heroism was bad.\nWhole of Surya's village paying for him also sounds unbelievable. Reminds me of Sangamam movie.\nI also did not like the emotional scene where Surya is not able to pay for flight. Actually I believe that army officers who can fly engines are well paid and It's bit unbelievable that he did not have money. Considering that he had money, but did not take the money to airport is also unlikely, as in an era where flights were less common, he should have assumed the worse case of unavailability of economic class ticket and took more money. That scene was not okay, at least for me.\nBut I liked the scenes which involved the heroine. It's nice see a determined character as a heroine in movies rather than trying to portray them as cute idiot dolls.\nMusic was decent. The yellowish shade of cinematography was actually not pleasant to watch. I think they are good for movies that show the underworld, not for the ones like this.\nOver-all the movie was okayish. But I'm glad that this movie worked out for Surya. He was waiting for a break for a long time.",

Sudha K, Surya, most importantly, who light-heartedly, yet impeccably, portrayed Maaran, the revolutionary leader who managed to let his villagers fly with the help of \"Deccan Air\" the paradigm and beginning of the thought-provoking concept of low cost aviation... He takes us on a rollercoaster of emotions, and so does Aparna Balamurali, with the portrayal of the bold, head strong character of Bommi and yet again, the fiesty old mother of Maaran, played by Urvashi...and notably... This is an ideal film.. with every element of a film beautifully indulged into perfection... I would congratulate Surya for portraying the character of Sri. CAPTAIN GOPINATH with such immense, utmost sincerity... And this is really one of the best films of his career... I literally cried for about 15 minutes continuously, when Maaran meets Sri.APJ Abdul Kalam and then there is a flashback of his ultimate inspiration behind beginning the whole revolution in the field of low cost Aviation... Just loved it guys... It's a must watch...\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Truly inspiring... Even the supporting cast members as well as even those characters who just appear for one shot have done it well, with great timing and realisticism.. Paresh Rawal as the villain counts for every typical, brutal, narcissistic business tycoon that we see in most movies who steeps down to any level for getting his things done... The film is quite emotional ... All of this makes it a must watch, for it beautifully engages us and inculcates belief in the quote that \"Once we dream something, and let ourselves believe that it is achievable, and work towards it, the whole world and the nature together conspires to transform it to reality",

The various hurdles he faces and how he overcomes it is the rest of the film.\nEverybody likes motivational films because after watching it one gets a sense of hope and positivity. The film shows maaran's road to success as bumpy as possible until the end. The performances are the main highlight. Suriya sir is fantastic as maaran. Aparna balamurali comes with a good debut in tamil. Urvasi is brilliant as usual. After long time, I am seeing paresh rawal in a negative role and he was very cool in it.

Of course, movies exaggerate everything out of real life incidents but this movie has taken so so many things out of context that it's unbearable to watch. Instead of calling the airline Deccan Air (original Air Deccan), they could have called this just about anything else!! Pineapple airlines would suit them best to be honest.The 9.1 ratings for this movie is a clear indication of India's herd mentality. Nobody wants to get into the details and find out who is what and what exactly happened. They just wanted Suriya to act like a goon and build an airline. Oh yes, in Tamil Nadu.",

Thanks to Sudha Kongara.\nLoosely based on the real life story of Mr. G.R. Gopinath, founder of Air Deccan and the book Simply Fly : A Deccan Odyssey delivered a wonderful cinematic experience. She once again proved that she is a brilliant director. The story, screenplay and the narration, she reigned in all aspects.\nGV Prakash Kumar, the man who gave the movie a life with his scintillating background score and songs and was well placed.\nAparna Balamurali, the female lead delivered in and out performances as Sundari. Urvashi played the mom's role with ease and her emotional performances were commendable. Karunas, Krishnakumar, Kaali Venkat, Vivek Prasanna, Achyuth Kumar, Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, Mohan Babu and the other actors who played even the small roles stamped their own charisma.\nThe cinematography was top notch. Thanks to Niketh Bommireddy, the man behind the camera.An enigmatic Cinema Experience.10 on 10Missed this in Big Screen. due to the pandemic.. Corona..\"Don;t miss this..

Definitely his best performance till date!Soorarai potru easily the best film of this decade, thani oruvan was my previous favourite, this has replaced that now.Sudha kongara - Wowww , chance less , the screenplay never bored us always kept us at the edge. I like technically correct films and this satisfies my appetite for such movies. Thanks a lot !Surya - What a man !! I have always been a great fan of surya , and this movie has only made me feel in awe for this man . The best movie for the man , pushing Varanam ayiram second.Aparna Balamurali - Great talent , sooperly sketched character.GV Prakash- The music track has been really good. But in my opinion Gv prakash BGM , could have been more eruptive in certain scenes, the only drawback I could say , that too only on comparison with the quality of the movie.Urvashi ,Karunas and others - they have done justice to the film , and all characters wer sooperly sketched.My humble suggestion , don't miss the film , I m already sooperly motivated.\nThanks team Soorari potru.",

Dream Wish is that every Man needs a sensible, bold, romantic Bommi in their life.\nA big salute to Sudha for breaking the MYTH that MEN FEEL WEAK IF THEY CRY. On screen every tear Maara sheds looks so meaningful, natural and intense that, we too cry along with him Irrespective of gender.\nThe struggles which Maara faces can be identified in everyone's real life . Hence the victory for the story and ths screenplay... Supporting characters like Oorvasi, Kali Venkat, Karunas excite you with their perfect, flawless acting. GV's BGM are so into the heart that you don't realise there is a music running at the background. Camera work is top notch and so are the Dialogues ....\nExpect another movie between the same combo.

            "content": "With Soorarai Pottru, writer-director Sudha Kongara once again shows that she can make strong underdog stories in the commercial format. I can confidently say that this is the Suriya movie that we've all been waiting for. As Nedumaaran (a.k.a Maara), he brings his A-game in every scene, whether it be romancing Sundari (Aparna Balamurali, in a memorable role), breaking into tears with his mother (played to great effect by Urvashi), or going neck-and-neck with Paresh Goswami (Paresh Rawal, as the baddie). Vijay Kumar's dialogues lend the screenplay a very natural, credible, and relatable flavor (\"nee oru socialite, naan oru socialist\", \"nammaloda airline vaanathil parakkapora oru Udupi hotel\", and more).The supporting cast is an efficient lot here. Mohan Babu, Karunas, Vivek Prasanna, Kaali Venkat, Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, and Prakash Belawadi all get decently written scenes. Soorarai Pottru has more to do with Nedumaaran's quest to launch a low-cost airline that's accessible for every Indian, but it's also a solid family drama. The intricacies of Maaran's and Sundari's relationship are woven beautifully into the screenplay which moves at a brisk pace. Yes, it does have the mass masala moments and angles, but unlike in say a film like Kaappaan, they blend well to take the story forward rather than appearing tedious.Paresh Goswami feels a little like the corporate version of Hari Dada (from Pa. Ranjith's Kaala), despising the idea of poor people taking flights and foiling every move that Maaran makes. Suriya and Rawal play each other off well, making every scene of theirs worth a second viewing. But Goswami, on his own, is pretty dull and cardboard-like. He doesn't seem to have anything to look forward to, except ruining Maaran's life and this makes him one-note. The film also plays the safety card of letting us know in almost every frame depicting the IAF that it's all fictionalized, even with two disclaimers at the beginning and a closing card that says 'based on several true stories from low-cost aviation'.Coming to the technicalities, the CGI plane crash looks slightly messy (but not as bad as I was thinking it'd be) but the rest of the film holds up with its dazzling production design, glossy visuals (by Niketh Bommireddy), and mood-setting music (by G.V Prakash Kumar). Soorarai Pottru is one of those movies that could have been infinitely more enjoyable if experienced on the big screen purely owing to the big acting moments that Suriya, and to an extent Aparna, excel in. He is probably the only one among the present crop of Tamil superstars who can really add intensity to emotional scenes. For that and a mostly engaging narrative, Soorarai Pottru is worth sitting down for.",

Singam , ngk nothing else really got his fullest potential like sudha did , the fact that he transformed himself for the role like its 2008 is no joke . To the international audience here , this is kind of a film which fights a faulty system also a biography kind of movie . The fact that \" heroine \" or so called \"actor\" of another gender according to sudha , gets to shine throughout the movie while the story his about a single man's impossible dream is also a biggest achievement in indian cinema . There are many other nuances like hero goes and literally asks for money to his wife ( which doesnt feel forced ) there can be filmmakers who can copy feminism to attract viewers . But here , its just equality. Hero's dad dies of sickness, hero has to reach home from army camp to his village , what stops him ? No money ? Nope , the system . Brilliantly acted by suriya , i had tears flowing .I cant stress this enough . Sudha is one of the very few directors who manages.to make entertaining movies with strong hitting subjects . She will \" fly \" more than her current status . As for suriya , this marks his seconds innings , super excited for what he does next !Did not talk about music , cinematography in length , they are very apt and outstanding , specially one scene comes to my mind while writing this , the scene where suriya is driving the bike near airport , the plane takes off and suriya slowly stands up in the bike following that plane . Brilliantly shot and edited .FALL A 100 times , GET UP LIKE A \"SINGAM \"( LION )IT ( HE ) DOESNT NEED A WEAPON. HE BECAME ONE .10/10.",

Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!",

But, some themes of competing businessman's only job is to pull down the hero looks cliche and age old. And, the other cliche is portraying hero as Socialist uplifter of poor and the Mallayas/Jet Airways as a socialite balking in riches. Come on, in reality, these are 2 different businessman with different business models and ambitions. And, the sad story is the airlines was finally merged with Kingfisher which is conveniently changed with a hero's punch on Dreams and bla bla.But, neverthless, all characters have an impact performance especially Urvashi and the father character. And, after a long time, we see a hero who was vulnerable and has his own ego. This is by far Surya's best in a looong time.I really wish a movie that portrays businessman as a business minded person rather than a ideological cine-hero of uplifter of masses!!",

Sudha kongara garu direction is Highlighted. She can gave a great message to each audience whom watched this film. There is no difference in Rich-Poor, all are human being. All are having their dreams to fullfill in their lifetime. Suriya sir that airport scene really touched heart. Simply 2hrs time of Inspiration.",

We are introduced to Sundari played by Aparna Balamurali on a train to meet Nedumaaran Rajangam. The character seemed to be a rebel in the beginning, but later we find him to be a calm person who bursts off when suppressed downright.\nThe characters are given to actors who know their job very well. Urvasi, Aparna, Maaran's friends delivers a great performance on screen. Paresh Rawal, Achyut Kumar delivers antagonist role very well. Special mention is needed for 'Poo' Ram who plays Maaran's father. Karunas gives some pleasant jokes in the film. Meanwhile Nedumaaran Rajangam played by Suriya will stay in the hearts for a long haul. This will stay as one of Suriya's career best performance among Nandha and Pitamagan.\nSudha Kongara's screenplay and direction, steer the film. One can argue that she alone holds the complete film in her shoulders. GV Prakash Kumar's music is highly enjoyable and sticks to the mood. The cinematography and the overall color tone are just splendid.\nI personally wished the climatic sequences were a bit more lengthy since it would have been helpful in getting Sudha Kongara her a standing ovation like how she got in Iruthisuttru. Well that need not be considered as a flaw but I felt the film ended soon.\nOverall Soorarai Pottru is the one such film that never makes you take your eye off the screen. It makes your eyes wet at times but the journey or I might flight is smooth and enjoyable.",

Just imagine if someone else dealt with that situation by adding unwanted stuff.#sudhakongara is calm and focused in her. She always tries to extracts the bad or wild phases from her actor's.

I'm sure she's going to bag few more awards in this year.#suriya #aparnabalamurali\nDominating performances throughout the film with due respect of the length.

This is the idea that Sudha Kongara wants to tell to us with her recent outing Soorarai Pottru. Based on real stories, the film follows the protagonist's dream of making every common man fly. The film is held up by Suriya Sivakumar's real to life depiction of Nedumaaran Rajangam and the way he handles both emotional and dialogue based scenes are a treat to watch. He carries the whole film on his shoulders and does so well at it. The supporting cast (Paresh Rawal, Urvashi) are well picked and give support to the main lead but fail to do so at times. Aparna Balamurali portrays Bommi ,a similar character as Nedumaaran ,does her job fairly well. But the lead characters as a pair don't have that chemistry that you expect. Cinematography is excellent and editing is efficient even when the songs are not needed for the story ,is placed forcibly in the screenplay. Background score by GV Prakash Kumar gives that peppy and arrogant tone to the movie which elevates the experience by a mile. The details in the film are a plenty and brings the feel of that 1990-2000s vibe. The story is overall a very enjoyable experience but there are some instances in the film when you feel bored or not into what's happening on the screen. With the intent and story there, I would have liked a more complete product. The film has some issues with dubbing as the dialogues are in a strong Madurai- dialect. But if you are feeling low or is in the mood for a film with a strong core story , this one's a treat to watch.",

Also the main villain was pretty stereotypical and one dimensional which was disappointing. The actors all did amazing jobs with whatever material they had, I really enjoyed the actor who played Surya's dad in this film.

Sorry, then this is not a movie for you! This depicts the struggles of a man in real life who wish to change aviation history.\nYes, the story might have been based on real life events of Gopinath who was the first to provide economy air travel (and others) by starting Simplifly-Deccan, but the struggles they encountered to provide the facility under tough airliners competition is not just Simplif(l)y!\nSurya has done an excellent job in bringing to life the character to steal the show. It is another feather in his cap. Aparna Balamurali as his wife Bommi, who teases, pleases, gives ample support to be with him as a true wife and companion during his struggles. Director Sudha Kongara whose Irudhi Sutru (Final Round) was a hit, has again given a different movie and she needs to be appreciated. Urvashi as Surya's mother, Paresh Rawal as Villainous Paresh Goswamy, the Jas airline owner, Kaali Venkat, Karunaas, Krishna kumar as Che, his friend have done their jobs well. Mohan Babu as Surya's commodore has a pleasant role at the end.\nTechnical values are excellent. G. V. Kumar has provided necessary music suitable for village background.\nThe drawback of this otherwise good film is the length. It could have been trimmed further to bring it under 2 hours.\nThere are many touching scenes like villagers sending money to Maran's account, Surya's desperation to reach the village to see his dying father's face, his initial failures and so on.\nWatch the movie on Amazon Prime OTT platform and let's encourage good movies!",

Suirya's acting, by default, was again great.Now, when you create a movie you tend to put some masala, unnecessary churns, villainous events, and emotions; otherwise, how can you showcase it to the audience. The same falls for biopics. I will say for sure that this movie can't be 100% ture, but again, for me what valued most after watching it was inspiration and motivation.

The loveliest touch is when they make a pact (her suggestion) that their earnings go into a common pool. It's not his income or hers, but theirs. I don't think I've seen household financial decisions being depicted on screen ever, less so when the couple is yet to get hitched. The Maaran-Bommi scenes are the best thing about Soorarai Pottru, directed by Sudha Kongara. (She's a friend. I had a look at an early draft of the script.) Suriya has many big acting moments here, and his most brilliant one is in the scene where - despite that pre-marital pact - Maaran hesitates to ask Bommi for money. Her business is soaring. His is just not taking off. You can see him struggle to bring out the words, which seem stuck in his throat.",

First of all, Big Salute Director Sudha Konkara.Usually when we watch a biopic you feel a little bored. The reason is that the gimmicks seen in the movie do not occur in normal life. Soorarai Pottru is different from this.The Man who said that airplanes are for the common man who has made it possible for people to travel by air for a single rupee. And it is the life of Air Deccan founder G. R Gopinath. His life must have been quite cinematic.Sometimes there are some small compromises when making a real life movie! But director Sudha, her writing, making, Vijay Kumar's dialogues and GV Prakash Kumar's music take the output of the film to another level.Let's take a brief look at the story. The protagonists are the protagonist who has a big dream of starting an airline that is affordable to the common man by avoiding intermediaries and the heroine who lives with a relatively small but strong desire to start her own bakery. The challenges they face, the larger the size of their dreams, the less likely they are to come true, but the human instinct to face the challenges is all accurately drawn.One of the best characters of the actor Surya. What sets Surya apart from other contemporary actors is his acting style which gives him unjust power. His performance, there are no words to describe it. Another testament to his range as an actor.Aparna Balamurali's character was amazing. Aparna, who was the heroine along with Surya was excellent.Urvashi's performance was not surprised because She has proved many times as a wonderful actress. That sentimental scene that performed magnificently. And finally a scene where the lady pilot who flew the flight looks on in amazement.A Movie that can be seen with eyes and mind full. The only downside is that it was a miss from the theater.Soorarai Pottru is a master watch movie. Movie lovers should never miss this.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant tamil film, after a very long time...",
            "content": "Feeling very happy to watch a meaningful and inspirational film after a very very long time. I have not seen anything like this in tamil cinema before. I wouldnt say that it really inspired me... But, I was pleasantly surprised to see a film with great direction. Surely, Sudha Kongara is a great director. Her meticulous work clearly shows. For Sooriya, after Anbuchelvan and Sanjay Ramasamy, Nedumaaran Raajangam may be a good meaningful character in his career (after a looooong time). Dialogues were very impressive. And the film has many interesting moments. All the actors in the film have given great performances. G.V.Prakash's music was apt for the film, with Veyyon silli standing out. The song transports the romantic feel to the audiences. Making a movie on aviation is not that easy. The flight scenes were terrific (that too, the first few scenes were awesome .. the team has rightly understood that these scenes are the plus of the film and has rightly kept one of these aviation scenes as the opening for the film).\nAnother thing I liked was that everything about the aviation business has been shown clearly - all minute details, the problems faced, the competition in the business. The heroine character was very interesting and I think that, that character has been created the way it has been, to maintain the raw tone of the film. Aparna's performance was terrific. Urvashi's too....One great thing about the film is its pace. It is super fast and uniform from start till end. But, still,I feel that, if the film had been edited differently (still maintainig the fast pace of the film) and few other minor issues fixed, this film could have been an outstanding,oscar-worthy film. My understanding of what Sudha wanted to show us in the film is that when a socially responsible person who has affinity towards his town and town's people (something that he has inherited from his father), who also happens to be a pilot, goes through a bitter experience of not being able to get a flight ticket when he desparately wants to, the result would be that he would make it his life's ambition to make flight journey a possible one for the middle/lower class people. Thats what happens here with Maara. Basically he doesnt want flying to be a prospect that only the upper class people have. In other words, when a need arised or when someone was having a lifetime dream to have a flight journey, Maara wanted to make it possible for them to do so. He did not want class or money to be a barrier in having a flight journey. And most importantly he wanted to connect the small towns and cities through flight. This would make India look more developed and sophisticated. This can be seen as an improvement to our society. This is probably what Sudha wanted to tell and if this had been presented in this manner as such, I think it would have been more acceptable. But, here it has been presented in a slightly different manner - the focus was only on Nedumaaran wanting the poor people to fly. (As though one fine morning he woke up and started wondering why poor people are not flying and he badly wants them to experience the flight travel...As though this is the pressing issue that poor people in India are having now). The film does show his experience as a pilot in defense team and also shows the incident which made him want poor people to fly... but, its all disjointed... so,the way it has been presented now, it makes one think - ' why should a poor guy fly? What is the need? why would a poor guy bother about flying when he has other pressing issues'.Though Sudha has pointed this out herself in the film and given an apt reply for it, through Maara's character, we cannot avoid thinking 'all of these struggles to achieve something luxurious like flying? As though struggling for basic necessities like water and food...' Is this ambition worthy of this much of struggle? One cant help thinking that the same amount of struggle and energy could have been spent in achieving what is 'necessary' for poor people. All of this because of the disjointed narration.\nA few more drawbacks I noticed .... As the film progresses , somewhere we start feeling a little bored. This is inspite of maintaining the fast pace evenly through out the film. It feels a little monotonous and a little confusing after 1 and half hours of the film. And I felt that the villain character is very caricaturish. For a film that is aimed at being close to reality, this kind of villains dont really fit in. Another minus point is that, though Sooriya is terrific in scenes where he has to display his determination, his ambition, his frustration, his sadness, his love and the fire in him , he doesnt look convincing as a villager. In all the family scenes, he alone looks aloof. For the most part, he looks like someone who just returned from Harvard university and just got introduced to his village family and is wondering what village life is like. The rest of his family and Aparna's family are very convincing as villagers. And they are the ones who give the audiences the right feel and tone for the film. Maybe if this had been corrected, the film and the character would have touched our hearts, the way it was meant to. For, the very pulse of the film itself is the protagonist's character - an 'ordinary villager' coming from a 'middle class' family having big ambitions and that too with strong determination, dedication and perserverance. So, Sooriya, acting like Anbuselvan-trying-the-rustic-looks (or may be like the young Sooriya from Vaaranam Aayiram) is not doing any good for the film.\nOverall, it was a surprisingly good film. But, it could have been a gem of a movie , if these few problems had been taken care of.",

            "content": "First of all, does this count as history? While this is up for debate, the hype and hooplah around this film has made sure that this is made out to be a historical saga narrating the drama behind a person in real life. Yet, all the drama hides layers upon layers of misinformation about thee reality. Emotional scores are important in a film, yet a film is dead if a film sacrifices its soul just for scoring points with the audience.The protagonist is shown as a struggling person in Madurai's outskirts. Many Kannadigas have started a furor that this is \"Tamil appropriation\" of a Karnataka's hero. Let the fact aside that this person was of Tamil origin... Even then, a scene in the film depicts the antagonist sanitising his hands after shaking the protagonist's hands. Does this imply notions of impurity with class/caste? This is simply a misdirection, as the core inspiration for this film himself was from the priestly caste who are extolled in India.Come to the final of the film.. This is the ultimate lie, where the entire drama is built upon the captain of the entrepreneurial ship sailing alone without selling out to big corporates. Yet, what had happened in real life? The \"large\" man parodied in the climax had actually bought this out, profiting the \"captain\" to the tune of thousands of crores. Granted, the film does begin saying that this is a work of fiction based on many true stories. Yet, all these facts above show the cheapness of this attempt.The hero goes on endlessly about \"socialism\" and putting \"people before profits\". Yet, one can only roll their eyes at such scheming dialogues.... In the nation this movie is set in, 99.999999999% of people do not know what \"socialism\" is. Even the most educated spew vermin at the alleged \"lower castes\" gaining education and blame reservations for all their failure. What does \"socialism\" stand for in India? Eying money, vested interests fall as low as lying and manipulating to say that only \"upper castes\" have talent. In this context, even imagining a crusader fighting for everyone is a laughable premise.No matter how approachable this movie plans to be, the setup of \"IIT coaching\" and \"bakery\" can give you an idea of which community this thread flows towards. Finally, you even have the entire arc in the flashback about the protests and the anger of the youth. I am wondering what will happen if all villages start attacking public property for what it wants... And, the family drama with a lot of tears which is well placed to make you tear up is another epic manipulation in helping you feel for themThe entire village giving up their hard earned moolah is another overdone sentimental scene to evoke tears. I am unsure as to how to view this in light of how villages are in real life. The initial scenes in the training camp and the scenes of landing from the middle of nowhere all show how wild-eyed dreamers are pointless in real life.The height of the disconnect from reality comes during the scenes with the late Indian President Dr. JPJ Abdul Kalam. The graphics is horrible in the scene and the entire scene is so cringeworthy that using this in a critical part of the film, to give a change of life to the protagonist, is just revolting to watch. How is this even remotely possible? With no proven business model, every hot-headed man with heart worn on the sleeve can barge inside the office of the President then? The entire country would be run to the ground then, just like this film and the idea which never took off in real life.",

Maara (Suriya) suffeeeeered to fight for his airline vision amidst the aristocrats that were skilled at discouraging and crushing him...\nFrankly, we were writing down notes while watching due to the many inspiring and motivational dialogues. Soorarai Pottru was engaging in every way; one moment, we were cheering for Maara then another one, we were shouting \"just give up Maara! It's ok, you did your very best, this is too much agony and shame!\" An extraordinary screenplay! Bravo to the make-up team for an outstanding transformation of Maara over the course of timeOne tiny minus was the heavy use of profane language that was overwhelming and didn't add much to the plotOther than that, Soorarai Pottru was regal!",

Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru is an inspirational film that drives you into Nedumaaran Rajangam's painful, tearful, passionnate journey to fulfill the biggest dream of his life. SURIYA! Where have you been all these years ? This is the Suriya that we all wanted for so many years. The Suriya that we all enjoyed, loved and cherished on screen is back in Soorarai Pottru as Nedumaaran Rajangam. He delivered a strong and hardhitting performance that will be remembered forever. Rather than conveying his emotions through dialogues, Suriya uses his eyes perfectly. Honestly, his eyes speaks a lot especially in the emotional scenes. Apart from Suriya, we have Aparna Vinod in a strong female role. It's been a while that we have witnessed a strong female role in a hero centric film and it's quite rare too. Among the stereotyped female roles, Aparna Vinod's Bommi stands as a strong woman who runs a bakery while helping her husband in his journey. She has also a dream. She has also the same guts and strength just like her husband and she proves that in several scenes in the film. Honestly speaking, Aparna Vinod's performance is really strong and bold making the film a must watch. We have some strong supporting actors like Urvasi, Karunas & Mohan Babu who delivered memorable performances despite their limited screen time. Technically speaking, Soorarai Pottru is a real beast. We have an amazing background score by G.V.Prakash. G.V.Prakash is one of the strong pillars of this film. In fact, his background score & his songs connects the film with everyone. It helps the film to be more soulful and intense. Soorarai Pottru is a film that is not only driven by strong performances but also by the strong writing of Sudha Kongara. Keeping in mind that this film is inspired by the events from the life of Captain G.R.Gopinath, Sudha Kongara added a lot of details that elevated this film brilliantly. In fact, her work in this film is just great. It feels good to see a director who is able to bring a real life story on screen without losing its real essence and its morality. Overall, Sudha Kongara's Soorarai Pottru will leave you with a smile on your face at the end. Don't miss it!",

Effort to detail was clearly seen. Even subtitling work and voiceover was good. Songs too.There is quite a lot of drama, many tears, a near-crash and of course, actor Suriya's trademark swag.While perhaps not as dramatic as the film, his vision really did change life in India forever, and he ideas set in stone what most of us take for granted today - a flight to almost any major city in India, for a price every middle-class salaried person can afford.Born in 1951, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar Gopinath was raised in a small village named Gorur in Karnataka and is the second of eight children. His father, a school teacher and a Kannada novelist, believed that schools were a system of regimentation and decided to teach his son at home.Capt Gopinath reared cattle to sell milk, got in poultry farming, silkworm farming, then turned a motorcycle dealer, an Udupi hotel owner, a stockbroker, irrigation equipment dealer, an agriculture consultant, a politician and finally an aviation entrepreneur - struggling, falling, rising, falling, rising again and taking off.Few nuances were good in movie but real life is a different ball game or to be honest a game of balls.. \ud83d\ude1cWatchable, inspiring and decent film making.",

Infact the entire cast is outstanding evoking all the right emotions all through the movie with virtually no drag, something that's hard to say about many movies. Kudos to entire team for taking on a potentially controversial theme and demonstrating the power of story telling through a great narrative and endearing screenplay.. That Air Deccan changed the world of aviation in India is well known but the struggles behind the idea of taking flying to the masses and the people who made it happen despite all odds is grippingly told in Soorarai Pottru and will be etched in memory of viewers forever.

She has got a lot of technicalities wrong.1. How do you find suriya doing all the work?\n2. How does he barge into the atc room just like that and give orders to the pilot?\n3. No aircraft without prior permission is allowed to land on an air force base just like that.\n4. The investigation that Mr.Naidu conducts is a joke.\n5.

This movie is just to portray the struggles of a common man against the capitalistic ego and inspire the hard working people. It has no need to speak every politics in detail, not always!",

This film is a journey and please don't hesitate to watch this film. You won't regret. Great job done by all Soorarai Pottru team. Easily brings in the emotional attachment from the very beginning, gets us highly invested and feel for the characters. Tears and goosebumps guaranteed in this film.Coming to the performances, Suriya look outstanding in each and every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen after a long time. Actor Suriya has literally lived the character 'Nedumaaran' and in most of the scenes his eyes talk a lot. Don't miss it guys. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his sick father. I literally cried out watching that scene. Really heart breaking scene. It reminds me of Suriya's acting in Vaaranam Ayiram when his girlfriend dead. OMG. To be honest his acting skill is more better in Soorarai Pottru. That is wat Suriya is. He always make him better every time. That hardwork and dedication really paid off in this film. Feel really really happy for Suriya.Not forgetting the female lead Aparna, did play a very good role in Suriya's life in the film. One of a memorable character done by and projected really well. Your this character really create impact in every boy's life to get this kind of girl in their life as well. Also in girl's heart to have that caring and understanding feeling in them. Your chemistry with Suriya is incomparable. Another memorable character would be Suriya's mother in this film, Urvashi. She also played very well and bring tears in almost every scene she's in. So touching.All the supporting casts are apt for their role and given their best. Special mentions for Karunas and Mohan Babu. I'm not lying this is the most best Tamil movie I've watched more than 3 times. The feeling that I have when I watched for the first time is still there even I watched it again and again. Suriya's acting is the highlight of Soorarai Pottru. He just nailed it. I loved the storyline so much. Huge applause to Sudha Kongara for this master piece. Hats off to Suriya, Aparna, Urvashi, Karunas, Mohan Babu and all the other cast in the film. Superb performance performed by all of you. Music and bgm given by GV Prakash is superb and it definitely gives more value for the movie.Cinematography and editing is handled well.Soorarai Pottru is a movie that stays really close to our heart and is a big-time inspiration also motivation to all those who believe in themselves to work hard and to never forget their roots. Don't miss this one. . Suriya really proved the word \"no pain no gain\". Behind every success there is hundreds of sacrifices. Just stay strong and believe in yourself. Your mind is like a magnet, if u think bad u attract negativities and if u think good then you are attracting positivity.Again big round of applause to all Soorarai Pottru team. Really happy to watch this master piece of Suriya. This film is a huge come back for Suriya Anna after so long. Many people may think after watching this film that Suriya is back but only Suriya's fans know that Suriya is always there but only you guys didn't noticed him. This movie is really a proud moment for all Suriya fans and for all Indians also film industry.Guys go for it..You will not regret the time invested in this film. Definitely you will love it. Best OTT released. Perfect inspirational.",

If we watch something, everything shown in that need to logically disclosed and answered perfectly. It is the important thing and that element is missing in this movie. if i rate this i will give ( this is purely with my knowledge) : For acting - 9/10, for songs and background score - 9/10, for screenplay - 6/10, for direction - 7/10 and other technical side - 6/10.\nOverall it is not so bad.",

Almost everyone of the actors had done justice to their roles.

I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!",

He totally reformed as a poor normal man who fell on strangers for money, who asks money from his wife. Every scene is surrounded on this character. Aparna truly deserves lot, I just can't believe she learnt Madurai slang and dubbed her character. Sudha, the director gave equal weightage to all charcters from hero's mother to hero's in laws. I'm sure this movie will snatch all movie awards. GvPrakash gave an amusing music which controls our emotion, from emotional scene to class scene. He catched my heart. You will truly cry on seeing the sweetest part of movie at last.\nI will say this movie should have released on theatres after sometime when normal conditions prevail, because this movie deserves a lot more like audience's whistle, applause and everything.

Please don't miss it. Amazon Prime finally brings it home and how!Although I'm disappointed we don't get to watch this in theatres among all the crowd cheering, I'm grateful the makers of the film decided to bring such a brilliant story to life. I hope this movie will also push people to read the biopic as well.This movie will take you on a very intense ride, which might stick with you for a long time. The aspirations of a comman man to achieve something close to impossible, the anguish of a son to start a revolution and the longing of bringing a dream to come to life, it has EVERYTHING.At some point in life, all of us would have been victims of some power in life, we couldn't overcome. This movie restores that faith, that no matter what, don't give up. It also emphasizes that when someone has the faith in you, you'll fly!Coming to the performances, Suriya is outstanding in every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his father.Aparna as the female lead is one the most empowering characters ever. In a world of women always choosing to play the annoying arm candy, be Aparna! Her chemistry with Suriya is impeccable.Most memorable character would be of the mother of Maara. She is very moving and will bring tears in almost every scene she's in.I cannot vouch for the dubbing, I have watched this in Tamil. The VFX could have been a better in some places but that is a very minor glitch compared to everything else in the movie. Definitely a must watch!",

One might feel the movie to be bit draggy. Its a biopic and it stands true to its genre and we cant expect a biopic to be fast paced when a man is suffering for his dreams.Coming to the technical aspects , everyone makes us awestruck. Special mention to the cinematography and art direction. Suriya once again proves why he is a celebrated actor and you can see only MAARA on screen. Aparna has done an marvelous job and she shines as BOMMI. Kudos to the director who has written such a strong female character to whom her husband asks money for his business. Kaali Venkat and Oorvashi has a meaty roles and they did justice to their character.After a long time G. V. Prakash hits us with something unique and fresh. Every track has come out very well and it was exceptionally picturised. B. G. M from the music director could have been even better.Sudha kongara who wants herself to be addressed as a director and not a \"female\" director is nothing short of any contemporary male directors. But I have an issue here. To make a biopic, you have to be \ud83d\udcaf perfect. Showing G. R. Gopinath( real maara) differently from what he is breaking down the authenticity of this biopic. Apart from that the Director stands tall. Special mention to Vijayakumar who penned the dialogues. The dialogues were so intense as it helps to verbalise the feelings of every character of the film.So put it all together, Soorarai pottru hits the Bullseye.",

Right from the beginning I was hooked, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.From the casting, the direction, the cinematography, the music, everything felt complete. The movie wasn't overly romantic and stuck to its central theme. One of the things I loved about the movie is that it featured a strong female lead, which was long overdue especially in tamil cinema.Such nuanced acting and so many complex emotions were beautifully portrayed by the amazing lead. Surya has proved himself yet again as a versatile actor. His eyes carry so much emotion. It was amazing to watch him in his element. I don't think I have ever cried so much while watching a movie. Every obstacle Maara and his gang had faced seemed so personal; I did not feel like a observer watching them from afar, but I felt like I was there with them, sharing their emotions. Surya definitely deserves a national award for this movie in my opinion.The fact that this amazing movie was based on the story/life events of a real-life hero is even more amazing. We don't realise that we take things for granted and forget the hard work and sacrifice of some unsung heroes that went behind the things we enjoy today. This movie has opened my mind to a whole new perspective, and I would definitely think about Captain Gopinath's resolve the next time I get to travel on a plane.",

If someone say this movie doesn't have a good story, then probably that person doesn't know what is a epic story. Music in this movie does its best with unbeatable sounds that makes you amaze. In whole movie I didn't even saw a single scene which doesn't have no logic. This should hit The Indian Best film ever. Such a superb emotional beats that even made me cry. Suriya and all other cast had made their best action to make this film best. Beginning, ending, pacing, dialogue, editing, cinematography, camera work, costume design etc. had done their best to make this movie \"Nothing better than this Soorarai Pottru\"",

Gopinath who founded Deccan Airlines , it is possibly the best biopic of sorts in Indian Cinema save Paan Singh Tomar, also while im no expert i wanted to note that Niketh Bommireddy the cinematographer is amazing here , also one added detail that i liked was that there was a dialect they used for Surya's character which was Madurai Specific the songs are average but you can skip most since they dont have an effect on the actual movie one the two friends played by KrishnaKumar was very impressively acted. The movie in some parts is obviously dramatized but is still impressive overall I'd give it a 7.8 or 8. Aparna Balamurali who usually plays a side is given a important role and i couldn't tell this was her first big role because of how amazing it was,it is extremely cheeky, they have a guy named Ajay Balaiyya who is very obviously a parody of Vijay Mallya, the villain named Paresh something is a clear parody of Jet Airways Founder Naresh Goel",

            "content": "Soorarai Pottru is the best and great film I've watched. Really amazing storyline. This film is based on a true story of Capt. Gopinath's life. This film is a journey and please don't hesitate to watch this film. You won't regret. Great job done by all Soorarai Pottru team. Easily brings in the emotional attachment from the very beginning, gets us highly invested and feel for the characters. Tears and goosebumps guaranteed in this film.Coming to the performances, Suriya look outstanding in each and every frame. For me, this has to be one of the best performances I have seen after a long time. Actor Suriya has literally lived the character 'Nedumaaran' and in most of the scenes his eyes talk a lot. Don't miss it guys. His performance will leave a huge impact, especially the scene where he needs to fly home to see his sick father. I literally cried out watching that scene. Really heart breaking scene. It reminds me of Suriya's acting in Vaaranam Ayiram when his girlfriend dead. OMG. To be honest his acting skill is more better in Soorarai Pottru. That is wat Suriya is. He always make him better every time. That hardwork and dedication really paid off in this film. Feel really really happy for Suriya.Not forgetting the female lead Aparna, did play a very good role in Suriya's life in the film. One of a memorable character done by and projected really well. Your this character really create impact in every boy's life to get this kind of girl in their life as well. Also in girl's heart to have that caring and understanding feeling in them. Your chemistry with Suriya is incomparable. Another memorable character would be Suriya's mother in this film, Urvashi. She also played very well and bring tears in almost every scene she's in. So touching.All the supporting casts are apt for their role and given their best. Special mentions for Karunas and Mohan Babu. I'm not lying this is the most best Tamil movie I've watched more than 3 times. The feeling that I have when I watched for the first time is still there even I watched it again and again. Suriya's acting is the highlight of Soorarai Pottru. He just nailed it. I loved the storyline so much. Huge applause to Sudha Kongara for this master piece. Hats off to Suriya, Aparna, Urvashi, Karunas, Mohan Babu and all the other cast in the film. Superb performance performed by all of you. Music and bgm given by GV Prakash is superb and it definitely gives more value for the movie.Cinematography and editing is handled well.Soorarai Pottru is a movie that stays really close to our heart and is a big-time inspiration also motivation to all those who believe in themselves to work hard and to never forget their roots. Don't miss this one. . Suriya really proved the word \"no pain no gain\". Behind every success there is hundreds of sacrifices. Just stay strong and believe in yourself. Your mind is like a magnet, if u think bad u attract negativities and if u think good then you are attracting positivity.Again big round of applause to all Soorarai Pottru team. Really happy to watch this master piece of Suriya. This film is a huge come back for Suriya Anna after so long. Many people may think after watching this film that Suriya is back but only Suriya's fans know that Suriya is always there but only you guys didn't noticed him. This movie is really a proud moment for all Suriya fans and for all Indians also film industry.Guys go for it..You will not regret the time invested in this film. Definitely you will love it. Best OTT released. Perfect inspirational.",

            "content": ".The above statement may seem exaggerated, but the film is structured like a flight. We hear the engine sound in the title card and the swift departure takes away our breath. We are introduced to Sundari played by Aparna Balamurali on a train to meet Nedumaaran Rajangam. The character seemed to be a rebel in the beginning, but later we find him to be a calm person who bursts off when suppressed downright. The characters are given to actors who know their job very well. Urvasi, Aparna, Maaran's friends deliver a great performance on screen. Paresh Rawal, Achyut Kumar delivers an antagonist role very well. Special mention is needed for 'Poo' Ram who plays Maaran's father. Karunas gives some pleasant jokes in the film. Meanwhile, Nedumaaran Rajangam played by Suriya will stay in the hearts for a long haul. This will stay as one of Suriya's career-best performance among Nandha and Pitamagan. Sudha Kongara's screenplay and direction, steer the film. One can argue that she alone holds the complete film on her shoulders. GV Prakash Kumar's music is highly enjoyable and sticks to the mood. The cinematography and the overall color tone are just splendid. I personally wished the climactic sequences were a bit more lengthy since it would have helped get Sudha Kongara her a standing ovation like how she got in Iruthisuttru. Well, that need not be considered as a flaw but I felt the film ended soon. Overall Soorarai Pottru is the one such film that never makes you take your eye off the screen. It makes your eyes wet at times but the journey or I might say flight is smooth and enjoyable.Even though it has predictable scenes the screenplay makes us yearn to know what happens next. That's where the magic happens.",

I can't remember when was the last the time I cried for a movie. In Soorarai pottru, whenever Maara cries you can't control your tears. Aparna balamurali as Bommi, bold supporting wife, every Man with a dream longing for. Chemistry between them is so natural and beautiful. Nikketh and G.V as pillars for the movie. Art work at its best and can't imagine how they recreate and created the world of Maara. This movie definitely motivates person who wants to be entrepreneur. Eventually, for Two things I respect this movie : 1) Suriya - dreams as Maara, Struggled as Maara and won as Maara 2) Mutual respect between Maara and Bommi and their passion towards their dreams.",
