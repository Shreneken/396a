            "content": "We all need to do stuff sometimes because we have to. I'm thinking one of several things are going on here. 1. Bruce needed money to pay his taxes. 2. He needed a loss to write off. 3. He owed someone. 4. He did someone a favour. 5. He lost a bet. 6. He signed this contract when he was drunk. 7. Someone held a gun to his head. It has to be one of those because there is no way, Bruce \"action star\" Willis, would look at this script and say..\"Hey! this is the best, can't wait to put my name on it!\" What an absolute load of cow manure! Bruce should buy up all copies, burn them; put a full page ad in the Times apologizing to his fans, friends, fellow actors, family and unborn grandchildren as well as give us all refunds! Utter garbage!!!!... sorry Bruce, I'm only telling you this because I've loved you since Moonlighting... I'm also probably not saying anything you didn't already know about this movie.",

The sets in the movie are hilarious, the dialogue is just not right, the editing seems incomplete and the camera shots are weird enough and repetitive. It 's a 3-star movie just because the story is not that bad and literally 3 scenes of the movie are good. But i can't recommend this to anyone with a taste in sci-fi.\nWatch Pandorum instead or re-watch another sci-fi and avoid the disappointment. 3/10",

Soon the crew members start dying and killing eachother and the survivors end up battling an alien life form that overtakes and imitates its host and is trying to kill them all.The movie is badly filmed with terrible sound and poor visual effects which are similar to what bad sci-fi movies had in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The editing is choppy as well. The movie basically borrows ideas from The Thing, Alien, Pandorum and many other superior films and copies some elements poorly. Actors like Bruce Willis, Rachel Nichols, Collin Mullvey and Thomas Jane among others have little to do and have terrible dialogue and story to contend with.There are a few chuckles but other than that there are hardly any redeeming points to this. Honestly, Leprechaun 4: In Space was more entertaining and better and it was made in 1996.",

I mean I love a good Alien rip off storyline but I think the actors just improv'd their way throughout. The main idea being humans messed up the earth, let's go to New Earth. And on the way we're going to smoke cigars, cigarettes, weed inside our last ship. Plus we're going to make moonshine and party it up in our filthy ship that we make 'six' janitors (really just one) clean with our two toilets for all the crew and 300,000 passengers ( I mean really, they didn't think anyone had to go before being cryofroze?)\nAnd the monster at the end? Whaaaaa? Was it a paper mache critter that the actors' kids made during quarantine?Really bad, but at least it was really cheap to rent.

            "content": "\"Breach\" is a film with a current rating of 3.1 on IMDB...low enough to merit its inclusion on its infamous Bottom 100 List. This would mean it's bad enough to be among the worst big budget films ever made...and as I watched the film it just didn't seem THAT bad...or even close. Sure, \"Breach\" is a bloody, violent and incredibly depressing film....and I am NOT singing its praises...but it is NOT 3.1 bad. It makes me wonder if there's something going on here...some attack on the film for some reason I do not understand. Again...I am not saying it's good....but it just didn't seem Bottom 100 worthy.This very depressing story is set over 120 years from now. The population of the Earth is 19,000,000,000 and some sort of plague is destroying mankind. So, in desperation, some huge ships are sent into space in order to send a small number of humans to what's been called 'New Earth'.The odd hero of this story is a stowaway. Most of the folk aboard the ship are in cryogenic suspension....with only a tiny complement to run the ship. During this time, some creature attacks and it's not only murderous but very smart. After invading a host's body, it begins working towards killing....and there's simply no reasoning with it....it only wants death. What's next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it in case you actually do want to see it.Could part of the reason the film did so badly is because during COVID folks did NOT want to see a film about the destruction of the human race? Perhaps. The timing certainly COULD have been better!! Maybe, maybe not...but it certainly is NOT a feel-good film!! But despite its gloom and violence and bloodshed, it's NOT a particularly badly made film. Depressing, you betcha. Bad, not especially and I have seen hundreds, if not thousands of worse films....worse films which, somehow, have much higher ratings and less hate than this film.",

I don't know what possesses him to make flicks like this, maybe it's like your favorite band that just has to keep on playing because they love to create music. The concept here was derivative of other sci-fi offerings, most notably the Alien franchise. Did you ever wonder how a toxic substance like Moxacell can destroy anything it touches except the container it's in? That one kills me every time. And how about that composite monster that came together from all the blasted human and alien body parts? That was the dumbest looking creature I think I've seen since that Horta on the old Star Trek series from the Sixties; the episode was called 'The Devil in the Dark' in case you're interested. I rated that one higher than this thing. To paraphrase my summary line from the movie, I'll just say, '...they f..... up some other movies, so here's a new one.\"",

I'm sure this was shot on a very limited budget but its difficult to suspend disbelief when you are watching a spaceship with concrete walls and chipboard hyper sleep chambers.Bruce Willis is actually in this one quite a bit, rather then the one scene films he usually appears in these days, but he doesn't really have much to do and most scenes are just him sipping from a hip flask and watching someone else work. I suppose you could watch this as a drinking game film and take a drink every time Bruce does, maybe thats what the writers were going for.The plot doesn't seem to make much sense, why would you need five janitors to clean the bathrooms of 15 other people. How much mess can they make - clearly a lot as the protagonist has to spend a year cleaning toilets. Odd.I thought the directors last film, 3022, was pretty good and was surprised its the same director of photography on this film as it just looks so bad and the shots are terrible.I can only guess perhaps the budget wasn't there for this film or it was shot in a hurry for whatever reason.

They had a lot of problems with his scenes in \"Motherless Brooklyn.\" Even as far back a 2015 he could be seen with an earpiece to feed him lines\nEssentially this once great actor, with not just action chops, but such expressive portrayal of irony and humor, as well as excellent work in dramatic roles s has a major health issue. It isn't avarice, greed, or laziness, it is an illnessso he ends up in dreck like this. Don't fault him. It is very likely you and I and most everyone else will be there someday. If you have such an illness and just withdraw and don't work anymore it progress is even faster.If you don't like this film overall, feel free to give it a bad rating.

            "content": "In the 23rd century, Humanity and Earth are on the cusp of an extinction level event and have begun evacuations for the colony of New Earth. Noah (Cody Kearsley) stows away on the U. S. S. Hercules impersonating a junior janitor while his pregnant girlfriend Hayley (Kassandra Clementi) is granted passage due to her father being the Admiral (Thomas Jane). While the passengers are put into hyper sleep Noah goes about custodial duties on the ship under the supervision of a demoted captain turned custodian, Clay (Bruce Willis), until eventually members of the support staff turn up dead or missing with signs pointing towards something inhuman as the culprit.To look at Bruce Willis' career is depressing because not too long ago the man appear in major blockbusters such as G. I. Joe Retaliation, RED 2 and A Good Day to Die Hard, while these movies weren't critically well received (for good reason) they were at least projects that made sense given Willis' status as an international action star. But outside of exceptions like Glass and a cameo in Motherless Brooklyn, Willis' primary output has been direct-to-video/streaming fodder for the company Emmett/Furla/Oasis with these film's featuring Willis prominently as the second billed actor despite only being in it for maybe 10 minutes with the rest done off camera or with a body double. With only two days of shooting and guaranteed $1 million pay day for each film it's no mystery why Willis has gone down this route. Breach (aka Anti-Life) isn't an EFO production, but it does reunite Willis with some crew who have worked on his EFO films, and while Willis is more prominent here than he was in many EFO film's the quality is definitely not improved simply because there's more of Willis.The movie is supposedly set in the 23rd century, but begins with a bunch of stock footage framed with a fish eye lens before transitioning to our \"future\" which looks like a rented storage area with a few dozen extras and a shambly chain link fence. And of course once we're actually on the ship things don't improve because it's clear it's just a refurbished warehouse with some red and green lights shined on walls with maybe the occasional flatscreen TV or poorly inserted hologram effect to assure the audience \"no seriously, this is the future!\". The movie features some brief CGI shots of the ship, but they're not particularly well rendered and it just calls attention to the fact that sets the crew are using are much smaller than it is. Not only is it unconvincing but despite being set in the 23rd century, the bathrooms on the ship look like public restrooms one would find at a bus stop and they're still using regular guns (which are cheap plastic replicas) except for one point where they break out cheap plastic lasers.The movie doesn't even have a good story behind its lackluster production values, because it's basically a cut and paste job of most of the Alien knockoffs of the 80s, but without any tradecraft or endearing qualities that made films like Galaxy of Terror or Creature enjoyable. Surprisingly though, the film despite being marketed as such isn't as directly ripping off Alien as one might think (at first anyway). The movie throws in zombie tropes, bits from The Thing, and even a little bit of Space Mutiny (though at least Space Mutiny stole special effects from John Dykstra). Most of the plot beats of this story you'll be able to predict as they're pretty much all here just because they were in other movies. Willis looks visibly uninterested despite being a prominent actor in the film with more screentime here than he had in most of his EFO projects, and Cody Kearsley of TV's Riverdale is not an engaging presence and feels hopelessly lost and confused with no real idea how to approach this character.On occasion I got a chuckle from some of the line deliveries (sometimes intentionally sometimes not) and there was a creature effect in the last ten minutes of the movie that looked okay(not great, but good enough) but then they overextended themselves with some rather inept expansions on it to try and milk all they could from it.Breach is a sad movie. It plays like one of those 90s direct to video films that tried to ape Alien's aesthetic on a miniscule budget, but at least those were made with no name actors on shoestring budgets and were kind of endearing in how stupid they were such as Leprechaun 4: In Space. Breach is just bare basics recycled to diminishing returns with the barest minimum of effort put in and sold to you using cast members like Bruce Willis to bank on their name recognition.",

I have to admit, going into it with all the low ratings - and Bruce Willis is in it, I was expecting another flop. Now I'm not saying this wasn't a flop, but it was an awesome flop. And Willis was actually somewhat convincing in this role.John Suits' directing was his usual amateur-hour. But producer, actor and co-writer Corey Large alongside co-writer and actor Edward Drake, managed to throw a whole bunch of popular sci-fi genre films in a blender, and come out with something so ridiculous, it was entertaining and hilarious at the same time. It had: Alien, Zombieland, Ghostbusters, Skyline, The Blob and many more, and although cheesy at first, the humor an audacity to do this worked for me. What's funnier, is that when I told friends about it, they were curious, and I actually didn't mind seeing it again - especially when we hit the bongs, and it was so funny and awesome, we were in stitches laughing! Try it, trust me, this is how this film was meant to be viewed.The dated S/VFX, cheesy 80's sets, the excellent choice of colors and excellent cinematography, as well as actually having a decent score - rare for cheap B-grade films, just added to how much better this film was than any of us initially thought. The casting was ok, and although the performances lacked quality, I blame Suits for not directing his cast properly. The 92 min runtime was ok, but the pacing needed to be faster and/or the runtime cut shorter.

After watching the truly execrable 'Cosmic Sin' by the same director, my other half and I decided to we had to watch 'Anti-Life' (or 'Breach) just to see if it was equally terrible. And you know what? Shockingly, it wasn't!That's not to say 'Anti-life' is good, by any means. It's actually pretty dreadful, but in comparison to 'Cosmic Sin', it at least had a vaguely coherent storyline, and progressed at a reasonable pace. Given that Bruce Willis and Rachel Nichols were in this for most of its run time (rather than the usual 'I could've shot my scenes in a day'), and that they're both good actors, I don't know why they didn't simply re-write the script to make them the leads. They would have been far better than the rather ineffectual unknown who plays the actual lead, and his even worse-acting romantic interest.Essentially the whole thing is an ultra-low-budget 'Alien' clone, with a dash of 'The Thing', already done numerous times in the 80s and 90s. It's so low budget, I would be amazed if it cost more than... I don't know... $100k? And 90% of that would've been on Bruce, Thomas Jane and Rachel Nichols.It's such a low budget production, that they've used every old trick in the book. Packing crates for shining light through, various randomly shaped packaging items on the walls, spray painted to match the colour of the set, etc... As such, it's actually a fun example of how young up-and-coming film students can create sci-fi sets with zero budget!!Even at 'Anti Life's worst, you can play 'spot the polystyrene packaging on the wall', which keeps things fun. Oh, and don't forget the painted NERF guns with badly composited muzzle flashes!It's all pretty bad, but it IS entertaining in a silly, cheesy, low budget way, most reminiscent of 90s made-for-tv movies, when poor CGI was just becoming available for low-budget efforts to throw at the screen.What can I say? I've seen a LOT worse, and it was more entertaining than The Last Jedi (My favourite stunningly-low-bar comparison movie, for all bad movies to be compared against). I didn't fall asleep before the end, which is something I can't even say of some Marvel movies. ;-)",

Really beautiful photography and the sound is up to par as well, and I am one who is usually really critical of these kind of technical details.More good: the supporting actors are quite decent. One of them being even really good. The bad guy of this movie is really a tough dude. Acts quite good. I have seen him in other B-movies and he simply should be starring in popular A-movies, because he honestly has got the charisma.Concluding: expect a B-movie and you could have a nice watch, full of suspense, action and cool, tough guys.",

You can usually tell a lot about a movie by who gets top billing and who doesn't. It takes place in the not so distant future-about 2245 if I remember correctly-when the earth is dying because of plagues and other things we humans have done to it. They build an interstellar space ark to carry the surviving humans to a distant planet called New Earth, in hopes of starting over. Thomas plays the admiral of the ship but he spends most of his screen time in cryogenic sleep. Cody plays a janitor on board that is hoping to start a new life on New Earth with his girlfriend-she is on board too, but in cryogenic sleep. Bruce has worked for 10 years or more as a soldier but has been demoted for his insubordination and is now in charge of the janitors-Cody specifically-and usually drinks while Cody is working. Rachel is the nurse on board that has to deal with an alien life form that starts infecting people, turning them into space zombies that go around infecting more people. If you are thinking, 'Wow, Bruce Willis fighting Zombies in space!', forget it. There is very little of that kind of action. It's more like as if a person from another country looked at several American action movies and tried to make one of their own, using different pieces from each one. There is a commander who likes to smoke a cigar, an alien menace that can't be stopped by bullets-but is defenseless against something simple, a man that uses one liners while shooting the alien, etc.\nIt's rated \"R\" for language and bloody violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes.\nIt's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it either. If you really want to see it, I would wait until it is on cable.",

Why was that? Well, I mean a movie that had both Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane on the cast list? What could possibly go wrong here? What would there be not to like?Apparently if you take the movies \"Alien\" and \"28 Days Later\" and mix them together, you'd have the formula for \"Breach\" (aka \"Anti-Life\"), except that \"Breach\" lacked the intensity and entertainment that both those movie have. \"Breach\" just feels like a watered down hybrid version of those two movies, where all energy has been sucked away.The storyline in \"Breach\" was as unoriginal as anything could be. Again, I redirect your attention to the \"Alien\" and \"28 Days Later\" movies and you have the storyline that writers Edward Drake and Corey Large managed to come up with. I am especially impressed that something like this would pass today and make it to the screen.Thomas Jane was not really all that much in the movie, which was good, as this movie will not tarnish his movie record all that much. Bruce Willis, however, was there almost all the time, and this movie was a swing and a miss from him, and it doesn't make a great addition to his repertoire of movies.I managed to sit through the movie to the very end, though I was hardly entertained by \"Breach\". In fact, I was more dumbfounded that a movie so blatantly ripping off two established movies could see the light of day. And the ending of the movie, now that was just a slap to the face. The storyline have you beaten down and stepped upon, but the ending just brings a cold, dead fish to the game and slaps your face repeatedly. That ending was just abysmal. Not only was it generic and predictable, but it was just saying that the audience watching it deserved no better.You might want to do yourself a favor and give \"Breach\" a wide berth. It is not worth the time, money or effort, believe you me. My rating of this 2020 movie lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",

When he doesn't, it's because he has crap to work with. Most \"science fiction\" movies are utter garbage, or at least just barely watchable if you know how to drink your way through them. Or write a little poetry, or talk to your mom during the romantic parts. This doesn't pretend to be something it's not, and thus, doesn't take itself too seriously. When I saw the ratings and looked at the trailer, I thought \"Wait, something is a bit off here!\" I rarely review anymore because over the years there are more and more whiners and princesses, and self-entitled primadonnas who are 100% negative, and that is NOT a \"review\" of a film! Complaining and belittling of any creative effort, no matter HOW seemingly bad something might be doesn't create a whole picture of an experience using the objective mindset needed to accurately explain an 'opinion' that is worthy of being taken seriously. Meaning, that too often it's ALL about the reviewer's emotions and expectations and creative 'fragility', and NOT about the movie itself. This was fun and perfectly campy, well written well acted. Everything was pretty believable and didn't insult your intelligence by pretending it was anything other than it was. It was simple and genuine and the writer knew his characters fairly well. And he wrote accordingly. The strongest arm of the movie is that it had genuine suspense! I was certainly not expecting that. Sadly, there are more and more princesses in the world writing reviews and less and less castles for them to feel safe in so they won't be SO disappointed and bereaved when a movies falls short of their narcissistic demand that it should have been better. I give it a six. The extra star is for the fact that it didn't insult expectations I never had in the first place.",

            "content": "I wanted to post a quick review of this movie because I really don't think it deserves all the negative reviews it's getting here. \"Breach\", to me, very much felt like a low-budget science fiction horror movie along the lines of the ones they used to make in the 80s and 90s. It's dark and gritty and, what I found to be refreshing this day and age, not politically correct at all.One reviewer complained the sets look bad, but I thought they appeared exactly like I expect (and want) the inside of a space ship to look like in a bleak, futuristic world where Earth has gone to hell and mankind is struggling to survive. Both it and its crew reminded me of \"Event Horizon\" since the atmosphere and look of \"Breach\" are very similar to that and also reminiscent of \"Alien 3\". Maybe those two won't go down in history as the best science fiction movies ever made, but I, for one, still enjoyed them and I would much rather watch something like \"Breach\" than all of those clean and realistic ones that are being produced nowadays, like \"the Martian\" or \"Gravity.\" Back in the 80s and 90s they made many dark, low budget sci fi movies, which were not very realistic at all, but that wasn't the point. They all took place in a bleak, hopeless future where humanity had destroyed all the beauty in the world and life was basically a daily struggle for survival in whatever setting the movie took place. But after \"The Matrix\" came out, science fiction changed (although, ironically, those films take place in a similar setting) and the only movies I can think of which were made in that style in the 2000s are \"Doomsday\" and \"The Gene Generation\", although they used a bit too much CGI for my taste. 2018's \"Death Race 4: Beyond Anarchy\" was better in that way and it was very refreshing to me to having been able to watch another film that tries to keep that particular niche alive. As for Bruce Willis, I thought he was very good in \"Breach\" and delivered pretty much what you'd expect from him in this role: the witty, tough as nails anti-hero that he's become famous for.So give this movie a chance. Of course it's not as good as \"Alien\" or even \"Event Horizon\", but watching it, it brought back memories from when I was a teenager, checking out the science fiction and horror sections of my local video store, looking for exactly this kind of film. I'm happy it got made if only for allowing me to experience that sensation again years later when there aren't even any more of those magical places left in the world.",

Established rules get broken, characters act inconsistently, nothing makes any sense.I know this is a common and overused phrase, but there's a good film in there - meaning that they had everything to make a decent movie, despite the low budget. I don't really care if the VFX aren't top notch if the characters are good and the plot makes sense. The filmmakers try to borrow from \"The Thing\" and \"Alien\" a bit too much, but it still could have been a decent \"Dead Space\" clone with Bruce Willis as the reluctant and alcohol-infused janitor.

This director couldn't wrap a Rubik's cube, let alone a complex beast like Willis, and he clearly couldn't afford a gift bag in which to hide his lack of packaging skills. Hence, Willis comes off as a cheap cardboard cutout, on which the film unfortunately blew the majority of its budget.Thrown in with a discount-store 'junior Colin Farell and Jodie Foster knockoff Chinese Action Figurine' value pack, Willis doesn't even phone it in. In fact, I'm not sure if he even could be gifted with a generous \"he texted it in\". Thomas Jane gets off lightly by spending the great majority of the film in cryosleep - he may be able to wash off his association with this fetid puddle of space horror trope-vomit, given enough time.This film lacks any originality, and is so mono-dimensional that any (possible?) attempt to tip its hat to the genre's greats telegraphs desperation, not pizzaz. The sets look like an elementary school cardboard diorama, and nothing is done to meaningfully disguise its low-budget nature. Foley frequently neglects to mask hollow, wooden clunks and thuds on walls and surfaces that should be metal. Lighting is flat and atmosphere-destroying (I've seen better-lit budget 1990s cable soap operas). Colour grading seems to favour uneven, generic \"point and shoot\" settings. Special effects are, well, bad. Some of the monster stuff is actually ok when hidden in the mist, but the ships and space scenes are worse than budget Dr who ships from the 70s, and effects such as muzzle flare look painted in with 80s paintbox technology.I not sure what this film thinks it is, but it isn't. Urgh. Raw sewage.",

Bruce planted the first vineyard in Eden.4. When Bruce writes it can be in Summerian.5. Bruce booed Copernicus at a Catholic hearing as a flat Earther.Bruce is too old for making movies that are multiple decade old imitations of Aliens with much better actors like Seguorney Williams.

Apparently Bruce can't let his ego retire him to the local country club of ancient has been, washed up, actors on his millions he's worth.

The rest of the movie is bad.The plot is terrible, the motives and actions of people are idiotic, the villain and monsters are virtually flat. At times this movie feels like a parody, as none of the jokes, or conversations were executed well.It just feels cheap on almost all levels. And it's a shame really, because if some of the scenes would have been deleted, a better monster was chosen with some suspense added - this could have been a \"pandorum\" lookalike.In general I cannot recommend this to anyone except those few who are hardcore fans of Bruce Willis. All of the rest should avoid this movie.With better writing, more suspense and less stupid and forced action this could have been watchable as at times it does feel like a horror movie.

Most of the film had some action to keep an interest, and the only thing that was even remotely satisfying was the cro room.Aside from the obvious the characters needed a whole lot of work when they presented their lines.In the first ten minutes I couldn't stand the loud obnoxious speeches of the old haggard soldiers trying to compare war stories with one another. If I didn't know better, that the screen writer was someone sent overseas and came home deciding to write something other than what he experienced in another country. Except he chose to use the Sci-ci trope.This was a bad movie. A bad investment. What surprised me though was when they first made their hump into hyperspace. The scene where bruce was sitting in front of a very dirty, and scratched up port window. Who the hell made the choice of keeping such trashy appearances? On an angle shot it looked like it was what everyone else was thinking.... nothing but polymer plastic.The sets were down right shabby and on any other ship I have seen of past sci-fi flicks, that the pipes were held in place using bracket hooks. I have to give this one out of ten stars mainly for the theme of the film. The plot has been overdone on so many levels in other movies as well as giving a thumbs down for both bruce and thomas jane. Their roles did not fit their profiles, and neither of them looked like they were happy to be in the role.Truly, a sad day for sci-fi.",

So he spends the days cleaning and mopping, and getting slack from Bruce Willis's hologram.But something is up, as one of the guys puts make up on from Land Of The Dead and learns how to jump really high. This isn't really on for Willis and co, as they are busy making moonshine, so they decide to wake up special guest star Thomas Jane, and the special effects guy, to help save the day.A good film this is not, but its a lot of fun if you watch it in a different perspective. We all know that Willis was ill at the time of making this, so he will not be criticised for his performance, although he is a lot of fun in this.The rest of the film is just a lot of people in make up jumping really high, and getting covered in CGI holes, courtesy of CGI blasts from the guns the cast are using.If you're a zombie movie completist, this has to be seen.

Instead we get static midshot cut to midshot continuously. It's dreadful. There's also no atmosphere and little to no music.

Were they sober at the time?!!? If this was the final version, my god... what was the first draft like?!!?Minus three for Bruce Willis putting his name\non this and making me think it must have SOME kind of credibility. Someone must have been\nholding his family hostage during the filming, or he was drunk in real life the whole time or SOMETHING.Minus one more because I can only subtract one more, but it represents at least 13 more substantial reasons this was unbelievably awful, and not in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way either.This movie is what fast-forward buttons were\nmade for.",

I think that sums it up. If they have the alimony issue than charge on brother. Gottta do what you gotta do.Lastly, the movie, the one I'm 43 minutes into, it's bad. It's not IMDB 3.6 bad though.

Blurry non descript shape and to be honest I needed a drink to get me through this movie and by the end I was totally spannered so found the end really difficult to recall this morning albeit in a hazey, \"what on earth did I watch last night, seriously 1 hour and 32 minutes of my life I will never get back\"\nIn fact the credits made much interesting reading as several people who worked on this were credited with doing several jobs simultaneously.",

The first 30 minutes of the movie feels like someone went at it with a chainsaw, leaving you wondering if you dozed off and missed something. It's possible that the script alone may have been merely bad if it had decent editing, rather than truly awful.\nThe walls are papered with flat characters that serve nothing more than to become fodder later. Character motivations are flimsy at best.\nThe camera work is at times passable, and at times seem like someone forgot they were operating a camera.\nColor grading ranges from jarring and off putting to \"I recognize that preset\".\nIt's so predictable I could have told you the ending at the 30 minute mark.\nIt's entirely forgettable. I just finished watching it about 10 minutes ago and already can't remember any of the character's names.This film basically offers nothing memorable or noteworthy, not even brainless action fun.

I am deeply ashamed of you for having accepted a role in this pathetic drivel. I would assume that Bruce Willis was cast because his fee was far lower than the cost of having to produce something credible and worth watching plus advertising. People see Bruce Willis's face and get reeled in.Whilst Bruce Willis managed to play to his usual acting standards, the rest of the cast appeared to have been expelled from a 3rd rate acting school for bad grades. The budget seemed to be almost enough to cover the storyline which in of itself wasn't overly horrendous, however, whoever was in charge of the execution should be banned from working in the entertainment industry for life.",

Basically, the Earth is dying and humanity is heading off in giant spaceships (arks) to a \"new Earth\". There are a group of people who think humans have had their chance and want to sabotage humanity's chance at a future. Somehow, which is never truly explained, the sabotages unleash an alien parasite on the ship which infects the passengers and turns them into puppets. Bruce Willis, who's character is completely unlikable leads a group to defeat the alien scourge. The plot is really thin, the acting very b-grade (including Willis and in particular Thomas Jane who is ridiculous), the special effects are low rate and poor. Even the weapons look like toy guns. The final creature couldn't look anymore fake. Just overall really really bad. Cheers.",

Unfortunately, there are also opponents here who want to sabotage the flight.\nAnd this is where it starts to become illogical. Where the being brought along comes from is not mentioned in any way. It seems more like an alien life form than a creature bred in a laboratory. The behaviour of the crew in the face of this threat is grossly illogical in places.\nThe fact that one of the main characters only thinks of the ultimate weapon against the monsters when it is already out of reach borders on debility. As a substitute, a homemade schnapps must be used, which is mixed from rocket fuel and other things. Even in the near future, these ingredients are unlikely to be edible,\nThe ending is also illogical and should hopefully not point to a second part.Bruce Willis must owe a lot of people a lot of favours or be in the dumps to accept such film offers.\nI hope he gets his act together and makes a comeback with movies that are above B-- level.",

The set builders tried to imitate that classic 'space corrosion' effect by dribbling thinned paint down the walls. The tech gear looked like it was tossed together from obsolete PC and VCR parts and the wiring was bundled using zip-ties. The movie is set in 2242 A. D. Seriously? And the flamethrowers; I swear the fuel tanks were Thermos bottles. The weaponry looked like Airsoft guns and muzzle flashes were cheesy CGI post production add-ons.

This movie takes place over 200 years into the future...and yet we're still using gunpowder, AR-15 rifles, and flamethrowers that look like tactical super soaker water guns. Not sure if they blew whatever budget they had on getting permission to use the Halo warthog gun turret sound effect but the other comical part is these \"futuristic\" guns utilize 50-round drum magazines, yet zero shell casings come out and the AR-15 bolt dust covers remain closed when they're fired.I've seen B-movies where one A-list star carried the movie in order to improve viewership as well as acquaint the audience with a no-name supporting cast. However, there are plenty of familiar faces in this movie (along with discount space John McClane) so I'm not sure how they duped...err I mean convinced them as well as signing Bruce Willis.I'm not going to beat a dead horse so I'll leave the other problems with this movie to my fellow reviewers who share my opinion and we all agree, that's 90 minutes we'll never get back.",

            "review_title": "Hilarious Technology Optimism",
            "content": "99% of all films about space and technology are pessimistic. \"The Breach\" seems to me refreshingly optimistic about technology if probably somewhat ambiguous when it comes to space and the future. Compared to the \"Alien\" franchise though which is unambiguously dystopian and where you find a lot of toxic masculinity, the masculinity at play here and its goal, most people will propably end up sympathising with. To me it smells a bit like the people behind this film had different opinions of what the message should be. Nevertheless this low-budget film is in my view by far the best about these topics, second only to \"Interstellar\" which is also much more serious in tone.Admittedly, Bruce in his later years needs a good director to direct him, but as in \"Death Wish\" here it succeeds and Bruce's performance as a result is more than decent. Furthermore most of the other actors are top-notch and what we have is a very entertaining film. Especially the first hour and the ending I find hilarious. At first it may seem like just pure entertainment but I must say it has grown on me since I first saw it some months ago. It's not that it's especially deep but nor is it the opposite. When I first saw it I would have given it 5 or 6 out of 10 but maybe because generally I don't care so much about how expensive films look, I think there's more to it than maybe first meets the eye. The fact that I find the actors and the dialogue so good and funny is for me the most essential.I could imagine that some of the reviewers who give this a negative rating find the masculinity here a tad too toxic. For me they found just the right balance.In fact \"The Breach\" should in no way be seen as controversial and is a prime example of how a film can have a lot of humor without seeking the limits of free expression. Certainly compared to the 80's it's very harmless.",

He doesn't tell her what the gun is for or what'd happening on the space ship, no. He just shoves aa gun into her hands while she's still in the cryogenic pod. The woman has been asleep for almost 3 months and now she has a gun in her hands. Instead of telling her what's going on, the Protagonist drags her put the pod and into a swarm of zombies without warning.This is the general tone of this film: very illogical. It's zombies in space, but not the A-list version or B-list version...this is the H-list version. H for Horrible.Even Jodie Foster's look-a-like doesn't get a fair shake. There are too many scenes of characters looking at things that are about to happen and then just standing there.The bunk bed design was awesome.

Which is more than I can say for a lot of even worse films. So if you worked on this movie, good for you.Alas though, I can't let this one slide, when better movies were being made on similar budgets, 30 or 40 years ago...As a longtime fan of the space-horror subgenre, I'm only giving this 2 stars.This a really terrible, cheap-looking, silly film. Was it a joke? A barely coherent plot is dressed up with terrible CGI effects. From the ships to the machine gun blasts, to the fake CGI flamethrower fire. I've seen better special effects in Jimmy Kimmel skits.In the 80s, with the limitations of the practical FX of the day, a lot of scifi-horror films were made on tiny budgets that still managed to look far more authentic than this. Check out films like Moon 44, or DeepStar Six. I miss that amazing model work. Breach just seems lazy in comparison.Heck, even check out the recent short films based on \"Alien\", that were made with tiny budgets.Yet here we are in 2021. And Breach is an embarrassment compared with all of the above. Don't believe any mild praise you see for it, either. Some other reviewers appear to have lost their minds, or they'll just excuse anything.From the action, to the monster, to the acting, I wondered if I was being \"punk'd\" the whole way through this. At one point, our heroes go from shooting at the bad guys, to having an all-in fist fight brawl with the nasties. I couldn't stop laughing. The first act does build some low-level interest and tension. But there's far too much student-film on display here, to take this seriously. Nearly every scene contains something amateurish. Incessant lens flare, goofy acting, empty dialogue...How on Earth (or in Space) did Bruce and Thomas ever agree to this?2/10.If I had made this film myself, in college, I'd be mildly pleased with myself. Instead, I'm astounded this was released to the general public.",

Except it's pretty clear they only made one room, and one L-shaped hallway. Towards the climax, we see the zombie aliens attain their final form, and this must be the entire special effects budget, because by the end of the film, we've got some kind of stop motion 1933-King Kong lookin garbage, englarged with MS-Paint, and greenscreened into the background under a layer of dense fog.True to form, our heroes never seem to discover any way to kill the zombliens. There's several obvious options they ignore in favor of shooting nerf guns at them (props guy couldn't afford some black spray paint?).

The special effects are horrible. I wouldn't criticise the acting because the dialogue makes a good performance impossible.

Well compared to this, Ed Wood is a genius. Ed Wood's worst movie is good next to this one.

For unknown reasons, this terrible director and producer goes on and on working with stars the size of Bruce Willies. (Poor Bruce) Aren't there better directors in Hollywood? there must be thousands much more talented who are being ignored. Why does this person have a job? Weren't there better and brighter scripts to film or invest money in? Unfortunately I think this more often every day.\nI always try to see things from a positive point of view but it is getting harder and harder. I hoped that this movie was actually a joke, and I tried to see it from this perspective ... was useless. And those who invested money, don't they regret it? Please Mr. Willis, don't end your professional career by burying yourself under this heap of bad productions. This is not cinema, nor entertainment, it is a scam. A scam for those who invested the money, a scam for the audience, a scam for the professionals who worked in it ... What is happening to the film industry? Is the imagination over? Is this movie the best they can do? Really? What is the excuse in this current age, for not doing things right? Not to make good CG?

Its very very obvious that these are paycheck films for Bruce. Its not a hidden fact that he will only work for an enormous price tag and these are the producers (who aren't very good at writing films) willing to fit that bill and everything else is chicken feed left for the rest of creatives. Blame everyone for continuing to watch them because they see Bruce. Maybe pay attention to smaller productions that can evenly spread the effort to make a decent film. As a B-movie this is much better than the majority of others I've seen though. As I actually like B-movies and watch them, with the majority have terrible dialogue, and sound editing. This actually excels at sound that since a lot of action is happening off screen and the VFX are not doing it any justice but sadly they are very bad unfortunately which is breaking the entire filmmaking illusion. Its brainless fun even though overall the script was bad. Rating this a 8 because a lot have unfairly judge it, because they may see Bruce and expect the moon. Those days are over.",

            "content": "I have actually watched this movie twice, and trust me when I tell you that it doesn't get any better with repeat viewings.I have nothing against low-budget indie flicks, and I have watched enough of them to know that they can be just as enjoyable as big budget, studio-backed blockbusters - but this one did everything wrong.Okay, almost everything, because I actually liked the set design and the lighting; I'm a sucker for grimy, grungy sci-fi settings, and Breach delivered on that front. Some commenters have mentioned how cheap the sets looked, but I used to be a Trekkie; I was 100% willing to run with a reactor consisting of three red neon lines, and accept the general aesthetic as fitting a ship where crew comfort wasn't exactly a priority.But everything else was a disappointment.Plenty of other people have already mentioned the CGI and the poor editing and pacing, but the filmmakers apparently didn't even care about a trivial little thing called 'continuity' either, and at one point, Commander Stanley is referred to as 'Captain Stanley'. It's such a small thing, so why couldn't they be bothered to get it right?And speaking of small things; they even managed to spell one of their own actors' names wrong at the start of the movie, which is a very special kind of cluck up.The fight choreography is also poor, but I wasn't expecting much in that department anyway. Nor was I expecting much from Mr Willis, and yet he still somehow managed to disappoint.In fact, the acting is the most frustrating part of the entire experience--even more so than the storyline, which we'll get to next. The filmmakers squandered good actors, although how much of the blame should lie with the writers and how much with the director, I don't know. What I do know is that someone should have:\na) told Tim V Murphy and Thomas Jane to tone down their cartoonish accents.\nb) given Rachel Nichols more to do than be Willis' little shadow.\nc) actually told the actors what kind of movie they were making, because this movie just doesn't know what it wants to be.Is it a serious space-based horror? Kearsley, Clementi, Nichols and Mulvey seem to think so, and they're all (re)acting accordingly. Then you have Murphy and Jane who are just chewing the scenery because apparently they didn't get the same memo, and the aforementioned Mr Willis who is just there, whose acting ranges from 'grumpy' to 'surly' regardless of what is supposedly happening around him, and whose one-liners are simply cringe-inducing.And the less said about the Admiral's 'elite commando team', the better...Now, onto the storyline, and I was again 100% onboard with the premise. I didn't care that it wasn't original, so long as it was well-executed and entertaining. Well, it was neither. Character motivations are paper-thin at best, incomprehensible at worst. Characterisations seem to flip on a dime, too - so you didn't care about leaving 19 billion people behind, but you DO care about 300,000 on this ship? Right. The alien gets free shortly after leaving Earth but waits months to start wreaking havoc? Give me a break.You know, writing all this out makes me think something must have happened at some stage of the production. Last-minute rewrites, perhaps. I just can't believe that anyone would set out to create the mess this turned out to be, unless they were aiming to deliberately tank some careers, and I feel genuinely sorry for the less well-known cast members; I hope they don't end up being haunted by this thing.Lastly, I'd say watch it drunk, but I tried that the second time round and it was still bad. So just...avoid it.",

The same goes for Rachel Nichols, she's a lovely wonderful brilliant actress who was under used in this role (I might add) the same goes for Callan Mulvey and Timothy Murphy, again underused as they are both good method actors..But for me, what broke the 4th wall wasn't the effects or the god awful lighting or their use of grey corridors, but the use of the Red Dwarf bedrooms, in fact I'm pretty sure all the corridor scenes were stolen from the Red Dwarf set too.The alien, doing then black goop eye thing was straight out of the X files as was the whole alien premise, but nevertheless a damn fine Sunday afternoon movie with a decent level of suspense. Breaking the suspension of disbelief, the autopsy scene is simply laughable, so why don't they get real specialists in to block out these scenes... finally, does no one know what a headshot is ????In fact now I've gone back and looked at it, watch any Red Dwarf episode and you'll see what I mean about the sets..Nevertheless, I'd still go drinking with Bruce or Rachel",

The metal doors flapping about, the dead guy breathing, almost visible light bulb just outside the window, it's all just a bit tacky. The editing or lack of available scenes is criminal.

Like some of the other reviewers, I came here to see what the heck was going on, and I got my answer - and shut it off. This movie was bizarrely bad in every way; acting, writing, effects, pacing, plot, you name it. I dont understand how Bruce Willis signed on for this. Watch Thomas Jane in The Expance, and you'll see his talent was also wasted here. This is only worth watching to see something that boggles the mind that it was ever created in the first place.",

The dialog might be the worst ever. The directing is very poor as is the editing, actually the editing is putrid. Bruce and Thomas Jane have a few good acting moments but way more bad than good. Lead Cody Kearsley plays a character that is lost but the actor also looks completely lost in his role. Music was good. Movie is 2/10 stars. Worst Bruce Willis movie by far, very disappointed.

The script was worse than most fan fiction.

Although the (predictable) story arc could have been fun to watch had it been treated with a certain humor, the dialogue is too stereotypical and lacks any originality to the point of becoming boring.The cinematography is so bad that the image lacks depth and volume and I won't even talk about the colors.At first I thought I was watching a student movie, ready to forgive the cheesy sets and special effects but an hour and a half of this convinced me of the lack of seriousness the whole production crew demonstrated by trying to make a movie for which a budget of at least $10M was required just for CGI for the project.I would also condemn to the gallows the editor but I believe beheading the director would be sufficient.As a principle, I always watch a movie until the very end and this one made me regret it. There is an obligation any would be artist has towards his public and I feel betrayed.Shame on you John Suits.",

He had to have lost a bet to even show up for this movie, because he didn't even bother trying to act himself. All his lines are said in mono-tone, with no effort behind them. But that wasn't even the worst acting. It seems that either A, no one knew their lines, or B, the director made them up as they went.I'm a fan of B rated movies. But this is worse than those. In fact, if they did make this as a B rated, it would have been enjoyable. At least then you could laugh at the poorly made set. Steel doors that move around like plastic. Air tight seals that could be broken with a screw driver. Guns that never run out of ammo, or even eject a shell. A fire extinguisher turned flame thrower (Or maybe it was a potato gun).(Spoiler)\nBest part is when they finally wake up. The Admiral. You think, hey, something is gonna happen now. I mean, they literally say, let flush them out the airlock. So one would think that's what is gonna happen next. The alive crew is safe in airtight doors, just bleed out the air and boom. All dead.Nope.Instead they run out like morons and try to do the exact some thing the now dead crew did...Shoot an alien species that can't die to being shot...",

The only other option i can think of is that he ran over some dudes dog and agreed to star in his film to make up for it.The idea could have been good but the execution was terrible. They clearly struggled for investment and ended up having to make the film on a budget of about $12 because the props look like they were bought from toys'r'us or found in the skip at universal studios and the CGI appears to have been done by a high school kid on his iPhone.I'm embarrassed for the actors involved in this project and as a piece of advice to the production team, I'm all for following your dreams but when investors are laughing at you and asking you to be removed from the office (As i assume happened for you guys...) then maybe you should question whether it really is a good idea to inflict you abortion of a movie onto the world...",

Uninteresting and has absolutely no screen presence. Why was he cast in this role?I clicked on this film because I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis. The movies he has been in later years have not been like Die Hard or the 5th Element ... but watchable. THIS one... I mean, what is going? And, Thomas Jane... after The Expanse, he should have had the choice of the best sci-fi projects out there. Does anyone know the backstory here? The script is so bad that surely Willis or even his agent would have rejected it. Why did they agree to this? (Why did Netflix even agree to have it on their platform?)Why risk ruining the legacy Bruce Willis. Think of all the great characters he has given us: McClane, Stamper, Dallas, and so many more.It is a mystery.",
