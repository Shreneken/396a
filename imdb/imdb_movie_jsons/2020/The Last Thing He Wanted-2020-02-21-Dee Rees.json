What was seasoned writer and director Dee Rees on when she wrote and directed this, and did no one else proofread this convoluted plot ridden excuse for a screenplay?Ugggh, 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! Watch the trailer and you've seen the entire movie - and the trailer makes more sense than the movie if that tells you anything. What a waste of talented actors. A shame this will be a thorn on their resume, I hope they got paid well. NOTHING in this film made any sense. The only thing I got out of this film was to take up smoking; Hathaway was successful in advertising cigarette smoking.The only reason I'm not giving this film a 1/10 is +1 for the actors and +1 for the producers not posting fake/paid reviews - yet. Thus it's a 3/10 from me",

            "content": "'The Last Thing He Wanted' begins with a long narration from Anne Hathaway's character. We have no context for what she is saying, and what she is saying is so incredibly dull that it is nearly impossible to focus on what she is saying for the lengthy duration she rambles on for. This sets the tone for a truly shocking film. I can't remember the last time I saw a film so pretentious and full of itself, while concurrently being of such a low standard.Where do I begin with the faults this movie contains? The story is all over the place for starts. It darts around like a headless chook running in circles and never settles down for a moment. The movie asks you to follow every little detail hidden in the dialogue, but the dialogue is so bland and uninteresting that is an immensely tough task to do so. If you haven't completely lost interest in this film 15 minutes in then you have the patience of a saint.I looked up the book this is based on. From what I can tell people were not overly fond of this book. Which begs the question why it got a film when so many incredible books out there have failed to do so. Who read this rambling mess of a story and thought it would make for a great film? Also how did they get a cast as good as they did with a script this bad? I know Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck's careers have fallen off a cliff, but surely not to this extent? I really did not enjoy this film and even though it's free to watch on Netflix I would suggest it is not worth your time or effort.",

            "content": "Dee Rees, the director of the much acclaimed \"Mudbound\", offers up her second Netflix collaboration - \"The Last Thing He Wanted\", a crime thriller based on Joan Didion's novel of the same name. The cast includes such stars as Anna Hathaway, Willem Dafoe & Ben Affleck, also Rosie Perez and Toby Jones. What could possibly go wrong? Apparently a whole lot.\"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is, in a certain way, an annoying experience. Its main strength are the acting performances, the highlights include a content and contained lead performance by Anna Hathaway and a well fitted supporting role for Willem Dafoe. Rosie Perez and Ben Affleck were good as well, but, frankly, they weren't given enough to do to really stand out. It's a mildly frustrating watch because the star-studded power seems wasted on an otherwise weak and confused movie. Or rather the story and screenplay. I can only suppose it's an unsuccessful adaptation of the aforementioned novel. Visually, \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is shot very well (and uses a peculiar aspect ratio, but with no complaints), looks and sounds like an above average Hollywood-type thriller. But all of that only matters so much on the background of the script which feels like a lot of things and almost none of them are good - it's disjointed, unfocused, doesn't stick together, doesn't carry the weight it should (I'd take a guess though that the filmmakers think otherwise) and just disappoints altogether. While watching I felt like each scene is somehow to be taken on its own terms, every time the previous one didn't feel important much anymore. What I'm trying to say is that a rather simple story telling has gotten all tangled up here and it's a huge black shadow hovering over \"The Last Thing He Wanted\".Despite the quite enormous flaw/s, \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" possesses one or two redeeming qualities. I'll go ahead and assume, probably correctly, that this movie is going to be a bore to a lot of people, but if the viewer commits, it's possible to squeeze out an eyebrow-raising evening 5/10, which is the most I can give it with a clear conscience.",

How William Defoe could get involved in this movie!? If he didn't read the script he should fire his agent. Anyway, to be more precise, i renamed the title of the movie to The Last Thing I Wanted, and put it on my personal blacklist that's called \"never watch or touch it again\". But for certain from a certain perspective it is an achievement to make such a bad movie with that kind of skilled cast... Verdict: one of those fast produced movies that are made these days to fill the airtime of some paychannel. My guess: The Last Thing He Wanted will be faster forgotten than produced.",

            "review_title": "A Film That Hasn't Found Its Audience",
            "content": "Just tonight I watched \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" with my family -- two younger siblings (16 and 18) and my mom (60). All four of us loved it. We were all talking happily about it after it was done. I had heard vaguely that it was getting bad reviews, but I hadn't actually read any. Now I'm on IMDb and I'm seeing all these one star reviews. I decided to make an account just to give my own opinion.This movie is hard to follow. That's something everyone here is mentioning. But it seems to me like it wasn't THAT hard to follow. It's only about as convoluted as \"The Big Sleep\" or \"Funeral in Berlin,\" which don't have rock bottom ratings.That makes me think that this film just hasn't found its audience. I think a lot of people came here looking for action scenes, and got bored with this mainly dialogue driven movie (which was adapted from a novel). I found the movie very tense and thrilling throughout, so that the action scenes came as exciting escalations of the ever-present tension. But if the dialogue is not hooking you, you probably won't be feeling the tension much in the first place.And the dialogue is a big thing. I have no doubt I wouldn't have been able to make sense of the movies without having the subtitles on. The characters talk fast and reference a lot of names (of places, people, and organizations). It expects you to keep up with this rapid fire pace. To be fair, this is just one of the pitfalls of adapting a novel. There are so many words, and if the actors spoke more slowly they'd never be able to fit the whole story in one movie.I think the pacing was truly admirable. Most novel adaptations either have dumb time-skips where you miss important information, or have summary-style scenes where all the interesting dialogue is cut out to leave the plot-relevant information, or have scenes that plod on much longer than they should. \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" goes at a clip, really rushing from thing to thing. But each point is actually made very well in each scene, and the rush of it becomes pretty exciting. You have no time to stop and think while your life is at risk, and you have no idea who to trust. This ends up demanding a lot of focus from the viewer. I think my family enjoyed it so much because we saw it as kind of a game. We pointed things out to each other and tried to make connections between things.I can understand reviewers who were unpleasantly surprised to find that there isn't much action here, and that the fast-paced dialogue requires a lot of concentration. That isn't everyone's cup of tea. But I also get the sneaking suspicion that people are just frustrated that this movie doesn't spell everything out about the historical background. It frustrates me because the historical background is one of the most urgent things about the movie.Some movies will start with the ABCs because they know their audience doesn't know much about the subject matter. For instance, movies like \"Hotel Rwanda\" are like an introduction to their subject matter. It doesn't assume that you know very much about the Rwandan genocide. It wants to tell you about it.But if you're always starting from basics, you never get anywhere. Sometimes there are important things to say AFTER you've learned all the basics. That's the kind of movie \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is. It expects you to have some familiarity with the political background.And believe me, you should WANT to know more about the political background. Because this stuff is the background of our own lives today. This movie is basically about how America behaves as a superpower -- how it acts at home and how it treats other countries around the world. The way it acts today is not much different. If you try to learn a bit about the background and then keep that in mind while you watch this movies, YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH THAT IS SO IMPORTANT! Of course, I can't guarantee that you'll like it. But this information is valuable in its own right.Basically, the backdrop for this movie is the Reagan administration's involvement in Central America and the Caribbean. The Cold War was still on, and a group of left-wing Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua. Reagan opposed this government and backed anti-Sandinista \"Contras\". He supplied these Contras with arms and funding, and also spoke out publicly in their favour. The problem is that the Contras, to quote Wikipedia, \"engaged in a systematic campaign of terror\" -- these were not just freedom-loving citizens who opposed leftism, but brutal armies. At the same time, the US government was getting involved in similar ways in El Salvador, Grenada (a Caribbean island), and many other places across the world.Besides the moral problems associated with backing the Contras, there were also the nefarious ways that the government did it. It was not by any means a straight-forward affair -- the CIA and other government agencies acted in almost total secrecy, and a lot of shady dealing got mixed in with the declared actions the Reagan administration was taking.This is the central dynamic of \"The Last Thing He Wanted.\" The shady backroom stuff can't be disentangled from what the government is officially doing. Anne Hathaway's character, Elena, is a journalist who documents the things that the government wants kept secret. Early on in the movie, Ben Affleck's character debates with another Washington guy about whether or not to \"allow\" her to keep doing her journalism there. The other guy thinks it will help to make things seem more unstable in Nicaragua, and thus give legitimacy to American operations there. Affleck's character, Treat, thinks it's too risky to have the truth come out.The question hanging over the whole film is, who is out to get who? When Elena (Hathaway) starts to get involved in her father's smuggling operation, she doesn't know who is connected to the Sandinistas, who is connected to the Contras, who is perhaps only trying to make money off of drugs, and who is connected to the US government. For people connected to the US government, we have to wonder, do they know Elena is a journalist and care about that, or is she only relevant because of the smuggling thing?Basically, everyone's motives are completely tied up with the political situation at the time. But, let's be real, the world hasn't changed that much. It's exactly the kind of high-handed treatment of other countries which are, in theory anyway, sovereign, which makes China, Russia, and other countries so recalcitrant about accepting US leadership. If this is how the US treats Nicaragua, why wouldn't they treat China the same way?It's also the same attitude which led to the (second) Iraq war. Now, I need hardly remind you that the Iraq war is a huge reason why people are so jaded about politics today. People were lied to on a massive scale, and bought into a costly and painful war over what turns out to have been nothing important. It has given both Republicans and Democrats a sense of powerlessness and cynicism (one of the things which helped elect Trump). Moreover, American prestige has never recovered, and the international well of goodwill for America has become very shallow.Well, that's my little history lesson (and I don't claim to be an expert on any of this stuff). But it gets to the heart of what matters today. The world still works the way it does in \"The Last Thing He Wanted,\" and unlike a movie, you can't just give it one star and tune it out.",

It is one of the worst films ever which nearly everything about it is bad and terrible. Besides having a good cast with Anne Hathaway, Ben Affleck, and William Dafoe.

The plot is boring and all over the place which by the time it reaches its end. You do not even care about what just happened.

The premise of the film sees a journalist who is fed up at work go on a job for her father which causes her to question if the story is worth the effort.Main Character\nAnne Hathaway is one of the best actresses around and she is fantastic in this role, she delivers a very memorable and interesting role here. She has some very quick and snappy lines which mixed with her dramatic moments really provides a pretty real character that you can actually sympathise with and was easily the best part of this film.Supporting Characters\nWillem Dafoe plays her father in the film and he does a really good job in the role, his character is clearly very shady and messed up but I liked his relationship with Hathaway and felt it was probably the most interesting part in the film and I wish we could have seen more. Ben Affleck is in this film and he does an okay job with what he is given but his character is really boring in this film. He isn't in the film a huge amount and they don't do enough to make you interested in his character. Rosie Perez is also in this film and I just didn't find her character interesting either, she is just Hathaway's friend in the film and doesn't have a defined character in the film.Story\nThe story is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the film, it just moves all over the place and feels very jarring. It is very confusing and clearly thinks it is clever then it actually is, when Hatheways character works things out it just doesn't make any sense and it leads to lots of characters poping up that don't provide anything to the story. Plus the ending is absolutley crazy and again makes no sense and just leaves more questions then answers and not in an interesting way like some films can.Script\nThe script has some pretty quick and clever lines especially from Hathaway but the question is whether that is good scripting or whether it is just her performance. The fact that nobody else has any interesting lines in the film I have to believe that is was just her and the script is poor.Style\nThe style of the film is really nice to look at, it is shot really well and there are some films that build the tension pretty well. But this films pacing is pretty boring it is very slow but isn't interesting which makes it feel longer then it actually is.Overall\nOverall this is a very forgettable film that has some decent things about it but really isn't worth a watch.Rating - 4/10.",

They barely escape murderous government soldiers and Elena finds evidence of munitions from America. Two years later, she is pushed off her investigation and assigned to follow the Regan campaign. Her father Dick McMahon (Willem Dafoe) is struggling. Her investigation leads to exports of excess American munitions to Nicaragua and Washington insider Treat Morrison (Ben Affleck).The first half is a grim grind. Hathaway is doing a rough no-makeup character. The film is washed out. The camera is often close up. I'm willing to go with the style and at least, Hathaway is trying to do something different. The overall pacing is rather boring and then there is a change in the middle. It starts with something questionable and it doesn't stop. The bad guys try to set her up with a brick of coke. My question is why they wouldn't simply kill her in that random Central American hotel and plant the coke on her. I don't get her relationship with Treat. I don't get why she's using the fake passport. I don't get a lot of this story. I'm willing to believe that she's not doing the smartest things but these things still need to be set up better.

With a plot hovering around Reagan, Sandinistas, conflicting American ambitions, and personal baggage, this story merits going back for its history, but even that doesn't promise your understanding. At any rate, it's plot-heavy with material for several movies.Young but experienced journalist Elena travels to South America to collect an arms contraband payoff for her dicey dad, Dick (Willem Dafoe). You know this is not going to come out well, especially since revolutionaries are notoriously poor debtors, not terribly respectful of women, and this revolution a story she was working on anyway.Adapted from Joan Didion's novel, The Last thing He Wanted is probably too faithful to the book and too heavy with its many plot strands. Yet it briefly entertains as interesting eccentrics glide in and out, and a central player, Treat Morrison (Ben Affleck), doesn't justify his place in the plot until the end, where he really places himself, if not too late.Needless to say, I should see this gnarled espionage thriller again to get just the plot right. Yet, why should I have to?\"We were moving fast. We were traveling light. We were younger. I was younger\" Elena",

            "content": "Okay, so this movie is BOMBING. Apparently people hate it. But, you know, most people aren't saying they don't like it period, they're saying that they couldn't follow it. I could follow the movie, and I liked it a lot. I want to spend this review trying to give the (spoiler-free) background that will help the story make sense. Hopefully with a bit of background, people will be able to make some sense of it, and might enjoy it as much as I did.\"The Last Thing He Wanted\" has an urgent story to tell about politics, power, and violence. It is packed with a crazy amount of details, which is overwhelming, but they are all true (or fictionalized details that are close to the truth). The author of the original novel, Joan Didion, was a journalist like the main character. You need to approach this as a kind of expos\u00e9 of how politics worked in the 80's and still works today, not as a piece of escapism.In the 80's, the Reagan administration was heavily involved in Central America and the Caribbean. \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is mostly concerned with Nicaragua. At the time, a leftist Sandinista government was in power there. As part of the Cold War, the US was supporting a group of \"Contras,\" armed forces fighting against the Sandinistas. The problem is that the Contras were, as it says on Wikipedia, \"engaged in a systematic campaign of terror\" against the populace.Reagan was vocal in his support of the Contras. Elena (played by Anne Hathaway) quotes him early in the movie, mentioning that he had said \"I too am a Contra.\" However, the extent of US involvement there was kept mostly under wraps. The CIA and other organizations were involved in all kinds of secretive business, including what would eventually be the \"Iran-Contra Scandal,\" something I don't have space to explain here.The whole plot of \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" plays out against this backdrop. As the movie begins, Elena is investigating the atrocities committed by US-backed soldiers. She's trying to crack open the case so that the government is held accountable. In a very early scene, Treat (Ben Affleck), who I think is in the CIA, discusses with another Washington type whether they should allow her to keep working or not.Their conversation alerts us to the shadiness of the CIA and other US government agencies in this movie. They want to control the conversation in America so that they can act with impunity in Central America. In other words, the question of American democracy at home and foreign policy abroad are inextricable. Elena wants democracy at home and accountability abroad, and that puts her at odds with Washington.So, in the main plot of the movie, when Elena is back in Central America, we are stuck in the middle of all kinds of conflicts. Are the people she is dealing with Sandinistas, Contras, or unaffiliated? Are they connected to the US government, and if so, do they know she's an investigative journalist? Could they be connected to other foreign governments?The situation depicted in \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is so relevant, because it's this exact problem which is at the heart of politics today. Now, voters in America are disenchanted with a government they see as unresponsive and unaccountable. Likewise, the world at large is eschewing American leadership, partly out of distrust. Both of these facts can be traced to just such situations as these.If you want to dig a bit deeper into the present political moment, learn more about the world of \"The Last Thing He Wanted\"! Even if you never like the movie, it's important to understand. Once you know the historical background, I think you'll find the movie much more rewarding, too.",

            "content": "Every now and then a film comes along and you just have to ask yourself (after watching it) how it possibly got released this way. I heard about this film a couple of months ago and absolutely loved the cast involved, so I was kind of eager to watch it. Released by Netflix and directed by Dee Rees, the same woman behind the very good film Mudbound, The Last Thing He Wanted is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. It's not to say that any of the acting is bad, or the Cinematography, or even the directing for the most part, but here's why this movie will likely confuse even the smartest people on the planet.\"A veteran D.C. journalist loses the thread of her own narrative when a guilt-propelled errand for her father thrusts her from byline to unwitting subject in the very story she's trying to break. Adapted from Joan Didion's namesake novel.\" That is the description of the film that's given on the IMDB webpage for this film. I decided to quote that, rather than describe this plot myself because even after reading that description, I hardly got any of that out of this film. The film follows Elena (Anne Hathaway) and once she reconnects with her father Dick (Willem Dafoe), the \"true plot\" kicks in. It was during these few early moments between these two that had me interested, simply due to them just being great actors, but once the story progressed, I found myself lost in this story every few minutes.Adapted by Dee Rees and Marco Villalobos, The Last Thing He Wanted has a screenplay that needed about a thousand rewrites. It felt like a film that was trying to be extremely intricate and smart while failing to deliver any sort of coherency. The description that's used for this movie all over the internet is only about 20% of what this movie is truly about, but if I tried to explain the rest of it, I would probably do it incorrectly or leave things out. It's just far too jumbled to be any kind of memorable. On top of the script being messy plot-wise, the dialogue was incredibly unengaging. I was staring at the screen, trying to latch onto anything anyone was saying, but it just wasn't working.What's even more frustrating about this movie is the fact that everyone seems to believe it's a great movie, so I feel bad for everyone involved with it. The Cinematography by Bobby Bukowski is pretty solid and the performances by Anne Hathaway, Ben Affleck (whose purpose in the movie had me chuckling), Willem Dafoe, and Rosie Perez were all far better than this movie deserved. That's just about all the praise I can give here. Once this movie tries to explain certain story elements in the final few moments of the movie, I was scratching my head and literally asking \"What?\" out loud.In the end, I'm sure the performances and look of the movie will be enough for some people to enjoy aspects of this film, but it was a trainwreck of a story for me. I usually try to find the absolute best in movies, no matter how good or bad they are, but for myself, I just will never be able to recommend this movie to anyone. Netflix has been releasing some amazing films lately, so this was a huge surprise to me. Not only Netflix, but I really enjoyed the director's previous work in Mudbound. I just think this film is an example of a movie that had many script issues but was made anyways and had no way of being salvaged. The Last Thing He Wanted is a complete mess of a movie, which is a shame.",

I suggest viewers Watch the 5 minute video on YT called \"What Was the Iran-Contra Affair?\" before watching this movie.I hope you forgive me, but here comes my rant: I am in utter disagreement with USA tv pandering to the lowest common denominator. American tv has been doing this for the last 30 to 40 years, under the excuse that they need to use simple words and simple story lines, so that \"everybody\" can understand. I instead am an optimist: I believe low quality education doesn't have to equate slow thought capacity. I believe in the plasticity of the brain. When challenging content is presented and becomes the norm, people tend rise to the occasion.I see the low rating of this movie as symptomatic of a public which for generations has rarely been challenged in the context of entertainment; a public who rarely watches (let alone read) the news, knows little about geography and even less about their own history, and has unfortunately become complacent. Yes the script has some problems, some events could have transitioned better, and if that meant a longer movie or a mini series in stead of a movie, so be it.

This includes not only the plot and settings but also why the 'bad guys' are doing bad things.While there are some action scenes this is more of a slower thriller (which after seeing the trailer (after watching the movie), I can see why some would seem to be misled especially those with short attention spans).As for the main character's actions, it can be boiled down to her love for her father (the title is \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" after all) intertwined with her investigative journalistic drive to uncover the truth further mixed in with who on earth should she trust.Finally, there is no feel good Disney happy ending for everyone here.PS: Acting was great and there was nothing wrong with the cinematography.",

            "content": "This joke has been made a thousand times but The Last Thing He Wanted perfectly resembles how I feel about this movie. It was the last thing I wanted to see. There is so much that is wrong with this film. Whenever I watch a movie for the first time, I pay full attention to it so that I don't miss any details. After watching this, I thought, \"What?\". I don't understand what this movie was about or what happened. Its plot is so convoluted and confusing that I honestly can't tell you what happened. The film has little to no structure to it. Scenes just happen and then they go on to another unrelated scene. Since I couldn't understand what was happening, I was incredibly bored. This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. None of the characters are interesting or developed in the slightest. I like Ben Affleck, Anne Hathaway, and Willem Dafoe but I hated their characters. They are all unlikeable and don't have any motivation for what they do. Anne Hathway's character doesn't like her father at all and yet she decides to take over his job? It made no sense. Their performances weren't that great either. Willem Dafoe was fine and his performance was the only aspect I found above average but Affleck and Hathaway were pretty bad. Hathaway sounded like a robot the entire film and Affleck who has top billing was only in the film for 15 minutes. He contributed almost nothing to the film. The other actors did a pretty poor job and were very forgettable. I honestly forgot that Toby Jones was in the film until I started writing this. The script they were given was particularly awful. The dialogue was poorly written and shallow which hampered everyone's performance. The cinematography was fine. It wasn't special but it wasn't bad. The editing was particularly annoying though. It would cut randomly during scenes which threw off the focus of it. At other points, the editing would cut so rapidly and quickly that it was hard to tell what was going on. Overall, The Last Thing He Wanted is a convoluted, confusing, and boring film with a poor script, bad characters, and obnoxious editing.",

So, yeah, there are a lot of moving parts, and Dee Rees takes the Michael Mann route of making the audience pay close attention to how the story unfolds without making it easy in the storytelling department. Anyhow, I managed to follow the plot and if you feel it's convoluted or silly you should consult Didion novel. Also it's an unofficial remake of Antonioni's PASSENGER with Anne Hathaway taking over the Jack Nicholson part. For me, it made sense for what it is - a backbone for a sweaty and highly stylized excercise in arty thrillers like they used to make them in the seventies.Anne Hathaway is mesmerising in the leading role. Ben Affleck is good as the White House sleazebag involved with her. Toby Jones is a delight as an old semi-retired pimp who still knows how to create an intrigue. And above all else Bobby Bukowski does an impressive job as the director of photography. This film should be seen for his contribution alone.Admittedly, it's an acquired taste but not the kind of film that should be hated with such passion.

Don't know why the director had all the players deliver their lines so fast , like they were in a Lifetime channel production, or a porno, but it makes them look bad.Ms Hathaway early on has a fight with her editor about being pulled off a story. She flits around the office like a valley girl on crack, and , back away from the sunlamp Ann , it's bad for you. I remember hearing Hathaway interviewed by Terri Gross a couple of years back, and when she described playing a \"plain Jane\" character started fishing for compliments wildly from Gross; now I see why. In this piece when she faces off with New York actors playing central American gangstas it becomes laughable. Hathaway putting on a hard chick act is like casting Michelle Williams (that billboard of vunerability) as a Cholla...She pulls a gun on a driver and car jacks him, major cred problems..Rosie Perez is of Puerto Rican dissent, but seems to be Hollywood's resident Latina, as I saw her and fellow countryman John Leguizamo cast as Mexicans in LA in some other nebulosity. Her accent and voice are going from cute and perky to annoying and grating as she ages very quickly. Ever wonder what she REALLY sounds like?The only way to watch this movie and enjoy it is as a spoof, and thats made easy by the 80s get ups they have put everybody in. Dafoe is doing his imitation of Pacino, Perez of Rita Moreno, and Hathaway of her younger and more entertaining self.

I like her in this gritty, angry, taut and gaunt un-Hollywood journalista role.

But not here. This international anti-thriller, which freely mixes hardworking journalism and weapons smuggling, continues to blaze its own path of gibberish up through a disastrous finale. It's the kind of movie that establishes one major detail or location, and then veers toward the next big one, and never lets us settle in. The first 15 minutes or so, for example, establish that Anne Hathaway's extremely dedicated journalist Elena McMahon has done some heroic work in Nicaragua; along with her peer Alma (Rosie Perez), they escape the country in a thrilling shot that goes from outside the airport onto the runaway in one swoop. Moments later, Elena is back behind a desk at her job at the Atlantic Post, but her work has been stagnated by her employers, who want her to cover the 1984 election, which infuriates her. So she does that, and Rees establishes the election race with a few large sets of campaign rallies. But that's not the main story. Because at the same time, it becomes apparent that the very story she's been working on about smuggling has a personal connection, as her father Richard (Willem Dafoe) is in the middle of the weapons business. In a rambling bit of conversation that struggles to establish this and also their father-daughter dynamic, Elena takes a job for her father, wearing both her reporter and amateur smuggler caps. Hathaway is nonetheless all-in on this performance, and if the movie were more focused with Elena's intent I suspect her sincere work would be better received. Instead she comes off as a character at the center of a parody about a hard-working, fearless journalist, who has a magic intuition when it comes to making the right bold move, and later can hold her own against menacing weapons dealers like Edi Gathegi's Jones. In reoccurring quieter moments, Hathaway has an emotional core of being a detached mother, and a survivor of breast cancer, but both are distinct character elements that are lost in the fray.",

This was a rare movie that forces you to read in between the lines and get it wrong!, therefore adding to the confusion. I always felt like I was floating on a major event that fell in the water, dissipated and I sank in with it.

Hathaway is really trying to bring some soul into Elena McMahon and she certainly might have in another version of The Last Thing He Wanted. Her character is a breast cancer survivor, single mother, and stick-to-her-guns D. C. journalist. The movie is so committed to mirroring how tedious the assignment she is on is, though, that the movie's tone takes a major blow. Then there's CIA official Treat Morrison (Ben Affleck) who speaks slowly and has a glum face. He has something like five lines in The Last Thing He Wanted, and never has the actor resembled a brick more. The movie attempts to push him and Anne Hathaway as a romantic pairing, and it's so completely out of nowhere. When there's a twist in the relationship between the two, there's not enough built upon between them for it have any type of effect on anything.

They also use Mexican lingo, that are not proper for the countries showed, this is just DISRESPECTFUL.\nJust imagine, what will the audience would feel if I show a story in England and use Irish accent with Irish lingo, is just disrespectful and STUPID.\nThe are also not respecting distances, showing her landing in Nicaragua and traveling all the way to San Jos\u00e9, at least a 5 hour drive AND without doing any border control (Yes, Nicaragua and Costa Rica are two different countries), that not so say she drove not having a map, or knowing the stretch, and WITH NO PASSPORT.So, boring movie, with lack of respect and with a story that makes NO SENSE at all.\nI see what they tried to do, and the type of movie they wanted to release, but it is a complete FAIL.",

In that context, this movie makes perfect sense and works well. I agree that her going on the trip for her father's arms deal was a bit dubious (but it was not completely ridiculous, given his dire predicament and her previous experience in the region).

I've seen two and they were both terrible in a way that makes you wonder who could have been drunk enough and still kept a job long enough to commission them. And I've read more of her novels than that and they don't work and neither, to any significant extent, did any of her screenplays as movies. By the by, I've also heard or read her saying she did screenplays because they paid well and they were 'easy,' which I guess shows you her level of commitment there. But I think she cared about the novels, which, well, what can I say?Didion is a genius prose stylist and a great, acerbic analyst of American society's absurdities and sicknesses. Even in her novels, she finds a little space to get her licks in in these respects, but this, it turns out, is not material suitable for the screen. There's a long passage of voiceover near the start of this movie lifted straight from the book, probably because the screenwriters were as impressed as I generally am with her voice. It's fascinating just how badly it works on screen and shocking that no one stepped in to cut the hell out of it once that became clear. It's sludge and tangle: dull, confusing, almost impossible to follow and devoid of relevance to what we're seeing.So skip this and do yourself the generous favour of reading Didion's essays. You could start with her piece, from Slouching Towards Bethlehem, on Hollywood: 'I Can't Get That Monster Out of my Mind'.",

Then you watch this and say why did so many people make such terrible decisions (like me!)? Why was the plot so convoluted?There has to be a beginning, a middle and an end. They don't have to be in that order, but any book or film needs that. There has be some understanding of characters motivations (there was very little). The plot has to make some sort of sense at some point. It didn't for me.I had an understanding of the Anne Hathaway character at the start, a clever, battle-hardened journalist in search of uncovering a story and a web of corruption.Everything after that pointed to a na\u00efve wet-behind the ears woman who got herself into serious scrapes that she had no real concept of what to do in. Even when there was a way out and no point to continuing whatever quest she was on, or trust any of the dubious characters around her, she continued to do so.

If you can't answer these three questions, then there are extreme limits to how much you'll like this movie. It's not because these questions reveal required knowledge for watching this movie. It's because this movie caters to a certain type of individual, and if you can't answer the mentioned three questions, then your interests probably don't align with the targeted audience for this movie.This movie is primarily for those who are really interested in politics, world history, and government. If social studies was your favorite subject in school, you're pretty good at Trivial Pursuit, and you're highly interested in current world news affairs, then this movie may be for you. If not, then probably not.I don't fit the demographic which I've just described. I have a moderate interest in politics, but not much more than the average person, and I had no real interest in social studies, when I was in school. However, I do love movies, and I also enjoy a good thriller.This movie isn't much of a thriller. It has a few thriller aspects, but the movie isn't driven by them. It certainly would have been possible to tell this story without focusing so heavily on the interests of the targeted demographic. Quite a few movies have successfully done it. However, this movie doesn't even try.\"The Bourne Identity\" is a perfect example of what I'm talking about. It's a thriller that deals with certain government issues and topics, however, it's written in such a way that the audience can enjoy it without having to be deeply engaged in such issues. \"The Bourne Identity\" comes off as very authentic, in terms of the mentioned issues, however, the movie isn't driven by those issues. It primarily focuses on being a thriller and telling a story that a broader audience can relate to, easily understand, and be entertained by. In other words, you can watch it without having to have a deeper interest in any particular topic, like government, politics, or history. This particular movie doesn't offer that.For me, this movie's greatest strength is in its professionalism. It was made with seasoned, professional actors and a professional filmmaker. All of the performances are extremely solid, as you would expect from the big-name actors which appear in this film. You can easily watch it without feeling as if any of them are acting. This is something audience members often take for granted until you watch a lower-quality, grade-B movie. I've been running into quite a few of those lately, and they've given me a greater appreciation for those who are experts in the entertainment industry.So I give a lot of credit to the well-known actors in this movie. They're the biggest reason that I was able to enjoy this movie to any real degree. Had they been no-name, amateur actors, with limited skill, this movie would have been terrible.",

She is an incredible actress/actor that always excites, develops and provides across her work.'The Last Thing He Wanted' seems to force a vast range of sub-plots into the tight duration of its length, but for the first 2/3 of the film, it doesn't seem too problematic. Once in the final act, this is when plot beats seem forced and convenient to the story - characters suddenly appearing, re-introducing minor characters, forced relationships. But, this film still provides the audience with something new and engaging, especially upon a topic-matter that will at least entertain.Don't disregard the film. It is still deserving of your viewing, especially upon the sheer innovation and impressive style of the cinematography, production design and thrilling performance from the wonderful lead actress/actor, Anne Hathaway",

To be fair though I cant remember much about her character because nothing was sticking to me, everything was just washing over me. This is due to the incredibly slow pace and dullness of the script, I mean there is just nothing appealing about this film at all. The same goes to Ben Affleck and William Dafoe both trying there best but even those two great actors as well cant save it.The main problems are a story that could be interesting , riveting and suspenseful, but its laid out in this almost surgical manor that tries to explain everything so convoluted and all over the place that it becomes uninteresting really quickly.This film had all the ingredients for a great film.........decent director , fairly interesting premise/story , great cast and a great trailer.................but instead it was all thrown away for this almost B-movie like documentary film.........I don't know anymore , I don't care at all.Overall its 30% out of 100 its a bad film again from Netflix , unfortunately they do put out some stinkers..........very occasionally do they get it right but when they do they definitely do........you cant win all the time..........this is a perfect example of that, don't bother wasting your time with this one.....totally un-re-watchable and forgettable...........I never cared about any of it what so ever !!",

            "content": "It's unfortunate that the work of the great Joan Didion, who wrote the novel that this film is based on, is cut off at the knees by--of all things--the screen play. One disadvantage, viewers won't be schooled in the Iran-Contra scandal, which was a murky, poorly reported, hastily forgotten major episode in the Reagan administration, almost leading to his impeachment. So, at the onset of the story there's too much backstory that's a mystery to the audience.Didion's unparalleled reporting of the crisis in Central America was penned as a novel of her experiences during the time. And the filmmakers put together a superb cast to illustrate a novel whose style is challenging (more than most) to translate into a film. The central character played by Anne Hathaway (demonstrating here she needs a strong director and didn't get one), and that character makes choices that don't really comport with logic or anything remotely convincing. Today's film-goer is skilled in the hazards of the drug and arms trade of Central America, and even the most naive person wouldn't put themselves in the situation here.The screenplay is also negligent in defining who the cast of characters are and what their history has been. Ben Affleck's role is particularly poorly rendered. We simply assume he has a major role only because he's Ben Affleck. He drops in and out of the story in a confusing manner, and towards the end Hathaway's character shows a familiarity with him that isn't based on anything we've seen or been told. You can almost hear the audience ask in unison: \"Huh? Did the leave out a reel?\"Since Hathaway's character is pulled from investigating what she suspects is an illegal arms trade backed by the United States, the coincidence of discovering her alienated, alcoholic father is the very person behind it is too \"literary\" to be convincing. And what leads the character into the crisis at the heart of the film--entering the drug deal in lieu of her ill father to somehow redeem their relationship and further her investigative reporting to boot--is just too contrived to make sense. It can work on the pages of a book, but not as presented here. For a great example of how a film can succeed with material like this, see 1982's \"The Year of Living Dangerously.\"Other than Hathaway's often hollow too hasty reading of her lines, the cast is excellent and the production crew superb. But the screen adaption is so flawed you wonder why anyone even tried to realize it. This certainly won't damage Joan Didion's literary reputation, but it's unfortunately the filmmakers let an opportunity pass of furthering it.",

            "content": "Netflix has been on a roll these past few years. While changing the idea of how television can be consumed, the streaming giant has also financed dozens of films from revered auteurs and budding talent. This level of investment has paid dividends with films such as \"The Irishman'' and \"Roma.\" But like all portfolios, there are some stinkers such as \"Bright\" and \"The Ridiculous 6\" that blemish the hits. Joining the latter pile of garbage is the newest film to be dumped unceremoniously on Netflix: \"The Last Thing He Wanted.\"A journalist for \"The Atlantic Post,\" Elena McMahon made her mark with hard-hitting investigative pieces detailing the revolutions in 1980s Central America. One day, her secretive father attempts to reconnect with her after years apart. It's revealed he's rekindling their relationship because he has fallen victim to Alzheimer's. With his final days winding down, he confesses that he is a gun smuggler for the Nicaraguan Contras and asks her to complete his final deal. To fulfill her father's dying wish, Elena must go back to the place where everything began for her. Only this time, she's on the opposite side of the law than she was before.Re-teaming with Netflix after the critical success of \"Mudbound,\" director Dee Rees makes some of the most shocking failures a respected filmmaker could make.Her command of the material is nonexistent as the plot and characters move along without any rhyme or reason. For a two hour movie (that feels twice as long), Rees offers little in terms of suspense and subtlety. The choppy editing lacks any cohesiveness between its revolving door of throwaway characters and locations.Even when Rees is supplied with quality supplemental material, such as the score by Tamar-kali, she cues it at the most obvious times, turning it against her intentions.Rees does throw in a nice camera movement every once in a while, but it's painfully obvious that it's only being done to try and cover-up the catastrophe that is being filmed. An example is the laughably bad final shot that looks ripped straight from a parody movie.Adapted by Rees and Marco Villalobos from the book of the same name, \"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is one of the most incomprehensible movies ever made. I would feel safe betting someone a billion dollars to watch this movie and then properly explain what they had just seen.The dialogue is both cliched and flowery as it makes even the smallest detail hard to comprehend. Characters speak English in a way so cryptic that it seems they aren't even speaking English at all. No amount of rewinding or looking through a dictionary could help me understand what exactly someone was saying. Fortunately, the poor sound mixing makes half of the dialogue muddled, saving me from further anguish.Also part of the problem is the script's overabundance of half-baked storylines and details. I would say that almost every one of these plots and subplots is filled with holes, but I'm not sure of what the plot was, to begin with. Characters and locations come and go, barely leaving a mark on the overall narrative. That is, until the end when Rees wraps a dozen different things up in the final three minutes, ending the film in a pile of disjointed pieces that produces more questions than answers.I know it's a tired trope to say that a movie should have been a mini-series, but this seriously should have been a mini-series.Anne Hathaway is mediocre as our supposedly tough main character. Hathaway tries her best, but she is woefully miscast and can't muster a sliver of enough fortitude to convince us of her believability.Ben Affleck plays a CIA agent hot on Elena's trail. Affleck seems to have been on set for less than a week and has as much energy as someone who just woke up from a nap after downing a bottle of NyQuil. Factoring in his minuscule screen time, it's safe to say that the main reason he was cast was to put his name on the poster.Playing the ailing father is Willem Dafoe, who has recently been on a career resurgence. Disappointingly, Dafoe falls into the type of hammy overacting that plagued the middle third of his career.\"The Last Thing He Wanted\" is a glaring misfire on the careers of the usually dependable cast and crew. It will surely land on many \"worst of the year\" lists and may even take the top spot on a few. Thinking about this awful movie is the last thing I ever want to do.",

By the looks of him, we can tell he's chosen alcohol, money, and drugs over being there for his daughter. And perhaps he's struggling with slight wet-brain dementia? We don't know for sure, nor do we know whether he's just putting on a farce.This movie made you think - at what level do we begin choosing money over life? Choosing work over family. Choosing to help your ailing father obtain a very illegal million dollar payout, only to realize he sent you to retrieve it because he knew how dangerous it was.The guns, the drugs, the politics... were all just additions to the plot of this story, in my opinion. Yes, it told a fascinating tale, and if you have zero knowledge of recent history, it could be hard to follow. But beyond that, this movie forces you to question who you can trust in life. It forces you to question the choices you make - \"Why are you here?\" It offers multiple escape points for Anne's character, all of which she refuses to accept, and we're left to wonder how differently things would have played out for her had she chosen the right people to trust.",

It's confusing, self-important, rambling, non-sensical, disjointed, tedious and just plain dull.And is it me, or was the volume of this film curiously low? At first I thought I was missing things because it wasn't loud enough, but I was missing things because the film is, well...missing things. Like a story.And to think this incredible cast signed on for this! Were they given a wonderful script and then it got all chopped up in the editing room? Were they tricked? Duped? Anne goes all in to flesh out a character, but I started to feel sorry for her after awhile that she was working so hard, not knowing that the ship was sinking. For an actor, that seriously has to suck.When all was said and done, I suspect the producers knew they had a bomb, so they lowered the volume hoping we'd just fall asleep and forget the whole thing. Which everyone will.I don't like giving bad reviews, but this was just so remarkable in its terribleness that it was worthy of comment. I guess that's something.",

This is like a cinematic version of that, with the plot thrashing wildly, showing in quick, fragmented succession, showing an investigative journalist, a daring idealist, a political cynic, an alienated daughter, wife, and mother, a gun runner, a blubbering floozy having casual sex with an associate of George Schultz, CIA intrigue, ..., and so on and so on. Along with occasional, out of character, poetic narrative.You might be tempted by the impressive cast. But a dozen celebrities cannot make up for a disjointed script.

            "content": "When you go to a five-star restaurant, you expect a five-star meal. If, at the end of your dining experience, you find yourself feeling unsatisfied, your review of it will get an extra edge of harshness. I think this explains to a large extent why users and critics are attacking this movie with such little restraint.I do agree that there are many things that could have been done better, but I think that rating it anything below 4 must be a result of the emotion I described above, and doesn't do the movie any justice.I believe that with a different approach to the script and the buildup of the movie, the results might have been better. I guess it's always a challenge to try and \"do a book\". I'm pretty sure Dee Rees was aware of that, as she described Joan Didion's book as 'fragmented' and 'jumping around in time'. Since watching a movie is an entirely different experience compared to reading a book, choices must be made to clear up that fragmentation. It seems that Rees wanted to stay true to the novel, more than is good for her movie.The result of this approach has been that established and experienced actors do not end up placed in the story in a way that allows them to shine and display their best talents. The ever-charming Anne Hathaway still did an acceptable job, but that's the thing. Your lead protagonist has to shine, always. There just aren't many exceptions to this rule, in much the same way as the lead vocal in a song has to be stable and clear in order for any song to be appreciated by its listeners.This could have been a really good movie. You have the budget, you have a strong cast, you have great locations, you have good cinematography, and, let's not forget this: you have a good story. Yes, a good story. It's just hard to follow, and you can remedy that by reducing the disjointedness that apparently worked for the book, but pretty much buries the story if you use the same approach for a movie.I'm sure that Dee Rees will learn a lot from this experience, and I am confident she will give continue to give us great movies in the future. I still have a good degree of sympathy for this film, which is why I rated it six stars. I didn't feel like I wasted my time. I had a meal that satisfied my hunger, but not the expectations that I started it with.",

In fact the movie should have considered that all people did not read the original novel, and do not necessary know much about geopolitics.\nI did not read the novel, and I admit I had a hard time trying to understand all the events and details as the story went on. It was clear, however, that the main character Elena was investigating sensitives affairs in central America, which represented a threat to important politicians in the US.\nThe profile of Elena is clearly the one of an extremely audacious woman, ready to risk her life for her cause. When she arrives in Nicaragua and things do not happen as planned, she chooses to stay in an extremely hostile place to dig deeper in the subject, instead of running back to her airplane back home, something anyone with a minimum sense of survival instinct would have done. (Personally I wouldn't even have entered the plane to begin with, but yes I'm a coward).\nThen all the atmosphere of mess, chaos and paranoia is actually thrilling, imo. The fact that we do not know exactly where she is and who are the friends and who are the enemies translates what the main character probably felt. Anyone is potentially an enemy willing to kill you. I was curious to see how would or how could she get out of such a degenerated situation. Well she didn't.\nThe story makes you wonder, in fact, why did she go on that trip, and why did she stay, if it was for the money, for the cause, or for both. I would guess for both.The movie failed to keep the audience connected due to a complete lack of clear illustration and explanation of the context, I was extremely frustrated not being able to fully understand who were some character, and what was exactly happening in some scenes.But I think the story caught my attention, and I think I learned a couple of new things about some events that were going one in the Reagan era, involving politics and interests concerning Central America.",

Especially if you lack advised historic background AND advanced concentration skills to stay hooked for this amount of time.Although the bottom line theme was quite clear to me while watching this movie, I too felt puzzled, disconnected and somewhat frustrated trying to understand in details all characters and plot-twists while watching it.This is not a straight forward 'popcorn' movie, you really must be knowledgeable and engaged to 'enjoy' it. 'Enjoyment' for me only in an intellectual way grasping the sad point this movie is trying to make in a hard way, since the conclusion and the end makes you feel sorry for humanity and the journalist.Nonetheless, I think this movie is a brave attempt at times only the easy to digest 'movies for knuckleheads' seem to receive good ratings.\nfrustrating\nwell made",

Disjointed, obscure plot, unintelligible blathering, etc. Read all the reviews, same, so, bad movie, period.Except that there was a little voice in me saying hey you did not try very hard to understand this movie, in fact you did not try at all. So I gave it a second try, and frankly, I had a much better experience. I watched it a third time, and seriously, I am beginning to warm up to this movie.Truth is, you won't enjoy his movie while stuffing your face with popcorn, chatting to your friends on your mobile phone, and doing 10 other things at the same time. This is just simply not that kind of movie. It needs your full attention and probably multiple viewings. Add some research on the context. It doesn't entertain as much as it challenges. If you are not OK with that, this movie is not for you, and you'll probably be disappointed. If you are OK with that or even appreciate a movie like that, you will probably like it.Thing is, I hardly ever see a movie that I even remotely consider watching again. This one I have watched three times so far. So, it can't be that bad, can it. If there is one thing I question now, that is the producers' choice to make this particular book into a movie. Probably not the easiest task, and they did a good job at it, but yes, this will never be a blockbuster. Most people watch movies for light entertainment, to switch off, not to switch on.

The gesticulation when smoking is distracting and incredibly amateur. She talks fast throughout the movie in a desperate attempt to sell the character and with this film she has reached a new level of over-acting.

I kept rewinding and watching parts of this film again in case I had missed something crucial - but nope - hadn't missed a thing! And why in heavens name were the drug dealers so readily accepting of her? Not that I have ever tried to infiltrate a drug dealing cartel - but who knew it was so damn easy?? Apparently the movie is based on a book and the script writers changed the ending. Well I have another suggestion - just erase it. All of it. Please.
