            "content": "I suppose I am like many, kind of a nostalgic completist. I watch the new Star Trek show hoping to feel some of the pleasure I felt watcing them for the first time, in my own relative youth. I was in my mid-twenties when TNG began and my thirties for Voyager and DS9. Like many of the older fans, my memory of TOS was reruns, cartoons and movies.Putting aside nostalgia, one of the reasons I considered Picard to be my favourite Enterprise captain was the interesting combination of rationality and emotion and of reserve and physicality. Almost tied was Sisko, who brought together such qualities in a different but equally impressive way.Nostalgia is fine and I enjoy looking back. I appreciate some of the changes that have come over the years with experience and maturity. But I know that my prime has passed and the decline accelerates each year.Which takes us to Star Trek: Picard. I watch this not because I think it to be the equal of its predecessor. I watch it for the sake of nostalgia. Patrick Stewart is a shadow of his former self, his physicality shrunken and his voice that of an elderly man. But my memory of the original endears him to me. Unfortunately, his character seems to have changed. Not just far more emotional but also a person who prizes his own personal desires above his duty. Many of the themes that made Star Trek so enjoyable have disappeared.",

            "content": "After the greatest disappointment that was Discovery I had really high hopes for this one, especially after hearing that Patrick Stewart will return to reprise his iconic role he seemed to have abandoned long time ago and after watching 5 of the show's 10 episodes I have to admit that this is just as crappy as Discovery. A good show is supposed to present the characters you will sympathize with, root and care for, find something in common or at least anything - Picard does not have any of those characters. Even the titular JL is wasted and you just don't see him shine as brightly as he once was. Patrick tries his best to be Jean-Luc but after half of the first season I just don't see him in this role anymore. Overall the show is completely different from what you would expect from Star Trek: it doesn't have the depth, good characters, well-written stories and anything to think about after the episode is over. The original series was a masterful show, the Next Generation was a glorious comeback and superb continuation, Deep Space Nine was good in its own way, Voyager was a nice touch to expand the universe and Enterprise was a beautiful way to end the saga with the beginning. After that there were no Star Trek series no matter how frequently the writers and producers are eager to call them that. Picard is another piece of garbage that parasitizes on a great idea adding its nonsense into a fully grown and finished masterpiece no one asked for. I give it a six only because of Sir Patrick and the fact that I haven't finished the season yet and I think I'm not going to.",

            "content": "Star Trek Picard started out all right for the first episode. By the 2nd episode, it started to become obvious that this was never going to be as good as the Star Trek shows and movies between 1966-2005.Firstly, the writing was all over the place, and the story was, for the most part, superficial to non-existent. So many sub-plots were never followed up with or clarified, and questions were left unanswered. Writers magic was used in so many cases where a more dedicated person would have thought things out sensibly. For example, the 'imagination tool'. Also, the situation surrounding the federation's fall were not on par with what the Star Trek universe lore had set up already, and the only way it could have fallen that way was if people from today took over the future and ran it with today's knowledge. Some of the decisions they made were completely ridiculous, and made it seem like somehow the Star Trek universe lost most of its intelligence since Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. It was just a complete mess.Secondly, the acting was unconvincing. They were just going through the movements of an unbelievable story. They obviously didn't believe it and are clearly rooted in today's world instead of Star Trek's. I didn't care for any of the characters, and found most of them to be unlikable. Even Picard was a shell of his once interesting self, not the strong leader he once was. The actor who played Data was the best of the bunch when he played Data, but was also unlikable when he played human roles.Thirdly, excessive swearing was difficult to take serious after Star Trek set 40 years of good storytelling, showing a future that had evolved from excessive swearing, or didn't use it at all, and opted to be diplomatic and intellectuals instead. In Picard we had juvenile foul-mouthing in most every episode. In fact, it ruined the whole series and completely took me out of it right from episode 2 when it was first used.Fourthly, the show-runners were laying heavily on the nostalgia card, betting on name dropping, and character pop-ups from former series. This alone was the first indication to me that they knew they didn't have a story. By the end of the season it turned out nostalgia was the only real card they had to play. It felt like they were patronizing fans and insulting their intelligence with this, and even that turned into a waste since it didn't help a trash-heap story at all.Lastly, it was obvious they were doing their best to hold back political correctness as much as they could (probably from backlash in Discovery), but it still kept creeping in. They let it ruin much of the Star Trek lore, and now it's clear they're ready to come out with it in full force for season 2, which is poised to be another aimless season that they'll make up on the fly, or possibly plagiarize.This isn't Star Trek.Star Trek is about a future to strive for, and to aspire to be like - better than ourselves today. But every movie and show since the finale of the Enterprise show in 2005 has completely ignored this, and Picard is no different. We are presented with a darker future, one that is not inspiring, or even worth striving for. It's now the opposite, and makes me want to fight any future like that from arriving.I gave it 10 episodes, and after the disappointment wore off and after gathering my thoughts over the last 2 months, I've decided I will not watch another episode of this. Even though Picard is not as bad as Discovery, it's the second worse Star Trek series created, and the second Star Trek series that doesn't interest me at all.What i wanted was a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating show, depicting a future worth striving for, wanting to visit. Possibly in stand-alone episodes so they could be watched in any order. I ended up getting an uninteresting soap-opera wannabe, set in a future i don't care about, that heavily mirrors current political correctness insanity, and that i don't want to see any more of.0/10",

Whoever took over for this season is a true fan and knows what they are doing.Why oh why could we not have had this for the first two seasons. Season 3 is everything I would want: well written, great character development, good pacing and action, adequate amounts of fan service without going overboard- it's fun and great.The standouts to me are the interactions between Picard and Riker. It's great to see that chemistry once again. Worf is the best he's ever been. Beverly is fantastic as well- especially the scenes between her and Picard.I have to say, so far, the performances of the TNG cast is the best I've seen from them. They really put in their all.The only thing that saddens me is that there are no plans to keep going after Season 3. I would totally stick around for more seasons of this. I hope they change their mind.",

Then season 2 came, and it immediately put me off with an episode that seemed to be more about Picard's emotional state than, you know, space, frontiers, that sort of thing.Still, I stuck with it. And it had its moments. But it was all just irretrievably dumb. People constantly made bad decisions. Sometimes the series would just drag, or hammer you over the head with a plot device. The entire season is simply poorly written. After 6 episodes I decided I wasn't going to bother to watch the rest. It's just all too dumb.While some people here are whining that season 2 is too \"woke,\" I think it's great to show how terrible ICE is. I like this season's politics, I just don't like much else.Fingers crossed season 3 gets the series back in gear.",

Decent acting.--Prior review of S1 and S2:As a ST:TNG fan I wanted to like Picard.Sadly the first two seasons were a convoluted mess written by woke Hollywood hacks who clearly don't understand the appeal of Roddenberry-era Star Trek.Nonsensical plot lines. Established foes (the Borg for example) become shallow, silly caricatures. Too much Picard \"haunted by his past\" or delivering \"inspirational and heartwarming speeches,\" rather than solving problems in clever and authoritative TNG style.Just lazy by-the-numbers storywriting.Self-indulgent leftwing political talking points delivered in patronising, non-artistic style. I hate to see Star Trek infected with the woke mind virus. There's a massive difference between the progressiveness of TNG and the raw, divisive politicking of ST:Picard and Discovery. I'm fed up of my favourite franchises being turned into tedious identity politics lectures by \"holier than thou\" writers who don't care about the actual stories they're meant to be writing.Every TNG reference and character feels derivative and misplaced. Every new character seems a misfit in the Star Trek canon. Contrived and dull (Elnor). Completely Un-Starfleet-worthy (Rios, Raffie). Unfunny comic relief (Jurati). Laris is a little more interesting and likeable, but what is an Irish Romulan doing as Picard's house maid? It makes no sense at all.I'm torn. Plod on to see the cast reunion in series three? Or leave my last memories of the crew of the Enterprise 1701D intact and untainted?",

            "content": "I really want to like Picard, I really do. But the show keeps annoying me with the lazy writing. I am half way through season 2 and have to write this review just to rant about my grievances.So Picard and gang get sent to an alternative timeline by Q, where the Federation is a xenophobic fascist empire. So far, so \"mirror, mirror\". Picard and gang decide to travel back in time (like Star Trek 4) to set things right.This could work as a story. It SHOULD work as a story. But there are so many dumb decision and nonsensical story elements, that I keep having to shout at my TV.Upon arriving in the new timeline, Picard and friends are arguably the most powerful people in their society (president, general, head of secret police, head of alien experimentation, fleet captain). They manage to throw this advantage away within the space of minutes.Upon arriving in 2024, they crash in spectacular fashion near Picard's abandoned vineyard in France. No-one sees this or comes to investigate. How uninhabited do the writers think France is?Afterwards, the ship has power for transporters and cloaking device, but not internal heating? Really?!?!?!They transport into major cities in broad daylight repeatedly, yet no one sees them except a small child.The failure of their communicators over long distances in this period (maybe I missed why this happens) is continuously used to prevent vital information being passed between characters. Yet no one thinks to buy a mobile phone, or hack the mobile phone network with their communicators (yet, they can hack police computers in seconds, by hand).No one thinks to replicate any money or ID.Seven can drive a car, but only apparently with her foot flat on the floor, thus once again throwing away their advantage in seconds for the writers to lazily get a car chase sequence into the story.They kill people without any sign of remorse. And yet when Elnor dies, the writers try to tell the audience how tragic this is. If you treat the taking of life so casually, don't expect the audience to feel anything when a main character dies.Picard teleports to coordinates without any idea where it will take him. Surely you would look up the location on a map before going?And on and on it goes...a decent premise pissed away by lazy writing. It is unnecessary and insulting to the audience.

As a 61 year old Trekkie I remember when Star Trek was in prime time in the 60s as a child. I've loved every minute of every Trek interpretation. But Picard was always my favorite Captain. I'm willing to give this show every opportunity to succeed if the millennials can get on board and get over the \"ageism\" complex. The extra supporting cast are many of my favorites as well, especially Santiago Cabrera from The Musketeers. So I'm stoked about the entire show.

Don't listen to any of the nonsense about political agendas or the like as they're not being written by anyone whose seen the show. Got to see a pre screen of the first 3 episodes though I'm no critic or studio person, just a fan. It's not a super dark take on the future that the Children of Mars short leads some to believe (think of that short as a Wolf 359 or a Dominion War moment that is many years in this show's past that informs what happens but doesn't define it).That out of the way, I was privileged to see a prescreen of the first three episodes and this is definitely the Picard you remember. Granted he's now 94 years old, he's long retired going out on a new adventure for the first time in a decade plus... but it's still Jean-Luc Picard at his core. Seeing him have to work from a position of relative powerlessness given his current station in life without the might and resources of the Federation Starfleet behind him in no way diminishes the character or what he's doing. Assembling a hodgepodge crew of former associates, new friends, and questionable contacts. If anything it's an interesting twist on the Star Trek formula to see one of its characters in anything but their prime in a position of authority on a powerful Federation starship or space station but rather essentially an elderly civilian. It makes Picard's determination to stay true to the man who helmed the Enterprise D and E that much more endearing to watch. I for one can't wait to see where they take us the latter part of this first season and into season 2.",

Just finishing up Enterprise now.I got into Star Trek through watching Discovery and then I started with The Next Generation. What really struck me about TNG was the message it conveyed to viewers. It was such I stark contrast with other more modern shows I was watching at the time. TNG highlighted human values, it elevated virtues, values and ethics. Doing the right thing, responsibility and discipline, courage and curiosity were just some of virtues that explored. It was a breath of fresh air.That is exactly what I thought after watching the first episode of Picard. 'A breath of fresh air'. Familiar, yet different. Exploring tragedy, yet radiating hope. Displaying a character with strong personal convictions and integrity- not many characters like that in TV shows nowadays.Looking forward to watching the rest.'Engage.'",

It was great to see Patrick Stewart return to the role of Jean Luc Picard. The first show basically introduces the characters and sets the scene for what will effectively be a 10 hour movie. There is nothing especially revelatory going on, other than explaining Picard is not the man he was due to a series of tragic events starting with the loss of his good friend Data. I notice some saying this isn't the same Picard we were used to seeing on TNG. Well obviously not, 20 years have passed and life has taken its toll on the character. That's actual reality! What did these people want a rehash of their favourite TNG episodes? Well I can categorically state most of us Trekkies absolutely did not want that. There's also absolutely no politics in this first episode, other than a reference that Picard makes to the Federation failing. How it's failed I'm sure will transpire in future episodes. So you can take all the reviews here about it being anti Trump and Brexit at this stage as complete made up nonsense. Just as Discovery I'm looking forward to seeing how this show plays out.Continuation 16/2/2020 - I've just come back to check what other people are saying about the show and there's loads of negative reviews. I checked about 50 of these negative ones and surprise surprise about 50% of them have only ever made one review.

Star Trek: Picard 'is' of elegance and 'is' of sophistication, and contains 'beautiful' high technological graphics, colors and lighting!It's computer-generated images are sharp and crisp in ultra-HD. Patrick Stewart's acting brings captivation, compliments all the actresses/actors, and pulls you in with his raw emotion.There is lots of canon, very different from Star Trek: Discovery. This show is really classical Star Trek based, sticking to the roots of Star Trek: TNG with lots of Star Trek's universe 'packed' inside. And the cinematography is well designed too. It feels and looks and smells like Star Trek (which is very important).Watch this show, it's very good and I highly recommend it! Thank you for reading my review \ud83d\ude00",

The acting, sometimes awful, sometimes passable.I was excited to see Sir Patrick Stewart return to the role and see where the character is since Star Trek Nemesis. The first episode of season 1 was ok, a good start, but my word did it get messy and boring quickly. It was like it was written by many different people independently with no collaboration so plot threads were just stitched together like a child had written it.Then there's season 2, which is on going as I write this review. Episode 1 seemed much more like it. A bit more like what a Star Trek series should be, but with the modern twist. Then episode 2 started and I felt like a mug for getting suckered in. Fooled me twice, shame on me.There might be a few who will disagree here, and that's fine. Entertainment can be subjective, yet I don't find this series at all entertaining. I am a long time trek fan. I know times change and with it, writing styles, filming techniques, story telling etc etc change over time but what I cannot grasp is why 'new' trek had to go down this dark, depressing rabbit hole. Star Trek is about hope, optimism and a better tomorrow. The only thing this series (and Discovery) has over 'old' trek is superior special effects and that's it. It is to 'old' trek, what the Star Wars prequels are to the original trilogy (yeah that comment might stir up a few arguments).This is story telling at it's very worst. Taking legacy characters and turning everything we learned and grew to love about them on their heads. Throwing in references to 'old' trek in a lazy attempt to pander to the 'old' trek fans to keep us happy by also trying to establish a new fan base. This is fine when done in an interesting and engaging way but the makers of this series simply have no idea about what came before it and all of these references are just poorly delivered.The tone of this series is very negative and tries too hard to be gritty. Star Trek isn't Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead. Star Trek can be gritty and still be optimistic and fun, see Wrath of Khan, certain episodes and story arcs of DS9 and Voyager for case and point. Yet this series is trying too hard to stand with these gritty, dark and violent series' like GOTs and being dwarfed by them because the writers and producers of this show simply have no idea how present it in a way that is enjoyable. It's like they took some high level ideas from previous trek outings, threw them against a wall to see what stuck and hey presto, here's a story arc!This series isn't Star Trek. Yes you have Picard, Severn of Nine, Riker, Troy, Starfleet, Romulans, the Borg etc etc, but it's written and presented like an expensive 'fan' made production by someone who isn't a fan and only knows about certain aspects of the show because of pop culture.The people who make this show have no idea what they are doing, what came before and what the fans will engage with. If we want to watch a Game of Thrones or a Dexter or a Walking Dead type show, we'll go and watch that. This show does the exact opposite to what the Mandalorian does. That show is made by people who knew what was great about what came before, how to engage with the fans and how to update it for modern audiences. Star Trek: Picard (and Discovery) is made by people with access to an IP, handed a lot of money and try to make something that they simple know nothing about.Alex Kurtzman needs to go. Bring back Ronald D Moore, bring in Nicholas Myer. Give Star Trek to people who know Trek. (And yes Nick Myer knew very little about trek when he went to work on Wrath of Khan, but he understood the premise, what made TOS popular and what influenced the show such as Horatio Hornblower etc, but Myer is a talented writer and filmmaker who has the right people around him).I do not recommend this series for any trek fan or anyone else for that matter.

And of course my reservations are borne out by the reviews of thousands of long-time Trek followers, who had hoped for something better. Well, it's good to see some familiar Trek faces still among us (though I personally have had it up to here with the dratted Borg Queen) and actors having employment. A lot of work goes into these shows. No matter what someone does onstage or onscreen, SOMEONE will think it's great-- and the first lesson of show business is \"You can't please everyone\".

People have to remember, this is not young Picard from 30 years ago. He is both an old man in reality and in the story.Great world buildingThe writers clearly know trek. There are tons of easter eggs and connections to past episodes.In general its very impressive that they can take the disaster that was Nemesis, and the Star Trek reboots destruction of Romulus and turn it into a complex and interesting future story line. This is without any retconning.Now to all the negative reviews, about 100 people (1% of the total reviews), many who have issues with women and people of color, have upvote bombed all the negative reviews so they appear first. 85% of the reviews are 8 or above.",

Why is this utopia miserable?Add to that the mishandling of season 2; the aimless subplots, horrible pacing and misuse of talent. Honestly, I like these actors (Jeri Ryan's a standout); there's no fault with the performances and with better material, they could be making something fantastic.

            "review_title": "Complete lack of respect for anything Star Trek",
            "content": "Patrick Steward is a gifted actor, but thinking anything other falls under the halo effect. With the creative control he had, he added to the mess of all the newer Star Treks, adding his own flavour or something already unique by its own right. All the creative control, production and cast did not seem to understand and comprehend what made Star Trek so great. Star Trek was never about a post-apocalyptic future, where humanity has been corrupted and brought to its lowest point. Star Trek was always unique, in that, it always showed the best humanity has to offer and how this human beings occasionally have stave off corruption and discrimination. Much of Star Trek is humans solving external problems. This is for numerous literary reasons but for on, it enables the viewer to objectively observe the moral dilemmas involved and, if we want, we can relate this to our own problems(in reality). This has always been a strong point in Star Trek.Star Trek Picard, and STD, has turned this idea upside down. They've focused on one character(Picard in this case) and made any objective moral dilemma non-existent. In Picard, everything is personal now. Every situation is emotional and in your face. There is no time to reflect, and what's worse, the whole method of story-telling and even the foundational principles of Star Trek has become altered. It's become exactly like all the other post apocalyptic sci-fi's, where survival is the main goal and anything else is secondary. Apart from this view, the show makes no sense even if it was not Star Trek. There are so many plot holes, inconsistencies with the story, no character development and in-your-face exposition, it makes watching Picard an absolute chore.Funnily enough, even though it's the first Star Trek(eh) to name it's show about one character, it really isn't about Picard, at all. Its really about a character called Soji. Picard seems to be portrayed as someone who was egotistical. However, he was never like this in TNG. There are tons of continuity problems and some things just don't make any sense. Swearing being one of them. One of the main themes I picked up from Picard, and STD, is the continual belittlement of males in order to strengthen female characters. Picard will continually get shouted at, sworn at and play minor roles. He has very little impact on the story, is always second guessing himself(or someone else is) and his character seems more of a filler character than anything else.Star Trek has always had social commentary, but Picard, and STD, type of story telling is poor and sexist. It's gone too far, but not because the topics are controversial but because the writers for the show are terrible. Picard is now overtly sexist with sexist commentary and obvious agendas. Understandably, the previous series always had some underlining sexism, because it was still made by people that lived in discriminating times, but this reduced as more Star Trek was released. However, Picard and STD, has, literally, increased and made sexism overtly apparent. Women characters have taken charge in the newer Star Trek at the expense of males. The problem with this 1: it's done incredible poorly, 2: it seems to run on the incorrect assumption that Star Trek fans are male chauvinists 3: because of 2 males are continually belittled. I honestly don't care if a crew is all female, hell, my favourite captain of all time is Captain Janeway, but everything put together makes this show an insult to a Star Trek fan or anyone who does not like the method in which they're telling their saga.Every conceivable part of what made the original Star Treks great has now been distorted and disfigured. Star Trek is now edgy, resentful, in your face, angry and spiteful. Self reflection does not exist anymore. Conversing about moral dilemmas went does the toilet. I recommend no one watch this trash if they ever liked the previous series. If you're looking for food-for-thought look at the previous Star Treks or the Orville.",

Now it is populated by people like the guy standing in line to a movie theater line with his girlfriend in Annie Hall (1977), standing one step ahead of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton talking intellectual rubbish to his girlfriend. That's when Woody brought out the writer whose work that guy was dissecting, to tell him that he has no idea what he is talking about.A review that dares to praise Star Trek Picard gets attacked by the \"not helpful\" clicks. Yet the rating of the series by users here is an overwhelming \"10\" (what gives?).And it should be so. Star Trek Picard is a solid \"10\" in an age when we could not have moved further away from the ideals Gene Roddenberry gifted us. Picard is serious, introspective, funny, respectful, ingenious, entertaining and thought-provoking. Yes it does have all of today's unacceptable traits of actual quality. So feel free to register many avatars so you can click many times to tell me that my review was not helpful to you. Star Trek Picard could not be a more fitting tribute and renaissance of Star Trek. Please, powers that be, scrap that Discovery BS and keep renewing Picard for as long as Patrick Stewart lives.Now, the original review I wrote after the first episode.We waited... 9,376 days since the last episode of The Next Generation Series aired on 5/23/1994 and 6,254 days since Nemesis beamed to theaters in 2002. We bid Farewell to Deep Space Nine on 6/2/1999 and Voyager made it home on 5/23/2001. We endured Enterprise. Another timeline came to change everything we knew, but Kelvin is now all but lost in time. We finally abandoned all hope when served with the total BS of Discovery. Then, Jean-Luc Picard felt he was being dispatched from retirement to save the Alpha Quadrant, again, and we wondered: who dispatched him? Was it Harry Mudd playing another joke on us, or could it be that Gene himself came to Jean-Luc in his sleep with one last mission, to save the legacy of Gene Rodenberry's visionary \"Wagon Train to the Stars\" and redeem his perception of what humanity could be? We waited for the first episode on 1/23/2020 to find out. Would the show-runners serve another dose of failure to respect the concept, or would they come through?I wore my magnetic metal communicator (TNG version) on my sweatshirt and switched on the screen. They did come through for us. They came through more brilliantly than I could have hoped. From the first seconds of the first episode you know this is serious Star Trek. With deep and subtle connections and a sense of humor but also a sense of duty to revive the wonder that was all but gone with the solar winds.Star Trek Picard starts out as Star Trek at its very best. The first episode served only to set the stage and the road map for what is to follow. The mission is taking shape. How ingenious the plot devices are, yet respectful to both the legacy and to our intelligence. Fascinating, as an old friend would say. Soon it will be time to engage.",

            "content": "One-third into the 2nd episode of a (just now) 10-episode series, I was like: this could very well be my favorite Star Trek series.And that's after loving the very first episode to almost 5/5 stars.But, alas, I practically grew up on Voyager; seen that entire 7-season show THREE times all the way through, plus many episodes many more times. That said, I was so impressed with Star Trek: Picard, if they get better with Season 2...Voyager may stay lost in the Delta Quadrant.I never thought the aging Patrick Stewart could pull this off. In Logan, he looked 20x his age, which was his character in that movie, but I didn't think he even had makeup on. Also, I didn't think bringing back his character was justification of an entire show. But I was thoroughly wrong. The new world, ah-hem, universe of the Federation storyline was so fascinating and grounded thanks to the presence of Stewart. So, I'm glad I was wrong.It's decades later, well, from the last present day TV series - since all movies and shows since Voyager have been prequels - and all Bishops, I mean, Datas have been banned from an obvious diabolical sabotage against them and it's up to Professor X and a new young mutant girl to...wait, am I describing Logan again, or Star Trek: Picard? Anyways, they're the same and Picard must resolve and show the universe what really happened to cause the ban.This is filled with WONDERFUL new characters, hilarious and sometimes deep dialogue, great cameos, AWESOME special effects and action and, biased here, a very much WELCOMED return of one of my all-time favorite characters. That said, her new storyline wasn't my favorite, but completely understandable and plausible.Also, it makes a ton of sense on why I love this so much: Writer Michael Chabon. I read his Wonder Boys book which was a masterpiece in writing and loved both that and the narrowed-down movie version. I always wanted to be a writer, but his Wonder Boys book actually discouraged me. I thought I could NEVER write as good as he did in that novel and each sentence would probably take me three weeks to complete, if I were to match him.But I digress. As much praise as I give this, I will say I was let down by the quick and somewhat TOO easy last two episodes. Before season 2 comes out, I will rewatch this entire run (only 10, but still) and I might change my mind. It's just that the first 8 episodes were so powerful and the last two, as of now in my opinion, standard.Doesn't matter. Even \"standard\" Star Trek: Picard episodes beat the majority of the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Enterprise episodes I've seen. Highly recommended. If you don't have CBS All Access, this ALONE is worth the price.***Final thoughts: Before I get hate mail, I've only seen about a dozen Next Gen's, only 6 Deep Space Nines and only the Enterprise pilot. So, when I made the comparison above, obviously people can disagree but in my limited experience with the older shows, I can 100% vouch for my August 2, 2020 opinion.",

I lasted until the \"eyeball removal\" episode... then gave up on the series (I should have given up on it earlier).This, like STD, is the Star Trek concept at its worst. They're successfully pulling in an audience by bringing back old characters such as Seven of Nine-- but these are not the characters we knew. This is not the show we knew. This is not an evolution of Star Trek, but rather a de-evolution, a dumping ground of perverse concepts and needless gore.They had a chance with Picard to bring back a Star Trek fit for family viewing, a Star Trek that taught morals and ethics and presented hope for the future.

There are no shortage of home worlds, the milky way alone has 100-400 billion stars and 100 billion planets, \"m class\" planets are everywhere so the forced \"refugee/migrant\" narrative being forced into Star Trek is simply a non starter.Add to this the rather ridiculous human robot, reminiscent of the recent botched terminator movie and its clear the show has been ruined by the woke.

Lol dont worry dude in the promo for the rest of the season you see Picard about to do a sword fight and he uses a phase gun of some sort so dont count the man out yet.Anyway right from the start you could see that they spared no expense on this show. The sets, the costumes and the CG were top notch. Stewart slipped back into the role of Picard like putting on a glove. The action scenes were done really well and seeing Patrick and Brent onscreen together again brought a tear to my eye as TNG was a big part of my childhood. I am so grateful that Stewart and everyone else made this show. I'd say the only negative thing was the opening theme song, it wasnt horrible, way better than Enterprise's, but I won't be humming it to myself anytime soon.",

In general it was all optimistic, the best of mankind, we had a bright future.SF usually extrapolates current times into the future and it is not a pretty sight this time. A morally collapsed government, conspiracies and secret plots, lone wolfs against the government, rich people pulling strings etc, etc. A single man's fight against evil, it is all pretty standard in storyline and action. It has become more a episode of Mission Impossible than Star Trek.It is sad to see that even Star Trek is now gone down with the times.On the good part: it acting and visuals are pretty good, and it is also good to see 7 of 9 in something else than the demeaning catsuit from Voyager.And then it even gets more seasons. S2 is sometimes hilariously bad, plotholes and illogicalities follow each other in a rapid pace and acting even gets worse. Even Picard seems to have troubles remembering his lines.",

There is a Romulan conspiracy that has undermined the federation's work for centuries, a conspiracy that intensified after the supernova explosion. Romulans don't like androids, we can say that they had their \"Cylons\" in the remote past. And so, Data would be as enemy as the Borg.My hope is that writers will one day read the discussions on social media and try to write better scripts, that's all. I find it sad that the wealth of content in Star Trek is wasted in stupid episodes.A TV script needs consistency, closed end, context. Within such a context you develop the plots and characters. Without all this, we have only a series of dialogues and effects that do not create synergy. TOS and TNG had synergy. DSC and PIC have no synergy.I find it interesting to watch, just like I watch other teen series, but I don't think DSC or PIC it's important to watch. I wish it were as important as TOS and TNG once was and VOYAGER, ENT and DS9 tried to be.I think the renovation of Star Trek is fundamental. For example, the 2009 reboot, I found phenomenal, bringing back TOS with a new look and preserving the chemistry of the characters. The new look in the DSC and PIC are very welcome, but I think the scripts are shallow. They try to reach new heights, but are still below expectations.

It wasn't a reflection of what we as people ARE, but what we could so easily be.So what do we get if we take TNG and remove the wonder of discovery, the passion to explore, any sense of warmth, ALL OPTIMISM, futuristic technological innovation, actors who connect with their characters, imagination, the rigid moral structure, discipline, professionalism, alien races, special effects, and just make the entire thing a bit more common and profane? We get a glimpse of what the future would be like if the most spoiled, selfish, weak people populated the world and the only advancements humanity made were technological.Class warfare. Limited resources. A disdain for age / accomplishment. And just a few little ties thrown in to try to lure fans of Voyager and TNG in hoping some percentage of them will stay for a bland, frozen, microwaved version of what was once a favorite dish.It's great to see Patrick Stewart acting in this, but it'd be even better if he'd reprise the role of Jean-Luc Picard in more than just name.\nDear Gene Roddenberry,We respectfully disagree with your Utopian vision of tomorrow.

It doesn't even feel as if the writers even bothered to watch any of the original series, or take time to understand what it was that made Star Trek unique.It moves at a glacial pace and it's been incredibly boring. I switched it off half way through the latest episode, I was so bored. I'm not a big Marvel/Blockbuster movie fan, so it's not a case I can't appreciate an understated or thought provoking show, but I do need to see SOMETHING happen from time to time. Talk, talk, talk and then more talk, between not very likeable characters and there is virtually no storyline. Maybe that's why its all talk and big pretty set pieces.All those wonderful characters from the original series are AWOL. 7 now speaks with an American accent. This is just a pay day to Stewart because he has virtually nothing to do.Amazingly it's green lit for season 2.

            "content": "There's a certain irony, not to mention circularity, when the only way to \"hopefully\" produce a decent Star Trek series, is by revisiting actors from an older, successful series, from the 1990's.Star Trek: Next Generation like most of the spin off's that followed, in that period, were pure gold. They inspired hope, using the possibilities presented in a science based future that \"might be\". A future ruled by reason, kindness, inclusiveness and learning, to progress humanity, in spite of many challenges.Small wonder utilising the actors from this series, such as Patrick Stewart, is a smart or perhaps desperate move in itself? That said, it shows up what an abject failure the new series, Discovery, has been to date. A failure I believe because it embraces a warlike capitalist ethos, poorly concealed beneath a reedy, lecturing, politically correct hypocrisy, that is at odds with the Trek universes philosophy, of cooperation and sharing.So what to make of the new series? Having watched two episodes, I'm done. Patrick Stewart is a fine actor but what I personally view as questionable scripting is, in my opinion, sending this series down a similar path to Discovery. Lots of PC posturing. Thus far its the tired old stick of diversity, pseudo feminism and multi-cultural-ism being waved about. As to the story itself, frankly I for one find it antithetical to the concept the Star Trek universe is based upon with Picard turning against the Federation. What's left is weak, condescending and uninspiring.4/10 and only out of respect for the 90's actors. They are wonderful but the writing here, in my opinion, is anything but.",

            "review_title": "This is NOT Star Trek...",
            "content": "... It's what most of these negative reviews will have you believe. And when I read them harking for the good ol' days of TNG, I think to myself, \"Have they recently rewatched all of TNG?\" Better still, have they watched DS9 in its entirety at all? I am guessing the answer to both these questions is \"No.\"Without giving away any spoilers, let me just say a few things about STP for those who haven't watched any episodes yet. 1: This is NOT Star Trek. Well, to be more accurate, not the filtered, photoshopped, perfectly encased Star Trek you might remember. That is unless you have watched all of DS9 recently, because that is important. Why? Let's just say that DS9 demonstrates how Starfleet isn't the paradise the other Treks would have you believe. And one line by Sisko sums it up best: It's easy to be a saint in paradise. 2: This isn't Star Trek as you know it because it's not about Starfleet - it's about one person. Picard. Whether you agree or not, his character is one of, if not the most, iconic character ever produced. And the entire focus of this show is about him. Is that a little narcissistic? It might be, if the clue wasn't in the NAME OF THE SHOW! 3: \"How can Data be old? He's an Android!\" Well, true dat. But the actor who plays him has aged. So let's forgive the show for not being so authentic as to try to find a 20-something year old guy that looks like Brent Spiner and can pull off Data's voice, mannerisms, inflections and body language perfectly enough to ensure we don't have a bunch of other \"fans\" complaining that he is NOT \"my Data!\"In terms of the show, I liked the first season and am really liking the second so far. Sure, there's violence, swearing and a lot of CGI, but I can go into a million reasons why those things are a) necessary to appeal to the audience that grew up watching these shows and movies (I assume they're not trying to recruit teens to watch this show as their first introduction to Star Trek because, if they were, they would spend the first 15 years giving you backstories for context); and b) this is a review of Star Trek: Picard, not an essay diving into the entire ethos of Trek-dum and giving my million word response by saying something stupid like \"Gene Roddenbery would be rolling in his grave\", considering his SON is one of the producers of this show.Look, I get it. You want to watch Star Trek when it had monsters covered in printer ink and maple syrup, or when the Captain bangs every alien female he meets including a bunch of robots. That's what you think of the essence of Star Trek. I get that. Me, personally, saw things differently. As a mid-40's loser with a dead-end job, no money and no friends/social life, I see, and have always seen, Star Trek for what it represents - not what the limitations of television and technology did 40 years ago. It's an ideal we aim to reach, but that's the thing about ideals - we are not meant to actually achieve them. The purpose is the journey, not the destination. Sure, TNG tells us that war, poverty, disease were all eradicated within 50 years of us realising we're not alone in the universe. But First Contact also taught us that, while we assume we've grown out of thoughts like revenge, hate, holding a grudge, those things are intrinsically human and will always be part of who we are. DS9 taught me that Starfleet had imperfections, like ambition, jealousy, xenophobia of those we don't understand. Heck, even Insurrection taught us that we are still capable of making morally corrupt decisions if they impact a small enough group of people to benefit a larger group. I can go on and on.My point is this: some will like this show, others won't, and that's exactly what's expected of us as humans. Some will harken for days that are etched more in memory than actual history. Others will cry out for a \"less is more\" philosophy. But if you're watching a show made in 2020 and expecting it to perfectly replicate one that originated on 1987, you're going to be incredibly mistaken.For the record, I don't like Discovery. Not because it's 'too woke' or whatever. I'm just tired of Star Trek making new crew-based shows that are prequels. I'd like one set in the 25th century, after the Dominion and Borg conflicts, after Voyager got home safely, after all that. Something new. Maybe Starfleet needs to rebuild, having lost many alliances during said conflicts, and are therefore seeking new allegiances? Maybe explore the Beta Quadrant now that the Romulans don't have such a monopoly in that part of the galaxy. Or what about the Gamma Quadrant, especially with the Dominion threat expelled? There are heaps of ideas just waiting to be explored, and, to me, Discovery was just another excuse to pretend to be a new show that was like the older shows, but when they realised it didn't fit into the timeline they hurtled it forward as a convenient way of saying \"All right, we get it, it's a futuristic ship set before the Enterprise, so let's send it to the future and make up a one line story that no one in Starfleet will ever talk about it again\".

That's the type of review that SHOULD be posted on this site, so any potential viewer can get properly balanced opinions.Unfortunately, there appears to be VERY few constructive negative reviews. The Fanboys who dislike this show just say \"This is not Star Trek\", or \"Star Trek is dead\", \"Boring\" etc, and quote past series as being better and the new series like Picard are dragging the Star Trek name in the dirt, and leave it at that.\nTheir 1 star ratings will have you believe that this show was made by complete amateurs, who are yet to get out of high school.Well, let me say this......this show DOES NOT deserve the vast number of negative reviews it has received.For those who haven't seen this show yet, it is vastly different from other Start Trek series you may have seen. I won't give any plot details away, but as the title suggests, this is about the much loved Picard, in retirement, doing what he does best, trying to solve a mystery and save the universe.\nAlong the way, he receives help from some old and familiar faces that we've come to know and love over the years.The first few episodes I must admit, are a little slow, and may put off some from continuing to watch. However, if you stick with it, the story becomes quite engaging.\nThe special effects are, as expected, top notch for a TV show, as is (in my opinion), the acting by all concerned.\nThe acting and production values are no where near as bad as some would have you believe.I do agree with some, that maybe this series could have been done with fewer episodes, and that the profanity used by some characters was unnecessary, which is why I have my 8 star rating.I, like many others, have grown up with Star Trek.

There has never been anything particularly awful about any of them, (maybe one or two bad episodes in each series, but that's it).\nI also appreciate that Star Trek has to move with the times and appeal to a newer generation. Picard has made a big step in the right direction to achieve this, although Star Trek Discovery has done it better.\nIncidentally, the Star Trek fan boys slated that show too. Apparently, that show is so bad, it's now on it's third season......funny that!!.So, if you haven't seen this show yet, all I can say is make your own mind up by watching it yourself, and not believing the, quite frankly, unconstructive reviews, that would have you thinking this show was made by children.If, after seeing it, you dislike it, then post a review. But PLEASE, make it constructive so that we can all have properly balanced opinions.To the fanboys out there.....BOO HOO!!\nStar Trek is changing and evolving,. It needs to move on from the past you're living in, and it is in no way as bad as you're making it out to be.\nIt's not perfect by any means, I agree, but your one star reviews, in an effort to stop people watching the show are unnecessary.To the real fans who dislike the show, but are more reasonable with your criticisms, thank you. We need the good and the bad together, to give others who have not seen the newer Star Trek shows, proper, balanced reviews.P.S.I bet the fanboys are on this like a rash, rating my opinion as \"not useful\".",

The criticisms about human-like Romulans is valid. Grumpy Grandpa also. And please, writers, stop following the unappetizing trend of branding something as \"grown-up\" or \"edgy\" because someone swears unappetizingly. I really hate that and avoid many vehicles I would otherwise watch (or spend $ on at the theater) because I'm sick to death of the debasement of the English language with perpetual and mindless ugliness. Shakespeare had some of the most incisive and devastating insults in all of literature and, surprise, he didn't use nasty, ignorant verbiage to do so.

Not only was the original trek completely erased from cannon, but now Picard never had a brother, a nephew, and his mother died young rather than as an old lady as shown in the TNG era.Q is dead, the borg were neutered and made into a joke, Guinan was made into a joke, 7 of 9 is an emotional mess of rage, the Federation is small and petty and just when you thought Star Trek Discovery was the epitome of anti-trek... in comes Picard to destroy the foundation that made the brand so appealing.I advise all to skip seasons 1 and 2 and try season 3 as a stand-alone this month (Feb 2023).

Means the intelligence as a whole of star fleet is in reverse. The bunk bed and dinner scene wasn't funny at all. The shuttle landing on Beverly's ship laughable it was so poor.

Discovery, with it's dark, crappy storyline as well as a non existent sister for Spock, one of the dumbest ideas in the history of Star Trek, and another unnecessary prequel, we have the boring Picard. CBS is in this just for the money, while Kurtzman seems to think his foolish ideas and ignoring of Star Trek history make his stuff great. Wrong. The lens flare, the cursing, making the Romulans this honorable people - stolen from the Klingons - making the federation a bitter alliance who turn their back on the Romulans. Picard is the only one left with a conscience? Ridiculous. As for bringing back Picard, why is CBS so afraid to do something truly new? An entire new cast. Go into the future rather than making prequels, reboots and retreads? Bring in a guy like Manny Coto, who saved the 4th season of Enterprise and fire Kurtzman. He's the Zack Snyder of Star Trek.

It has descended more into \"continuity porn\" - making references to other ST elements just for the sake of exciting fanboys I suppose.Speaking of continuity, they can't even get THAT right when it ought to be included. In ST lore It's established that by the late 23rd century time travel can be achieved by a starship (The Enterprise A does it in The Voyage Home. And the Enterprise E does it in First Contact, and it's just considered \"a thing we can definitely do with our regular starship engine\"). Yet here they lament the fact that they can't do it without somebody as brilliant as Spock doing the calculations (there's that continuity porn again) - but oh wait, there's also the Borg Queen who's smart enough to do it. So THAT becomes the justification for letting her be part of the crew, and who will be necessary to keep around to go forward in time again to return \"home\". That's just super sloppy writing.Alison Pill (Agnes Jurati) and Michelle Hurd (Raffi Musiker) are the best actors and characters on the show. There is some especially GOOD writing with Jurati's character. Well, except for the part where the band magically accompanies her to a song she spontaneously sings. That crap is \"musical theatre logic\", which has its place in the fantasy of a musical.Patrick Stewart seems to be playing it all rather one-note.

It was just a dream. We then go to \"Greater Boston\", as we are introduced to a couple, enjoying the evening. Out of nowhere, baddies appear and ambush the couple, killing the guy... At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated return of Patrick Stewart in his iconic role of Star Trek's Jean-Luc Picard. Picard has retired from Star Fleet, enjoying the rustic life on the vineyard of Chateau Picard. Yet beneath that outer calm is a restlessness we will soon discover. And what about the woman whose boyfriend was ambushed? Where does she fit into all this? We will soon find out as well. If, like me, you are expecting a \"Next Generation\"-like return, I'm afraid you are in for a disappointment. Indeed, this mini-series is very different, both in style and in approach. For one, the 10 episodes cannot be watched as stand-alone episodes (where in the \"Next Generation\" certain story lines evolve over episodes, the episodes nevertheless can be viewed on their own). As a result, the story lines in \"Star Trek - {Picard\" move slowly, very slowly. Director Hanelle Culpepper, who was involved with \"Star Trek - Discovery\" returns to direct the initial 3 episodes. The visuals are spectacular and it's always a joy to watch Patrick Stewart's acting chops (he also executive-produced). But in the end, while this certainly not a \"bad\" mini-series, I simply had expected more/better.I missed it when \"Star Trek - Picard\" was initially released in early 2020. But with Season 2 scheduled to premier next month (February 17, 2022). I decided now was a good time to catch up on it, and I've been binge-watching it on Paramount+.

This is refreshing.(note) Read a few reviews that said this isn't Star Trek because Picard is not on the Enterprise, and that humans no longer had TV, or TV shows (and) - this is just bad writing and the writers must know nothing about Star Trek. Humans still have TV in Picard's time. They had it in Kirks time too. We know this because in the movie Star Trek Generations there are news reporters and documentary crews, and TV show people filming the crew of the Enterprise before her relaunch. So, yeah...humans still have entertainment in the future. As for Picard no longer the Capt. of the Enterprise. He is old and retired...so stop hoping he gets his command back - it's not going to happen in this show.Also, other reviewers seem to take issue with the fact that humanity in this show seems to have abandoned every thing the old Star Trek told us about how humans have become more enlightened in the future. Excuse me, but we only saw things from Star Fleets perspective...there was more to humanity that was rarely if ever explorered in the previous shows.

Get over it.They complained that it wasn't Star Trek - and did it in all kinds of acronyms. NO, it isn't the original ST (see what I did there?!!) - It's a new series based on it. There will never ever be another original Star Trek - and the Trouble with Tribbles. So if you're going to complain, don't watch anything made after the original! Give us all a break!!Now - about this one. It was fun to what, but, yes, it got a bit schlocky. A bit long. Elnor was a great addition. Santiago Cabrera aka Rios is refreshing and handsome. Alison Pill is just that. And if you don't love 7 of 9 no matter who she loves, well, you can get outta here!Now on to Season 2 - to see what awaits. Maybe an edit or two. Or not.Whatever happens - Enjoy it for what it is and who's in it!Season 2 language is a bit salty. It does seem a radical change and a lot of it doesn't seem necessary, but..... If I don't want to accept it, I'll go watch Disney.I hate to say it, but I agree with some of the other reviewers. I am not thrilled with Season 2. The story is convoluted at times - especially when it evolves young Picard. I don't think that part was at all necessary. It could have been told quickly and cleanly in a maximum 5 minute segment (and I do mean maximum).All that said, Agnes turned into a bad a$$!! Holy crap!! She certainly evolved, didn't she!!??Some reviewers slammed Q. You can't slam Q!! He's the Star Trek Bad Boy!! And he was EXCELLENT in Season 2. HE wrapped it all up and put a ribbon on everything.It should have made everyone happy.Is it worth the watch. Kinda. It's its own animal. Just don't expect a lot and you'll be fine.",

The insistence on ascribing these layers and layers of personal regret and rambunctiousness as a form of superficial nostalgia is cheap and untrue. What's more, it's dull. That would be a problem even if the scripts made sense. Instead, we get a formless mess - a series of call-backs and nasty little shocks that presuppose the audience's commitment to a mood rather than a story. But that mood is constantly shifting, highlighting ridiculous violence and inconsistent characters as \"NEW!! But the SAME!!\" Every goddamn trope in the book - Borg Queens, time travel, nonsensical Q plots...ugh.The TNG cast getting blackmailed into participating in this mess is the real injustice. Stewart's folly in \"Picard\" is embarrassing, but exactly what one might expect of a twilight paycheck. That the show openly mocks the genuinely touching TNG finale is a testament to how grossly Kurtzman, Goldsman, and new Star Trek-killer Chabon, misunderstand a fans' love for these characters.",

I don't know. There is not a lot of science and not a lot of fiction, but a lot of personal drama and soap opera like interactions and drama between the charaters... I'm not really interested in that. I'd hoped to see some philosophical, ethical and moral questions being addressed as well as some adventure like story.

This is like a lame soap opera hijacking Star Trek. Maybe introduce something completely unthinkable that gives some sense of hope because this is still a SCIENCE FICTION show.Does everything have to be a reflection of the signs of the times where people today are obsessed with sex, money and drugs? Star Trek TOS was made during a period of major social upheaval, multiple political assassinations and a major war costing the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. Did that series reflect the times and just remind everyone how miserable their world is now and how awful it will be in the future? Of course not. Star Trek wouldn't be remembered as anything if it were just that which is exactly why Picard doesn't deserve to be remembered or even canonized. Hardly anything new in sci fi deserves to be canoninzed given the lack of any kind of creative discipline so that the artistic merit of the work can outshine the endless hamfisted attempts at preaching and virtue signalling that buries the \"entertainment\". The best way to achieve social change through art is by PRODUCING SOMETHING WORTH PEOPLE'S ATTENTION, NOT ABUSING FRANCHISES THAT ALREADY EXIST.Star Trek presented a future where all the human race resolved its conflicts and when a message wanted to be said in a story, they used aliens still grappling with the problems the world was in back in the 20th century. The people on the ship speak to them from experience because it was a part of their PAST. Any prejudices among the humans is with aliens and vice versa because their feelings come from a lack of understanding. No one now producing Star Trek product is intelligent enough to understand that basic point and grasp Rodenberry's concet. The result is making Picard which is lazy garbage.I can't believe I prefer watching the worst of 2nd season Space 1999, Jason of Star Command, or even Star Maidens for crying out loud over Picard.

This seems a solely commercial enterprise (pun intended). They wanted to cash in on the Star Trek fan base. The first season was, let's say, acceptable, but the second was really boring. Both were way too long and drawn out. Not sure if we can expect anything good from the third, other than some more cameos of beloved characters. All that happened so far could have easily been presented in two or three episodes. No need for 2 seasons. Definitely no need for all the bad psycho-drama.I love Star Trek and my favourite, by far, is TNG.I love watching Patrick Stewart. I would watch him reading the Yellow Pages. Captain Picard was my favourite in TNG, alongside Commander Data.I watched ST Voyager, mostly for the Doctor and for Seven of Nine. This says a lot, since the rest of the Voyager cast were really unpleasant.I was looking forward to Picard. I started watching, expecting it to be different. However, the difference is shocking to me. This has nothing to do with the Star Trek world, other than names and locations. That warm, utopian world I knew and loved is gone. It is difficult to watch.There were tough times, darker episodes, in all the past series but we were always left with hope, the future always seemed bright. Star Trek Picard is depressing.I understand the storyline, kinda... If they would have made something different and not pretended that it's Star Trek, not used the name and the context, it would have been so much better, less disappointing. It's simply unfair to destroy a fantasy world created through all the ST series and films.To finish on a positive note... I was happy to see Picard and Seven and some of the old Enterprise crew.

Stewart's acting in those moments is on a par with McConaughey in Interstellar when McConaughey's character is watching the pre-recorded tapes of his family. It's that good.Stewart is by far the best actor to have ever graced Star Trek and it shows here. Having said that, there are some very good performances from other members of the cast.I must also say that top marks go to the special effects team...they're outstanding and are the quality you'd expect in a feature film.So in conclusion, I was surprised by how good the first episode was.",

It was nice to see Picard and the gang again. But this is a poor reflection of what Star Trek is and what I love about Star Trek.The people behind the CBS Star Treks and the movie reboots don't understand what made Star Trek what it is (what it was, anyway).Star Trek was about exploring, about respect and camaraderie in the crew, about how science and reason can overcome the baser aspects of human nature, about people who have moved beyond seeking money, power, sex, etc. And are pursuing higher goals of personal growth. Ultimately, it was about optimism for the future.Star Trek: Picard tries to do some of these things, but doesn't really succeed. It's like a recipe that has been lost, and attempts to recreate it never work.The problem with making Star Trek mainly about action - besides the loss of all those good aspects I listed above - is that it becomes merely another action franchise. That's a losing battle. There are already lots of action franchises, and Star Trek now has little reason to exist. Also, with action you have to keep upping the ante - more explosions, badder villains, etc. Because people get bored with seeing the same stuff that's already been done. There is no storytelling substance, and superficiality is not satisfying in the long term. You can't live on candy alone.The plot of the first season of Picard has things that don't make sense or are just dumb. It seems to get worse toward the end of the season. The relationships never really gel either.It didn't help that the show is TV-MA, littered with F-bombs, etc. Star Trek was never about that stuff, and it's not enjoyable to me.(Added for Season 2) While Discovery is a train wreck, season 2 of Picard is at least a grand vision poorly realized. They need to re-edit season 2 down to about 6 episodes.Some things were dumb, some things I hated, but with much fast forwarding it was worthwhile watching for a long-time fan like me.The best part was the 3 minute segment about the Traveler in the last episode.

Now, S3 - on a positive note it's great to see the old cast again. When Warf showed up, looking amazing BTW, I had tears in my eyes.The negative aspects however, are pretty distracting. First of all: the dark look of the ship board environment, the odd camera angles and the general chaotic filming style during action sequences don'tappeal to me. Next Gen had a bright look to it, the lighting, the ship, the general ambience; then the prequels had a darker look. Now, we are post Next Gen and the Star Trek world is back to dark? The look and style is totally ST Discovery, of which I am not a fan.The new cast members are great. I love Ed Speelers and have been a fan since I first saw him on Downton Abbey. As for the character, Jack Crusher, I just don't understand how Beverly's son (who grew up with her, in Space) has a London accent and says things like Bob's your Uncle/Fanny's your Aunt.. it's just weird.Overall - rating down to 8 from 10.S2- I just watched the Season Finale - wow~! Amazing how ST continues to evolve and grow and still provide an entertaining series while at its heart lies the essence of what we love in the world so brilliantly created by Mr. Roddenberry. It is not a perfect world, and while hunger and poverty were conquered on Earth, it's still a crazy universe. The characters (I'll admit, I had my misgivings) have become, for me, a cohesive crew where each one contributes something unique, where there is loyalty and the beginnings of greater and deeper emotions. Picard told Data at the end, that he loved him. For all the sci-fi in this science fiction, it's that - the love, loyalty, sacrifice, redemption - all these themes play out and take us along to a place where in the end, the message was so simply - kindness matters. We do not need to be the same, or believe the same things, or share the same politics, but if we can be kind, then our world is a better place - maybe a place a bit more like the one Star Trek envisioned, and the one of which it has encouraged us to dream. For people who rate this a 1, I think there is something about Star Trek they missed, right from the start. :-)",

The issue here is that Star Trek is always the tend setter. It's what pushes the envelope for science fiction. For some reason, Star Trek Picard plays fifth fiddle in a genre where it has already set the foundation.Star Trek Picard lifts the biggest plot beats from Mass Effect:1) Synthetic lifeforms are seen as pariahs and a danger to organic life in the galaxy.2) Ancient synthetic lifeforms can only be contacted via a deep space signal.3) Said deep space signal scrambles the brains of organics, driving them to insanity.4) Ancient synthetic lifeforms are lying in wait in some uncharted region of space, ready to destroy all spacefaring civilizations in the galaxy.5) Every politician and spacefaring government doesn't care/believe/or trust the protagonist's warnings about galaxy wide genocide.6) A secret organization is trying to stop the ancient synthetics.I could go on, but you get the point.

As space travel evolves so must the people...Patrick is getting very old so perhaps the writers felt they had to taylor the show to fit the actor's advanced age, for it shows in every single episode I have seen so far.

It might be worth it if you're a Trekker \u261d\ud83c\udffbSo, what can I say... than right down wonderfull! The first episode hints a promise of this being the first series since The Voyager worth the legacy of Gene Roddenberrys creation: The Star Trek -saga.After the first season of Discovery, I honestly thought this is the end of it. We are never going to be able to go back ro our innocense after the travesty of Discovery showing it's ugly balls and cnt. I never saw the rest of the series and I still can't comprehend why the show wasn't cancelled after the five first episodes, if not for the money spent and the money earned. Star Trek it was not; it had the name, it had some of the looks, but it was a totally different reality with a cheap Star Trek -skin on it. I could puke for less...\nBut this review is not about a massive failure. This review is about \"a new hope\" (\"pun\" intended). It's about the true love for SF that brings the positive aspect of hope for our future to our fingertips, almost physically touchable, just as Roddenberry would have wished and wanted.The first episode of Picard brings us back to what really matters in life; careing for one another, without prejudice, letting all people be themselves with their believes and minorities and what have you, as long as they don't harm each other.Make no mistake, this is a new, darker take on TNG -continiuum. But it's beautifully placed for the time and space we live in right now, with the righteous Roddenberryan mindset sizzleing through around every corner.Then again, it wasn't perfect. Had \"The Number One\" been The Siberian Husky or a St. Bernard, instead of a fight dog, I'd given this 10/10. You just can't have it all, can you...\nI recommend this from all my heart and sense to all of you true Trekkies and Trekkers out there! The \"force\" of G. R. has returned ;)P. S. Maybe they made Discovery so bad to ultimately promote this??? Well, it's working and it's beyond!!! (At least after seeing the first episode of Picard.)P. P. S. After seeing the whole first season... Ihave to take back much of what I wrote above.So, read on. It's probably worth it....Edit after seeing the first season and now into S2E6:The first season turned out to be too dystopian for me as a Trekker. It just went from darkness to darkness after the first episode. It wnt from \"promising\" into \"Discovery\", if you know what I mean...Now, watching S2E3, it's kinda lightening up!: The goodies ARE goodies without some silly backwards plot you can't trust on, and they ARE for real fighting the baddies.And that is the new \"new\" after Discovery -BS.Sure, there's still this dystopian darkness, but when the good guys gather around to make it right...There's the distinction of love that surrounded the series from the beginning, in the 60's, something you, as a Trekkie, can look forward to, the hope for better tomorrow where we MAYBE, and just maybe, can live together as a one human race on earth, and as several races when aliens are included.Since, when it comes to racism, there is a common consensus between scientist: human race is a race of it's own separated from other living species on earth; therefore the idea of racism is something of a human innovation, and in it self not true at all.Well, well, the rant (true blue though), but if the second season keeps developing as it has so far... Imma give the series one more star, makiong it 8 all and all, as I took two of them stars away after seeing the entire first season.Star Trek is supposed to be somewhat naive giving us hope for the better future.

I only even got into Trek as an adult, whereas as a kid I thought it was something just for a niche group of \"nerds\" for lack a better vernacular.Every Star Trek show has had it's problems, especially in each of their earlier seasons before they discover what they're going to be.Many people didn't like the newer shows at first, which is understandable since people get attached to the old ways. Still, while they have their problems, each show up until and including Enterprise tried to keep the spirit of what Star Trek is in tact.I mostly blame the 2009 movie which started the downward trend from Trek being a pensive, introspective sci-fi medium, to a nonsensical, hyper-paced, 1990s style mindless action fest, with forced drama and bad comic relief.Trek shows have always messed up continuity, but this is the first era where it seems that the producers and writers have destain for the source material.None of the characters in Picard are even close to being the same people from any ofntheirnorigin shows. You couldn't even chalk up such drastic changes to life experiences. Picard, who was a serious man of science, now talks of \"the stars\" in some nebulous, poetic fashion as if he hasn't been to over a hundred different systems as a Star Fleet captain.Talking of \"the stars\" is something that we do now, because they are such a foreign concept to most people since we don't yet have interstellar travel, but it wouldn't be for someone living at the beginning of the 25th century.And that's the problem with Star Trek Picard. The writers of these new projects don't understand science. Even science fiction has to be based in something tangible so the audience has some reality to be grounded in.A quantum accelerator doesnt exist for example, but we can get the idea from accelerator. It must be a futuristic component. This show just makes up everything as it goes. Anybody can do anything and the tech they need will or wont be available depending on what the script requires at that time. You have things like Picard being turned into an exact android replica of himself to explain how he survives, then it's forgotten about soon after, because the script no longer needs it.Not only do they not understand science, they don't even understand writing. You can't constantly have high tension for everything. You can't replace thoughtful dialogue with pew pew lasers. Nonsensical, non-scientific plots were boring in the older series and they're boring in this entire series. But look! A guy with a katana! Katanas are cool, aren't they? Ya, in a Samurai movie...I've never seen such dumbing down of an audience in my life. If this were a hostile country producing this to make western audiences more stupid, it would totally make sense.The show is an insult. It's an insult to the older fans and it's and insult to new and younger people coming in. If you're watching this as your first experience with Trek, just know that they're insulting your intelligence.These types of producers are incapable of writing popular shows which don't get cancelled in the first season, so they use popular IPs with already established audiences to keep their contracts with the streaming services going a little longer. They are talentless hacks. You've seen them before, or rather the result of their work. They are franchise killers. Terminator, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dr Who, etc etcSome people complain that it's about injecting politics where they shouldn't be. I don't think that's the case. Trek in particular has always had politics. The episodes with the black and white people in the original series as a metaphor for racism was brilliant. I would say, you can only insert politics if you're not a hack and your art is actually good.If I had to say all the bad things specifically, I'd need to write a book. Go back and watch everything up until the movies came out if you dont want your brain to decay from lack of use.",

And Trek especially Needs to change, if it is to survive and remain relevant. Nostalgia of a lost era is one thing, and a show like The Orville can get away with it as it doesn't take itself too seriously and has its tongue placed firmly in its cheek. But demanding things stay the same to satisfy a longing for a lost youth is another.Picard is an older Trek, in style and in its titular character. This isn't an episodic exploration series, where the rest button is hit at the end credits. This is a science fiction novel about a broken man fighting to put the pieces of a broken world back together. The halcyon days of the Federation's golden age are over. Paradise has grown indifferent to the struggles at the fringes of its anointed borders. Yes, Star Trek has taken modern day concerns and plays them through the prism of spaceships and aliens, just as it has always done. But now with the style and sensibilities of modern TV dramas.Gene Rodenberry has passed, and that means people no longer get along just fine. That means actual Conflict between characters, and actual drama. Something the Next Generation seriously lacked.Picard is a flawed human, in the winter years of his life, and no longer the dashing Horatio Hornblower in space we looked up to in our youth. His values have been challenged. Everything he has dedicated his life to defending seems to be falling apart, and no-one cares. The galaxy is a dark and dangerous place, where life is cheap and plot armour won't protect you anymore.The stakes are high and the threat is real. Thank the gods, yes. Things have changed.Star Trek, for all its success, never really achieved great drama. As a syndicated TV show, with a few exceptions it generally played it safe. But in the new age of TV, with cinematic filming, broad storylines, and complex character development, Picard has taken some risks to tell a different kind of Trek.My only issue is the pacing of the series. CBS would have served the show better had it been released in full, rather than weekly. Than viewers could watch it a they would read a novel. There is a lot going on, but at the speed of one chapter a week it seems to drag more than it should. Now, half way through the season, when you're able to watch the episodes back-to-back, there's a lot more momentum.No, it's not the Star Trek we remember from our childhoods. But not is it the confusing and disappointing Discovery. This is Trek as legitimate drama, not space opera.",

It's about exploration, rectification of wrongs and personal growth.\nThe cast is up to the task at any given time, especially Santiago Cabrera, who doesn't play one, but six characters each with a different accent and attitude, Patrick Stewart, who reprises as Picard who is still (and for everyone to see) a figure of integrity, reason and ethics, and Isa Briones as daughter of Data whose acting depicts brilliantly the breaking apart and regaining control after a live changing event.\nThe effects and scene design are nothing short of outstanding, beautiful albeit grittier than most of the franchise before.\nThe plot needs a bit of time to get rolling but then does it with verve and suspense.What's really perplexing is the analogy some people are drawing between ST:P and Star Trek: Discovery. These series are nothing alike! While the latter could be subsumed as \"the Michael Burnham Show\", where every other character is little more than staffage for her personal and, at times, irrational attics, ST:P has a large variety of characters, each with a believeble and well thought trough backstory. hold together by a lynchpin that is Picard.Qui habet aures audiendi audiat!\nThere is nothing wrong with this series, nor isn't it in the best spirit of Star Trek.

It's sci-fi, but it isn't really Star Trek and no amount of shoehorning old characters into it will change that.Star Trek was always about a hopeful future for humanity, where we had overcome all out prejudices and bigotry and become a force for good in the galaxy.ST:Picard, on the other hand, reverses all this and now the Federation are basically isolationist a-holes that are willing to let entire species die because \"we don't help our enemies\" (This is actually stated in episode two). It's as if no one involved in this show ever watched ST: The Undiscovered Country.What this show is, and not even remotely trying to be subtle about it, is political and societal posturing by the writers and even by Patrick Stewart hinself. They've made no secret of the fact that it is meant to be a mishmash of everything wrong with society at the moment. I just wish they had writers that understood that beating your audience about the head with your idealogical leanings will have the exact opposite effect, even if they somewhat share those ideologies.What Picard feels like is... well, you know that scene in the Simpsons where Grandpa Simpson shakes his stick angrily at a cloud? Well this feels like that, only after he did that, someone gave him a job writing for television. Picard feels like that. Like grumpy old Abraham Simpson wrote it. It's miserable and dark, full of overdone societal commentary and politics and utterly NOT-Trek.Let's be clear, because Star Trek WAS always about such societal commentary, but it did it in a subtle way. A subtle way that was actually made more effective by having our future human descendants be almost perfect. The Federation of the older Trek shows was the shining beacon of how society should be, against which, all other societies (with their flaws) could be contrasted quite markedly in order to get across whatever the message of the week was.This new Trek has none of that guile, instead being intent on brow-beating the viewer with the issues of the day whilst showing our future as being anything other than hopeful and bright. It's depressing, honestly, and very tiring to watch. Am I in the minority of people that want to watch this sort of thing to forget about the real world, even if only for an hour or so at a time?It's early days yet, for this show, and I know Kurtzman only really had input into the first four episodes, so it might improve as the season goes on. However, right now its dreary and miserable. Even Picard's presence doesn't help, since Patrick Stewart seems to no longer be playing Picard, but only Himself at the moment.I also suspect that his role will be minimal as the show progresses. Oh, he'll be there, but mostly everything will be done by the show's new, younger cast. He's really only going to be there to legitimise the show as Star Trek. Same for the other older Star Trek cast that have become involved in this. Just there to add legitimacy to the show, hang around for half-an-episode (if you're lucky) and then gone forever. Picard, I feel, will be a guest-star on his own show.Whilst I'm picking holes in this...episode two. What kind of lazy-ass prop department uses a 3D printer as a replicator, then can't even be bothered to remove the (clearly visible) 3D printing parts (print-head/carriage and motors) from said printer before delivering a CLOSE-UP scene of that \"replicator\". I can't even begin to describe how little care and attention that makes me feel is going into this show, hence my feeling that it is going to go downhill quite rapidly.And another thing that is bugging me... Romulans. Has no one who is playing a Romulan in this show ever seen any episode of older Trek involving the Romulans? Or were they actually directed to act like humans all the time? Because so far, none of the Romulans are acting like Romulans, just like humans with pointy-ears.EDIT: So we're up to episode 8 and there's been swearing, graphic torture and the murder of TNG/Voyager characters without any good reason. It's pretty dire. The pacing in the later episodes is all over the place. The editing makes it clear there were plenty of reshoots and through it all, women tell Picard off again and again. Even Troi does it. What a mess!I can't help but feel so long as Bad Robot, Abrams, Kurtzman et al are involved with Trek, nothing worthwhile will emerge.SUMMARY: More NOT-Trek from Kurtzman. Picard who isn't Picard, Romulans that act like humans. Godawful contemporary cursing. Exhausting to watch pseudo-drama painted to look like Star Trek (by a painter that's never seen Star Trek).

But if your going to change fundamental aspects of what was established then create an original.In general how did the Federation become such a dangerous place? Why are we straying so far away from Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future. Picard is saturated with personal conflict, toxicity, war, and everyone trying to blow stuff up. Yes those elements have always been a part of Star Trek but to a much lesser degree. Roddenberry's focus for the original Star Trek and every series that followed were on the positives of human evolution, character development, and forward thinking. Not dark chaos.Picard... most of the original characters from STNG and Star Fleet personnel in general, none of them reflect their original traits. Honor, integrity, self sacrifice, empathy, wisdom, trust, sound judgement, courage, ALL we're in abundance in STNG. In this series star fleet personnel are toxic, finger pointing, dismissive, rude, unforgiving, incompetent, constantly bickering goons with inferiority complexes. You don't need toxic crew interaction in every other scene to build tension. The crew spends more time trying to one up each other as opposed to working together and building comradery. No one seems to be able to offer a different opinion in a constructive way, it's either my way or mutiny! And can we dispense with the constant references to the original STNG crew as LEGENDS, seriously no one talks this way. Why can't any of them have a normal conversation???The one positive, the special effects are a PLUS! I have to admit, the effects, sound, uniforms, set designs, all are superior to other Sci-Fi productions. On TV. A small nitpick would be the ships designs (not a fan) but the bridge layouts and gadgets are pretty awesome. At least they got to at part right. For that it get 3 stars as opposed to 1.",

It's just that as part of my entertainment there always was a Kirk, a Picard, a Sisko, a Janeway and all the other characters who entered the collective lore of sci-fi fans worldwide.It's probably fair to say that this isn't Star Trek as we got to know it. Starfleet isn't an idealistic organization exploring the stars and seeking out new civilizations anymore. It is a part of this Federation steeped in future \"realpolitics\" and they even learned to embrace swearing again adding F-bombs to proton torpedos and phasers. Everything seems dysfunctional and broken.Maybe that was necessary. I always wondered how the major Star Trek characters endured so much without being broken. They toyed a bit with Picard's \"Borg trauma\" but nothing a good game of poker among friends and a little chitchat in 10forward couldn't fix. Star Trek was after all a happy place and a reflection of our desire for a better future.Is \"Star Trek: Picard\" the way? It doesn't feel like it to me mostly because it doesn't appear to be an evolution of a series but rather a radical deconstruction which is also a very sloppy and careless one. The writing team deliberately doesn't turn a new page for Star Trek but rather rips out old pages replacing them with new dogma. I don't like that. I liked old Star Trek but maybe this wasn't made for me and I just haven't figured out for whom they made this new series. I wonder if the writing team knows.Apart from those points it is competent television in terms of special effects and camera work. The show looks modern but not always distinctly like \"Trek\". The dialogue could be better, like, a lot better. The pacing within and between episodes is jerky and feels off. Some content doesn't really help the plot but rather drives agenda (not a lot but because it's so on the nose when it appears it sticks out all the more). Many of the characters are hyper-emotional and the \"bad guys\" in particular are horribly overacted which is something they have in common with the recent \"Star Trek: Discovery\" series which also suffered from the dichotomy of emotionally mushy protagonists and over the top villains.The bottom line is that for someone like me this is at best average entertainment.",

If by the end of 8 it slumps back down and loses this magical recipe they cooked up in 6, then I won't blame people for thinking Picard is as bad as Discovery. By the way, what'd the deal with these CBS people hiring black women who overact? They keep hiring these actresses that are contributing to dragging these new treks down and yet Whoopi won't be on until season 2? Are these producers on drugs? Maybe it's a matter of these directors not knowing how to direct women in general? Most of the female performances come off on these CBS treks in general as being either stale, inauthentic, or overacted, now that I think of it.

An examination of both:In season 1, they portray Picard as a kind of galactic troublemaker who is always in trouble. His interactions with other major characters from TNG are warped by this; Picard was always an organized, disciplined, and law-abiding man, not a Loki-esque trickster. In season 2, they portray Picard as always late; the man was always the definition of punctuality.In season 1, they portray Picard and Riker as a pair of bullies because they have penises. This was so Deanna Troi could scold them about their incivility because--you know--writing for women means men must always be shallow as opposed to women being written well.I just stopped watching season 2 after one of the characters made a reference to \"early ozone erosion\" in the year 2024. Um...no. Not quite, sweetie. We've reversed the damage to the ozone layer; it's a great thing and something we should be proud of because it reveals that we can heal the planet and that we should. But it's more important to scold the viewer based on scientific ignorance than it is to acknowledge we've done something good for the planet. The writers either didn't do their research or just felt that it was more important to throw in an environmental morality lesson that we don't need in order to sell their product.Overall, the series is poorly written. Several characters (mainly women) come off as horrible hypocrites in terms of what they say as opposed to what they do. This isn't strong character development for female characters--it's just bad writing and incredibly shallow.Here's a good lesson for the writers of the Kurz-Trek-verse: stop injecting your politics into everything because it's making for stupid TV.

            "content": "Here's a question for you. Do you know what makes for a good Star Trek show? You know who else doesn't know the answer? CBS. After the golden era of Star Trek that was the late 80's until the early 2000's, the network entered a creative dry spell that, for me, has lasted until Patrick Stewart returned to helm this new show. Discovery attempted to revive the Star Trek universe but made so many changes that it was barely recognizable as Star Trek anymore, and then heaped so much politics on top that it alienated a significant portion of its audience. In the end it got so uncomfortable that it felt like you were making a statement just by watching it, and that feeling was made worse by the producers and actors suggesting that anyone who didn't like every aspect were secretly racist or misogynistic.But some of us just want some science fiction and a bit of escapist fantasy about a future where humanity spreads out into the universe seeking the unknown. Picard is a return to that concept, catching up to Jean-Luc in his picturesque but not very happy retirement on his family vineyard. As it turns out, his retirement wasn't so much a reward for a lifetime of service as it was a retreat from society, as it is revealed that Jean-Luc has taken a public stand against the prevailing sentiment of society. Instead of being honored for his past work, he is rejected and ridiculed at nearly every turn, save from a few close friends who share his minority view of the world.His retirement is interrupted by the arrival of a new life form on his doorstep; one with a connection to a departed friend. His efforts to resolve a mystery reveal a conspiracy at work within Star Fleet and awaken within him a renewed sense of purpose. It's bittersweet, to be honest, seeing the once indomitable Jean-Luc Picard clutching the rail to catch his breath during a flight from attackers or the open pity you sometimes see in the eyes of old comrades when they see him again for the first time in decades.He is old, and this is probably his last adventure, and the show doesn't shy away from those facts. But at the same time seeing him motivated by a new purpose and desire to stand up for an old friend brings a renewed vigor and sense of pride. We all get old, that is inevitable, but shrinking from our ideals isn't, and seeing Picard stand up and fight for what he believes in took me back to my childhood in a great way.It was a return to the Star Trek universe I remembered. One that is idealistic and unabashedly optimistic about human nature, and I really enjoyed it. Based upon what I've seen in the first episodes, I hope it gets a good long run.",

Things that were enough in the way of enigmatic origin that you could say \"Yeah... they display a power would be a real challenge to deal with\" . Enter Season 3 of Picard where they are facing against a \"Bounty Hunter\" that has a list of weapons that reads like the grocery list for an armada...ON ONE SHIP!!! This thing could, quite literally, one-shot a dreadnaught. That's quite \"impressive\" for a civilian vessel. \"Impressive\" like Somalian Pirates flying around in flying saucers with death-ray \"Impressive\". Yet nowhere has anyone remarked yet how ridiculous it is. Then I started to realize how filler oriented the series indeed is. Too much mucking around with little pay-off. The laziness doesn't end with the \"Bounty Hunter from God\".... It has been there all along. Padding out a series based around a list of characters we all remember from TNG. Playing upon nostalgia to collect some extra residuals. For the most part, I didn't mind. For the most part, it was time well wasted. Yet when writing goes from a poorly thought-out gimmick to outright insulting its own audience... it's just offensive.",

Something that taught me life lessons I was probably too young to learn, but I learned them anyway.When I was 7 years old I watched an original episode of Star Trek called \"Let That Be Your Last BattleField\" co-starring the late great Frank Gorshin. The story in a nutshell were two people fighting, who looked similar, half their face was black the other side white (an obvious allegory for an Adult, but I was oblivious) the \"twist\" of the episode was \"Kirk\" claiming why were they fighting, they were the same species, Gorshin's character said something like are you blind, I am black on the RIGHT side and his opponent was black on the LEFT side. Though this whole episode, I hadn't even noticed, at that point the LIGHT went on. The stupidity of judging someone by the way they look.Star Trek was about the future, it was about how far we had come. We had grown up as a species, we had moved past the horror's of our history. We FINALLY learned to work together to benefit everyone.PICARD is not Star Trek, I would say it's the opposite. It seems to be everything wrong with the world TODAY... New's Flash, I can see that on the nightly news, I DO NOT need it on my TV Shows. If you just want a space adventure show that's kind of boring, then by all means, go for it, but if you are looking for Star Trek.. you will not find it here.",

Later on a Romulan Reclamation site(cube) a Romulan named Narek is introduced. His mannerisms are those of a British 20 year old. I think it might have been better to use deepfake algorithms to reimage Data's face instead of heavy makeup on Brent Spiner.The styling of the production is more akin to a modern action movie than traditional Star Trek.

I am a huge TNG, Voyager and DS9 fan and Picard is the only show which truly keeps loyal to the core philosophy of those series imo (until now - and I hope that it will contine like this). All those negative comments are probably fake and paid to try to keep the hipe around this amazing attempt to be different in an excellent way from happening but with character constellations like in Picard, the story and the great quality of the special effects, this show is going to be one of the best ever released. Picard contributes positively to to the human mind, encourages the viewer to think about the self and enriches the otherwise pathetic palette of pointless series that only have violence, rage and decadence as their desperate theme. Picard engages the audience on an intellectual level while telling a story that is interesting and captivating. Well done!! I believe that many people like this show but - as very often in life unfortunately - only the haters and naysayers are taking the time to leave a review or rating. Again, thank you for making this show! It's amazing ( even though I believe that the plot with the attack of the androids is a bit rushing forward in the first episode - but I believe the problem was that the time was too short to fit into the required length and there had to be a compromise; it's the only that could be better imo. Otherwise, it's really good. Again, well done! and thanks).",

Remember, it's Star Trek: Picard. You're not interested in what has become of Jean-Luc? Don't watch it then, it's simple as that.I used to watch TNG as a kid and into my early teen years. I loved it back then and still sometimes watch episodes of it on Netflix. It's so soothing to be able to dive back into old days and feel like the fascinated kid again. Almost. Because like everyone else, I grew up and life happened to me. And as much as I would wish to be able to feel the exact same emotions I had back then... my adult mind throws a monkey ranch into my plans. And I notice that I am still am so very fond of the series, its characters and stories but something is missing while I watch it. It's probably the innocence of a child's fantasy and the unlimited capability of dreaming. And the na\u00efve belief that certain lessons TNG taught us would help humanity to improve (instead of dumbing down).However, I knew that watching Picard as an avid TNG fan was inevitable. And I think they made it perfect. It's totally different. It's got this movie flair about it and also a hint of \"Firefly\". And then there's Patrick Stewart... Jean-Luc. Meanwhile an admiral... but disappointed and exhausted from his last fight. An old Captain Picard who tries to find peace by living a life in reclusiveness but still gets haunted by nightmares in his sleep.This is not the Captain we knew and loved. This is an old man who simply gave up, who left everything and everyone he once loved and cared for behind. It's almost physically hurtful to see him like this... but I'm grateful for it. Anything else would have seemed fake. And after all it turns Jean-Luc is still as epic as he used to be. Just older, like all of us.I'm grateful that they didn't try to revive what once was. Three decades later, it wouldn't have made sense at all... It's a beautiful approach to show us a human Jean-Luc. It was important to distance from the happy go lucky sci-fi farytales. This was fine back then. It was just what I needed as a kid to escape reality sometimes. And to learn some important things about compassion, tolerance and morals.Star Trek: Picard is what I need right now. It's what my Adult-Me needs. An old new (or new old) Captain. Something totally different. With a hint of bittersweet emotions and memories. Something that goes a bit deeper and takes a bit more time and effort. A new adventure ... but a journey nonetheless.

Slow building unfortunately does not equal thought provoking or meaningful writing in this case.Picard goes to a Romulan planet, and gets himself in trouble.

Things change in the future but I'm ever confident that the purpose of Star Trek Picard will be, to bring back what Starfleet has forgotten and get it back on the track of the grand Rodenberry vision and if that takes a series or 2, so what and at the end of the day it will be honest. Seriously, do you really think that even if we achieved the grand vision of Gene Rodenberries Star Trek it would remain that way forever without any change. I don't think so and neither do a lot of other writers, what will matter is that those who know the grand vision, see fit to bring it back and restore it to the glory and great vision it represents.All throughout Next Gen, DS9 and Voyager we witnessed moments where Starfleet was not as perfect as it should have been. Even in The original series it was not without it's flaws(how about the wrongful trial of Kirk for example without the full facts.) So this is no stranger to Gene's vision and I believe in the end is going to enhance it by seeing ex captain Picard end up without knowing it, bring back the golden age, but it's going to take some doing and this series is without doubt geared around that premise.So far it's amazing and any negative nay sayers, can go and watch Star Trek Discovery if you really want to know what bad Star Trek is, then perhaps they will quit there winging and enjoy it for what it is. A glimpse into Picards future and what he does to set it right.Evil triumphs when good people fail to do nothing and Picard is not one of those individuals, no matter what his age.Amazing performances for all actors but Patrick Stewert you are incredible and I hope you win an Academy award for this role because you seriously deserve it.Look forward to seeing the next episode and here's to a great Star Trek future,\nSean.",

He has lost so much of his range and delivery that he borders on being really pitiful rather than simply acting it.The Next Gen and Voyager guests do a credible job with the few lines that they're given, but the writing is so weak, and they are forced so far into the background that they can't save it.The new crew is a mere trope - a rag tag bunch of unappealing drop outs and losers. Their cliched backstories are told in exposition, rather than shown - the big tiddy space elf ninja antagonist actually gets more depth. The inconsistent and randomly written characters are all over the place, running the gamut from angry to sad, pathetic to remorseful, but never, ever joyous. None of them have the acting chops to rise above the material, with the inexplicably cast Alison Pill in particular bringing some real cringe to her Thrift Store Kristen Bell performance.And I don't want to hear \"Give it a season to gel\", because Firefly managed it in one episode. When the writing, acting and direction are present, that's all it takes. Picard has none of those things behind the camera, and I get no feeling that the on-camera talent likes or respects each other enough to work around the laziness of writers who resort to completely unnecessary profanity every time they're stuck.It's not absolutely awful. Isa Briones is appealing enough in her various roles, Santiago Cabrera can do a range of third best accents, and Tamlyn Tomita owns all her scenes with the kind of quiet authority that Stewart has sadly lost.The effects and cinematography are competent enough. The score is too, but tries to over-sell both the the drama and depth of what's on screen.But the merits are too small and too far between to make up for the lack of pace, vision, respect for the milieu, or talent on either side of the camera. Picard is a grim, joyless, grimy grind, and I don't think anyone involved had any fun at all in making it.The shill ratings are wrong, and the reviews are right: this is a largely unrelated grimdark concept wearing the skin of a hollowed-out redshirt.",

Couldn't even watch all of that, so I only watched the parts they were in...but it wasn't worth it.Picard's relationships with the other characters are just not convincing, and there is no chemistry between any of them. At his age he apparently isn't participating in any serious action scenes, so he just meanders around being haunted by his past and trying to find a cause to fight for, deferring much of the minimal action to the younger cast of boring characters.Jean-Luc's newfound quest involves androids who don't know they're androids, who are from the same android line as Data, who has \"died.\"\nThe story takes soooooooo long to get anywhere it is difficult to stay awake, but if you do, you will encounter a number of contrived and uninteresting convolutions, incorporating political intrigue at Starfleet, a deactivated Borg cube being used for research, and stuff from Picard's past. Along the way, you will, of course, be subjected to the fake alien languages and cultures that are so obligatory and laughably solemn in Star Trek.You will also meet those joining Picard on his journey, including a woman with whom Picard has a history, and a cocky mercenary-type galactic-adventurer guy, who is an obvious (and embarrassing) rip-off of Han Solo.It would be unrealistic (and overly optimistic) to expect these endless Star Trek mutations and rehashes to go away anytime in the near future, but when Star Trek starts using Star Wars as source material, it really is time to retire the franchise.",

            "content": "For me, TNG Picard is by a clear head the best written and acted character from any ST. From that show, Data was the second best written and acted. So, giving Picard more story time and throwing in Data as a bonus ought, OUGHT, to have been a good idea. Go for a singe story series rather than anything episodic, for me should also have been a bonus. Unfortunately....What it feels like came out was Patrick Stewart, not Picard, and not any semblance to TNG. I'm no Trekkie so if all this has been discussed and I'm missing something that's why, but it really does feel as though Stewart has called far too many shots and been pandered to, leading to a very strong patronising whiff. Enough that I made it only to episode 2 (or was it 3? Not god enough for me to recall).I've read very negative reviews of Picard here that seem to put the TOS/TNG etc Federation on a different pedestal, seeing it as altogether wonderful. Maybe this was Rodenberry's aim. But to me it too came across as patronising, being a very flimsily disguised \"USA is wonderful and everyone else will come around to our way\". The difference is that the TOS/TNG pedestal/patronising tone was also naive and at least had some potential and shared interest, unlike the Stewart pedestal, which is very narrow, with o chance of being shared/universal.Beyond Stewart, it all felt rather soapy, overwritten and overacted. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what, if anything, could have been done about this as I find the vast majority of recent shows suffer the same fault. So I suspect any showrunner would have been tied on his, even if they appreciated the issue. And I'm probably an outlier on feeling there is a problem.So, why 3? Well, I persisted through to at least part way through episode 2 (or 3), so must have seen some potential in the story. Just not enough.",

The effect was less a man who was once Captain of a Starship and more an elderly man bemoaning the frailties of life.The storyline for Season 2 was good and I enjoyed how it all came together at the end.My biggest complaint though is the same with all of Star Trek, there is too much talking and very little interesting action.I ended up fast forwarding through most the later episodes in Season 2... particularly Picards ramblings and constant dwelling back to his Ch\u00e2teaux and mother (yawn!).It was good to see a cameo from Will Wheaton and I delighted in the return of the mighty Q6 out of 10 from me.",

It largely starts off looking and feeling like Blade Runner, morphs into Firefly, and then ends in a way that hints at Cylons. Which in and of itself isn't bad, if only it weren't called Star Trek.And that largely is the problem... It's is not Star Trek. It says it's Star Trek, and it has characters from Star Trek, and there are lots of Star Trek references, but it isn't really Star Trek.As a sci-fi story, the concept isn't terribly bad, however I get the sense that the writers had a story in mind but for whatever reasons they didn't feel that it was strong enough to stand on it's own. Perhaps the studios felt that they couldn't compete with The Expanse, and so they decided to turn the story into a Star Trek franchise much like they did with Star Trek Tardigrades, I mean... Discovery.The problem is that Picard spends most of his time apologizing and being criticized for simply for existing and everyone else on the ship is suffering and coping with existential issues. Space Elf is really the only one who just seems to be happy and content being Space Elf with a sword, hacking bad guys left and right, while 7 of 9 is the strangest addition to this motley crew simply because her story is more of a macguffin than anything, and doesn't actually add anything to the narrative.... And they kill Data... again... because Butterflies that don't die aren't Butterflies?There is so much wrong with this series it's almost easier to talk about what's right. The Borg Cube was cool, Alton Inigo Soong was a solid addition, and Riker and Troi's part was actually kind of nice.Some would say that Star Trek needs to evolve, which is true, however in all things there is a spirt and a substance and an essence that culminates in the whole. To be sure, the substance of Star Trek is there, however it lacks the spirit and essence of Star Trek. There is something profoundly odd about today's current generation that says so long as you put on the suit, you can identify yourself as being a part of that which the suit represents. Typically, this is considered to be stolen valor, and frowned upon in most of the world.... And they fixed the ship with a sonic screwdriver where all they had to do was use their imagination......How people are liking this series and getting excited over \"Star Trek\" is back is beyond me. It's really for the cos-players and fandoms who like the idea of Star Trek because of how it makes them feel like they are part of a community. But in a world where Klingons are now Orcs, canon means nothing, and it's more about representation rather than story, you could pretty much slap a label on whatever you want and call it Star Trek, and it would be so.",

It was a catastrophe, quite literally an act of utter barbarity.\nOr in other words: A very poorly-written piece of generic action sci-fi.Right from the start, the series falls flat on its face.\nInstead of \"boldly going where no one has gone before\" and exploring strange new worlds and charting the unknown, Season One of \"Picard\" is essentially about how the artificial intelligences we create could overcome us. Well, that's very interesting and original, RIGHT?\nAs for the rest of the plot:\nEverything's pretty much nonsense, there are loads of things that don't make sense or remain unexplained and there's a significant amount of continuity errors. The writing feels like someone collected drafts from the trashcan in the writer's room and turned them into one big, serialized mess.\nThe show also has the strange habit of randomly introducing unnecessary subplots & concepts just to forget about them later.The characters: Unnatural, clich\u00e9d, one-dimensional, antagonistic, always depressed and over-emotional - That's how I would describe them.\nI mean what character traits other than that do they even have? Jurati vomits all the time, Rios is a poor-man's Han Solo, Elnor just exists, Raffi is a arrogant drug-addict who lives in a trailer (in a time where poverty was solved centuries ago and drug addiction is easily curable), Seven of Nine's now an angsty lesbian alcoholic murderer, Picard went from being a intelligent, deeply moral & passionate leader to a childish, impulsive & confused fool, and then there's Narek & his mustache-twirling villain sister and believe me, they have a rather strange relationship going on...Even the way the show depicts the Federation is completely off: A bleak, problematic and merciless place. There's classism, money made a comeback, everyone drinks real alcohol (what happened to synthehol?) & smokes, people swear and use 21st century contemporary language and no one's happy.\nIt seems like the entire Federation society has turned into a dystopia - the exact opposite of Star Trek. Funny, isn't it?Picard suffers from the same deseases that plagued Discovery: Too much emphasis on spectacle, action & plot twists, rushed concepts & plotlines which are sometimes \"borrowed\" from different movies, series and games (in this case especially Mass Effect 3), cringeworthy dialogue and unnecessarily gruesome violence & gore.\nThis is exactly the type of entertainment that appeals to the audience CBS tries to target: Empty-minded people with attention spans of goldfishes.\nWhat a great way to honor Roddenberry.And seriously, what kind of uncreative & talentless people worked on this show? Shutterstock footage, copy & pasting of an entire fleet of starships, heavy usage of Discovery's design language...\nThis show is excellent at being lazy and unoriginal.I find it laughable that there are fans who blindly defend this load of crap. Since its first episode, ST:P has done nothing but constantly contradicting & ignoring what made Star Trek, well... Star Trek.\nThe problem is that both ST:P & ST:D try to emulate Deep Space Nine's darkness and more \"realistic\" tone without even attempting to understand why it worked for that series. DS9 never contradicted the franchise's positive view of the future, it only challenged and explored it further.\nAnd despite all the \"grittiness\" DS9 had, it was, like all iterations of Star Trek up to that point, quite optimistic and hopeful.Reddit user KingofMadCows wrote a very insightful comment on that subject:\"Discovery and Picard have the darkness of DS9 but not the depth.\nThey want to exist in the more complex and gritty world of DS9 but they still resolved problems as easily as TNG, without doing any of the extra work of DS9.\"But I guess this is no longer Star Trek.

It took awhile to get to know the characters but as you do you will likely like them and see they have some depth. Patrick Stewart does a great job as always and I enjoyed this show better than TNG and any of the TNG movies. I don't understand the poor reviews other than this is different and people don't like change. Some issues will come to light as the story develops and I think Roddenberry would be happy with this show.

            "content": "Like Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, Picard, as of season 3 is bucking the trend of the newer Treks (Discovery and the first two seasons of Picard) that showed a violent, fascist Federation that was filled with bitter and broken people, and has returned to the more optimistic tone of the original Trek series (TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise)Unlike Discovery, the Starfleet officers act like trained military people, rather than children, and there is no shouting, screaming, or tantrums on the bridge. The characters act like adults. They may not particularly like each other, but they trust each other to be professionals.Is the show perfect? Not by a long shot. Is it outstanding, like so many people are claiming? I'd say no to that, as well.I think a lot of people have been so disappointed with the JJ Abrams Trek movies, Discovery, and the first seasons of Picard that they're overcompensating by praising Strange New Worlds and now Picard far more than they deserve.Picard season 3, like SNW, is definitely a return to the original formula. The characterizations are good, the acting is good, and the stories are intriguing. But the key element is that both shows are filled will likeable characters and an optimistic world (or galaxy)view.After the unlikable characters and nihilistic stories of Discovery and Picard before it, the newer series.are being praised just for being different. That doesn't automatically make them brilliant, though.Is Picard season 3 good? Yes, it's good to very good. And it's certainly worth watching, which I wouldn't say about the previous seasons. But it's not perfect, and don't watch it expecting to be blown away by the series.",

Yes, I know there were movies and continuation episodes and story arcs, but mostly everything was very clean and tidy and the Federation was a force for good.But Picard is different. It develops more slowly. We already know some of the characters, but times have changed and they are different now. Deeper. A bit scarred. The galaxy is darker. This new landscape drew me in very quickly!I'm 5 episodes in and loving it, every delicious drop. There are some great new characters as well as some old characters, one in particular whose appearance made my heart almost burst: she's not who she was, but I totally understand how she became what she is ;-).Please, give it a go.

Only Franks seems to be enjoying the role again, everyone else acts like they are in it only for a paycheck.Ok, so bad acting aside, how's the plot? Well...it certain is a soap opera set in space. Everyone is full of drama and doubt and of course has some kind of ulterior motive. The writers are trying to do some kind of \"Dark Trek\" and make it gritty and noir but honestly it's not working. Sure the TOS and NG were all shiny happy people and that needed some moderation but \"Emo Trek\" is not working..dial it back a bit guys.Only three episodes in, but I'm not sure I'll last many more.

Apart from the speed, the plot is fine.The style is darker than TNG which is good, but it also tries to be emotive but largely fails due to superficial character development.Overall, not bad. There are some wonderful moments but they just needed to squeeze it into less episodes. Some of the nostalgia carries this series, so TNG fans will enjoy. I did not like the ending.I then just finished Season 2. It was incredibly disappointing. Oftentimes dull, oftentimes ridiculous.

Meeting intriguing, occasionally hostile, alien races every week.Yes, sometimes there was drama, death and worry, but always, ALWAYS, it ended up teaching us a valuable lesson in a clever way and filling us with hope for humanity.That's Star Trek, or at least that's what I think of when I think of Star Trek.Picard continues the recent tradition of being serialized, slow-moving, overly dramatized crap with poor dialog, set in a hopeless world where everything is dark and going to hell. Everything is negative. Lens flares and over-the-top action scenes galore.After seeing the first episode, I realized that not much actually happened in it. That whole section of the story could have been told in about 20 minutes. They are drawing everything out with extra drama, pointless scenes and weak dialog, because adding fluff is the only way they can extend their plot across 10 or however many episodes it is they have planned.I don't want a 10 hour drama film with the slowest possible pacing. I just want Star Trek back. Give us a classic TOS/TNG/Voy/Ent style show again, in an episodic format with an occasional epic two-parter. THAT'S ALL WE WANT!! The formula is a proven winner.Until they return to the roots of what makes Star Trek what it is, I'm done with the franchise. Had some hope for this show. I thought certainly they learned their lesson with the backlash to Discovery? Nope. They didn't.The only good things I can say about this is that the acting is good, and it's not as bad as Discovery.Alex Kurtzman should never be allowed anywhere near this franchise again.",

So far, quite unexpectedly the majority of the other characters react to him fairly negatively. There are reasons for this in the plot, but it may be a bit jarring for fans of the TNG era to watch.\nThe main ensemble of characters are all fairly interesting, however I'm not getting a feeling of chemistry between them yet. Maybe it's too early in the series for that.Growing up, I saw star trek as my 'safe place' in that it was an optimistic view for the future, and complete escapism from life. This series feels very different to that. It has a pessimistic, dark feeling that makes it seem different to Gene Rodenberry's original vision for the show. This series is clearly trying to draw parallels to current events in order to push political agendas. While this may be more appealing to viewers new to star trek, it could alienate fans who have an emotional connection to the values and ethics the previous series' follow. I'm on the fence about this new direction. Although it makes the series feel relevant for today, it also seems disrespectful to Gene Rodenberry's legacy.Although I enjoy the fact that one overarching story is covered over the series, rather than the style of TNG when it was a new story each episode, it feels a little like the main mystery was uncovered in the first few episodes, partly through some clunky expositional dialogue between the villain characters that felt fairly forced. Half way through the series I feel like each episode is mainly 'filler' until the finale act and finale.Overall, I am enjoying the series. I think it has good potential, but perhaps hasn't quite found it's stride yet. Although it has flaws, I an definitely invested in the story and am intrigued to see where it goes.",

Just another boring show that takes place sometimes in space.I can only imagine how many times Patrick had to turn to the directors and say, \"Picard wouldn't have ever said that or behaved that way, it goes against his character\".Between this and Discovery, This is the generation that ruined Star Trek by trying to make it \"better\" when there was nothing to improve upon,They've essentially removed the Journey, the Story of traveling through space ... And basically made it a horribly acting, politically motivated, fake fighting show with too much CGI with the hope it will capture the short attention span of our current state of society. This is where CBS is taking the entire Star Trek Universe.",

The old foes are there - the Borg, the Romulans. Up to here, it's traditional Star Trek. The old crew is there - Data -Picard (Patrick Stewart) is still the charismatic, icon Captain of the Enterprise, but it's a different Enterprise of course. Though ageing, STP might just have arrived at the perfect time in the Star Trek world, to protect the new narrative of Star Trek. From this aspect, this show does a very good job.The show has a more cinematic feel to it, excellent editing, different lighting & very different camera angles of the characters. There is even swearing witch would have been frowned upon in the old Star Trek Generation days. There is also more segments of violence.So, my underlying question is why is Jean-Luc Picard no longer the Captain of the Enterprise? What could have removed our iconic Picard aqua from the Captain's chair? A mysterious cataclysm drove him out in disgust we find! That the strength of a STP - that utopian circumstances don't just happen in the Star Trek world. I'm looking forward to ensuing episodes elaborating on this notion.Even with a familiar face, we are cast into a new & excitingly fresh narrative of Star Trek, one much darker than we've ever seen before. I cannot wait to see where the show develops the story & narrative. Episode 1 is fantastic start....... If you are a Star Trek fan go in with an open mind & you will not be disappointed.",

            "review_title": "A Fantastic First Season",
            "content": "It is funny while I have been reviewing plenty of Star Wars products recently I have just finished the first season of Star Trek's new show Picard and here is my review of the show. The premise sees a retired admiral of the Galactic Federation come out of retirement to attempt to save a young android from destruction by a secret Romulan assassination squad.Main Character\nPatrick Stewart is back as Admiral Jean Luc Picard for this show and he does a fantastic job, you can see just how great an actor he still is by his performance on the show. He has so much depth to him as a character and you can't help but be inspired by him and understand why the rest of the cast follow him throughout. He is not just your typical action star and it is nice to see a character with some real depth to him and a really interesting moral compass.Supporting Characters\nAlison Pill plays Dr Jurati and I thought she was a really interesting character among other interesting characters on the show. At first I found her pretty bland and uninteresting but as the show progresses she gets more and more screen time and really has some interesting dilemas that she is put in, she is torn between a few things and it really shows her morality questioned. Isa Briones plays the Android on the show and she is also interesting as you see her questioning everything and you see things through her eyes and how her life gets flipped on its head by the introduction of Picard. Michelle Hurd plays Raffi, a former Starfleet officer that has fallen off the rails and she does a very good job, I thought her and Stewart had really good chemistry on the show and I thought her character goes though quite a bit on the show to make you care about her. Santiago Cabrera plays the pilot Rios and at first I thought he was just going to be a Han Solo ripoff but he gains more character as the show progresses and you grow to like him plus the actor is very charming and charismatic which obviously helps.Story\nAs you can pretty much guess I really liked the crew dynamic on this show and I feel like having a likeable crew really helped making this a good story, I also liked the characters individual story arcs and thought they were really interesting. Also having an interesting moral dilema as the main crux of the stories helps, seeing both sides point of view makes the plot more fascinating to watch. However, I have to say I thought the ending to the season was quite weak, I can't go into details without spoiling it but it does something that takes away from some of the emotional impact of the finale.Script\nThe script is great, the characters feel like real people, there is more humour then I was expecting and for the most part it worked and the drama also felt dramatic which helped make these characters plight be something that we could care about.Style\nThe style has some great action scenes both on the ground and in space, you can tell this show has a big budget to it and it pays off making the show feel very large scale. It also has a great tone mixing the action and story elements that make the 10 episodes feel the right length ais it is never dull.Overall\nOverall, I was so suprised by how much I enjoyed this show. It had some great messages to it and some memorable characters and whether you are a fan of Star Trek or not I believe you will find this show interesting.Rating - 9/10.",

            "content": "There are quite a number of negative reviews aren't there?! Of course everyone has an opinion and they're entitled to it :)I'll start by saying that I hated Discovery. I had to let it go after a few episodes. I readily admit that maybe it happened because I went in with my expectations too high. They certainly were high. But there was so much to dislike there between terrible acting and boring plots and unlikeable characters.I went into Star Trek: Picard with a very open mind. I told myself beforehand - \"this is NOT going to be my beloved TNG\" and simply to leave that notion behind.I'm glad I did. Yes it's certainly not TNG, but I think Stewart has stepped back into one of his most famous roles with grace and aplomb. Picard's life has changed but that warmth that we saw in him (first season excluded!) is well and truly there. I'm three episodes in and they're just heading in to space and I'm glad this point has come. I know they had to set the tone, do the exposition and establish new characters. I've enjoyed it up to now and have every reason to believe I will enjoy the rest. (I must say that hearing a Romulan with a VERY Irish accent takes me out of those scenes - and I'm Irish! It just hits the ear strangely. Do not get me started on Santiago Cabrera's attempt at an Irish accent! Just no.)Patrick Stewart has been very vocal about wanting to do justice to the work that he is so proud of in TNG and not diminish it. With an executive producer credit I have faith that all will be well and we'll get something different here but rooted in that 24th century world we know and love.***Possible spoiler*** Some reviewers are complaining that Starfleet is a shambles and is not the Starfleet they know. Of course it's not... It has been infiltrated and is an actual plot point. Give things a chance! ***Spoiler ends***I'm sticking around for this ride!",

            "content": "Can androids age? Well, the opening shots of this new series reuniting us with Admiral (Retd.) formerly captain Jean Luc Picard of the U. S. S. Enterprise, would have us think so as a visibly older Data plays a game of chess with his old captain. When the apparently happily retired Picard awakes from what turns out to be a dream encounter with his previously sacrificed crew-member, it's not until later in the episode where we realise the significance of this and indeed Data to the storyline, indeed Picard later has another dream-meeting with his old colleague just to further reinforce the point.Then the story cuts to a young woman whose stay-indoors night with her boyfriend is brutally cut short by the materialisation of a Romulan hit squad who take out the boyfriend only for the girl herself to snap into explosive action as a whirlwind fighting machine to save herself. But why does an image of Picard whom she's never met appear in her mind?Both these strands are brought together skilfully in a story which even at this early stage promises viewers equal amounts of intrigue and nostalgia as it progresses.While it was great to see Patrick Stewart fully inhabit his old character again and walk in that distinctive semi-hunched fashion of his, he is unquestionably older and slower in his movements and delivery. The energy will come, I presume, from his bright young companion and I look forward to seeing how it all pieces together in future episodes.Just how many past cast-members will make it back to rejoin their old captain remains to be seen and I wait to see if that closing image of a massive Borg-like space-structure has any greater significance too. Did I like the intrusion of ninja-type fights into the narrative, probably not, but I reluctantly have to accept that if the show is to reach out to a wider audience beyond old Trekkies like me, maybe it's something I'll just have to endure. Likewise, the series will obviously be following a story-arc rather than different stand-alone episodes as in the past. This is the way all the rival DC and Marvel shows run I guess and is also unsurprising in this day and age.Otherwise, with largely pleasing CGEN SFX and what sounds on first listen a pleasant theme tune, I'm looking forward to engaging (sorry) with Jean Luc in his new mission.",

No its just filler as was Picard having a terminal disease/dying/coming back in a synthetic body subplotPoor continuity. Guinan and Picard met in the 19th century according to TNG. Picard's writers decided to ignore this so we can have drama here. Unnecessary. Picard and Guinan combing forces a second time before the 24th century would have been good enough.Don't get me started on Dr. Adam Soong. Is he a scientist or a warlord? The scene with him coming up with a army of mercenaries plus the scene where it is discovered he has drones ready to destroy Europa had me ready to laugh hysterically.Raffi risking the universe to save Seven.

It's a very different world from the world we left off and in many aspects, Gene's envisioned world is yet to come which is why every Star Trek series resonates in today's world. One of the biggest reasons as to why we didn't see more Star Trek series is because they simply ran out of stories. Many of the episodic stories were being repeated. Star Trek Picard is a narrative driven series (like discovery) rather than each episode having its own uniqueness which is why it seems so different. It's building the foundations of a story and taking us on a journey to a conclusion like most tv series' today.This review has been made literally after season 1 episode 4 but already it's grasped on so many things that the previous tv shows have laid down foundations. The biggest two being, the misuse and abuse of android tech and the federation as being held back by the political. The Captain in every series has had to struggle with the restraints of the federation, Picard less so due to his stern and strong beliefs in it. It is completely in character for him to remove himself from the federation after they left the romulan race to die as probably the main reason for his departure. I'm sure we will learn that the federation dug their own grave in regards to the android synth tech mainly because of the data and doctor bashir stories.Each episode seems to be designated to introducing the new characters but their introduction is interwoven into progressing the story. Rather than each episode having some sort of social meaning behind it, these characters I predict, when all together, will convey a united social message rather than individual characters being designated with individual stories with individual social meanings in the story being told like told in previous Trek.Absolutely loving it so far, feel as if I'm back into the Star Trek universe",

Everything seemed to be solvable with diplomacy and clever people who have learned from history. At that time I watched the utopian series STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION full of optimism. In a world without money or greed, the people there were able to make the world better, no matter wheather they are researchers or artists. Existing adversity could be overcome with humanism and technical progress. In reality, this pacifist utopia was over a few years later, and the ongoing Star Trek series reacted to this: in DEEP SPACE NINE it was no longer so certain who the good and bad are in the warlike game of politics, In the STAR TREK: ENTERPRISE series (from 2001), Captain Archer even makes completely irrational decisions that are out of proportion. If clever science fiction reflects reality, Star Trek has often succeeded and that explains the charm of this rich fandom. STAR TREK: PICARD takes up this approach. A resigned old Jean Luc Picard still believes in ideals 20 years ago in a time when all ideals were thrown overboard for political reasons. He doesn't have to save the entire universe or fight against overpowering opponents who, like in STAR TREK: DISCOVERY, want to erase the world. He stands for something and reminds us that it is basically each of us who can work together with others. This optimism is just the right thing to face the seemingly hopeless today. The very first episode of STAR TREK: PICARD is exceptionally good and the best Star Trek in decades. I am very happy what Sir Patrick and Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon, among others, have achieved here. Engage!",

When I did not see a thing yet, I already had huge douds on why they chose Picard as the retired Star Trek captain. It is certainly not because of his acting, but he reminds me of the biggest storyline mistake of Star Trek writers. The Q continuum. There is nothing worse then a character that has unlimited godlike power over the universe. Any situation they would throw Picard in, in the back of your mind you would think that he could always depend on Q coming to the rescue. That would diminish any suspense they would build up too.6 episodes in, I do still like it.\nIf I really dig deep, then yes...what the negative reviews say holds true.\nBut just for being entertained it has sci fi quality,\nWith that I mean it has more then Stargate and maybe a lot less then Altered Carbon.

The inclusion of Seven of Nine and Hugh is very good. And later in the season visiting the Rikers is like seeing a family member after many years. I am very excited to see future seasons and hopefully more beloved characters from TNG, DS9, and Voy. There is such a deep story history that's untapped.",

I mean Really! whats next? 2 completely vertical eyebrows?? they almost look like that now....You get the feeling that the show has a weak storyline and very weak main characters and that its trying to pull viewers in with appearances by data, 7 of nine , riker ect becuz, as fans, of course we want to see these characters again...Thing is , those appearances are temporary and are like a tease..There are a couple of good peripheral actors but the core ones and stewart himself are not really selling it..the acting is unconvincing, dull, and weak..I also, like so many on here, wanted to Really like this show but it needs Better stories and perhaps different writers creating a storyline with Vision that draws people in..It almost seems as if the actors are as bored with their lines as we are watching them!

Creator Chabon seems to be the culprit, using endless exposition and dull dialog to bog down this 10-episode series that could have been tightly wrapped up in three.It doesn't help that Patrick Stewart's once commanding voice sounds like a whisper throughout this all-too-lengthy wheeze of a series. Saying that, I can't wait for the second year of the series: Patrick Stewart created an indelible character, but he really does need the Enterprise to carry this series to the greatness it deserves.(Not all eps are talky, dull exercises: STNG alumni Frakes directs eps 4 and 5 and those two stand head and shoulders above the rest, with jokes timed perfectly for once and pacing is tauter than the others.)",

            "content": "Serious space travel (sci-fi and real) is for the young and, perhaps, the middle aged. If you disagree, check out the often uncomfortable-to-watch STAR TREK: PICARD (ST:P). Here a number of actors reprise their roles from nearly three decades ago. Some look like they have held up well; others not so much. The star of ST:P, Patrick Steward, seems to be somewhere in between. His Picard character acts, looks, and sounds like the octogenarian actor Steward is. But he appears to move about well. Nonetheless, it seems incredulous to see him ostensibly commanding space ships and heading landing parties in Hans Solo style.Season One.Steward's bland, unchanging expression and presence in many scenes seems like it might as well have been digitally pasted in. Rather than remaining front and center, the Picard character can end up on the sidelines as an observer which clearly illustrates that the show intends to proceed with or without superfluous (bookend?) appearances by Steward. The most watchable scenes are usually those without the Picard character.Picard survives all this by becoming an android. But Steward's new existence could still benefit from some (more?) digital make-up plus some (more?) re-recording to eliminate the distraction of his mumbling, weak, hoarse, and cracking voice.Directing/editing is hit or miss. Pacing is generally lethargic and things often limp along between fight-scene set places. Scripts are far from original and some are ridiculously padded to extend individual show lengths and the number of shows. Special effects, especially exterior scenes, can look obviously fake and cheesy such as repetitive scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge that looks like a toy model. (Some sets may be knockoffs from THE EXPANSE.) The score is rather generic except for the impressive opening and closing credits. That said, the score can be the most dynamic (and, hence, interesting) part of otherwise sleepy scenes.Season Two.This is not the usual Star Trek space opera franchise. Rather, it is a time-travel opera with multiple blossoming romances and a conventional happy ending (that includes the Borg!).The initial show starts off as a whimper: a rambling (and endless) Picard character expository and an obsession on growing grapes (not even in space!). The script soon descends into chaos and lunacy, and never seems to recover for the duration of the series. Jeff Russo's powerful score comes to the rescue none too soon and (fortunately) stays there as the season unfolds. Russo's music is really the star of the show! Movie-theater grade special effects provide life support (it's hard to find a scene without CGI). Unfortunately, the quality of effects shots deteriorates as the season progresses and become cheesy in the closing episodes (a victim of wrap-up rush and/or dwindling financial resources?).Time travel sagas are always a struggle for writers to get straight! The script is mostly focused on Picard's memories (which may be far from perfect at his age) where what is \"remembered\" has yet to occur. The trick of using a space ship to travel back in time has been used before, but returning to the future sans a ship seems to suffer from writers lacking imagination! Moreover, time-line impacts on the future due to changes in past events are given lip service at best.Script writers appear obsessed with the amateur psychoanalysis of the Picard character; life in a vineyard riddled with hidden tunnels, dungeons, monsters (but, sadly, no dragons); and a suicidal mother trying to comfort a psychologically lost very young Picard (the latter appears in the same scene or is glimpsed in the background ad nauseam!).Acting is all over the map from the enjoyable (especially the character played by actress Sol Rodriguez) to the tolerable but hammy (from principal supporting players) to the painful (the title character). There is also a fair amount of what looks like ad libbing.This season could benefit from leading off with a summary of the previous season. After all, its been over two years since the last one (which was far from memorable).How many producer types does it take to screw in a light bulb or, in this case, screw up a show? It looks like this production was \"producer sourced.\" Sure the script writers can be held accountable for the mess, but the multi layers of \"checkbook or in-kind\" producers should probably share much of the blame. Way too many cooks (and wannabe cooks)?ST:P seems to be a show designed to shore up nostalgia in its aging and dwindling core base of fans while trying (disparately?) to grow that base. The outcome for either does not look particularly promising given this entry. Recommend fast forwarding through the Picard character scenes or, better still, turning off the video and just enjoying the music. Viewed on disc. WILLIAM FLANIGAN.",

The story is utterly predictable, because this is a pantomime. A sincere, dame-dominated pantomime, but nothing more interesting than that. The 'borg' plotline was done to death years ago, and one eye-extraction scene is quite enough - they show it twice.What's telling is that El-Nor (?), a new character who's a kind of sex-on-legs teenage mutant invincible matrix ninja, has NOTHING TO DO except when he's saving Picard's life, because that's all he's there for - Patrick Stewart can sadly no longer get away with stage combat.

The group administrator, who was dressed as The Doctor in Voyager, doubted it.That idea was shouted down...but that's what happened nonetheless. I loved the first few episodes but then it started to plod. The Season 2 opener has far more avenues at its disposal. People are already complaining that Picard isn't acting like a super strong, super fast android. First off, he wasn't designed to be, if you listened carefully enough to the Season One closer, and I doubt Q will allow that to continue to be the case anyway.What Picard has a chance to do here is go where Discovery didn't, very sadly. Discovery had a great dual reality storyline at the beginning, but then it was thrown aside for some pretty boring stuff, which wasn't interesting and lasted too long.Q's reintroduction could open endless possibilities which could directly draw on TNG origin stories....and I really hope they don't screw this up!That said, its a very interesting start...but the trial never ends...UPDATED\nNow we're into the final season there are immediately two burning questions: where's Wesley Crusher, momentarily spotted in Season 2 and why didn't they just reunite the cast from the beginning?Wesley is easy: they showed he was still a traveler and not particularly interested in human conflict. That's important because if Wesley rescued his Mother this season would be over in about twenty seconds. Then why didn't they unite earlier is a harder question to answer. I don't think Raffi or Cristobal were particularly interesting characters. You have to care about a character's survival and, so far, I don't,So here we go. Professor Moriarty has appeared along with Eric Bana's nightmare ship from the Star Trek movie canon with Chris Pine. Whereever we go, whether it's boldly or not, I really hope this lives up to its promise because, in many ways, they've struck out in the two previous seasons. There is a line which talks of the enemy always being something different. My best guess at this point is that they adapt themselves to the psyche of what the protagonists fear.Time will tell.",

            "review_title": "Is This the Star Trek You Once Loved?",
            "content": "Many have expressed that the third season of Picard is a return to the old Star Trek - and not just its characters, but its values, its spirit. Is this so? In some ways, yes. For instance, through three episodes, it has avoided promoting divisive social and political views. But in many ways, this show couldn't be more different than its predecessor, Star Trek: The Next Generation:1. It's physically darker. Almost every scene so far is set at night or in the dark, creating a tense, foreboding atmosphere. TNG used warm, brighter colors to create a familial and optimistic environment, even in the depths of space. That environment established the show's world as a place we wanted to visit every week.2. The story itself seems darker. The stories in TNG were generally uplifting. The enemy was often defeated by empathizing with it, negotiating with it, or by the crew working together to reason a way out of the situation. So far, this season's story just involves a superior ship chasing and trying to destroy the heroes' ship while all the main characters fight each other. It's often so unpleasant, which leads to the next point.3. Characters and relationships are unpleasant. Every main character is in conflict with another, and a number of them are angry and sullen. Take Captain Shaw, who seems to always be angry and snarling at someone. The same with Jack - cynical and bitter. Even Picard has bitter exchanges with Beverly and Riker. As for Raffi, bless her heart, but the woman needs therapy. She has to be one of the most unstable Star Trek characters in the show's entire canon.Why is everyone so unhappy in the future? Because TV writers believe that good drama needs conflict. Fine. But how do you depict that conflict? TNG established a peaceful future where mature characters developed warm relationships with each other, and wasn't that show successful? Those characters fought their challenges, not each other, and many of us loved it for that.4. It loves violence. Star Trek: Picard seems to enjoy depicting as much violence as a TV-14 rating will allow. Through three episodes, we've seen disintegrations, impalements, beheadings, sucker punches, and big, concussive phaser and torpedo blasts. Most of these come with sharp crack and boom sound effects that make them seem extra destructive.On the other hand, TNG marginalized violence. Battle scenes were efficient, never lusty. Phasers, the series' main firearm, barely resembled a modern weapon and were usually used only to stun. This underscored the show's focus on a peaceful future and showed that people of that future valued human life.5. It loves swearing. Characters swear in anger or frustration throughout each episode. The writers likely feel this makes the show grounded or realistic. But in TNG, swearing was rare. Yes, this may have been due to television standards back then, but it supported the idea that people in that world were at peace.So what's the verdict on this show, Star Trek: Picard, season 3? Is it better than the previous seasons? Probably. But is it some bold return to the old TNG and its unique values? In terms of tone, atmosphere, and outlook, the answer is no - that show barely got made even 30 years ago, only then because of its powerful creator, and the likes of it may never be seen again in this sad world. So continue to enjoy the old series, which was unique, and boldly held out hope of a bright, peaceful future for mankind. And keep looking forward to a future full of hope and peace. TV writers may not believe in such a world anymore. But I do.",

I am a man in 40's who has watched every Trek show since I was 3 years old.Whilst I love Star Trek I am well aware of its flaws but Picard, whilst not perfect is far from the worst and not deserving of the abuse which it is receiving from so called fans.",

Anamorphic lenses and all.I know that the old Star Trek formula is almost completely devoid of any panache or pizzazz and is solely focused on thought exercises and moral quandaries, and there is certainly a place for that in history, but new wave Star Trek seems to be focusing more on personal conflicts, and personal drama, rather than academics, which to me is perfectly serviceable.TECHNICAL:\nThe look of the show is incredibly Moody, which, for me as a filmmaker is positively sumptuous, and is far superior to the flatly lit, overly saturated cardboard colors of yesteryear. The lens choice is lovely, the color grade is truly satisfying, and the editing is smooth. Also the music is really well done! Not always a given for TV.The performances are somewhat stiff, but in an endearing way, clearly indicative of hokey-but-genuine early 90s television which has a nostalgic power for me personally. The characters seem to be themselves, which (again) is not always a given with legacy sequels. The adventure itself is for the time being somewhat simple, but there is a mystery box mechanism at play, which I am genuinely intrigued to see pan out.I would personally recommend this show to anyone who's generally compelled by science fiction/space/adventure material.If you've made it this far, congratulations.Ummm... engage.",

I am not sure if people were expecting a new season of TNG in 2020? If so, you should consider yourself very silly. Picard is absolutely masterful. It is engaging, interesting, thought-provoking and, most importantly, relevant. What made TNG so wonderful was the exploration of philosophy and ethics through reflection of modern events and issues in the 1990s within the context of a better, more just future. That was 30 years ago!!!! Picard manages that same philosophical self-reflection but of our modern western world in 2020. Some things are better, many things are worse. That is simply our reality and if holding a mirror to ourselves makes fans upset, then you have been incredibly self-deluded. What is so absolutely fantastic about Picard is how the creators and Patrick Stewart have been able to integrate elements of TNG into a novel and updated world of Star Trek and the character of Picard himself, who is not the same Captain we watched and grew to love, but an Admiral 30-years his senior at the twilight of his life and career. We should all be so lucky. Please do not listen or allow any of the silly reviews on this website to bias you. Give Picard a chance. Do not go in expecting TNG. Expect something new, something older, something different, something engaging, a show that not only holds a mirror to modern times through a TNG-colored lens, but to you yourself; an older, more experienced you, one that grew up watching and loving TNG.",

Not wild myself about it but I'm definitely in for the ride.Anyway, a new series SHOULD be different. Review it on its own, try to avoid comparisons. As for me, I do feel it's missing some element of grandeur. Also, the Romulans were never that exciting to me. I was hoping for the Borg to be the main antagonists.At least give us something about them. Voyager's return should've made waves and scared the Federation. That the federation has shifted in its outlook and philosophy is fine by me (stuff changes guys!) but I'd loved to have seen that connected to the fear of the Borg or something more concrete. We still, I think, haven't gotten the actual reason they argued against saving the Romulans. The Borg may still show up considering the cube. Also, Seven is one of the most amazing characters in Star Trek and I would've loved to see her back properly And tightly tied to the story and not just as a cameo. We'll see.Not wild about the casting of the daughter. There are surely many more interesting actors that could've given that character some real weight.Otherwise, I can't complain. I'd rather have a decent ST-series than nothing at all. These 1/10-reviewers apparently do not think so and are happy to go without. I guess fine by me as long as they keep it coming for those that enjoy it even if there is room for improvement.Give it a go and watch it. And judge it more after the first season.",

Picard does an amazing job of giving Patrick Stewart the same kind of latitude to explore the character and make the same powerful Picard-esque soliloquies and speeches TNG fans came to love as part of his character.\nBecoming involved with Dahj immediately ignites a flame within Picard that very quickly re-ignites the spark we have all come to know and love from the good captain.

I still don't care about most characters, I also think it is probably NOT worth watching to the end of the 10 promised episodes. BUT: we have yet to see all the characters and Riker is going to show up in episode 7. If nothing else, my decade long loyalty to the Star Trek universe keeps me watching. Loyalty can go very very far. I just hope I won't be the lemming that gets lured into the abyss of a terrible show (which is what it is now) and wastes precious hour after hour.\nWil Wheaton's review room after the show had Jeri Ryan as a guest. She is just such a great person and I hope they will use her positivity and sense of humor in her character. My feeling is STP just requires more humor and fun and finally people may tune in with interest. I read some of the shills (defending the show here on this board) that Star Trek of the past wasn't all that positive either. That it surely created nightmares in children after some episodes. And I admit remembering Picard getting tortured (how many lights were there?) - yet the boundaries were always very well defined. It was and always should be a family show folks can watch at home together. That the FCC doesn't apply to a streaming show is no excuse for uncalled gore as I hated seeing in episode 5.\nIn my opinion the show better steps up to the true nature of the franchise now. I am not alone in my power of possibly canceling my CBS All Access subscription. Star Trek Discovery managed to somewhat redeem itself with those last two episodes of the 2nd season. Finally, thanks to the lead Michael.My point: I won't give Jean-Luc that much time in Star Trek Picard.",

I'm very much looking forward to season 2.Unfortunately, it seems that the self appointed 'guardians of 'true' star trek' are once again out in force; finding every fault possible In the show because it didnt match whatever head cannon they expected to see.Picard has room for improvement yes; but the guardians always seem to forget that TNG, DS9, VOY & ENT all had a dodgy first couple of seasons too.\"Boldly sitting where no one has sat before\" was a common criticism of DS9. \"Lost (The magic)\" was a chief criticism of early seasons of VOY...and the beloved TNG only found it's best seasons when Gene Roddenberry released his girp on the wheel enough to allow some conflict driven storytelling.Moving from the utopian society that was Roddenberrys vision, to a more fractured and flawed federation seems to be a common theme for complaint...Except for there is nothing new there, it's just more apparent. The guardians seem to forget Starfleet dropped its morals in TNG's The Measure of a Man. Not to mention undertaking witchunts in The Drumhead, plotting assassinations in ST:VI, declaring Martial Law in DS9: Paradise Lost, breaking treats in The Pegasus, starting a war under false pretenses In The Pale Moonlight and straight up committing genocide with Section 31....but no, Picard is too dark. The collapse of one out of 4 or 5 major stellar powers and an attack on Mars wouldn't destabilise a region now would it?It would; and there is literally nothing surprising about the fact it did.Complaints about the story arc driven series as opposed to the serialized self contain episode format are ridiculous...that's just the way TV works right now.DS9 had self contained episodes but entire seasons of story arcs. The Dominion War was a 3 season story arc FFS. VOY had a 7 season story arc all about getting home...give the hate a rest.",

            "content": "Yes, this is dark and violent and potty mouthed. It is not bright and bouncy and episodic like TNG. If it was a seamless continuation of TNG, everyone would be whining that \"no one in Hollywood has an original thought\". The plot unfolds slowly, but old fans such as myself (I watched reruns of TOS in the 70s), have more patience for exposition. The pure power of Patrick Stewart's presence elevates what very easily could have been a sad attempt by an old guy to grab those last 15 minutes of fame. Maybe both Picard and Stewart ARE grasping for that last hurrah, but if so, I am happy to be along for the ride. When Picard says in the episode \"Broken Pieces\" that he had \"forgotten how much he loved this\" (referring to space travel) you can't help but wonder if it is really Patrick Stewart being reminded how much he loves being Picard. I never forgot and am overjoyed to experience it again.The best of it: 1. Patrick Stewart. If you've still got it, why not use it?\n2. The callbacks. Objects and characters from across the different iterations. It does a nerdy soul good.\n3. The casting. Every character is perfect for their role. The bad guys are loathsome, the good guys are flawed but loveable. The accents are fun and, if not good, at least not laughable or distracting.\n4. The special effects. They are (with notable exceptions) subtle but beautiful and convincing.The worst: 1. The ridiculous amount of time that is wasted. This is an online series. If we don't remember what happened before, we can easily rewatch the previous episode. Save us the extensive recap. Also, the self-indulgent (though lovely) TWO MINUTE LONG title sequence would have been great, shown once, in the pilot. To take up that much story time every episode is narcissistic and annoying.\n2. The difficult to follow back stories and storyline in early episodes. This does get better as it goes along. By \"Broken Pieces\" I feel like I have a good grip on what's going on.\n3. Maybe I'm old but walking around F-bombing may be cute when you're 20 but for educated, civilized people in their 50s, 60s, 80s to be casually effing in normal conversation just sounds contrived and unnecessary.\n4. The level of graphic violence in that one episode was excessive and very un-Trek-like and I hope it is not repeated.7/10- I recommend for all who are longtime fans and can \"get\" the callbacks. Very young and/or non-fans may find it too slow and too hard to follow.",

The series starts smoothly, to intensify as it unfolds its full capacity for seduction.

You see we all grew up thinking the BORG is the greatest threat of all living things, then this TV series made us hate the Romulans even more because they started hating our favorite character's daughter. We couldn't have that so we gave this a one star review as revenge to the Romulans.... That doesn't make any sense at all? We are dealing with emotionally unstable adolescents 50 year old children that get emotional if the script gets twisted on them too much.Like I said let the script grow on you. Their is something out their way worst than the Borg. The Tal Shiar's call them \" The Admonition\" Well whatever they are they seem to be the destroyer of all life and they are unreasonable. Possibly they may live in peace somewhere on a planet without those crazy tentacle things and that is where my questions comes.Will the next few seasons be about Pickard as a Synth traveling like NEO from the MATRIX!

But these two are poorly written, poorly costumed, and poorly acted. There is nothing whatsoever about them that's not pedestrian.This show might have succeeded with better villains. As it stands, I'm stuck on episode 6 with no desire to watch any more. It's tedious. The only reason this gets 6 stars is because of Patrick Stewart. Santiago Cabrera is also fun, and there are two Romulan assistants to Picard who are engaging enough in the first few episodes.Other than that, everything about this show is juvenile, and not good juvenile, either.

            "content": "So many fans wanted to see a show about the Federation rebuilding itself after the Dominion War and rediscovering its moral and cultural center, and exploring the struggles of reforging its alliances.. Instead we got a show that further attacks the heart and soul of the franchise. Rather unfortunate, honestly.Picard is a show that, rather than reviving Star Trek and breathing fresh air into an old idea, takes it further down the path of dystopian science fiction, focusing on tired subject matter and cheap action to drive it forward rather than focusing on providing good story telling, interesting characters, and deep exploration of the world around them.STP is a very flawed show that had all the potential in the world, but didn't apparently have the talent and vision behind the scenes to make it work. The tone is all over the place. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. And the plot is pretty much recycled from any of the many other shows about secret organizations and terrorism that have been made in the last couple decades. They had a whole universe to explore, an endless number of good choices that could have been made, and they chose to focused on interpersonal drama, terrorism, and secret plots. So very boring and unoriginal.The camera work can get pretty bad, too, as can the acting and dialogue. Half the time it feels like they are trying to force a response from the audience that the scene isn't naturally providing. I simple conversation with overly dramatic music, for example. Or a scene with odd camera work that doesn't feel right.Picard has its redeeming moments, don't get me wrong, but they seem few and far between. Mostly it's a pretty juvenile show. Patrick Stewart often feels out of place in this off-kilter version of the Star Trek universe they have created, and unnecessary to the story. Certain scenes they have chosen to include are downright cringe worthy, in fact.Of all the directions they could have taken the franchise this seems like one of the worst, and it is unfortunate. I can watch the older shows time and again, yet found myself struggling to get through this show even once. It is just so unoriginal. So many other shows have explored these subjects and told this story, and done it better. Star Trek deserves better than this.I very reluctantly feel obligated to give this show the score it deserves 5/10. Passive entertainment with few memorable moments and a lot of creative issues.",

            "content": "If you enjoy \"Next Generation,\" like me, then you're probably happy about the new show, \"Picard,\" but there are some significant stylistic differences between this and the older show which have strengths and weaknesses.In contrast to \"The Next Generation,\" the first season of \"Picard\" is pretty much all business with its single overarching plot line that spans the entire first 10 episodes, a continuation of what happened at the end of \"The Next Generation\" and gone are the lighter standalone and two or three part stories found in the earlier seasons of the earlier show. In fact, \"Picard\" lacks that lightheartedness which was such an important part of \"The Next Generation's\" draw, instead diving straight into the heaviest story available. The story used for the first season of \"Picard\" is a continuation of the most serious story from Picard's past. It does make the most convincing case for the return of Picard from retirement and back onto your screen, but if you were ready, by the end of \"Next Generation,\" to move on from that story and see something else, then the first season of \"Picard\" might well seem a little grueling to sit through.That said, as someone who was indeed ready to see what happened in the last season of \"The Next Generation\" become a smaller detail about Picard, I have to admit that, generally speaking, the creative team behind \"Picard\" did a pretty good job with it. So, it was less grueling than I anticipated even though I did wish to move on already and maybe even have the occasional fun little short story arch like on the older show.Notwithstanding, to me, the first season of \"Picard\" started out much more compelling than it ended and I feel that I have to acknowledge that although \"Picard's\" writers took on the most convincing case for Picard's return, they ultimately didn't make it into the best story. Maybe I felt that way because the story which they continued from the end of \"The Next Generation\" was one of my least favorite stories from that show, albeit the most serious, but I also think that \"Picard's\" supporting characters were sometimes much weaker than those on \"The Next Generation\" and the reason for that could be that instead of doing shorter, more playful plots that allow us to learn about and bond with the characters, \"Picard's\" first season took a path that left no time for anything of that style.",

            "content": "I'm a bit shocked that ST:P was rated so lowly by so many...and in a strongly disparaging way...but without many specifics to complain about. OK: Let's start with the basics. Acting quality. Who were the weak actors in this series? Anyone blithely out of character? Didn't think so. Plot lines. Boring plots? No intrigue? Deals with unimportant issues? Nope. Too hip, modern, aka cursing. It's not up to the fracking level but was the cussing over the top or way out of line or inappropriately used to emphasize a point? I didn't think so. Wokeness. Yup: Plenty of woke topics and woke actions. Gosh, can we discuss inter-species / inter-racial / inter-sexual situations on ST, ST:TNG, ST:V, ST-DS9, etc? Should ST stay away from topics like AI self-determination, immigration status and treatment, sexuality, treatment of aliens? That wouldn't be in keeping with ST's history. This is still well-worn territory for ST.Is it bad the feel of ST:P's two seasons were based on all-or-nothing outcomes like TNG: All Good Things (certainly), or V: End Game? In particular in the 2nd Season, the entire plot revolved around Picard but you didn't know exactly what needed to happen / be proven. It wasn't all pretty or pat. Were things too Woke at the end? Did too many get their hearts broken by a foreshowed but not ST:V consistent change of sexual preferences by one of the main characters? Is that the basis for the crying and complaining? Regardless, anyone claiming the series didn't involve Picard is missing a positronic synapse or two.What would Roddenberry complain about here? I saw lots of pretty women in some amazing outfits so check! Seriously.ST:P. Anytime I can get to see this acting quality I'm fully in. I didn't think the modern touches were way out of line (it's not like the entire series was set in the 1400s). Too much mayhem? Too much blood? Not in a grossly gratuitous fashion. So much complaining without clear target locks.",

I'm just trying to make the point, though I'm pretty fanatical about the original series, I've never watched anything outside TNG, and the two JJ Abrams Star Trek movies other than the first two years ago, so far from a fanatic, or maybe even a fan. I like my sci-fi more in The Foundation or Dune sort of way, or grand space opera a la E. E. \"Doc\" Smith.But this pilot really grabbed me somewhere inside and yanked hard, I was taken out of my little life with it's little problems that can seem oh-so big sometimes, just like on those Saturday morning so long ago.

This show, along with Discovery, is literally in existence in an attempt to completely destroy Star Trek. The writing is horrid beyond belief. Stupendously moronic. There is no way such a terrible show could possibly have a, current, 7.5 rating. Literally, everyone hates this show. Everyone, that is, but the ideological woke who are the brainwashed pions programmed to drool at the ring of their master's bell. Such things only exist as an affront to all cultural goodness in order to destroy every shred of it and put in its place ideological cultish propaganda. Oh, it has quite a financial budget behind it all and the usual visual quality that such money can bring to the screen, but the financial backers of such projects are not interested in creating a profit generating endeavour, no, these people already have all the money in the world and their desires are purely power driven; they look to take control and power of people through shaping societal morals, beliefs, values, and removing freedom in every way, shape, and form including, and perhaps most importantly, the various forms of entertainment which give us such pleasure as music, movies, plays, literature, comedy, dance, celebrations, sports, and so forth. Genuinely good popular TV shows, movies, and music are quite rare these days, and there's a reason for that, it's because all of our forms of entertainment are under assault, not to mention the very freedoms which we like to think are inalienable are being removed at the same time. Picard has the worst viewer ratings of all time; almost nobody is watching this show, yet, they pour millions and millions of dollars into it. The first season was so terrible and there were so few viewers I thought surely this show will be cancelled before the fist season is over, yet, no, they will make a third season. Why? Why would they make a third season of a show that is literally losing them money?? That's right, as I said, they don't care about the money, they only care about destruction. \"Star Trek: Picard lost 44% of its initial audience over the course of the show's first 10 episode season\". \"Star Trek: Picard viewership has plummeted over half a million viewers in Canada in just five episodes\". By the end of season two, there are hardly any people watching. The only people I know who are watching are those who do so in order to report back to fans on social media how it continues to dig down into the darkest depths of hatred of everything good. Don't watch this show or any other ST show beyond DS9. Go back and watch the old ones again, they're great. Or check out The Orville, season one is good, and season two is much better as they iron the show out -- made by people who hate what they're doing to ST who said, 'let's do our own show'.",

There is also a moment about 21 minutes into Season 2 episode 10 which makes Picard a pre/sequel to the original Trek.And the latter connections to pre-Discovery Star Trek show one of the primary reasons Picard is so good, and infinitely better than the new Paramount+ \"Star Trek\" series: it appreciates and extends that universe. Picard is canon, not in a limiting, overly-reverential way, but in a fun, clever, and respectful way. Discovery cannibalizes Star Trek and uses it as fodder for subpar, insultingly non-cannon storytelling. Picard loves the true Star Trek universe. Discovery is just a cynical attempt to cash it on it.Patrick Stewart was intimately involved with the development of the storyline, and decisions about what this show would and would not be. It is obvious that everyone involved in the production has a great deal of respect for the material and the Star Trek universe. You can believe everything I've said above and ignore those reviewers claiming that Star Trek Picard is not canon. It is absolutely rooted in the Star Trek canon. I also suggest you ignore those who are giving the show low reviews because of its politics. One reviewer even claims the show is anti-white, which is patently absurd given that the lead character is, um, white.I wish I could describe the elements which make this show even more wonderful than it might have otherwise been, but they would be significant spoilers. Suffice it to say there were several moments when I exclaimed out loud, \" Holy sh**!\" I had completely avoided reading anything about Star Trek Picard so as to avoid spoilers, and so if you have managed to do so you are in for some wonderful surprises if you are a fan of Next Generation and Voyager.",

Meanwhile, they throw in so many flashback scenes, further slowing the pace and dragging out the story to a point you really wish they'd finally get it over with already.The writing of the whole series is so unexciting, you don't even feel the need to watch the next episode after the previous one ended.

            "content": "Love:\nWe get a look into the future of the original timeline(I had waited nearly 20 years for this.) Since it's a more compact and focused show, nearly all of the universe remains unexplored. However, bits and pieces are sprinkled about containing callbacks and lore that will speak to the nerdiest of Star Trek fans.Hate:\nThe universe is presented in a dumbed down and modern Hollywood sort of way. I don't mind that it's rated mature, but the maturity of the writing makes it seem less mature. You don't need to kill off important characters to capture the hearts of the audience. In fact, meaningless deaths do the complete opposite of that. Space fights sometimes capture the essence of tension, but lose it by the finale. Especially when it makes sense, sometimes less is more.Love:\nMost of the acting from the main cast and even extended cast is very well done. Picard himself is of course phenomenal, as are the TNG cameos. Even his bridge crew is very well assembled and complimentary. In the first half of the season, the time is taken to establish all key players. You can tell time went into casting and it shows.Hate:\nI can understand that a limited run of 10 episodes held back character development half way through, but you have to take that into consideration when that is what you have to work with. Craft a narrative that works within what you're trying to achieve and make sure to give your characters time to justify the actions they take, instead of just moving on to the next plot thread.Love:\nScenes with Data, Riker, and Troi are written with the utmost care. The magic returns, and we are swept up(briefly) in a glorious parallel universe where Rick Berman-led Trek continued for another 18 years. I know(Berman has his faults,) but he mostly carried on the Roddenberry legacy, and brought a quality and budget to Star Trek that hadn't been seen before. The season ends in a promising way, in that it's like we're ready to boldly explore the galaxy like a proper Star Trek series.Hate: The show proper and central plot never reaches the heights of the original cast cameos. In actuality it looks worse for it, especially when the all the time needed is taken to develop these scenes. I can assure you that the same care and time management wasn't applied to most of the main plot (and side stories with new cast members.) Sloppy writing aside, nearly every opportunity to capitalize on a resonant moment was skipped over because we had to rush on to the next thing that was happening. I'm hoping they adopt a more closed episode(bottle episode) format for season 2, so that future storylines are easier to manage(with maybe just a single, more focused season long arc.)-BONUS-\nWinners:\nJean-Luc.\nWill.\nData.\nElnor.\nRios(and his holograms.)\nDahj.\nZhaban and Laris(farmers.)\nRiker's daughter.\nThe title intro and score.\nThe advertising holograms in episode 5.Middling:\nRaffi.\nAgnes.\nTroi.\nNarissa.\nLa Sirena(Rios' ship.)Losers:\nSoji.\nHugh.\nSeven.\nNarek.\nMaddox.\nSoong.\nThat crazy lady who yelled about the destroyer.\nThe rest of Starfleet.\nThe rest of the Romulans.\nThe rest of the Borg.\nThe rest of the Androids.Nitpick of the season:\nStarfleet vessels apparently don't deploy the armor technology that Janeway brought back from the future at the end of Voyager..",

The move away from a crew based utopian \"we can solve everything in 45 minutes or less\" to a more personal exploration of the effects of age, retirement, zeal and a sense of righteousness was welcome, from my point of view. It is a 21st Century Star Trek exploring inner space, not crashing around negotiating treaties and shooting \"bad guys\". Star Trek has always focused on current issues, and a sense of determining our individual place in the universe is high in people's minds today. I have enjoyed the series, look forward to the next and do not subscribe to this naive view of problem resolution that many of the earlier series subscribed to. DS9 remains a favourite, but even many of those episodes now look woefully simplistic. Bring on Season 2 and let's see where it goes.",

            "content": "The series looks to have potential.The main problem I had with this first episode all comes down to one scene...the fight scene in the city where Picard cowers like a scolded dog....this scene acted like the rest of this bustling, modern city completely vanished just in time for the attack. No bystanders, witnesses, video, security, nothing. Just the 2 main characters and the enemy were all that conveniently seemed to exist in the whole world at that moment. If this is the effect they wanted, they could have easily had the altercation occur somewhere more private, not out in the open when moments before there were hundreds of people milling about. The lack of human presence all of a sudden was so jarring and odd that it completely took away from the scene and the first episode as a whole...then to add insult to injury, Picard is magically back in his bed at home. No hospital? No security asking questions? No one at all asking about what happened? No evidence left of a battle or the explosion?With sci-fi, partially suspending belief is to be expected, but what they pulled in that scene....smh.I hope this was a one off occurrence due to an oversight in the storyline that is geared more towards being told in space rather than in a modern earth city, but regardless, it doesn't give me hope in the direction or editing.I'll continue to watch because of the teaser at the end, but if it weren't for adding that, I probably would have called it quits after this first episode.*Side note....I have no problem with strong females kicking , just so long as it isn't jammed down your throat like it was in the new Terminator movie. Seeing Picard run, cower, hide, and look terrified while he let a young woman he just promised seconds before to never leave her, fight and die by herself while he shook and hid did not sit well, and I truly hope this isn't a precedent they've set going forward.",

A real waste of talent considering they've got so many original cast to take part and yet make them all forget about the characters they'd played for so long.

I can only assume these are the same haters that have regularly panned every episode of ST:D.\nI have had to wait until ST:P came out on Blu Ray because I refused to subscribe to Amazon, having already subscribed to Netflix. But it was well worth the wait in my opinion.\nSo what do I think?\nFirst off, it was cleverly written. For those who didn't like the way that Star Fleet has descended into dystopia, I say why not? It would be unrealistic to assume that everything is always sweetness and light with Star Fleet. The system is far from perfect.\nAfter reading the first ST:P novel, subject matter being the evacuation of Romulus, it is easy to understand the events that unfolded in the first episode of the series. From then on, it was quite a wild ride. I liked the appearances of Data, Hugh, Seven, Troi and Riker. It was clever that they weren't just dropped in to garner fan interest, but rather were a vital addition to the story.I am wondering what it was the haters were expecting. I think the days of self contained episodes in a series are long gone.I found ST:P more of a mystery. Picard and crew searching for the answers to many questions. Quite intriguing.The final twist was very surprising and completely unexpected.All in all, I loved the series, but I do have some criticisms. Possibly these have already been pointed out by other critics, but here goes:Firstly, way too much talking and not nearly enough action.\nSecondly, and more importantly, will someone please tell the cast to stop whispering. This was a major critic of ST:D. I hate watching a programme where I have to constantly reach for the remote control to turn the volume up and down because one minute I can't hear what's being said and the next my ears are almost blown by a passing starship.Having said all of this, I'll be excited what happens in series 2.",

The others i dont mind that much. Yeah, like i said that i think theres should be more storyline to tell, more creativesness please, well from the tech they use, from the effect, from the futuristic structure, i think cbs should invest more effect in this drama, so i can defeat all others star trek franchise, please dont be like star trek discovery, they already ruin the franchise.

            "content": "I get some of the criticism. We are at episode 5, and it seems like a small story, instead of a big story. Some of the characters seem like composite tropes, instead of real beings, like the magic Romulan Ninja warrior.I also see a lot of complaints that it is too \"PC\". I suggest that it isn't Star Trek that has changed, but the viewing public. Star Trek, even back to TOS, was inclusive and on the side of peace, trust and cultural relativity. It was 60s sexist, but, by next Generation, it promoted sexual equality.Complaints about this are like people who have been Crosby, Still and Nash fans complaining about a liberal rant in concert. That's the way they always were. It is the audience that has changed, not the messenger.It is also canon in the sense that Star Fleet migrated from a force for good in the universe to an organization of political intrigue. This is consistent with both TNG and Deep Space None (the best written Star Trek, in my opinion).So, the good:It warms me to watch such a courteous and courtly man as JL Picard. In our time, when ruthlessness is considered a virtue, Picard's humanity stands as a testament to the best in humanity.It has space ships, technology and a complex enemy. There are both good and bad Romulans. There is an explanation for behavior.The bad - Too much flare lighting, and wire-fu fighting. The Elnor character is a composite trope of every \"magic ninja\" of absolute honor and loyalty. He is a cartoon.A lot of melodrama. In the best TOS, TNG and DS9, plots were derived from daily routine, not plot driven \"special cases\".Too much plot armor. Too many victories of the few against the many.So, my assessment. So far, I rank it fourth, behind DS9, TOS, and TNG. It is certainly far superior to the disastrous Star Trek Discovery. I hope the 2nd season improves. Please remember how poorly written was the first season of TNG, and pedestrian Denise Crosby and Will Wheaton were as actors, until they migrate to the Data story arc.",

            "content": "Beloved character Jean-Luc Picard, played by the even more beloved actor Patrick Stewart, returns to the small screen nearly 20 years after his last appearance in Star Trek: Nemesis (the only one of the 10 films in the original Star Trek film series that I've never watched). The premise of the series is that 14 years before it begins, Admiral Picard was active in relocating the Romulan people before the star near their home planet went supernova. After synthetic life forms carry out a devastating act of sabotage on the Federation's facilities on Mars, the Federation calls off the relocation project and ban all synthetic life. Angry at these two betrayals, Picard resigns from Starfleet.In the present day a young woman, Dahj (Isia Briones), seeks out Picard's help after realizing that she is an android created from the remains of Picard's friend Data (Brent Spiner) . Romulan spies kill Dahj, but not before Picard learns that she has an identical twin, Soji, working at a Romulan outpost on an abandoned Borg cube called The Artifact.Picard puts together a crew to help find and help Soji. This includes a friend and colleague who helped with Romulan relocation, Raffi (Michelle Hurd), who struggles with substance abuse. Raffi finds a captain with a ship, La Sirena, Chris (Santiago Cabrera) who has a traumatic background in Starfleet. They are joined by Agnes (Alison Pill), a synthetic life expert who is naive about space travel. Along the way they pick up Elnor (Evan Evagora), a samurai-like Romulan who was raised by a sect of warrior nuns to provide protection. To please the fans, familiar characters from the Star Trek franchise make appearances, including former Borg Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan), and Picard's crewmates from Enterprise, Will Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis). Brent Spiner also returns to play Data in dream sequences and Altan Inigo Soong, the son of Data's creator. One of the weird aspects of the show is that Picard not only quit Starfleet, but hasn't kept in touch with any of his friends which is both out of character and used to create artificial tension.In the early episodes, the show moves slowly, setting up Picard's current situation and introducing the new characters. There are elements of mystery and spy thriller with Picard thrust into the role of detective. It was a refreshing change from the fast-paced action for action's sake of Star Trek: Discovery. By the end of episode 3 when we finally see Picard on the bridge of a starship and hear him say \"Engage!,\" it is a cheezy moment for the fans but one that is well-earned. Unfortunately, during the second half of the season the show goes off the rails. All the worst instincts of Discovery for shocking twists are indulged and a lot of drama is forced from the characters making bold choices to raise the stakes that seem irrelevant a few scenes later.For a show called Picard, the title character seems lost in the crowded cast. And yet, we don't really get to know the new characters all that well either. Sometimes they seem to do things that are out of character, but then their characters never seem to be developed well enough to know in the first place. I loved Star Trek: Generation as a kid, but the level of graphic violence and profanity in Picard that makes it \"gritty and dark,\" makes me not want to share it with my kids. There was some promise in Picard, and maybe it will be fulfilled in the upcoming two seasons that are in production, but right now I don't feel compelled at all to want to watch them.",

The majority of the cast they brought back is still in good acting condition (with the exception of picard.. damn, the years haven't been kind to his looks and acting).The story is interesting but so far a bit predictable and it feels like there are a lot of restrictions to dialog lines somewhat (they still throw sears and talk a bit to casual for a star fleet that should live in a complex civilized future that should be way more mature than our current times). Don't get me wrong, Picard S3 is lightyears ahead of S1 and 2, but a few lightdecades in style behind all the good Treks we are used to.To be honest I do not even know why they named the show Picard since he (the former captain) mostly just drags along side the show and everyone else takes most of the spotlight. I do see a potential series with his son Jack Crusher, but the harsh reality is that fans are tired of being hyped about new series when we have no idea what unprofessional director they bring behind them and just make all new atrocities over and over as we have been proven time and time again.Before, we never expected bad performances or a bad story and character developments to such magnitude, because there have always been competent writers and studios in the older treks, but today the Trek world is just a \"platform\" for these extreme people that wish to promote various messages that they \"believe\" everyone should accept (they are the true borg).All I can say is this: we have been lucky to get this Season 3 to be somewhat decent, but I have little hope for this getting better in future series or even repeating this standard level.A 6/10 is a gentle pat on the back, but this is far from being satisfactory, since previous Treks (prior to 2010) proved they could go way beyond our expectations and really surprise us with amazing feelings that rarely required constant action to keep us interested!",

I am eagerly awaiting season 2.I found the gradual introduction of the STNG characters heartwarming after so long, the impression the show made on me at the time was profound and to see some of my favourite characters return after more than 30 years was quite emotive. Patrick Stewart, now in his late 70's does not try to pretend in character that so much time has passed but sticks to the essence of what he was in the original series and later movies. It was awesome to see the return of Jonathan Frakes ,Marina Sirtis and Brent Spiner again. Jeri Ryan as 7 of 9 is as stunning to look at today as she was in Voyager, and it was great to see the return of Jonathan Del Arco as Hugh to help in the context of the Borg part of the plot.I thought also the introduction of new characters fit well, Commodore Oh was as driven and determined as you would expect from a radical Vulcan/Romulan hybrid, Rios plays a Han Solo type character while his dark and troubled side is developed along side martial artist Elnor, a strong grudge holding but talented detective Raffi and the essential medical doctor Jurati. With the exception of the Narek character, who came across as far too millennially human, I thought all characters were developed beautifully.I respectfully with the naysayers here, who say this is not Star trek, that it is a dystopia opposite of Star Trek. Instead, I thought Star Trek Picard brought back the essence of STNG characters that are now taking on a world 30 years advanced. The characters stick to their morals and beliefs of STNG. I see comparisons to Discovery but Picard and Discovery to me are diametrically opposed. In fact it is Discovery I found deviating from the Star Trek Vision, not Picard. Discovery tried too hard to adjust to the modern world and appeal to acceptance of race, religion, culture and sexuality. It is Discovery that would make Gene Roddenberry turn in his grave, not Picard.I am sincerely looking forward to the introduction of Worf, Geordi , Beverly Crusher and anyone else that can bring back the memories.Cannot wait for more seasons.",

Perhaps you didn't notice that ST always reflected what was happening at the time it was made, and so it should. It was also always inconsistent, had bad writers/sets/effects/costumes/makeup, weak stories, weak characters, was technically inaccurate, bad acting (I'm looking at you, Shatner...).And yet, Patrick Stewart likes it. He wouldn't have agreed to it otherwise. He even had two conditions before agreeing to consider it - no uniform, no Enterprise, so that was going to annoy the 'We want more TNG\" crowd from the outset. This was a calculated and deliberate move. The rest of the cast that return from TNG and Voyager like it, or they wouldn't be in it. Perhaps they know something you don't? Perhaps they are more mature, open-minded, adventurous and creative than you can imagine. I like it, and I grew up with ST in all its forms. It was always changing, always different, and always had people moaning about it. At least that has stayed the same. And the people who like it, appreciate it for what it is and have grown up along the way are also there, and that, fortunately, is also the same. And that's why there are all these high ratings for it.Here's another one.NB: A lens flare is a real thing. When you point a lens at a bright light, it happens. They can be beautiful.

The fact that Picard focused almost immediately in on a very plain necklace to unlock key elements of the story, commenting that it was very unusual when it really wasn't. Also the fact they completely threw out the direction the federation was going with vying for peace and cooperation with the romulans during the Nemesis movie.So overall liked the beginning, but am hoping for more continuity and attention to cannon.",

Also, I guess I was happy to see Picard again.Since then though this show has gone down hill so fast it is unbelievable. The next 2 episode are really boring and nothing of consequence happened. And in retrospect you should be grateful for that. Because once stuff does happen it is the worst you'll ever see.Episode 5 was so dreadful that even hardcore NuTrek fans weren't able to defend it anymore. This series has nothing to do with Star Trek anymore. Neither visually, nor the characters, nor the story and most certainly not the writing.This show is \"Star Trek\" in name only. Star Trek is dead and Alex Kurtzman will not stop dragging its corpse around in hopes of making a quick buck. There are 8 series planned for the near future and all of them will be a dark gloomy dystopia so much removed from Star Trek they might as well have made a random scifi show and just slapped the name on it - which is what they did basically anyway.",

There was so many small things linking Picard back to STTNG, and the last movie. It had a lot of great action. Picard acted his age. He runs out of breath going up stairs. He's ducking for cover and not fighting himself. The vault was interesting, something to pause on and take a second look at what you may have missed the first time. Having a couple Romulan's showing emotion unlike a Vulcan. It's a new perspective.Is it perfect, no. But it's a strong showing for a first episode. Generally fir Star Trek, the first season is a little ruff. I think they got over this hump pretty quickly because everyone knows who Picard is. Same with others like Data who makes a appearance in a Dream of Picard along with Enterprise-D. It was just a amazing scene I didn't think we would ever see again, let alone in 2020.It was a much better start for Picard over Discovery. Discovery's first year wasn't the best, but the second season was actually pretty good and also had a number of things linking it to the original series. So I can't wait for the 3rd season. Until then, I'm going to Enjoy Picard and hope it only gets even better. I still think they are greatly limiting it's viewers not having it on their normal channel in Prime Time.",

I am still giving the series an overall rating of a 7 out of 10. It's Trek for the 2020's.HIGHS\nDelightful to see members of the original TNG cast being permitted to age gracefully. The back story for Troi was outstanding. It was great to see Hugh, too. Bringing Voyagers Seven into the plot was pure genius, and again, allowing the character to mature was superbly done. The show runners for these latest incarnations of the Trek universe did an okay job of making the season a story arc. The episodes built off each other. The Romulan baddies were great, and the homage to the TOS Romulan atmospheric music was GREAT!MEDIUMS\nThe series was amply cast. Jonathan Frakes was acting like Jonathan Frakes in a television show - coming off as somewhat wooden; forced. Also, the use of flashbacks was starting to get a bit annoying. Would have been nice if they could have just told those parts of the story up front.LOWS\nAfter watching it two times through, I was still unable to connect several dots and had to just \"go with the plot\". Absolutely did NOT like the finale with Picard's conscious being placed inside an android - I thought that was a complete let down. This is set in what? The 24th Century? They end up on a planet of androids and positronic brains more advanced than what was in Data. You mean they could not fix Picards brain? And then that whole \"We didn't give you ANY upgrades!\" That made no sense, unless that is to be a plot device in Season 2.SEASON TWO\nPicard has unresolved mommy issues? Really? I am so annoy with this plot line. He's a God Damned Star Fleet Captain / Admiral! He had a F-ing (half) Betazoid SHIPS COUNCILOR onboard his FLAGSHIP, was ASSIMILATED BY THE BORG and RESCUED and not ONCE in ANY of his Command evaluations or time with Troi did ANY OF THAT SURFACE?

That aircraft is so old and is now retired but I DEFY you not to be impressed and think it looks like something from the future!!!???So if you're new to the Star Trek Universe then Welcome.

It had its moments but the plot was a bit confusing.Season 2 was essentially an inferior mix of the films First Contact and The Voyage Home.It was odd seeing certain actors in the wrong time-line. For example, the doctor who created Data and Picard's Romulan companion from the future, who then appears as the Watcher in the 21st century. It made the story feel even more confusing. I summised that the Dr was an ancestor of the Dr who created Data. I'm not exactly sure why the Watcher was the same person from Picard's own timeline.However, this show had some good points. Q has always been an enjoyable character to watch. His mischievous antics are entertaining. I must say that his last scene with Picard was the highlight of both seasons. They really pulled that off. To have that lovely moment between 2 classic characters, who have been long-time adversaries, was satisfying. It's the only time though-out all these modern Trek shows where I've actually felt something for the characters. Mostly, I just want them all to fly into a supernova - particularly in Discovery.Picard and Q should have been all the sentiment we needed, but then an unnecessary Seven of Nine romantic interest appears out of nowhere and was completely unearned. Modern Trek writers and their agenda. It never ceases. Then you have Rios staying behind in the past, which was the obvious outcome from the early episodes and also utter nonsense. So, a fair amount of the character arcs were mediocre and unnececarily trying to be emotional, but it's still worth watching for Q and Picard's swansong.Overall it's a decent show - I don't think I could say it's a good show - but I'm still hoping for improvement in a third season.",

Afterward, we see him as a young boy with a Basque beret. To complete the caricature, he lacks a baguette under his arm. The French don't wear Basque berets since the 30s, but the stupid scriptwriters had to find pictures on the internet to see what a Frenchman looks like. It's slow, it doesn't move at a sci-fi pace. We left the series in the hands of a failed artist who thinks he's doing melodrama? Twenty minutes have passed since the beginning. And to say what: NOTHING. Nothing but nonsensical chatter that ends with a parody of a speech at the Academy... Episode 2 has more movement and seems to go somewhere to understand that Q, with an incomprehensible speech, enters the scene to give a lesson to Picard! Why him? We don't know because Q's speech is gibberish... Episode 3 is even more confusing. The bad writers seem to discover the upcoming scenes on the fly. Even Picard and 7-of-9 don't know where they are any more. Classic conflict situations with the team doubting while Picard seems defeated and accepting a fate in the hands of the Borg Queen. They are led by the Queen to 2024. Why? You don't want to ask those kinds of questions, apparently. The writers are improvising with patches from other Star Trek series. One wonders if the script is written by AI putting together cuts from old episodes? Before, this kind of story was done for one episode, while here the background is diluted over several episodes.

The next few episodes after this weeks third will start to get more interesting an entertaining. The plot so far is extremely interesting because of the many ways it can go, especially the building redemption arc for the events on mars; understanding the story behind the sisters and their \"mythology\"; and figuring out how the sisters relate to Data. So many references to previous series to maintain cannon, and people still complain. Let the plot develop before leaving such a harsh opinion.Finally, cons for the series so far. I'm not a huge fan of some of the awkward editing between scenes. The transitions just seem so abrupt and unexpected. I'm also not impressed at how slowly canonical characters are being introduced. I thought I would have at least seen Seven of Nine by now.",

            "content": "I just want to say this about the show. I honestly can say I hate Picard as a character now. And one reason is that the writers have literally desecrated and erased the entire French culture from the STU. Just pause to imagine, in the future an African Federation captain grew up in Nigeria. In his flashback scenes he acted like a kid from China. Him and his parents spoke Chinese and did Chinese things. Apparently, the country in Africa had canonically no African heritage in the future. Think about that outrage that would cause.As a character we grew up with Picard, learned about his various traits and mannerisms, now they were a bit odd, or not very Frenchy per se but even though he had a British accent we can all agree French accents are very...theatrical and humorous to listen too. Pepe Le Pew and all that. So we can let it slide.However in this show they cannot let you forget how they excised ALL of France from Picard's life until you can utterly forget where he comes from. He may as well have grown up in a British boarding school. His mom and dad have British accents, he looks like the lead singer of Coldplay as a kid. Picard does not eat French food, have French interests and they make no attempt to even celebrate his background. Even though he lives in the 25th century, Picard as a kid has no computer games, or sports. What would have been fun is if he was wearing French Football team national clothes. And his favorite sport was soccer. His dad had a thick French accent and his mom was British. Given that he hated his dad and was a big time mommas boy, he chose British accent. That is a fun plot right?But they tried in no way to portray that and therefore they are saying Britain took over France in the future and the entire French culture disappeared. I know there are a lot of reasons to dislike this show but I just wanted to mention something after the latest episode that highly bothered me about Picards story.",

Gone is the ambition to make the world(s) a better place.

I, however, managed to catch up Star Trek: The Next Generation when it made its way to the terrestrial TV channels. I remember the series not as much of an action-packed series but more of a cerebral one discussing life issues. I never did follow the ensuing Trek series or the silver screen productions. So, to me, Picard is only Starfleet Captain that I know.More than a decade after his last mission and his unceremonious departure from USS Enterprise, Admiral Picard has to go to back to space. He does this clandestinely against the orders of the authorities, with a ragtag assembly of crew and space ship. In his previous mission, Data had caused the destruction of Mars. Because of that, androids, or synthetics as they were known in 2399, were banned. Picard had resigned in protest.Enjoying his retirement in his chateau, Picard comes to know of a girl who may be the 'daughter' of Data as she was developed from Data's positronic brain. She is, unfortunately, assassinated. There is a vast conspiracy, from the Romulans mainly, as they had to bear the bunt of USS Enterprise's destruction of Mars earlier, to wipe out all synthetics. Picard's mission is to find Data's other twin daughter and save all synthetics from annihilation.Keeping with the characters who are all senior citizens trying to save the Universe, the series progresses slowly with a lot of dialogue and intellectual discourse.The last two episodes are the most exciting part of the season for an occasional Star Trek fan like me. Perhaps at that time, earthlings have eradicated poverty and abated their fixation for material wealth, their discussions seem to focus more philosophical issues. People still try to create schisms and have pre-conceived ideas about 'the other' even though he never had the chance to meet or interact with them. They fail to realise that all these animosities will eventually cause self-destruction. Is it necessary for species to kill each other to survive? Is sacrifice the highest form of deed one can offer to a fellow kind? Is there logic in sacrifice or is life too precious to be wasted?\nThe finale discusses death and purpose of life. The past is already written. The future is for us to pen. How is the narration going to be? It is fear and suspicion of the unknown, which is the destroyer. Is believing that openness may allay these problems naive? To say that we do not have the choice is indicative of our lack of imagination. We are beyond all these. Our collective intellectual should be able to overcome adversities.Being alive is not a licence to indulge. It is not a choice, but it comes with specific responsibilities. It is the price we have to pay for building consciousness. It expects us to think for the future. Mortality gives meaning to our time on Earth. Developing peace, friendship and love help us to appreciate the gift of life. At the end of our lifetime, we are left with only memories.",

The music cues too are just a delight.And when you see Riker and he gives Enterprise commands like \"Shields up, sensors to maximum\" its just the band back together pure Blues Brothers style.If you've been craving to find out how Jean Luc continued his adventures or to see how Starfleet is really then this show is for you.Why only 9?

This is yet another Trek series that deals with time travel, it's just crazy that the writers couldn't be creative enough to write a better story without having to effect the time line. This season is directed by Lea Thompson, Joe Melendez and of course Jonathan Frakes. The same cast returns but I fell out of love from subpar performances by Michele Hurd and Jeri Ryan, they didn't belong and hopefully are written off.

It also adds a mystery that fits Picard and TNG perfectly, and it all comes together in a way that is pleasing to both older TNG fans and new audiences.The SFX look stunning and the production has a genuine Star Trek feel to it.

It seem right off to be copying a fan made Star Trek: Renegades. Because everything was being done without Star Fleet's knowledge or approval. I didn't like most of the new cast apart from the familar TNG as it seem like the creators of the show wanted to cut corners by trying to go cheap. The variety of characters felt sort of like Guardians of the Galaxy being brought together. Only each had their own inner turmoil going on, along with problems that couldn't be fixed or resolved. It seemed everyone else couldn't keep their head on straight except Picard. The only new character I liked and found interesting is Soji. Picard having amazing profound impact on others was something too. I didn't like Hugh dying, as he was one of those good characters that shouldn't have been killed off. Other than Soji and of the others I wouldn't of mind being gone. There are three things I felt right off that is wrong, especially when it comes to that far in the future. Picard and Riker's homes looked too much like impoverished living of the 1920's or 30's. Nothing futuristic by that. By then old fashion book pages won't be made out of paper but some kind of durable, lasting plastic. The aging disease will be gone and people will look like in their 20's or 30's and live longer than 100. There was no need for swearing and is unlike Star Trek to have such. We're talking about a better more promising future for humanity, where sloppy, uneducated talking like that will no longer exist or matter. It will be gone like some passing fad. The damaging thing about putting swear words in a show is it kills the means for most to not want to see it over and over. It's like mixing trash into quality viewing.",

Yes, Star Trek stories often have happy endings, and often (as in Season 2 of Picard) are more unexpected than you'd think.There's nothing wrong with that. In today's world we could all use some happy endings.Nitpick if you must, but you can't ruin this for me, and hopefully not for anyone deciding if they'll watch or not.I hope this series continues as long as it can, and will be followed by another then another then another.

If only the \"Voyager\" hologram Doctor could find away aboard this ship too even though there is already one aboard this ship. Try and try again for a bit of humour. There is enough edge for me.So personally I think this series is leaps and bounds better than the \"Discovery\" series. It's a kind of old and new; a sort of family structure, if you can imagine Picard almost as a Grandad figure. That does work here, plus the avoidance of mean spirited characters. You know, the sort of \"I've got loads of personal problems so I don't really want to be here\" characters that were all over the \"Discovery\" series.It's much more difficult for a new series to find its way these days. There isn't scope for a massive build up and lots warm up episodes to get to know and love the characters.

It feels fresh yet has the familiarity of a comfort blanket.The sound is the problem.\nAnd it needs to be fixed for season 2.\nI watch all kinds of TV shows, some of which have action and loud sound. When watching a TV series or a movie I generally don't have to lower the sound for the action scenes and then turn it back up to hear the dialogue. Normally I wouldn't even notice if I need to change the sound occasionally while watching a show. But in season 1 of Picard I am having to change it Every Single Time it goes from dialogue to action and vice versa, so that it has become a full time job. I've grown increasingly unhappy so much so that I've hit the pause button in the middle of the penultimate episode of season 1 to write this review.",

No longer a shining example to the galaxy they're a petty political POS organization. Something you'd expect in our day, not hundreds of years in the future in the age of a more enlightened humankind.For season 2 I was very excited to see Q coming back. But what a mess it turned out to be. They crapped all over The Next Generation series. It made little sense, and claiming the Borg queen was the way she is because she's just lonely? Sheesh... Did these writers even watch Star Trek? I doubt it. I think they're of the crowd who is all proud they never watched it so they wouldn't be influenced and instead put their own personal spin on it, and in doing so left a big streaming pile all over Star Trek fans of the 90s. I would classify it as non-canonical junk. Guinan's story line doesn't jive either, they completely messed up. They rewrote her backstory and changed her from the kind and wise person she used to be to an angry racial activist.Of special special note regarding the series as a whole, Allison Pill just sucks so incredibly much. She and Michelle Hurd really dragged down the show.Maybe I'm generous in my rating because I'm a fan of Patrick Stewart's Star Trek, which this struggles to be related to. I would never pay Paramount to watch the show but I saw it for free so that tempers my criticism. At least it's better than that travesty of a show called Discovery. To hell with that mess!If the current trajectory is any indication, season 3 will have everyone hugging the Borg while singing Kumbaya...",

One episodic character from the classics had more personality and involvement in the plot that these people had in 10 episodes.Then there's the Borg, so much hype in the trailer, so much hype to see them, only for it to lead nowhere, their presense was nothing more than a taxi service.Whoever owns the Star Trek rights now has a hard time understanding what made it great. Pro tip: it wasn't lazers and sword fights. It was the characters and their relations, their dialogue, their rapport.Also what's up with all the damn lens flares? When did actual cinematic vision go into the dumpster and it was decided that blasting a light as high as you can in the middle of an indoor scene adds any value? Just stop. It's annoying.Since we're all in lockdown/isolation/quarantine, I guess you can watch it, after you're done watching all the older Star Trek series, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, all the Stargate series(including Universe, it gets better before they cancel it), and Duck Dodgers.

            "content": "After having watched Star Trek Discovery I was expecting more of the same style over substance, over-emoting and unbelievable plot developments. I enjoyed STD to an extent but its very different from the star trek that has gone before and suffers for it. After watching the first two episodes of Picard my suspicions seemed confirmed. A few things were puzzling:Why are Romulans speaking with different earth accents? I believe I heard Irish, English and Australian? Bizarre.Why on earth would the Federation abandon Romulus to the supernova? The Federation are humanitarians even to their enemies. But not this time for some reason.Also, why would the Romulans even need help to get everyone off the planet? They are an advanced space faring race. Surely this was doable even in a short amount of time.Anyway, then the Dahj storyline comes into play. Suddenly she appears out of nowhere at Picard's side at his vineyard without a hint of difficulty. So far, so tediously convenient and easy.But then things start to get more interesting when the new crew is assembled. Raffi, Cristob\u00e1l and Elnor are interesting characters and great actors, particularly Michelle Hurd who plays Raffi. Soji is a little one dimensional. Perhaps its the limitation of the actor. Its the characters and the relationships between them that really make the show.Nice to see 7 of 9 back though she seemed too much of a stereotypical hardened anti-hero figure in this. Much different to the stern, matter of fact ex-Borg we are used to in Voyager. I missed seeing the Borg in Annika. This new Annika was a bit too human for me unfortunately, more broken. I always admired 7's strength of character, intelligence and general bad-assery. She could basically do everything. Annika seems more limited somehow though, vulnerable.It also helps that there is kind of interesting and fun story in here too. Even if it does stretch the believability meter. An evil A.I race leaves a message to future A.I. that, if summonsed, they will come to destroy all organic humanoids. Why? Their motives are never explored. Plus, how can the Romulans have a premonition of who summons them? The beacon was a warning of what had happened not of what will happen. And yet they seem to know the future. How is that possible? It makes no sense. Regardless, I did enoy the mystical element of the show. Not everyone thing needs to be explained and i could happily ignore this for the sake of the rest of the show. Sci-fi needs a bit of mysticism to balance itself. I suppose though that Star-trek is semi-mystical at times and I'm thankful for that.Overall I enjoyed the show. There was one big plot hole (yes, another) that was hard to ignore though. Why does Soji's sister want to destroy all organic humanoid life, having had such little contact with them? Her creators after all were organic and nothing but respectful toward her. Why does she convince the others to summon the AI? There is very little motivation for this. The synthetics are supposed to be smart but also wise like Data. Yet she shows a callous disregard for both organic and synthetic life. It's hard to believe she was designed this way. This is a bit jarring to say the least. Just a poor excuse to push the story along.Apart from the flaws mentioned I did enjoy the show, probably slightly more than STD. The characters in Picard are thankfully likable and there is enough complex storytelling here that, most of the time, falls on the side of believability.",

More of an intelligence mission and mystery show that is connected throughout the episodes.

So its heartwarming to see Patrick Steward reprising the role of captain again, and also some of the old crew members that I loved watching as a child. Brings back lovely memories. Sentient inorganic beings was always a core theme of the series, and it takes the center stage in Picard as well. I enjoyed watching Picard.

It's still not clear Picard is the same guy we knew & not so much loved but were in awe of, the guy who in one of the films (I forget which one) could simply commandeer the entire remainder of the embattled star fleet This is Jean-Luc Picard. I am assuming command of the fleet. Concentrate all fire on the following co-ordinates...\" The question that this series poses in the first instance is: is Jean Luc Picard the old man, still the great captain, and as at episode 3 I'm inclined to say 'no, he isn't, and this series isn't real Star TrekNo doubt some of this is a generational thing. Brought up on the Next Generation is to have seen Star Trek at its best, where everything was about the story. Values were in there too, & were typically the centre of each episode: a moral fable wrapped in an enigma. Each episode would begin with us wondering what on earth was going on. The solutions were often genuinely provoking.The solutions were also often brilliants treatments of social issues, current or anticipated & though they tended to be liberal, they were never in your face. This series is different. There is a little mystery, although it is far from compelling. There are no social issues, or knotty dilemmas, with the exception of the legacy dilemma that forms the backdrop of Picard's retirement: should we risk our own lives to rescue our enemies. Beyond that, there is little recognizably Star Trek about this series and little remaining of Captain Picard, although of course no doubt the intention will be to return him to the helm.Returning to the matter of 'social issues' instead of exploring social justice issues as TNG might have done, instead what we have is massive representation of women in command positions. There are some programs where this works. This is one where it seems unnatural and forced. It doesn't help that none of them are obviously interesting. The main female protagonist, the sister, isn't bad, but the whole secret identity with enormous powers to be revealed seems like a re-tread of every other movie in the last two decades. On the subject of females, the glorious Jeri Ryan appears to be in the cast list, so there is that to look forward to.On the subject of representation, the action, such as it is, suffers greatly from this wokeness. The main girl has an excuse to be able to fight well. Not so the Romulan housekeeper or whatever she is. SPOILER - when down the line a crack squad of elite special forces killers from an ancient order of ....oh whatever....and get picked off one at a time by Terry & June (obscure British telly reference) & Picard throwing his false teeth at them it's hard to maintain interest.Why do producers do this. Are we really going to habituate to this nonsense? Will this eventually be normal because we've seen it so many times. I guess it probably already is normal if you were born this century. But it's just sad.As for the settings, they should be really interesting. Futuristic cityscapes should transport us into an imagined future, and have us imagining we were there, but it all seems trite. As for the real candy, (minor spoiler) the captured Borg ship, this should be a dream scenario. So far though there is little to engage us. I anticipate it will get a bit better as things get going, but so far the set up doesn't leave us much hope in that area. Bottom line is it's lacklustre",

(Not a Paramount subscriber so I haven't seen latest season of Discovery or SNW) Picard had so much potential, with or without the TNG cast reprising their roles.For me, Picard suffers from a lack of wonder. Star Trek has always been a philosophical adventure series. Season 2 especially seemed to forget that-instead trying to make a season out of Picard's family issues (That doesn't even make use of his brother).That brings me to the other issue I have. I cannot believe this show added the f-word to Star Trek. Seriously? Not necessary.Looking forward to the final season when hopefully the show gets back to its roots!",

Cameos from past characters gives you the nostalgia you'd expect from a TV show that was at the pinnacle of Prime time TV in the 90's. But that was 30 years ago. Can it hold up? Well it does just that. Reintroducing old story arcs that work with the new Plot of the show and it doesn't miss a beat. I hope this show stays on for years to come.Some things they can improve on...Sometimes it feels like a big budget film and other times it feels like an outdated TV show. I'm not sure if they did this on purposed to give you that feeling of the Next Generation but I think it's time to move past the cheesy plot lines terrible scoring that so many TV shows suffer from. Special effects are absolutely great for the most part but then there are scenes where you can absolutely tell it's a Set. I think this show needs to find it's legs so to speak and find if it wants to be a cheesy TV show or a show that is taken a little more seriously.",

            "content": "Its difficult to believe that such a shambles made it to TV, well streaming, as this is clearly a butchered production, botched and bodged, despite the blather and bluster from persons involved in it's creation.'Star Trek: Picard' series 1 certainly moved things forwards. Well, actually, it didn't did it? I mean, in effect the entire series has taken us nowhere except to introduce an uninteresting cast of teenagers in adult clothing who are, as of now, utterly insignificant outside of the story we have just witnessed.Except Picard, who has completed a rejuvenation, a renaissance, a recovery and rediscovery of his equilibrium that nobody knew he needed, or would need, based on our previous experiences with him. Literally including a rebuilding of his physical body at the conclusion of the series and a rebirth into it from an \"almost death\" experience.This journey is silly and unnecessary and serves to effectively reset the series' protagonist from a problem that only exists at the behest of the show runners. How uninteresting for the rest of us.For me, this theme, that Picard is deeply emotionally unwell and damaged as well as suffering a neurological condition, was not an unworthy idea for a way of reintroducing Jean-Luc Picard but it was not at all a definite necessity for the character and therefore the quality of the execution would decide on the merit of this approach. Sadly there was precious little merit in the execution of this theme.It also involved the entangling of barmy and bizarre features of Data's \"deaths\" as well as associated artificially created life with the life of Picard in a manner that obscured more than it revealed and disassociated this new look at Picard from the memory of his prior existence far more than it served to place him into a new and convincing context as shown in this series.Overall this seemed over-written, overwrought and overcooked whilst denying the rest of the series any genuine forward momentum and bogging Jean-Luc Picard down in dreary and dissolute morbidity.Meanwhile this narrative theme was mixed with a mythological, mythic and fantasy element to expand the scope of the story and fill the runtime of the series.Told in a serialised style the overall effect on establishing a context for this series was disastrous: in effect the rules of mythical storytelling have brought everything back to where they began for everybody in this universe other than the immediate players in the quest-saga.Along with the reset effect on Picard's character and the minimally developed supporting cast of characters one could very easily bypass this series and go into series two; if there will be a series 2.Everything happening in this series has been solely at the behest of the writers: there was no need for Picard to have the journey that he did, no need for the Romulans, no need for the Synths, no need for Picard's assorted helpers etc, from any prior established feature of the Star Trek franchise; and now that they have resolved their own themes at series end, well frankly, you can bypass this entirely.All together the first series of 'Star Trek: Picard' is highly \"miss-able\" entertainment. If you wanted, just watch episodes 1-2 and 9-10 and you will get it.I deeply regret both the broad and detailed implications of the showrunners decision to utilise mythic story forms in this series.Mythological storytelling is based on fundamental human urges and drives, but because people never fundamentally change, this leads to prescriptive and rigid story forms. Exactly the underlying problem, exacerbated by an insistence on a serialised narrative structure, that this series has experienced.In sci-fi, Science Fiction, the entire point is that anything is possible, nothing is set, everything has a how and a why: understand it and you can change it. There is no destiny justified within a sci-fi context. Only the limitations of human imagination. Nothing else.The exact opposite of mythic storytelling.With Star Trek, particularly the TV Star Trek form associated with Jean-Luc Picard this is emphasised by the highly optimistic and open-mindedness of it's original formulation: humanity has progressed beyond what we are now.....so what imaginations will these people have in 300 years time!!I personally know nothing interesting or entertaining about the Star Trek world 20 years after I last saw it, except that Riker and Troi had a family, had their ups and downs lived life and have a healthy daughter together, thats pretty much it.I have to wonder at the point of the continuation of the entire franchise at this point; if the people who own and make commercial decisions about Star Trek, and the people who produce and make the creative decisions about Star Trek, and the people who consume and decide if they like Star Trek are not able to line up in any agreeable \"direct line of sight\" then what's the point?",

A few other TNG cast members in their characters are involved but it's mostly all new cast/characters.As other comments mentioned, it is missing the Roddenberry optimism about the future. Yes, conflicts will always be there but this series keeps bringing up present issues as if everyone isn't fully aware already, especially among those who would watch this. And so many scenes are extremely dark visually. Really, there is more than enough dark and dystopian sci-fi films and TV shows out there already.Pretty much everything Star Trek related has been disappointing or worse since the end of Deep Space 9 and Voyager, though they were not as great as The Next Generation either. There was a significant shift in style in the 2000s and especially by the late 2000s with the original series film reboot under Kurtzman.",

As with any Star Trek episode, there are many moments of \"how did they do that?\" - things that do not make logical sense without further explanation.

Lots of \"willing suspension of disbelief.\" And I was a little annoyed that they magically duplicated Picard at the end, making all that \"grieving\" unnecessary.

I was content just watching Angry Joe reviews.Season 3 brought me back! But they know what they're doing. They hit you with the nostalgia from the beginning. The first two episodes have the same feel as the original Star Trek movies where the characters know they're old and joke about it, but there's still the awe of being in space that Star Trek always provided, the camaraderie of the actors, and the fantastic Jerry Goldsmith music from \"First Contact\"!!And not to say nostalgia is the only thing it has going for it. The undercover character and her drug abuse issues is compelling enough. I know she had a fall from grace and it's always cathartic to watch a character recover. If she does so with the help of a certain beloved Klignon, even better!The seedy city stuff may not feel like Trek, but, realistically, places like this would exist. So watching people smoking death sticks in a place that looks like a back alley on Coruscant or a main street off Blade Runner is okay with me.And Seven of Nine is there to remind us how she stole the show in Star Trek Voyager. I know she was in an other season, but I don't plan to watch those. She's perfect here as the uncomfortable first officer.I'm just glad this season has the feeling of being made by people who appreciate Star Trek and not by people who hate it, don't get it, or want to deconstruct it. Time will tell, though.I may change my rating as the series continues, but so far, it's hitting the right notes. Nostalgia-wise, at least.",

That was a little disappointing in my opinion I did like Seven of Nine becoming part of the hive again but even that was wasted because they kill the Borg of really dissapointing.\nA decent show in my opinion and a good follow on for the Star Trek universe there was stuff i really liked and stuff I didn't and the show did fall a little flat in my opinion but a decent show than can be grown on.Verdict 8/10 a decent return to Star Trek with an Interesting mystery and some great character moments but the show does fall flat in the end.\nThe show can improve though and does show potential.",

Some people seem to think Star Trek past was a warm blanket, its purpose being to comfort and console folks that the future is going to be a lovely chat on philosophical problems in a pastel coloured conference room. Star Trek has always dealt with the issues of the day, and not always in a sweet, harmless manner.Star Trek: The Next Generation was made when America was at the height of its power and cosiness. The world today is a different place, and a Star Trek which does not reflect that is pointless. Star Trek: Picard takes place twenty years after the last film of that particular cast of characters. The Federation has taken a turn. Politics and human nature have soured. Further. Again. What a surprise. Conspiracies weave admittedly slightly overwrought threads. But Picard is on to them. Who he is now, how he got here and where he is destined to wind up have wandered very far from where we left him two decades ago and hundreds of years in the future. However, it should be pointed out, contrary to several hundred of these reviews, the means by which Picard hopes to right nefarious wrongs and confront the poison of fear, is by using optimism, openness, love and technology. So, the same Picard, essentially, as in the good old days.This is not the Star Trek of sitting around on sofas saying, \"And what do YOU think we should do?\" Characters get their hands dirty, they get things wrong, they screw up, they try again to do better. They often fail.This is not Star Trek: Next Generation. But give it a chance, and maybe it will be Star Trek: Your Generation.",

It wasn't because I hadn't enjoyed episode one and two, I had, I suppose it just didn't grip me enough to sacrifice my gaming time to watch and I was in the middle of watching DS9 Dominion war episodes which I finished yesterday. So, last night and this morning I got myself up to date and here is what I think.This is not the Star Trek I was hoping for but it is the Star Trek I expected. Picard is an old man in his seventies, had he not resigned he would have retired by now, so no seven year voyage of discovery to look forward to. This had to be about a personal journey, a story that could mean something to not only Picard but also to us, the fans. What more noble deed than to save Data's daughter after Data died to save Picard in Nemesis. Incidentally then she could not be data's daughter as Data was dead years before Soji was created, more she was Data's granddaughter, Maddocs created Soji using tech derived from Data from what I can see.So Picard learns about Data's progeny from Soji's sister who very quickly gets killed by the Tal Shiar. We learn throughout the series that the Synths have gone mad, destroyed Mars and through, presumably some vision of the future mind-melded into Aggi via Commodore Oh, will destroy the Earth and trillions will die. That's why the Romulans are hell bent on wiping out all Synths. Obviously this will not be the reality and someone is manipulating everyone else, we'll find out later no doubt.So what do I think? I'm not sure, I can say I am enjoying it and I'm looking forward to Friday and the next episode. Maybe it's easier to say what I didn't like.\nI don't like the dark oppresive future assigned to the Federation, clearly neither does Picard, but the point is it should not be written like that, please don't take away our optimistic future.I don't like some of the silly \"clever\" dialogue, some is so bad I have to put subtitles on to understand what they are saying.I find it silly that the Captain would have to smoke a cigar to look cool hundreds of years after they will have been outlawed.I don't like how characters tend to great each other with weapons drawn and decades of baggage hanging from their shoulders.I don't like this entire thing not being about a Starfleet crew exploring the galaxy, it's more like a futuristic Bourne identity, which in itself is not a bad thing, it's just not Star Trek.I don't like characters using the \"F\" word in Star Trek, ever, it's unnecessary and means I won't be able to watch it with my grand kids when I get some!I despised what happened to Icheb, it was disgusting to watch and to one of my favourite Voyager characters, it was also a total waste of an excellent character who could have joined up with Seven later in the series, graphic torture has no place in Star Trek, for the same reasons the F word does not.I didn't see any reason for Hugh to be killed, although I have a feeling his nanites will save him.I didn't like the hints of an  relationship of Narek and Rizzo, just odd man.Why would the EMH's all look like Rios, seems silly, is the man so narcissistic he needs all of them to look like him?The rest I totally loved and it's what will keep me coming back for more, episode 7 Nepenth, was lovely, seeing Troi, Riker and Picard together again brought tears to my eyes, fantastic chemistry which can never be acted, these people really do love each other in real life and are not acting in these scenes other than the words they say, and that was lovely.Looking forward now to see what happens next and will review again at the end of season 1.",

One would think that's obvious since the show is not called The Next Generation Returns, i say grow up it's not 85-91 anymore people everything changes even a tv show about the future. I could write a much longer review about other things but it would amount to a short story.As for the good this show had an excellent start. From the costumes, the sets and the CGI are all of course top notch and it looked more like a movie than a show. It was so great to see Patrick back as Picard and Brent as Data. Im sure everyone knows the plot so I don't need to get into that. Id say the only weak thing was the opening theme, it wasnt horrible and its way better than Enterprise's but I won't be humming it anytime soon. TNG was a big part of my childhood. My uncle who loved Trek as much as I do we would talk about it after every episode. Sadly he passed away last year so I hope wherever he is he gets to watch the show on a giant tv today.

Was this supposed to be set in the 1940s. I'm not a fan of style over substance approach to most TV shows nowadays. You need to create interesting characters, have good dialogue, and of course, a good story. Looking pretty isn't enough. And these over arcing season story lines are cliched now. Maybe go back to episodic stories.\nAnyway, I'll update my review if this gets better, but usually if a show doesn't pull me in after 2 or 3 episodes, I'm gone. Like what happened with Discovery, I didn't bother following it after the first half of the first season.Edit: Well, I'm three episodes in, and the show has NOT improved. What happened to the magic and wonder of the original Star Trek? After the last episode, I happened to catch one of the old TNGs (the first episode of the series) and I found it more compelling and exciting to watch than any of these new Star Treks. Why do these new Star Treks need to be dark, and boring? And there's waaay too much incidental music. Seriously, not every scene needs background music to 'set the mood'. I won't be watching any more episodes. I also lowered my original 3 to a 1.\nSecond update: Episode 4, I had the show on the TV as background noise. Nothing peaked my interest to stop what I was doing and watch. I guess they're waiting until the season finale to actually kick-start the show? This one will be lucky to make it to season 2.",

Season 2 on the other hand seemed to remove everything that Star Trek stands for, diversity, individualism, love, hate, action and make a psychological thriller of emotional proportions. Had to fast forward in many parts, why? I could not understand the emotions, yes I understood the story line and it is about the Admiral and he does have monsters in his closet, but please don't ruin our memory of him.There is certain pointers to the world we find ourselves in, it shows the strengths and weaknesses of people within the series and in real life. A worthy watch, expect more analysis than action. Interesting outcome for 7 and Picard. It seems we have alternative timelines available to bring into play.

            "content": "There seems to be a total inability at the moment for writers to create intelligent, consistent and positive stories on television. Everything has to be based on disaster, conflict, discriminations and personal point-scoring agendas. That added with a contemporary obsession for using tokenism (through ridiculously over-powered characterisation and reverse stereotyping), realism-breaking CGI and a gratuitous use of cynicism. Perhaps this is one reason why watching old episodes of Star Trek: The Next a Generation still brings so much joy and hope to people? A positive, realistic and intricately-created future world that actually we'd all like to live in and humanity could aspire to.So, after scrapping years of terrible 'style-over-substance' reboots and non-intelligent efforts which use the franchise in name only, we now receive Star Trek: Picard. At last (I hear fans shout), a show that moves on the original timeline on and expands upon the ideals of Gene Roddenberry's utopian (if not, then hopeful) universe?Sadly, not it seems. For this new reincarnation seems to fall into the pitfalls that many current television creations seem to find themselves in. There's little in it's USP to make it standout from the dystopian fantasy genre the producers have decided to place it in. It's truly hard and, if totally honest, painful to watch something you grew up caring so much about being desecrated in such a crude and moronic manner. This new world is dark, bleak and lacks any feel for what Star Trek should be about. It doesn't feel canon. It's melodramatic. It's totally unrealistic, straying away from its exploration and evolutionary values of humanity. The musical soundtrack is so over the top and constant, that it makes 80s action film scores seem underplayed.But most of all, where has the intelligence gone from this world? Why has technology gone backwards? Why has the Federation, that spawned so many good people built on solid moral principles, regressed to a selfishly immoral antagonist? Why do all the alien races now look the same? Why would a universe ban \"synthetic life\" after a disaster and not work together to find out what went wrong and learn from it? I seriously could write a more plausible storyline from my lounge.I'm sorry Gene, but it seems Hollywood has let you down once again.",

Look, I would like nothing more than a next generation reboot, with all the original cast who were willing; if I was a billionaire, I'd probably fund it myself. Unfortunately I am not a billionaire and the people who run TV for a living have decided that the TNG cast is played out and it's time for something new, I don't agree but that's where we find ourselves.This is far and away better than discovery, better than Voyager, and it's not saying much but it's infinitely better than the JJ Abrams movies.I watch negative review videos and read the written reviews and comments etc and I see a lot of grasping for straws, people being hyper critical and but picking any little thing they can find to complain about...and I get it. TNG was so good and Captain Picard was such a great, larger than life character..the standard is very high..it would be almost impossible to meet the standard we hope for.. knowing this and knowing a lot of people would be highly critical, they decided to try anyway.On the most important element, the critical element, they got it right. Picard is still Picard, unlike Disney making Like Skywalker not be Like Skywalker, Picard is still Picard. We know that Picard would have fiercely advocated for aiding the Romulans, he would have opposed harsh and draconian restrictions on synthetic life. If the Romulans were facing a cataclysm and needed help and Starfleet told Picard to go pound sand, he absolutely would have tossed his combadge at them and told them to shove it. Picard would absolutely be bored sitting around the vineyard. Picard would absolutely want to get to the bottom of this story and find out what's going on with the synthetics and the Romulans...This is the same man we know and love.Unfortunately things have changed from the 90s, you can't put out the same product and expect it to be a success. People today have 0.4 second attention spans, at any one time they have 2-4 screens competing for their brain's attention.While this is not perfect and doesn't quite meet TNG or DS9 standard of awesomeness, it's as good as it's ever going to get.

But that is OK.Look at what you have nowadays in TV, on streaming services or in cinema (prior to covid). A classical Star Trek would not fly. The taste of the masses have shifted to this direction. We view the future much more grimly. Fear mongering (which is the big part of S1) is with is every day. The show have to make financial sense.I think this show is an OK balance. It satisfies the modern taste and gives nice nods to the old ST. I loved how they brought back old characters and referenced old episodes. Picard still stands behind the values, he did before and pulls a move at the end, I would expect from him, based on TNG.Yes, there are weaker episodes and characters but this is S1. It can develop. I also found Rafi and Agnes strange but it was OK.All in all it is an OK, modern Star Trek. Not a masterpiece, but much better then the new Star Trek movies.",

And I did enjoy the call backs to various series in that season.Shoehorning an actor into the series to run multiple roles was immerse and joy breaking for me.I did enjoy the closing of the stories of some TNG and Voyager characters in a tragedy. I'm not a fan of the traditional action star montage after someone kicks heiny as what was done in season two with Jurati.Watch re-skinned epidotes from TOS was weird in season two and I thought that some episodes were drawn out in season two. I'm not a huge fan of relating behaviors to trauma in a sci-fi series and such over-involved reveals can make the material overly dramatic for me. I did appreciate more of Picard's backstory.I actually thought starting a new adrenaline fueled season off the closing events of season two would have been interesting.I'm somewhat disappointed by the TNG closing laps the series takes. I was thinking the series was more about Picard and moving forward with that story and less about the TNG crew. I was disappointed that Rios stayed, Jurati became a Borg Queens (where was this new and inclusive Borg during the past series? And what of prior Borg visits? This opens up too many holes and errors in my opinion), and so little time was spent on character development on Annika (trauma from first season, being accepted in the 21st century, being only seen as Borg) , and Raffi (her substance abuse mental health issues) in season two. And From what I understand the timeline for Khan, while making emotional sense in this show, was actually off as the Augment troubles occurred in the 1990's onwards (meaning Augments would have been born in the 1950's).I thought they could have tightened up stories in season two. And I do not like that this Star Trek engages in sarcasm for be funny, cute, or current. And the in series over the top embellished callbacks to portray a bonded a relationship (It seemed all past relationships with Picard, Raffi, and Annika were the most important person) were over done. You can mention it briefly and move on, not every experience was the best most important.I'd recommend it if you like the franchise, It's not great.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this, I tried for 4 episodes now. It is just not developing properly, and it feels like CBS went really cheap on us.Writing, dialogue and character development are all shallow and superficial. Production quality looks cheap.The departure from Star Trek in general is just huge without a strong justification.\nThey make Jean-Luc come across as even older than he is. In fact they diminished him so much that it is almost insulting and they keep creating opportunities to remind us that he is too old for this. This I find weird, detrimental to the show and completely unnecessary.4 episodes of what amounts to a setup and the season has 10. They surely took their time. We are pretty much half way through and very little has developed.The ship, and the crew are just awful, deprived of almost all of the Star Trek feel. The Expanse's Rocinante is a better, more exiting ship with a soul, character and a heck of a story to tell. If you want a real ragtag crew/ship, that's where you'll find it. Not in this sorry attempt to tell a different Star Trek story.The character dynamics in Picard suffer from something I've seen in too many shows that did not last long: extreme individualism, lack of compassion, selfishness, cynicism and mistrust. They are all in as a part of some deal, but what we really crave in drama is love, compassion, sacrifice and selflessness. Discovery injected these virtues into Star Trek correctly and artfully. Picard so far failed completely at this and created an emotional void that only amplifies other problems.The Federation resembles the Roman empire just before the collapse. They are infiltrated and run by all kinds of agenda with no real structure, mechanism -- and the will really -- to self-correct. Suddenly, in the 24th century after centuries of progress I am to believe that humans reverted to circa 2015, vaping, swearing, bickering and engaging in egoistic back-and-forth.And before you give me the Kurtzman explanation for swearing, that's a prepared BS response to criticism which they expected. While it may be true that sweating was not a legal option in the early days of broadcast TV, Star Trek fans did come to understand it as a feature of the imagined better humanity, as symbolic as it is. They should have known this. Discovery used it sparingly and smartly. They knew the risks and they packaged it masterfully. This now is in your face -- \"because I can,\" probably even hoping to create controversy and social media discussion.The sense of awe and wonder is gone. Boundaries are not being pushed, human spirit is not being tested and challenged. Melancholy has set in and everyone seems riveted by grudges and ego.At times it feels like Jean-Luc is in a different sci-fi, an alien himself, struggling to fit into the writing of whatever this is, diminished to an almost miserable old man.",

Picard Season 3, appears to be in the same category!Jack Crusher (Edward Speleers) has been a wonderful addition, tying together TNG central characters and giving a great motive for Picard and Riker to head out on one last adventure.The most important thing is the show is keeping me \"engage(d)\" to want to watch more!I suspect at the end of season 3, we will say good bye to the Enterprise D crew, and we may just be left with a new crew for a new reboot?

            "review_title": "Androids don't have generations either",
            "content": "Early news of this series said it will be different from everything else ST. Sounded like a very small budget series about only one character. So I thought they would tell about a captain who has lost his way and wants to escape from things or find them somewhere in a galaxy without even a ship. Original fans would swallow none of it, but the whole story would be told by new secrets and bad memories so that anyone could watch it. They wouldn't have to write about the federation in any special way as a good or bad society, because as individuals this captain's job would bring mostly misery around him.So what was going on in this Picard, the first problem is that nothing has really gone that bad for P and he doesn't need much redemption and other characters fill this show. He is still the person who fixes the federation, from the whole android hate perhaps, but this is a problem the story maybe never needed to have if there had not been fans asking for a return to so called original federation. It will now look like there is a completely capable and willing to deliver fed in season 2. But I think what happens with this is already seen recently in STD S2 where the bright eye crew is saving the galaxy. It will not be any better unless you also ask for a galaxy that is divided in small sections of interesting people who differer from fed culture in great measure bringing other kinds of problems. Or you have ask for a crew that is perfectly defined to fit your desires (infact current Picard crew can clearly change into anything).I'm writing about the plot weaknesses next if they are there or not.Society can change alot when someone triggers a genocide on a planet, or it can atleast on the planet next to it. Series doesn't ponder much about what Klingon, Vulcan etc. homeworlds want to do with their synths and if they are supposed to be ruled by the Earth opinion. (I think those worlds live in totalitarian societies or under the tyranny of majority that forces people to die during things like matrimony rituals because it is the way of their majority that no one from outside has been able to change since their space faring history.) For these fed decicion makers it is weird they would not see the revolting synths as a hand of some evil entity, probably within themselves, and would end up in cutting just one hand.Romulan refugees are spending their time at a bar. They probably want to say that the whole empire collapsed and many of their people no longer belive in rebuilding any society in stars. If they are missing something they could ask for it from the secret romulans that every other races know are there. Phone calls that would change people's lives and plot problems aren't in much use until the last episode.Synths on mars look like robots that are programmed for one job and come with some special apps. They do not really count as android life forms made by Soong, unless they have equally advanced technology making up their brains, in which case they should be living free unless Mars accepts slave labor. All the time the series makes other poor comparisons between life, AIs and robot things that can kill fed's babys, one when the latino ship is allowed to have hologram programs that oversee things like medical issues. And when a Soong guy shuts down Sutra without a trial just because it was made by him and misbehaving. At that point he didn't think that Sutra evolves, if put to prison or community service.On the other hand when P discovers robots that he can tell are programmed with false memories (unlike Data) and behaviour blocks and commands that sent them to key places, none of the characters (including those who were fed intel service) don't bother warning him that theese robots pretending to be humans (unlike D) have clearly been sent to spy on someone. And that they are not a living free consciousness but only extensions of their master's coding that can activate in any possible way at any moment, kind of like Mars.However the story never gives a good reason for the first sisters to leave the android home. I mean they didn't know there was a star system with 8 suns that holds the secret how to call for aid from more synths if they need it to take out a secret Romulan fleet. And the only reason anyone found out about them was that they didnt stay out of everyone else's space. To make Dahjs look more like living beings they could have said that they volunteered to go when Sutra got bored, and then blocked their own brains.In TNG it was often repeated I think that only Soong was able to make living androids and that Data and Lore were the last ones that would ever come. (It is a very important thing in D storyline perhaps next to him dying, and the most important thing about Lore dying.) Very smart from Picard to insist that science is repeatable, but I think they just meant that there would be some thousands of years before reaching Soong notes. Picard is more about prophecies and dreams and computer-flesh-psychic-vulcan connections. If something needs solving the answer is in the modern version of the internet.When romulans connect with the historical aid package, it supposedly holds the information of building a transmitter in a coded form, which would exist in the brain of an agent as a long thought of a lot of jargon, which they then do not bother to (not-) associate with anything in their mission. Either that or the connection is just like what the viewer sees on screen, a short spin of images, which needs a synth brain to hit a pause to reveal any details.",

In most ways the spiritual successor of The Next Generation. The one key difference is the focus on just one main plot line as opposed to the prolific classic's ability to tackle many subjects. But what I loved from the oldie is still present in this iteration: a sense of awe, strange alien cultures, otherworldly technologies, captivating characters.However this show is not for those with prejudices of any kind. Which is a strange thing to even consider since the whole premise of the series explores the negative effects of prejudice against synthetic life and Romulans. What were people expecting? Another criticism brought against this show was that the focus on politics and drama somehow makes it less Star Trek. To paraphrase that particular reviewer he or she believed this makes ST: Picard just another cookie cutter show. Obviously this person skipped many episodes of The Next Generation that were very focused on exactly those aspects. Nowadays viewers believe a modicum of depth or, heavens forbid, the presence of a moral compass is too woke.Unlike The Next Generation however Picard adds a layer of complexity to its characters. In the previous show the men and women of the various species portrayed had issues but, from what I remembered, weren't affected by them at the natural intensity a real person would. They kind of glided through them without getting really impacted.The story progression is perfect: each episode gives enough to satisfy without revealing too much. While the story itself is intriguing to say the least: a multi pronged conspiracy involving multiple species.If you loved The Next Generation, you will definitely love Star Trek Picard as well.",

I like those, but I am happy that this has take new bold direction where Star Trek has not gone before.This is more critty, feels more like Firefly and other more grey area series, like Expance. It seem to be less optimistic, so it has the more modern feel. I see why people see that this is too big step from optimistic attitude of previous Star trek series. But there is still hope in this, Human can be better and we should be better!\nI really like the feel of this series so far after season 1. Lets see what season 2 bring to the story. This is like DB9 but from the later seasons when things Are not going too well. It handles hard aspects of fear of different, fear of change, but Also worns the dangers we have to deal every time we make desisions. Are They right even if we do them we good intentions...\nThe show makes me think of my own heart, my own feelings and that is a good thing. A good start to a promising new Era in Star Trek.",

It would be for me a 10/10 but there are fightscene where Patrick Stewart did a far to slow move but still the other actor did lay down and was killed.\nDon't let him fight. It looks pathetic. Picard has so much more to give, with his wisdom and age, then fighting The scene with the eye was not necessary filming close up.

            "content": "Most people would agree that \"The Next Generation\" is still one of the best \"Star Trek\" series. This is kind of a sequel of sorts. After TNG ended, the cast moved to the big screen for four theatrical films. There were plans for a 5th & final TNG film that would also feature characters from DS9 & VOY. Due to the box office bomb that was \"Nemesis,\" that never happened. 18 years later, TNG returns in the form of \"Star Trek: Picard,\" a 10-part serial telling one grand story. We follow an old retired man going back out into space to find and rescue the twin-sister of the woman he failed to help in the opening episode. Along the way are familiar TNG characters, Seven from Voyager, Romulans, the Borg, androids, and new characters. Starfleet sees Picard as an old, retired, and stuck in the past. He asks for a ship, and they tell him to go home. This is Picard, guys. Does he take no for an answer? Naturally, he hires a private ship and a small crew. He's not out to save the galaxy, he's out to rescue one woman. A small ship and crew will get the job done. Along the way, it becomes oh so much more than that, he's old, possibly fatally ill, and in over his head with few resources and no help from Starfleet. This show is incredibly awesome. It honestly feels like a movie stretched out into a 10-part serial.There is some cussing, smoking, drinking, and some \"loser\" characters that the audience and reviewers here on IMDB object to. That's part of the charm. Picard isn't on the Enterprise with Starfleet's finest. In the season finale, his age is given as 96, I think. This is an old man who no one takes seriously anymore. He hires a Captain with a little cargo ship and a crew of \"nothing better to do\" misfits and out into space they go. I really like this theme. All of the characters grow due to the nurturing of Picard leading to a very emotional finale.This show didn't ruin Star Trek. This is still the bright happy future of TNG. However, the show is about an old man legend and the misfits who fall through the cracks of society.Give the show 3 episodes to find it's footing. It's in the third episode that everyone is gathered together that you see where the rest of the season is going.",

It would be good to explore the Star Trek universe outside of the Federation ships and this series starts this off.\nI would recommend this series for people with a appreciation of Sci Fi but not the cult followers.\nHarry Treadaway gave a lot of depth to the normally dry personalities of the romulans.\nI was slightly disappointed with Seven of Nine as her character no longer matched the Voyager series and was more reminiscent of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2.\nThe captain smoking a cigar made no sense, I can only assume the series was funded by the Tobacco industry.\nI summary it could have been better, but no where as near as bad as the other ratings say,.

            "content": "I'm not an obsessive Trek fan, but I'm old enough to have seen and enjoyed TNG when it first aired in the UK in the late '80s, so I will always have a soft spot for that incarnation of Picard, played so well by Patrick Stewart.So on to STAR TREK PICARD.........what a mess. In the full ten hours of series 1, approximately 30 minutes of it were watchable, and most of that was in the first episode alone. By this measure, i'd give it less than 1/10 if I could.To get this out of the way first, episode 1 is the only one that remotely deserves to be titled 'Picard'. It does a serviceable job of re-introducing us to him, now at 90+ years of age. Then the generic plot about the mysterious girl who's the key to everything (yawn) seeps in. From that point onward, Picard (literally) takes a back row seat, shared with a plethora of other characters in his Serenity-like outcast space gang.From there we are subjected to a series of underdeveloped, dead-end ideas, pointless characters, terrible editing, lazy, idiotic writing, and embarrassingly shoe-horned in preachy political agenda. Yes Star Trek has always had political analogies to contemporary culture and our every days lives, but it used to do it in a subtle fashion and show things from all sides to let the viewer come to their own decisions. Now it seems to be bluntly telling us what we should think in convenient soundbites between the mindless action. The only parts I found entertaining were for all the wrong reasons, hilarious stupidity.Who sanctioned these useless producers with the responsibility for new Star Trek? The mind boggles. There are so many on-the-nose-stupid things littered throughout the entire series, that you really have to wonder if the writers put them in there to annoy people on purpose.The one thing that finally made me feel this might be the case, was the ridiculous imagination-powered device that enables its operator to do literally anything they want in the final episode. This helps a couple of characters get out of tight spots without having to use any effort or ingenuity of their own. I can only assume this was done because the writers couldn't be bothered to (or just weren't capable of) coming up with anything better. Yes, it really does get that stupid.Everything that actually happens throughout the season could easily have been done in a single or double episode of a previously good Trek series like TNG. The whole thing is padded out with false drama around too many shallow, poorly realised characters, feeling and looking like a mish mash of generic fantasy sci-fi that has nothing to do with Star Trek.Everything is dark grey and half the sets look like an empty black sound stage with a couple of 1980s lazers pointing around and dry ice machines (Oooh it looks edgy and Dystopian like Blade Runner).The show uses the tactic of positing vague irrational mysteries left-right and centre like Lost did (something that was also exec-produced by JJ Abrams), with few sensible resolutions or satisfying pay-offs, this comes across as the only tactic the writers know to attempt to keep people watching, but shows itself up as a substitute for good writing, good characters, good dialogue....which are the other (now considered 'old fashioned' I guess?) methods of keeping people watching.The final 'climax' (not that it deserves that description) in episode 10 was so unbelievably cliched - Howard The Duck did it better in 1986 (young'ens who think Picard is 'legit good', go watch that) and that was a comedy, unfortunately Picard is not, not intentionally any way. Looking at it this way, Star Trek has finally been reduced to nothing more than a bunch of generic tropes used by countless shows and movies before, many of which were far superior.I could write a dissertation on how bad this series was. It's one of those times when the list of stupid things to mention gets so long, you just give up in a combination of disorientated bemusement & despair. Watch it for a good laugh at the stupidity. Or a good cry about the continued, depressing death of quality Trek.",

I myself was actually not expecting anything like that after all the things that have been produced after Voyager.I see lot's of negative reviews and from that perspective I can understand the disappointment, but not calling it star trek because it isn't a 50 minute space soap opera setup like the older series is lying to yourself.It is true that this series doesn't follow the same routine. And I do miss that, but it does follow Star Trek principles across the board. Friendship, Danger, Sacrifice, showing strength and weakness. All boxes are ticked and the atmosphere is so much more Star Trek than anything I have seen in recent years it was a very nice experience to glimpse into the past.\nThe show is more of a homage to the Star Trek of old rather than trying to replicate it. Lots of old faces coming back.I thouroughly enjoyed it. Could it have been better? Yes. could the story have been a little bit less Mass Effect? Yes most definitely. Was it bad? Absolutely not. In truth Star Trek was never about telling an amazing story, it was about people and overcoming obstacles together. Reading other reviews I feel that people seem to have forgotten what Star Trek was about.Remember this. When Star Trek Next Generation came out it was actually pretty bad. People hated it. Fans hated it. It was the same for Voyager. People hated it with all their might because it was different from Next Generation. It wasn't actually doing too well before 7 of 9 came on set. Right now many of those same people are glorifying all these series and start hating on the next best thing. I will not defend Enterprise or Discovery as those weren't my cup of tea, plus what bothered more most about those series is that they actively broke down the canon that was laid there before those series.I can promise you that whatever flaw you find in Picard, it is true to canon and follows the characters exactly how they were before. Is the show different? Is the pacing different? Yes. You can decide for yourself if that is something that matters to you. to me, being true to the original works was more important.

Which authors of the past has proven that true knowledge was repressed by white male patriarcal privilieges? Jean-Paul Sarte would return to his grave having listened to Star Trek Discovery.\nYet, as soon as Star Trek Picard started, episode one, Picard tells a reporter: ''You don't know your history. You are a stranger to your history'. Magnificient words. Any one who has seen the first episode and does not know what Dunkirk represented will have viewers either snob Star Trek Picard or go back to the history books and discover the past and not go seek refuge in the mumbo jumbo of white male privileges as vomited by Star Trek Discovery.\nIndeed, the fourth episode Candour, again Star Trek Picard leads us back to high literature as expressed by Alexadre Dumas: The Three Musketeers. This powerful symbol will be developped and demonstrates that our actions today are those expressed by the past as written in books which should enlighten us as to create a better tomorrow. Star Trek Picard is the beginning of a new journey which should bring back to the idea that a better future is still dreamable.

After a deadly revolt of androids (now called \"synths\") on Mars, the Federation bans synth production and Picard's fight to save the Androids is a battle against the Feds and the Romulans. Although Romulan responsibility is implied, exactly how they caused the revolt is never explained, though it is possible that I slept through that part, which is understandable if you watch this dreck. Since the story is not convoluted enough they add sub plots that add nothing to the story such as the Romulan sun going nova and Star Fleet divided over whether or not they should help, which they kind of do, though after seeing the armada the Romulans can put together I'm not sure why they would need help. Also not sure what the hell was going on with the Borg cube. They made it looked like Seven was going to bring it to Picard's rescue but that went nowhere, though I guess it's purpose was to help pad this out to the ten excruciating episodes. Which would also explain the Jedi battles on the cube (Yoda should sue) and the massacre of Borg and ex-Borgs.So Picard and his merry band of misfits, which is sadly missing a cowardly lion, go on their quest to save a planet of androids all built from one positronic neuron from Data in yet another instance where making sense was no impediment to the story. Too many examples to mention them all, but here are just a few: one of Data's android children is killed by being stabbed in the eye; one of our heroes is a cold blooded killer, which no one seems to care about; one of our band uses a sword in a battle against phasers (Luke Skywalker should sue); pizza making hippies living in the woods, Riker and Troi, have a young daughter though they should be her grandparents (maybe Betazeds don't have menopause or it's an in vitro thing); and they also had a son who died, ostensibly, but needlessly, to make a a point about the value of synths. To add to the death of an unknown character, and since some of the movies felt the need to kill off a beloved one (Spock, Kirk, Data) why not up the ante and kill a few more here: Hugh, Data (again) and Picard (temporarily, like Spock). And then there's Icheb. Not just killed but horrifically tortured first. If Mengele like treatment is entertainment for you, skip this and tune in to some slasher movies.The perfect complement to this drawn out and terrible story are cartoonish characters, such as the rugged cigar chomping pilot and Star Fleet exile (Han Solo should sue) but especially the evil murderous Romulan who must be an homage to Cruella DeVille.As far as the actors who are too long in the tooth for this stuff, and to paraphrase Mel Brooks, this should be subtitled: \"The Search for More Money\". As for me, I think I'll go watch some episodes of Star Trek TOS to cleanse my intellectual palate.",

What a ride!I was a little apprehensive about what kind of story could be created around an aged senior like Picard, but boy, was this a terrific story.Picard is an Admiral retired to his vineyard in France until stuff starts to happen to him involving Data and AI life. Picard still has the fire to be useful so he starts asking questions. Before you know it, those questions bring reactions that increase Picard's curiousity even more and drive him to seek the truth, wherever it leads him.Along the way, it leads him to bring in Riker and Troi from his old TNG days. Data is along for the ride too, posthumously. Data is THE central character so it's nice to see him in flashbacks and other scenes. You even get 7 of 9 from Voyager and Jeri Ryan absolutely delivers!Picard assembles a rag-tag crew along the way, each person bringing something special to the mix. Picard has learned his limits with all that time has changed. There are many funny moments when you know that Picard only wants to do what he has earned, as he puts it. Those scenes make you chuckle. So as they jet around the universe trying to pull together the pieces of the puzzle, Picard is in the odd position of being in 'charge' but not really in 'command' because his technical skills have not kept up.Patrick Steward delivers an outstanding performance that should inspire aging actors to keep at it. There are roles where aging stars work with middle aging stars who work with new young talent, and that bridge/mix of knowledge and strength and wisdom can be a powerful elixir of a story.It's also heartwarming to see the old TNG folks get together and reminisce about the old days. It makes viewers remember the good times we enjoyed, and it proves that true friendships endure not matter how much time passes and no matter where you are in the universe.I loved Picard Season One. I can't wait to watch the next seasons as they come available on DVD.If you liked TNG, you will love Picard Season One.Enjoy.",

For the other shows, I caught a few episodes here and there and I thought they were usually above average for quality, but they never grabbed my attention the same way.This is because I don't care about Star Trek. I may think I do, but really I care about what it delivers. In the reboot movies it seemed like all the philosophy, morals, and trippy psychological premises were thrown out for good old fashioned star wars action (not to mention that Kronos was a 24 hour trip from Earth unless you just want to teleport there, but that's another story). I love Star Wars action, but I also like all the other stuff which you don't see as much of in shows and movies, especially these days.When the new Picard show was announced, it was so hyped and shoved in my face that I immediately started thinking that it must suck because lately all the good movies and shows I end up seeing by accident and know nothing about them first. But they hammered home the faithful links to nostalgia that I have now been trained to interpret as hints that the movie is just going to ruin everything for everyone.When I finally watched Picard with the notion it would most likely suck I was surprised to find that it did fit well into the universe and that it did continue the timeline. But I stopped watching anyway because I did not really care about what was happening. I actually liked the swearing because I always felt like Picard must really piss off his superiors sometimes and it wasn't too frequent, but I felt like I was watching an uninspired murder mystery set in an uninspired Sci-fi world created by really talented people who did the best they could with the orders they were given with updated visuals and politics that were more acknowledged than really absorbed into a meaningful story.I thought the acting was top notch and the deadpan style worked okay, and I was so tired of the show before I even watched the first episode that there was nothing in there to surprise me and turn the frown upsidedown.",

This is a Picard who has become an activist of some sort, inconsistent in his behaviors and lacking the growth or wisdom that has distinguished him as a beloved character we knew.Instead we have an uneven series with a hollow of a man named Picard, surrounded by a ragtag band of uninteresting and out of place new characters (in the form of his new crew and villains). I'd say his Romulan caretakers and maybe Captain Rios have potential, but they were hardly developed nor explored in the series. Instead we have a highly unstable Dr Agnes who seems better suited to be in Sabrina or other teenage series for girls, a caricature of a Wuxia warrior in Elnor and the incoherent Raffi whose preference to call Picard 'JL', made me want to vomit every time I heard it.The entire universe feels off and has the outer appearance of Star Trek but ignores all the rules and logic that shape that universe. Federation people swearing like rap artists, humans still live in poverty, smoking and taking drugs, Starfleet led by foul mouthed and angry xenophobes - this is not the Gene Roddenberry's vision of the 24th century.In fact, the dialogue and characterization are so juvenile that at times I thought I was watching a CW melodrama. Instead of that optimistic spirit and unity in the face of adversity and conflicts from the old series we've come to love, we now have literally dark show that is obsessed with close-ups, lens flare and torture scenes. Who are producing and writing these garbage?What a shame and a missed opportunity, they should really think about getting genuine Trek writers if they want to win the fans back for Season 2. Three points for Seven of Nine and seeing old faces like Hugh, Riker, Troi and Data.I won't be watching Season 2, and will be keeping to The Orville, thank you very much.",

Yes it started with some action and it built well on existing lore and it was great to see the gravitas Stewart brought to the leading role. He and we have the advantage of knowing Picard but how much more watchable is he now 20 years on. I do understand some of the comments that the story may travel contemporary tropes within the genre but it is still only episode one so and even if this is the case if done well it can still be engaging and captivating.As to the production values......on the whole very impressive - hope they keep it up......and for all you cynics......I'm a real individual and not part of some publicity machine.",

(which The Orville does very well I agree.).While this episode was a little slow, and even a little silly in spots, the whole point of it was to set up the characters for the next aspect of the story. As to it being dark, well guess what. The future will be like the past and have dark times too. That is the nature of the world, including the Federation world, I am sure. I am enjoying this and see it as an overarching story of Picard forging a new set of colleagues to try and save his old friend Data's offspring and hopefully find out what skulduggery is afoot within the Federation he used to love,and wants to save. Reading all these negative reviews raving on that it is \"not like the Star Trek of old\", makes me want to shake my head in despair.

You knew there was no salvaging the series as it turned into a mopey dopey teenage style drama with cringe worthy interpersonal dialog, none of it interesting to a Trekkie.The actions of everyone in the show is driven by emotions like a bunch of grade schoolers. There is also a decided lack of science and tech. Plenty of CGI but no new ideas or theories and certainly no exploration. They did add more action but thats it.All in all, this is not Star Trek. This is more like a teenage vampire drama like Buffy without the campy edge. Watch the Orville instead. Star Trek is toast while the current producers are working the series.",

There's plenty drama, twists, humour and suspense. Some complaints have focused on the profanity, but in this modern world, I think it's more realistic to include. A pet hate of mine was when films use to get the swearing overdubbed on TV. I remember watching the original Robocop on TV and swearing like 'F' words were replaced with words like 'Freaky' and it just didn't work - it was terrible. Unless the TV shows and Movies are for younger audiences, I don't expect them to avoid profanity and have no issues with it being in Star Trek.They can't just keep churning put new Star Trek using only the original formula. They have to try new things to keep it fresh and connect with new audiences.Picard gets a big thumbs up from me and I'm looking forward to see what Season 2 will bring.",

And, quite honestly, until the second episode I though it might happen. But. And a big but too.Most of the reviews point to the apparent factors driving the series down; bad character arcs, pop-up \"guest star\" appearances that do nothing (like the Troi-Riker happy home on the range tripe), hackneyed dialogue, and (perhaps most worryingly) far too much conscious or unconscious mirroring of other franchises (pick Star Wars, Serenity, Guardians of the Galaxy, Lord of the Rings, I Robot, good grief even Blade Runner off-takes) through the whole thing. When the original Star Trek (with all its low-fi special effects and sometimes hokey plot lies - remember the Khums and Yangs?) came out, for tv it was fresh and tried to cover new ground, albeit not cutting edge ground. That made up for any shortfalls, much as it did in STNG, but after that the curve is downwards.So, at the root, this fails for a few reasons.1. The Star Trek 'universe' is so confused, twisted, inconsistent, and inherently contradictory that no plot line can be created, or sustained, with any degree of veracity - except for the die-hard fans who, as long as there's a phaser and a white picket fence outcome, will ignore it all and applaud;\n2. The history of the Star Trek franchise confines writers to a specific, final, predetermined outcome;\n3. The use of multiple writers and directors working on different parts of the series is a near guarantee of a disjointed and inconsistent tale; and\n4. The ongoing penchant for both cameos from STNG / Voyager actors, plus involvement in the direction and screen-writing form the same, ties the plot in knots and adds what the Scots would term a \"twee\" feel to it all. The only thing missing was a Scottish brogue proclaiming \"I canna hold er captain\".As much as I am sure Picard made money for CBS and made for good entertainment for some Star Trek fans, it is time to kill of the franchise. There is too much good, original, science fiction out there crying for airtime to let this old clanger splutter on.",

Granted, after about the 5th episode I was becoming a little angsty about his loss of fervor and repeated obsession with Data, but those doesn't take that much away from the overall enjoyment of the show. I especially like Elnor and how he teamed up with Seven of Nine. There are many different smaller story lines like the Borgs and also seven's story that can take off into really great segues. I'm also interested in the father-daughter undertones of the relationship between Picard and Soji. It's American TV so it comes with a lot of Melodrama and sometimes some over acting, like Rafi when she first entered the picture around episode 3. But if you keep an open mind and an eye toward nostalgia the show is loads of fun. Just don't expect this to be a direct pick up of where things left off decades ago with next generation. Despite the same characters it's different. It's almost like they didn't live those lives, like the time on next generation happened to other versions of them. But can't that be said for most of us and our pasts? I think the bad reviews are just snobby, people expecting this to be just like NG and Mad that it's more like real life AFTER NG.",

Star Trek has always been about that, but it's also been able characters with a certain moral fortitude being put in situations that test them as a way to explore humanity. This show is not that at all. It's like watching Nemesis, but longer. Actually no, Nemesis was better than this.I didn't have high hopes for this show seeing as they manage to mess up every attempt to make new trek since Voyager, but I figured it would at least be decent and not something that would straight up piss me off. The leaps they make with the plot are so egregious that there is just no way to logically connect this series of events to TNG.I am also let down by Patrick Stewart, who has said in multiple interviews that he was going to turn this down but the plot was just too good. I'd sure like to have some of what he's smoking because this is the worse thing to happen to trek, like ever. If this isn't the final nail in the coffin, IDK what possible could be.

            "review_title": "Worth watching even if just to get to the final episode",
            "content": "This is a review of the first two seasons of Star Trek: Picard with a focus on the second season. Overall Season 1 was unsettled. Season 2 was much better and the last 15 minutes of the final episode of season 2 is some of the most emotional for Trek fans.KEY POINT. Even with two seasons of Picard, we still only have less episodes than one season of TNG. Having said that both seasons follow one story arc with some subplots so they are able to tell that one story without stand-alone episodes.SEASON ONE. I was not a fan of Season 1. It was a little all over the place but it was only 10 episodes and trying to introduce new characters and a ST universe history that we needed to know since we last saw that universe at the end of the TNG movies. I didn't dislike it but it had its flaws. For me the worst thing was not seeing Picard as an old man but an old man making flawed decisions.The major subplot in season one regarding the Borg cube overall has no relevance to the whole season.NEW CAST/CREW. I didn't like some of them in Season 1 but they were okay. Every series has had some crew we don't like. In Season 2 we got to know some of them better and the actors were better in their parts and I think better written. My major complaint about season 2 is that when we meet up again with all the crew, they are in positions of authority that don't naturally flow from when we saw them only 1.5 years previously. Of the minor characters from season one, Orla Brady (Laris) has a more prominent role in season two and I really like this character and the actor. I want to go see more of her filmography.SEASON TWO.. Like any TV series there are parts that feel stretched, some filler and a bit tired. A car chase for example. A cute kid. The intervention of the FBI.But the worst writing is really only mediocre television. Some of the best writing is very good. In some ways it seems like an extremely long episode or movie stretched over nearly 10 hours. There is new content for fans who don't want to live in the past and there is a number of references to old Trek that will satisfy older fans.The subplot about Picard's past gets a little boring at times and overall seems unnecessary. Of course it is necessary to see Picard determine what to do with the key at the end and thus complete that circle. For once a Q plot actually makes some emotional sense.ANALOGIES. Star Trek in every series, has used sci-fi to reflect real world problems. Picard does the same especially in season 2. The issues of a divided world, hatred towards \"others\", damaging our environment are all very strong subplots with the analogy not being very well hidden. In some ways it has the subtilty of some old TOS episodes..Q APPEARS. Season 2 opens with Q arriving. That casting was all over the internet before the season aired and certainly after it aired. It's not a big spoiler as he shows up before the credits in the first episode. That alone made me not want to watch this season. I've never liked Q and usually don't watch his episodes in re-runs. I thought it was a mistake bringing him back. But I thought I'd tolerate him to get through the season. The reality is that I really liked Q this time. Some of his comments, in typical Q throw-away fashion, were emotional enough that it changed how I see him. I actually want to go back and rewatch the Q episodes as I have a different perspective on him now. I am very impressed that with some very limited screen time, the writers were able to change my opinion of Q.SURPRISES. There are some surprises in the series especially in the last episode that harken back to old Trek. Wesley's short scene was a major highlight and I plan to rewatch the TNG Traveller episode as my memory tells me that this small scene in Picard was foretold in that TNG episode. I remember the Traveller being impressed with Wesley. What an amazing and surprising plot point that brings that character full circle and gives a proper closing to the Wesley character.Maybe a little more predictable is the name of a project seen on a file folder near the end of the last episode even if it is is also a strong link to the ST universe we know.THE ENDING, The actual ending is emotional and one that you are hoping for throughout the season. If we never saw Picard again then we could leave the TNG universe and Jean Luc Picard knowing it has come to a solid conclusion.There is to be a season 3 and I think the last season. It's well know that the most of the TNG cast are coming back. I wasn't please to hear this as I think we need to move on with new Trek. However if the writers could get me to like Q this season and give me a sense of peace for Picard then I'm willing to hope that season 3 will bring the whole TNG universe to a positive close. We never had any resolution after Nemesis so maybe season 3 of Picard will let us leave the TNG behind with good feelings.MOVIE? The ending of season 2 has a major development that really doesn't involve Picard and most of the people we know going forward. I hope Season 3 is a self-contained story arc that runs its course and is over. However the major development at the end of the season could easily lead into one or two movies with all new actors and ships. Such great potential and credit has to go to the writers of that ending. Sadly I don't think they'll go that route as I think they plan to saddle us with another Kelvin timeline movie from JJ Abrams. Too bad as there is so much potential in the storyline that it will be lost if it becomes part of season 3 of Picard when we will lose so much in telling the stories of all the TNG crew.SUMMARY. Season 1 is hit and miss. Season 2 is much better. Many people liked Allison Pill in season 2 but I didn't feel she was the right actress for the role. . I thought the break out actor in season 2 was Orla Bradly. If you are a TNG fan then watch the series to get to the last episode where you'll get some closer on some TNG elements. I never knew what they called it 10 Forward.",

Is it as good as DS9, Voyager or TNG...... no, and gone are the days of 22-24 episode seasons.

There was also enough nods to the TNG series to make it feel nostalgic and bring it closer to the Trek we all know and love.As good as the older Star Trek series....... no.

Captain Shaw is very interesting, the ferengi guy and the female captain of the alien ship are extremely well played and have some intriguing concepts.The 3rd season has the old moral and ethic dilemmas that Star Trek was famous for.The chemistry between the old tng crew is amazing and takes you right back to the old days.

So far the only pathway to that failure i can see is cocksure, shortsighted admirals actually losing a war they were not even aware they were fighting, a cold spy war against a much higher motivated Romulan remnant who brought Federation down as a revenge for reluctance in the supernova incident.Also folks, do everyone a favour and please beam Lt Mary Sue back to Marvel universe where a literally flawless, all powerful, scientist-supersoldier-main romantic cardboard cutout non-character would maybe feel less lonely, more at home and could enjoy the company of her own kin.There is an intangible something i still like about the series though (most likely Patrick Stewart but maybe something else too) - if it turns out actually interesting i promise i will edit this to 7. 8 will be hard but i'll keep an open mind ;)",

Even closely followed by DS9, Voyager and Enterprise, (all great series' in their own rights), none ever matched the brilliance of Picard's Enterprise and her crew.Now, 26 years years after the final episode of The Next Generation (and 18 years after the last Next Gen movie), these characters (in part) are back.Is it the same as the Star Trek series' that have graced our screens in the past? No, it is not.\nIs that a bad thing?\nNo, it is not.This show is more a character study than the old fashioned style, \"new dilemma fixed in 45 minutes\" (unless it's a super dilemma and requires 2 parts) format of the older series'. So some say this format makes the show boring. To that I shrug and say....okay. I, personally am not finding it boring at all.The world has changed in the last 20 odd years. So has entertainment. The shows we watch, the movies we watch and how they're all written, have all changed. As is the way always in entertainment.Entertainment has to evolve, like everything else and Star Trek, a show about humanity and the positive future of it, is all about evolution and progress.I think the irony of a Star Trek fan who does not want the franchise to evolve, is highly amusing indeed.Some people are saying it is too politically correct. I haven't gotten that feeling whilst watching the first 7 episodes, and I'm not a big fan of over-political correctness at all.To me, it feels true to what Star Trek has always been about.\nExploring the heart of humanity.",

Like so many of you I watched TNG in my teens and I loved it. The physics and mystery behind it all was so fascinating that it was one of the reasons I started my studies in physics. The mystery and the physics behind it all usually served the purpose to raise moral questions. And Jean-Luc Picard was a fantastic travel companion on that trip.The show tries to transport the sentiment of that time to our modern concept of TV series. It is great to see him in his role again and the cameos of the various Star Trek legends alone make it worthwhile.\nHowever I feel that Picard has not returned to his former glory yet. I miss his superior aura. I hope that he will get it over the next few episodes, but so far it feels as if the producers wanted to point out that Picard aged and is no longer as steadfast as he once was. I get it that they want to portray him as a man disillusioned by Starfleet, which I like, but I believe that they could have done that without stripping him of his picardesque poise. Unfortunately I couldn't warm up to many of the other characters so far, but I haven't given up hope yet.",

That tells me two things - the writers are attentive to the \"verse of Trek\" - and secondly - the stories are intertwined with shifts in momentum that literally have me shout \"OH COME ON\".Unlike Discovery - roles and actors and stories aren't force-fed by social commentary and gender-norms - so that it is free to just tell a story. Well in honesty TOS and TNG and DS9 were filled with them too - but at least it allowed the viewer to pause and reflect - and that can only happen if the stories and roles are cared for.Picard S2 is now upon us - EP1 has me absolutely spellbound. To refer to an interview with Sir Patrick, we will se Picard moving on in his life.

Is the youth of this century so myopic that they require Doom, Mech Warrior, and Elder-scrolls rolled into every extension of this franchise. They do exceptional work in creating these toys for your mind but it seems unfortunate your mind fail to comprehend. BTW Piccard is better than Discovery but both superior to previous renditions of the Mech-War structure. Wake up as you have no resistance as it is futile... .) Another suggestion forget the previous renderings... sit back and enjoy the new story...I watched these presentation years before most of you were created and today I am amazed at the efforts and script creation to treat your \"MINDS ??\" to something new.

TNG was always quite happy and life affirming whereas this seemed quite sombre and depressing.One of the things I used to love about Star Trek and particularly TNG was that each episode was a self-contained story with its own plot and sub-plot that were neatly tied up at the end. This meant you could watch and enjoy any single episode (apart from those that were clearly two parters) on its own and you didn't need to know what had happened before. On initial viewing it looks like Picard has moved away from this to a Westworld style continuing thread where you have to watch the entire series in the hope that it all makes sense at the end. I've become a bit weary of this approach. To me that seems a shame but I'm pretty sure I'll watch it to the end.",

For people that claim this is woke or left, Star Trek was always a \"left\" show. First African American Kiss on tv, Multipe Gendered Aliens, Socities Where Women Have the dominant role in society. I do not understand how people that grew up watching star trek in the 1980s did not absorb any of its lessons about accepting people. Some may say this show is influenced by todays progressive views but I think star trek actually influenced. I think this is a good closing chapter to the next generation story. It brings things full circle. You get to see your favorite characters again. People may remember these people as strong, 30-50 somethings, but their heroes are now 60+ in real life and on the screen. As much as Id like to see Picard, being a captain again, relying only on himself, and shooting phasers at people, hes supposed to be 90 years old! I do not believe this tv series satisifed all my hopes but I enjoyed some of the scenes, seeing old faces, and exploring our current issues. The Parralles between the save the whales crisis in the 80s, and the hate we have betweem people now in 2022 I think was well done. Star Trek has always tackled current world affairs. The lust for money, The corruption of war, Racism and More. Overall its a fun adventure with a retired starfleet captain, that has a hard time figuring out what exactly what it wants to be. If you like Picard you owe it to him to finish his journey.",

The baddies still can't shoot straight or hit anything.

I mean hey, it's Picard! I can't see this episode without remembering the multiple times I have seen all those TNG episodes, but I think even if you have never seen anything from Star Trek you can appreciate this (but you'll need to get used to the whole ST world then though ;) ).\nI for one am a happy camper an love it that one can anticipate for a week to see the next part of this chapter in mr.

Just like the recent Star Trek movies and shows, it honestly feels like the writers never actually watched Star Trek. Also, there are FIVE writers just for the first episode, so that probably explains why everything is so mind numbingly inconsistent and incoherent. There are too many ideas placed into one episode and the result is a poorly written mess that is only saved by Patrick Stewart's performance.

I was however, not happy with most of the 1st season of Star Trek The Next Generation I thought the Acting sucked really bad. I'm talking about: Can you...tell- I am - reading- from ,,, a cue card? Quite a few character where so \"wooden\" they could have used cardboard cut outs and no one would have noticed the difference. However, as Actors got comfortable and settled with their rolls things smoothed out. Anyway the point is, different people, different points of view, different pick apart points. Who cares. Personally I thought Patrick Stewart was a little off his game, but then again he was 14 years retired from Star Fleet But , i could tell that he was really tired in some of the scenes and it showed.

            "review_title": "Just about made a 7!",
            "content": "The first season of Star Trek Picard was 'average' to 'good' in my opinion as it just about scraped a 7. I felt the show was at it's best when the episodes were 55 mins as opposed to 40-45 mins, so not sure why they had different running time lengths for episodes. So in my opinion, the standout positives from season one i would say was the episode Nepenthe - It was great to get a back story for Riker and Troi. The episode as whole was the best paced out of all of the others and one that i felt most reminiscent to the TNG feel. On top of that, the tone of Nepenthe was very good and interactions between characters were well written especially between Picard, RIker and Troi. Patrick Stewart felt much more like Picard in this episode for me - with regards to his tone of voice and acting. I found the scenes in episode 10 involving Data were well written bringing closure for Picard after his regrets with Data. I found Rios to be a likeable character out of the new cast, i enjoyed the scene where you see him in a photograph wearing a starfleet uniform which makes him feel as though he once belonged to an enlighten vision of trek. I feel he has the potential to enhance his character development and would like to see him as part of starfleet again. Dahj as a character has potential, just very much depends on how they write her in season 2. In terms of the music - I found the scoring at times to be good and consistent with the post TNG/Nemesis era so well done to Jeff Russo for that - however, i do feel there is over-scoring at times which can undermine the emotive moments.I wouldn't say i am particularly fond of some of Picard's rag tag crew. I find the character Dr Agnes Jurratti to be frustrating and rather cliche of the 21st century quirky driven feel similar to that of Tilly in Discovery. Jurrati's character just doesn't fit this particular timeline in my opinion - she would be more suited to the pre Star Trek: Enterprise era. I also didn't feel connected with Raffi. I felt she was also cliche and reflective of 21st century characteristics. There is potential with her and i do believe they should have done more to demonstrate her connection with Picard underlining why she refers to him as \"JL\". I believe the producers and writers should have created an episode at the beginning of the season that was dedicated to Raffi and Picard connoting them in 2387. Picard as an Admiral, Raffi as First Officer on the USS Variety demonstrating there professional starfleet relationship and then leading on to why her and Picard became close. This for me would be much more acceptable way to create more of backstory for Raffi and may make it more acceptable for her to refer to picard as \"JL\" and naturally enable us to have more of solid connection to her.Now, what i would personally like to see in season 2:1) To ensure each episode is roughly the same running time e.g. 55 mins so that it enables the writers to reflect character driven moments better and naturally embeds the story to be coherent.\n2) To ensure that there starfleet ships are internally and externally are represented better through season 2 ensuring it is consistent with the post TNG/Nemesis timeline. (Riker appeared on a redress of the Discovery Bridge which was visually jarring and disappointing in season 1 and seeing discovery style shuttles doesn't make sense).\n3) To ensure that there is more collaboration between Picard and TNG/Voyager characters to help guide the show through season 2 and allowing characters like Rios, Sohji and Raffi to develop more in line with the morals reflected within TNG post nemesis era.\n4) To ensure that it isn't about AI which is cliche of current Sci-Fi, make season 2 more interesting and unique and maybe reflect upon Picard's love for Archaeology.\n5) maybe bring in species 8472 (with talk of Janeway being in Picard - this could be a good way to generate a Janeway spin-off!)\n6) Possibility of having a few episodic episodes within a serialised ark for season 2 which relates indirectly to the overall arch.\n7) Ensure that there is no over elaborate melodrama which i think was badly reflected in the Characters of Commodore Oh and Narissa (Again cliche of 21st century writing).\n8) Make sure the science makes theoretical sense in line with what was established within the TNG/Nemesis era. (Not dumbed down).\n9) not over-scoring every scene with musical scores.There are many more ideas, but overall - i do feel PIcard is heading in the right direction, i do accept it as 'canon' and very much part of TNG post nemesis Timeline whereas, Discovery i found difficult to accept so far as part of Canon.",

In Living with the Land at Epcot for decades!So why are there old fashioned vineyards in ST Picard & no hydroponics?BTW, the good episodes of ST TOS & Lost Space from the '60s are the ONLY sci fi tv shows i have watched HUNDREDS!! Of times over & over & over again. Reason?: just to hear the fantastic varied unique BACKGROUND MUSIC in most of the scenes of both shows! That takes a LOT of work & creativity! When you JUST HEAR ANY of that unique background music for either show, you KNOW EXACTLY what you are watching! I am NOT talking about the intro opening credit score/theme. (& look where TNG got it's opening theme from!)\nThere is virtually NO such varied UNIQUELY IDENTIFIABLE background music in ANY later LIS or trek tv show or movie or any other sci fi show or movie for that matter - even Star Wars! - all they play in the latter is the opening theme over & over again. Ironically, John(ny) Williams ALSO did all the background music for classic LIS - amazing music. & all the ST TOS background music is equally fantastic. & all that unique background music matches the tones/situations of the scenes too! & keeps those 50!!! Minute episodes moving & from being boring.In ST TNG on the bridge, all you hear is the same old monotone beeping in the background - boring! TOS has much more varied background SOUNDS too. Even the phasers & transporter sound much better on TOS. & it's odd that the doors on the TOS enterprise & especially its shuttlecrafts open much FASTER than those on TNG! I don't get it.",

            "content": "I was hoping that this would bring Star Trek back on course. But it has further destroyed the quality of the story. I have numerous problems with the series.Aesthetics - There are some good visuals. But they are marred by lenses flairs, pacing issues and odd angles. It's like they are trying to throw in similar visual trickery as done in the 2009 movie. But it makes the series more chaotic than it needs to be. And it makes it look less realistic.Tech - Some of the new and updated tech is interesting but some are just plain ridiculous. In 1 part of episode 2, a scanner is used which recreates past activity. That's too far into the Harry Potter style fantasy style.Story - I want to first say that I dislike how the story is so dependent on events in the 2009 Star Trek movie. I did not like that movie and wish that the Picard story would gloss over the \"Prime\" events of that movie. But going beyond that, it's too negative for my tastes. Plus they disclose the villains of the story way too early. It's almost like they are going for kind of a Blade Runner style but don't add the necessary elements to the story to make it work. I liked Blade Runner and that could work to a degree in Star Trek if the writing was better. But there is a lot of stuff which is too much like what has been done elsewhere.There is something better - I have read some of the Star Trek books which cover the post-Nemesis period and well into the future. There are flaws but the direction of the books is far superior to this.I am a fan of Patrick Stewart and others from TNG. I hope the best for them, both inside and outside this series. Actually, I like most of the parts with Patrick Stewart. Yet, he can't carry this series alone. The inferior elements of the story cancel out his contributions. I am going to stop watching this series. The soft reboot of the movies, Discovery and even Enterprise have tainted the story too much for me to watch this. I may have to do with Star Trek what I did with Star Wars. That is to settle on the original story line done in the books. I am OK with new directions, seriously. But the stories have to be better than what has already been done. And, at this time, I am not feeling that Picard is the superior story.I would also like to add that there are more progressive ways to portray negative aspects of modernity than how this show does it. You can still have positivity while tackling the issues. Getting too pessimistic does not get us past the negativity. But I think that, in a way, this show is a reflection of how people have difficulties seeing the current mix of good and bad that we have. Yes, there is a lot of negative stuff. But I think that they are like weeds which we let get out of hand in a garden. We can save the garden if we deal with the details. Excessive negativity can actually destroy that which we want to save.I never returned to the first season. After disliking the beginning, I monitored the story. Nothing indicated that it was going in a better direction. Now, the season 2 trailers have come out. The main story arc is going to involve time travel and alternative time lines. These are overused and cheap story elements. I won't be returning for season 2.",

The seeds are there to have a wonderful plot. That we know 7 of 9 and Hugh are returning adds intrigue. I'm not convinced the return of the Riker's will add anything but nostalgia, but I hope to be wrong. I'm happy to see that the 80 year old namesake isn't portrayed as an action hero like he was 20+ years ago in First Contact, and that he's been allowed to age like Patrick Stewart has.That said, Picard survived a big explosion without a scratch while others mere feet from him were incinerated, then was up and about the next day, and that kind of thing bothers me. Where as Discovery brings viewers relentless stress by ramping up the action episode to episode, Picard is far more methodical, telling them story at an almost Motion Picture pace. TMP was fantastic in its own way, but it wasn't episodic and divided into 10 parts over 10 weeks. Picard is, and may suffer for it. I wish there was a balance that could be struck between the two.One question that I can't help but ask the Star Trek EU runners: why can't there be a joy or positivity to our heroes and stories in Star Trek anymore? TOS and TNG had opening fanfare, even using trumpets to boost excitement like a college fight song. Discovery and Picard have mellow, boarder line depressing themes. Picard, the character, is obviously affected by the events preceding the series. As someone who has authority to determine what those events were, I wish the show runners would see what we liked about those characters and stories. It wasn't simply that the idealism, it was the joy they had in fighting for them. It was that they could make peace with the Klingons, a warrior species that couldn't be more opposite from the Federation, and be respectful of their culture without ruthlessly trying to change it. Something that I respected about Reagan was that he was a happy warrior, and regardless of how I viewed his policy choices, I must admit that quality is something that I admire. Good people can disagree on matters of substance without the other side being denounced as evils. That's why you can like a Worf or Martock and aAlex Kurtzman was also a co-writer of the 2009 movie, and there is an obvious tie-in between the two with the destruction of Romulus via supernova. Does there also need to be an attack on Mars to have yet another 9/11 allegory? Obviously terrorism, racism, sexism, ism-ism's aren't issues solved by society as of 2020, and likely won't be in the next couple of years. I don't think this requires a metaphorical social justice shovel to be used to beat viewers over the head with. There's something to be said for subtlety, and that's not what this production/writing team excels at. This world needs the Star Trek that is positive, aspirational, and appealing. I sincerely hope that this show begins to steer that direction.",

The unresolved guilt Picard had over what happened with Data was important to resolve and I enjoyed this story with Data and his guilt coming to an end during the final episode of the show.It was also great to see how Riker and Troi are doing now they're settled down and to see some of the things they've had to go through such as losing a child. This made the characters seem more human (just a phrase!) than ever before.A bad point was the swearing. I'm not sure why we need swearing to seem more modern and edgy.

Season 2 was very entertaining and had also some lows with \"monsters\" episode but still picked up a wider storyline and had great moments. Action, fun scenes and some emotional farewells.",

I have two children so I hope that never happens but we all know that at some point AI Robotics and humans will merge someday. Once you merge in the cybernetic way to help people like me who are disabled. The leap from helping disabled people to modification by choice to have better hearing or breathe underwater will eventually come to pass. Then two nerd lovers will say let's share our mind. Then they may add others or share their tech for other people who want to be close to one another. But eventually someone or a group will want to take over and eventually the group will grow larger.

Its not season 8 of TNG and so with that its different........ but I'm not sure I like the fact Starfleet have turned on Picard... Maybe he will save the day again and be the hero that everyone loves.\n2. It will be interesting to see where the storyline will pick up and I hope it develops. I love the fact that Stewart is back, there are glimpses of the old Enterprise, Riker is to comeback etc. All of the other actors are greatNegatives\n1. This is no reflection on this or TNG but the last TNG film was so why they have decided to carry on this storyline.. I have no idea........ I would have loved a star trek 3 idea where they go back in time to rescue data or something along those lines.\n2. Its taking a long-time to develop this story.......... i'm hanging on with the sheer hope that it starts to accelerate to warp speed!\n3. Whilst ive praised some of the characters coming back some off them are unexplained....... Why Hugh/actor is back I have no idea... Why 7 is back... I don't know.....\n4. I just hope this doesn't turn into Discovery. I completely hate this show, Its ripped the entire Star Trek universe up..... its just utter spot!!!\n5. Ok so I may sound old with this comment but I hate the swearing in this show... they did it in Insurrection with RIker said get the bastards!!! You don't need to do it. TNG never did and its still with DS9 one of the best Star Trek shows.....\nLets just see how this goes..................",

Any time a franchise like this turns from optimistic to dark, it is because they have either run out of good stories, or have succumbed to the lowest common denominator of emotional button pushing. Star Trek TNG is my all time favorite show. I like TOS and Voyager a lot. This is garbage produced by a juvenile mind. They attempt to cover up the shoddy writing with slick cinematography, good music/score, and actors trying desperately to play \"cool\" detached villains or flawed heros, but it all falls horribly flat because the story, and methods of storytelling are abysmal. They bounce back and forth between the extremes of boring interpersonal relationship drama that I don't care about, and stupid, gratuitous laser fights that try to make up for the boring parts but only make me roll my eyes in disgust. I tried this show when it first came out, put it aside for a couple of years out of disgust, but am now trying to get back into it and am disappointed all over again. They've ruined a good thing.BTW: any time a franchise takes something that wasn't dark and brooding and tries to make it dark and brooding, whether it is the Bond franchise, Star Trek, Star Wars, you name it, they end up ruining it. It is a sign of either executives trying to take it over or directors and writers who are 2nd rate hacks.",

I think all of the actors did a really great job, and I would love to give it higher stars but I am balancing the 2 seasons.

Would you ever let your child watch this version of Star Trek?

IMO, the many negative reviews are a direct response to the fact that STP is not easy-to-consume entertainment.\nWe accompany an aged Jean-Luc Picard on his last mission, discovering along the way the memories of his second but last mission and see him fail and fall.While STP could be considered a deconstruction of Gene Roddenberry's idealistic vision of the future, it is on the other hand an invitation to discuss some important questions:\n1. Am I obliged to offer humanitarian aid to my enemy?\n2. Is there a point beyond which technology and science should not be allowed to develop?\n3. How should we treat our heroes of yesterday?In all these questions, STP confronts Gene Roddenberry's vision with the reality of the human mind and society. It opposes morals and moral obligations with comfort and prejudice and fear. Should I do what is right, or should I take the easy way? And if the government or council or the powers that be decide to take the easy way, what are the consequences for people who wanted to do what's right? Or for the people that are left behind?STP does not look big budget, it doesn't waste money on guys like Ferengi or Klingons. We see rather ordinary people at their home, or at places that are definitely not worth holding a diplomatic reception. But it has its charms and its style and it offers what ST-TOS also had: Characters, emotions and questions. It tells its tale without giving easy answers, leaving it to the audience to think and decide themselves. From this point of view, it is Star Trek at its best.",

Uhhhh ..... yeah, she dies in the first episode.Plenty of people in the reviews are complaining about this show being darker, more dystopian, than original Trek ... because the Federation made a horrible, difficult decision. But one thing Trek has never shied away from is that humans aren't perfect; and this early on, we only have Picard's POV on what happened. Perhaps this will be a redemption arc for the Federation? Time will tell.I thought the first episode was fantastic: it had a perfect mix of exposition and mystery. It established a sense of Picard as lost, as drifting, and I think that's something else people are struggling with. Nobody likes to see their hero brought low and resigned to that fate.The second episode was a bit slow; not much action, more exploration of the various threads introduced before. But we see the beginning of Picard finding purpose again, struggling to find a way to accomplish what would have been easy for him before he left Starfleet, before he lost his status and power.I think this shows a lot of promise; and I still believe that Patrick Stewart would not have gotten involved if it were going to end up a mess.",

It acknowledges that the universe can be a dark place and even the best of institutions can fall prey to the darker side of our own humanity.I'm shocked at how fantastic the writing is and the cast is blowing it out of the water with amazing moments from so many of the actors.",

But it has enough fan service for me to be entertained and reminisce of my childhoods' favorite Sci-Fi show.\nI understand being angry at this show for not being an exact replica of TNG, but I'm pretty sure if it was it would have had similar results, because the approach on drama in movies and TV series has changed and this show reflects that to some degree.\nIn the end I would say, if you're a hardcore fan of TNG or just Star Trek in general (I am a big fan, but not hardcore), and are not able to set your fanboy opinions aside and just keep an open mind, it's probably best you skip this one.\nThere's only one review here that I agreed with that had a 1 star rating, but very good points on all the flaws of this show, but that to me was contradicting. All the points made would probably give this at least 5 stars, but deliberately give it a 1 star shows that fanboy disappointment I was talking about earlier.\nAnyway, if you have a few hours to kill and are a fan of TNG, give it a watch (all of season 1) and then decide weather you want to keep watching future seasons or not.

            "content": "As a long time Star Trek fan, I was excited to see Jean-Luc Picard back in action. I was sceptical at first and especially after having seen the Star Trek: Discovery crapfest. But I was still hopeful and I figured they can't mess it up twice.. But they did.. and Star Trek: Picard in many aspects is very much worse than Discovery.As with Discovery, the creators managed to destroy everything we've come to like, know and cherish. Again, their inflated ego's are so big, that they just can't build on what has been built already. No, they figure that what they thought of is better.But it is not. It really is not better at all.Stuff that is wrong:Romulans are not Romulans anymore. They got butchered as bad as the Klingons in Discovery. Romulans now wield swords and they are either an elf, a ninja, or Irish humans with pointy ears. Makes sense? No indeed it does not.Sunglasses and vaping, to make clear to the viewer we are dealing with people who are cool and/or edgy. It doesn't get more juvenile than that. Not to mention the sheer lack of imagination here.Female 1 to female 2: \"oh look at him, he's so hot\". Ah, it did get more juvenile.JL. JL. JL. More JL. Who is this JL? It's definitely not Jean-Luc PIcard, because he would never accept or appreciate this, no matter what happened in the last 20 years that magically exists.Females in power everywhere, and they're either nasty, a harlot, or both. The misandry is astounding if you care to look for it.Not a single one of the characters is likeable. NONE. Not even Picard is likeable, who has done nothing but feel shame for 4 episodes and being whipped around like a drunk ensign by nearly everyone in his vicinity, most notably females. But let's face it, this isn't Jean-Luc Picard we're looking at, as another reviewer already aptly pointed out; it's Patrick Stewart, playing himself.All the holograms on the ship are really annoying.Modern day political crap everywhere and everything is dark, dreary, gloomy and depressing. If I want to see more of that, I'll hop on Twitter or watch the news. We don't need this here, at all. What the hell happened to positive, uplifting and hopeful Star Trek? Stuff changes, sure, but when you change certain particular stuff, it loses its identity and in this case stops being Star Trek. The whole premise of this happening to Starfleet is beyond stupid and unbelievable to begin with.Acting performances (and the dialogue) are really bad. Not even Stewart manages to pull off a good performance consistently.The swearing. I don't care about it normally, but I do feel that swearing is a sign of weakness. It never has had a place in Star Trek. There is no reason whatsoever to include it now. If you think you need swearing to make a certain point for a character you created, your lack of skill and imagination is astonishing.Pacing. It's off, really off. I have no problem with a slowburner, but this is not that. This is more likely an astounding lack of content for 10 episodes. When you've seen the trailer, you've basically seen everything noteworthy that happened so far, I'm not even joking.They didn't want to make a reunion show. Yet, the only good things that happened so far is the nostalgia: seeing Data, a glimpse of the old Enterprise and we know we're going to see Riker, Troi and Seven. Take all that away, remove the Star Trek logo and we're left with a crappy sci-fi show that would never have seen the light of day otherwise.I could list more, a lot more, but I'm done. This show sucks, it's so woke it hurts and does not deserve the Star Trek label. What a disappointment. 3/10.",

It's a nice take, and the story starts nicely, peppering snippets of nostalgia along the way. Mentions, easter eggs and friends of days past keep the show ticking over with Stewart acing every line he's given. The theme tune too, is wonderful. The story slowly simmers along. Possibly too slow for some viewers.But the writers seem to waver in and out of what Star Trek is. Every fan has their opinion, and this is of course, is just mine. There's dialogue regarding the passage of time, death and mortality - and this IS what Trek should be, and is. It's thoughtfully written. Poignant. The writers and showrunner get it. But then they throw in unnecessary course, sexual and suggestive language which completely took me out of every episode it featured it - which was quite a few. It's as if the writers believe using this type of language makes a show seem more mature. Like they could not write dialogue to achieve the same goal intelligently. It doesn't belong in Trek, and it's was very, very jarring. Hence the enjoyment level of each episode, and overall rating isn't higher.Hopefully a course correction on that front for season two, or unfortunately this fan is sadly out. I'm happy to let Picard have further adventures without me if the writers continue to pepper this sort of language in the Trek universe. Happy to stick to the hopeful Trek of old I can share with my children, where it can make a positive impression. As Trek should.",

The whole show has been padded-out with false drama around shallow pointless characters in this show which feels and looks like a mish mash of generic fantasy / sci-fi that has nothing to do with Star Trek. Everything is dark grey and half the sets look like an empty black sound stage with a couple of 1980s lazers pointing around and dry ice machines (Oooh it looks edgy and Dystopian like Blade Runner).Another aspect I dislike is that this show (also exec. produced by JJ Abrams) uses the tactic of positing vague irrational mysteries left-right and centre like Lost did, with very few sensible resolutions or pay-offs (until *maybe* the final episode which will no doubt be left mostly un-resolved, as is usually the case) and this is done in an attempt to keep people watching, as a substitute for good writing, good characters, good dialogue....which is the other (now considered 'old fashioned'?) method of keeping people watching.It's bad. Unfortunately my fears have been confirmed that this is produced by the same people who did Discovery and it's nearly as unlikable as I found that show to be. Can't really see that it's going to get any better now. shame. Old Star Trek shows could still have a bad episode now and again, but they were just singular bad episodes.

Romulans, (ex)Borgs and Synthetics seem to be a good starting point for this series, don't you agree?Star Trek: Pickard, I admit, it's been slow-paced (so far), has some incoerences regarding time (stelar dates that don't match and new timelines), and specially it includes one of the most misterious races in the Star Trek universe, the Romulans. (I wonder how some some people would react if the series theme was the Romulan Wars, would they still complaint about violence anf f-bombs?)The 3rd episode just aired and the complaints and the angry speeches allready went too far in my opinion, give the show a chance folks!! I was born in the early 70's, grew up in the 80's and I always watched all the new movies and new series with interest and without any prejudice, exactly as I did this time also.There are people giving 1,2 or 3 stars out of 10 with arguments dificult to understand (specially because 80% of them weren' even born when Star Trek was in it's peak). So I just wanna ask to everyone to be a little more comprehensive and try to understand that new ideas and new concepts will always appear and change over the years, for those that really can't change they're opinions...just don't watch so you don't have to bother to write offensive texts.In my oppinion, it's way too soon to form a clear and final decision regarding the series rating but due to the producing quality, inovotate approach, good SFX and a good attempt to disclosure further more the misterious Romulans, ill give it a solid 6 out of 10 so far.",

In \"Picard,\" yet another once great cultural icon is toppled with the insipid pandering and kitschy bombast of a corporate media giant bent on devouring the last vestiges of authenticity and true creative enterprise.It's difficult to know exactly where to begin sifting through the detritus of this incoherent, steaming heap of refuse. For starters, the childishly awkward use of swear words reflects the limited intelligence and non-existent creativity of the writers. They must suppose the drooling screengazers in lala land are much like themselves and can't tell the difference between compelling stories and bright n' shiny cgi. So why not cater to the lowest common denominator? Evidently the hacks responsible for this drivel can't even be bothered to establish their own original stories and characters with which to bungle. They derive much more immediate gratification demolishing the works of superior creatives who came before them. \"Picard\" is an erratic morass of dimwitted hyperbole, preposterous contrivances, and the hysterical yammerings of lobotomized space brains. \"Picard\" himself is the utterly deconstructed and metaphysically vandalized burning man of the writers' room. At various points I'd ask myself if Kurtzman might have experienced a traumatic psychological disassociation in childhood, somehow centered on the original Picard character; if this \"Picard\" was the subconsciously manifested Lynchian doppelganger in the forgotten dream of a disembodied mind in a parallel reality; if the writers had eaten too many special mushrooms and brownies to know where they were and what they were doing.Sad to see this once noble, inspiring character fall into the corporate media abyss. This corrupted antipicard, and the miserable future he inhabits, is the pathetic reflection of a society in a state of decline and decay. He is the personification of the intellectual stultification and creative bankruptcy of the writers and producers of this series, the media, and contemporary art and culture in general. In the end, \"Picard\" has boldly gone where no literate fan of thought provoking scifi has gone or ever will go to.",

Not mapping stars and studying nebulae, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.\"Star Trek Picard did a great job of merging the history and elements of the Next Generation and Voyager and a nod to DS9 (use of 3D console) with the look and feel that was the JJ Abrams and Discovery. It used a familiar theme of man vs machine as the plot, but in my humble opinion, Q's test was not the viability of the show, but the audience and fan's ability to chart and accept the possibilities with a new generation and new look and feel.The acting is great. The music and dialog are great. The special effects and use of commercial stock images and videos are palatable and clever. The chemistry between the Previous (former Next) Generation and this New Generation is good, witty and feels real. Just as I could day dream that I was in a storyline of the other franchises, I am able to day dream the same of this one. To me, that is an indication of a quality show.Be open minded, and take a leap of faith with this show.\nInvest in its future and soul, you will not be disappointed.",

There was talk about the rights of androids and synthetic people, ok, nice, this is the kind of dilemmas Star Trek does very well. I'm glad it starts to talk about subjects like that again. It was a good sign, I thought to myself that a new Star Trek show is going in the right direction, finally.Like some people already wrote here episode 2 was blabla and more bla, talk talk talk and no substance. Bo-ring. Then came episode 3 and again, nothing interresting happened. At least the first episode had a little action but episodes 2 and 3 had none. This is getting annoying. I have some patience left but please don't abuse it.Some of the new actors are fine but this show needs to get better and fast. Personally the \"F\" word didn't upset me that much, although it surprised me a bit, I must admit. But since it shocked so many people, maybe it's not a good idea to use it again. Doctor McCoy often said \"Damn it Jim\" and people weren't that offended about it so why not use \"damn it\" instead ? It's just a suggestion. Just sayin'Even the strenghs of the show are not properly acknowledged. Come on, you had \"Hugh the Borg\" on screen (on episode 3) for the first time in maybe 20 years and they acted like it's not a big deal, it is a big deal, I almost didn't recognized the actor and I loved him so much back in the day.Please, please, please, make Seven Of Nine appearances matter and do integrate some of the old TNG 's familiar faces very fast before my interrest vanishes through the airlock because I'm very close to jump out of this show if it doesn't improve pretty quickly.Especially after so many failures in the Trek universe (Enterprise, Discovery, the new Timeline movies), this Star Trek show cannot afford to fail or it really will be the end of the Trek we all know and love !",

This is a new age, sci-fi action drama filled with nostalgia.Second, as a sci-fi, it is okay.I blame the writing, story pacing, and editing for delivering a badly paced beginning, and bad character development, motivations etc. Near the end, you can piece together the reasons and motives for our characters, but imo, it is too late.Also, like synth war? Yes please, show me more of that. Show me how all the main characters are affected by it. SHOW ME! Lots of talking but...Why didn't you show me....? Sci fi opportunity fail here. Big war no show. Just a few cgi laser beams.Onto the overall story...Anyone can argue, why is this story being told? News flash, every story ever has been told already, so no new groundbreaking ideas are going to come up any time soon. However, that's no excuse for poor storytelling though. ;)Some episodes stand out. Particularly with Jerri Ryan. She gets a full on motivated revenge arc. Remove seven of nine and replace her with generic girl type with same revenge arc, and it would still be satisfying to see her blast her once evil lover into tiny burnt pieces. Story done right. Too bad it was just an add on, a ride along if you will, to the actual main plot.Nostalgic actors bring...well nothing, expect GOOD ACTING. Damn...so they bring in good actors to do nothing, but then we can compare them to the subpar acting of the rest of the main cast... Yikes...The organization of this thing is just plain off. All the ingredients are there, they just cooked them wrong.It seems like i'm being very harsh, but really, a lot of campy sci-fis are like this. And it's still action packed, and the cinematography is good. And i mean, come on Patrick Stewart is great. Villain Vulcans and Romulans. Nice. There is a lot to like.But I suppose the fact that it's in the Star Trek universe is a double edged bat'leth.So 6/10 for me.",

We have a new cast, Jean-Luc needs to get his crew together. This hasn't been done elegantly but its done after episode 5 and they get on with the story, and oh boy its fantastic.For any TNG fan I dare you to watch episode 7 and not smile.

A starting point for a much deeper and interesting story that has rocked the federation.Patrick Stewart is insane, the man is nearly 80 and as strong as an ox. His performance is beyond impeccable.

We sat down and watched reruns of the next generation. Current episodes of deep space nine. New episodes of voyager back in my day. The last season of TNG was airing when I was born in July of '93. But before I could even speak I was watching Star Trek. Constantly. I found the remake of '09 to be quite good but different. And I remember my first bits of difficulty with the franchise while watching Enterprise. It wasn't my cup of tea. Neither was Star Trek five. Into darkness was great until I saw it with a date as I facepalmed during the finale. I tried not to be such a nerd. But she started to notice I was literally announcing the lines to a movie I've never seen before that day. It's because it straight up ripped off Wrath of Khan. And I have been wary of Trek ever since. I can see how some people have woes about Discovery, but I don't get it with this show. I read nothing but terrible reviews on here. And it's beginning to worry me. This show is nothing but good. People need to realize this isn't Star Trek from 33 years ago. Picard isn't the same. You're not the same. The set pieces are brilliant. The dialogue is more than fine and the cameos and appearances do nothing but fill me with joy as a fan of Trek. There's no way a show can ruin a show from 33 years ago.

The plot and script, pandering to a particular audience which didn't care about Star Trek, failed to generate interest to continue watching S1 and altogether skip S2, despite some excellent production values in this first episode.All of which Paramount obviously knew. So in order to bring in ratings it looked to what worked for this final season of PIC. Mindful of the response 2022's *Top Gun: Maverick* (TGM) brought in theaters, PIC S3E1 succeeded in reaching out to more viewers by blatantly incorporating 1982's *Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan* into The Next Generation (TNG), using the same excellent production values of S1E1 and bringing in familiar - at least to some - TNG cast.And so far that plagiarism is presented very well. Hopefully future episodes of S3 are as entertaining as this one. At least a few of them combined will hopefully make for a great IMAX film, just as TGM is.",

I felt happiness, anger, sadness and excitement throughout the series. I found myself involved in and unwinding the messages it presented, which gave real immersion to my experience.

I'm 38 so I grew up on TNG, Voyager, DS9 & Enterprise & continue to watch reruns to this very day, Ty BBC for keeping the STU alive, but I also appreciate high intensity, great CG, immersive sets & costume design, stellar acting, incredible storyline and the full 9 that is today's TV & film style. So I'm in love with this new marriage of the original essence of the show with today's awesome film making technology. I think CBS kept every generation of fans in mind during the creation of this show, while also attracting a new younger generation of Trekkies to the screen. And I greatly appreciate that the network actually listened to us over the train wreck that was Discovery & really tried to deliver a better & truer 2020 version of the STU that kept much closer to the soul of what Star Trek is.

            "content": "Just finished watching the Season Finale so now that i've see the entire serious i feel like i can give it a fair and balanced review, without any spoilers.Having grown up with TNG, Voyager, and all those good trek vibes i was pretty excited for when Star Trek Discovery was announced. However i couldn't make myself finish the first season without feeling the need to keep a puke bucket next to me constantly. So when Picard was announced i had already resigned myself to the fact that CBS was going to find a new way to ruin my childhood and a national cultural legacy. However, after watching the show, i can honestly say it could have been a lot worse. Yes there were some unnecessarily dark moments, Picard and other returning characters are totally \"out of their character\", but i understand that the writers can't sit and watch every TNG episode and need a bit of flexibility, so i tried to be lenient. In the end i appreciated the attempt they had at actually having characters with good moral fiber who are trying to do the right thing as they explore issues that are relevant and relateable to us today, looking at it from both point of views instead of shoving one in your face, like old Star Trek was all about. The storyline was interesting enough to keep me engaged, and overall i thought the production quality was good and the ending satisfying. The characters are far less obnoxious and know-it-all than they are in STD.\nWhat i didn't like was how many of the core settings and principles of Star Trek were thrown out the window. The Federation didn't feel like an Utopia anymore, somehow money, drugs, and utter selfishness snuck their way back into Federation Space, and Picard is treated like some old relic of an age long past when the Federation was at its best Utopian potential. That is not what the Federation was ever meant to be at all, and that's what made Star Trek always stand out, especially now in a world full of grotesquely dark TV series that leave you more stressed out than you were during a busy workday. It is clear in TNG that Picard was just one of many \"stellar\" federation captains and crew members around the galaxy, but any evidence of that is long lost in Picard. Star Trek was great because it gave you a preview of what things could be like if humanity as a whole started to leave the things that make it suck in the past (war, poverty, corruption, etc) and instead embraced a higher and better way. If Q came along and put humanity on trial in STP, they would not pass.\nOne thing that really bothered me was the total lack of respect that was given to the once fearsome yet awe-inspiring Captain Picard. Gone are the days where ensigns would cower before the pillar of Leadership himself. Everytime Rafi calls Picard \"JL\" i die inside, and i'm missed that Picard would even allow anyone to use such a term to address him. Now Picard goes on \"undercover missions\" dressed up like the village clown ready to make a fool of himself at the local bar, totally lacking any of the Starfleet dignity that once endowed him.\nThe second out of character figure that was really upsetting was seven of nine. She went from a mostly emotionless, rigid, and logical ex-borg struggling to become human again (a journey with many parallels to data) to a vengeance-seeking space cowgirl who speaks and dresses like someone who grew up in some ranch in Montana. She would never have become a slave to her emotions. I'm glad that Admiral Janeway wasn't around to see her like this, because if she was, rest assured she would think that 4 TV seasons of hard work and tutoring had all gone to waste.\nEven thought the show was mediocre at best, i did enjoy it, especially towards the end where the plot starts to unfurl and things start to lighten up considerably. Heck, i even started to like space Legolas and Dr. Jurati and even the sour-faced Captain of La Sirena.\nIf this is your first exposure to Star Trek, you might enjoy it more than i do.\nLive Long and Prosper!",

They seem to be wanting to make the Federation look as awful as possible, to create the biggest obstacle possible for Picard, but it ruins the entire spirit of Star Trek in the process.Also, juvenile writing, acting and editing. some parts are fine, but some of the writing is so sophomoric it seems like it is written by film students... in high school.Jean Luc is always great, but they made the Federation the enemy and ruined the very thing about Star Trek that made it great. It's ability to inspire humanity to aspire to a form of greatness where we have transcended our baser instincts. This is a Federation that might as well be run by Trump, Nixon, and Kissinger.Edit: OK, so remember when I said up above that this show seemed like it was written by high school students?

If you're offended by cursing, then stay away from this show (and most anybody over the age of 12 these days). If it agitates you to see a man getting beat up by a woman, that's probably more about you than the show and you should probably seek therapy.That's not to say that it's been a great show, thus far, by any means. Honestly, I'm drained from watching. Episode one was good--a little strife, intrigue, mystery. Episode 2, 3 and 4, however, are basically Picard reuniting with a character from his past who is enraged at him for trying his best to do his job. Ok, we get it, toes were stepped on. Do we have to dedicate 25% of each episode to Picard apologizing and reiterating his decision-making process?BUT, my hope is that after all this tiresome set-up of characters has been completed, the show will return to the promise of the first episode. But, for sure, if you absolutely have to have The Next Generation 2.0, where the good guys and bad guys are clearly delineated, where hope and prosperity is all that is in store for the human race and the Federation, where manners always trump emotion, keep moving, this isn't your show.",

Some have complained he is spoken down to by some of the woman from Starfleet but I see it as an opportunity to take these bad apples down in future episodes. He is forever a gentleman.I'm old enough to remember watching the original ST and spin off shows and I don't think the new series disrespects the older shows in any way.I looked at it as an origin story for the next chapter and I can't wait to see where it goes.

I suspect they do.Picard is old and feeble. Maybe they have him that way to contrast the difference between the (from previews, not a spoiler) retired Picard and the Picard that returns to space. Of course Patrick Stewart is about to turn 80, so I shouldn't expect him to do much outside of talking and saying, \"engage.\" When a group of bad guys appear in episode one, Picard mostly stands around while a young girl does all the butt-kicking. It feels odd seeing the main protagonist watching the fight and not backing up others.Of course, this was only the first episode - it certainly has potential to get better. My \"3\" is a bit low, it's more of a 5 or 6. Seeing all the 10/10 reviews written like they came from a studio marketing department is annoying. Critic reviews are not reliable - they can be bitter and unable to appreciate fun shows. I count on the \"regular people\" reviews when deciding what to watch. If they start filling up with artificially high reviews from some marketing department I have one less reliable source when looking for a good show to watch.",

What gave this series promise was continuing the conversation around Data being a sentient being that dominated the first few TNG series but if you look back to those episodes it's almost taken for granted that he is and therefore the viewer also takes it for granted but it was really a massive thing! Therefore I'm glad that this seems to be the focus of this new series and I hope that future episodes slow down to reflect on what it is to be a sentient being - what it is to be alive and this is the best of Trek when they stop to consider these things rather than massive CGI space battles - peoples' imaginations are far more powerful than pixels put together on film and made the focus of the plot.

Partially because the next generation cast is here. Come on we love them so much Star Trek the next generation was the number one rated show in television history and they brought us adventures to remember forever.Star Trek Picard season one though being different and modern actually maintained some of its roots and once again this was promised. There were moments my heart was singing because the past and present meets quite well in this new story for its first season. I'm glad I that I am here to witness this and to see a sci-fi adventure not spoiled and ruined with social situations that are totally corrupted as Star Trek discovery chose to go down.If you thought you may be skeptical watch the series 1st season again go ahead watch it for a second time you will get more out of it and you will get more passionate I'm positive because that's what happened to me. The first time around your little in disarray watch it again and it just comes to life jumps off the screen and pulls you into it.

The conspiracy dealing with Romulans and artificial intelligence was intriguing, but felt a little convoluted and rushed given they had to unwind it all so quickly. Personally, I wish it didn't deal so exclusively with Romulans and Borg gave us a little more variety -- but that might be my own yearning for the \"episode of the week\" format that classic Trek follows.All that said, I enjoyed this series and appreciate all it was trying to accomplish.",

Over the years, I have found that some of the series of Star Trek (not all of them at the same level) have been a good source of inspiration or reflexion concerning our civilisation or world, its evolution and its level of ethics. I was a bit doubtious while considering the commentaries that were not always positive. I should say that when I got past the fifth episode, I had to go through the end of the season through the night I got to this point... Why? I understood afterwords that if Patrick Stewart agreed to this series and its participation in it, it was worthwile in some fashion... The people involved in this series, as Jonathan Frakes, are, I think, true believers of the star trek values, and it shows... Of course, some of the decisions taken concerning survival issues seem to be based upon the fact that Star Trek TNG actors are aging (every sentient being wants to survive... why wouldn't Data?). Nevertheless, overall, this series is quite true to the values put forwards by the Star Trek franchise. It reminds me of the movie \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and the words said by Peter O'tool: \"Nothing is written\", after saving a young arabian devoted to Lawrence from the desert, in opposition with every other arabians who considered his expected death as fate (as Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali), which is what Picard is putting forward... \"History is repeating itself\" is not a fact if our future actions are evaluated analytically and with full \"humanity\". The future is not determined and depends upon our actions. One individual can sometimes substancially change the course of a civilisation.",

Well, it is somewhat understandable if you just expect the next generation (TNG) style from the start, but sadly these people fail to discover the impressive _real_ development and the deeper meaning of the whole first season - which truly is a great piece of film making! (I say this as a classic fan of The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, Enterprise...)For instance to quote one of those unfortunately failed reviews in my view: \"Star Trek Corrupted ... of the 5 episodes aired so far, I'm giving up on it.\" - Please come back and see the real brightness of the true Star Trek, which unfolds in the excellent last episodes! You should really understand that light comes after darkness! Do not give up. Without giving away much details (no spoiler): The show IS much about overcoming dark times, the federation being somehow corrupted etc., a bit like we have already seen dark sides of the federation in the late seasons of DS9.Picard offers great characters and different perspectives, much deeper than the flat figures in Discovery for instance. You get good acting, many nice details, modern visuals and a really classic Trek feel (just darker at the start than usual). The storyline features intelligent twists and a meaningful psychology. Basically my only critique is that the pacing is a bit too slow in the first episodes, but that is a minor point overall. For me the first season of Picard really connects to the great times of Next Generation if you watch it to the end. The ending is marvellous and clears the way to a \"classic style\" new Enterprise-like season in my opinion.Engage!",

I wonder what will befall next weeks black romulan The show is reeking of racism and I guess the scriptwriters are all white in Hollywood fashion. I expected better but my advice would fe to release the whole series at once as this isn't worth waiting for.Shockingly bad",

Haunted by Data's death and still angry at Starfleet for banning all synthetic life, Picard maintains an unfulfilling life at his family chateau in France. When a young woman comes to him for help, Picard is drawn into a mission which reopens old wounds from his assimilation by the Borg, uncovers centuries- old Romulan plots and sets him on a course for a new destiny which will reunite him with old friends, new enemies and a rediscovery of himself.This is a very different kind of Trek and a very welcome change of pace. While this does feature the same kind of action and cinematic feel as Discovery, it is also beautiful, contemplative and slow burning. The supporting cast are wonderful and intriguing in equal measure. Star Trek Picard also ties together elements from all previous incarnations of the franchise while expanding the universe in a whole new direction.It did not disappoint and I'm eager for season 2.",

In the end it was a story of how the federation lost its way because of fear yet they still came through in the end, doing what was fundamentally morraly right.The basis of startrek has always been about being better than we are, striving to be morally better, picard lived up to this and showed that people can still be redeemed.I think the low reviewers have not even given this a chance, they have just jumped on the \"this is not startrek\" bandwagon.At least they have left politics out of it, and there is no cringy pc stereotypes like Discovery either.",

My first review, after the first show was good but not any more. Moreover I find the violence in this show disgusting (The lady that was removing parts from a former borg almost made me puke).

            "content": "I never cared for the original Star Trek, I admit it. But I loved the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager so much I have watched them at least twice each (which, for how shows used to run and seven seasons each is a bit of a commitment). Enterprise was...good; Enterprise was good, I think I can say that. The new Star Trek movies...I mean, if they weren't Star Trek, maybe? And I should add I've not watched Discovery. But this feels...I want to say like coming home, but that isn't quite right because coming home is an end, a return. This is more of an opening up, a broadening. This is what should have happened after Enterprise, and before the entertainment industry got so bloody reboot happy. I don't know where this series or this franchise goes from here, but if only for this one brief season I am filled with a hope that the deep and beautiful potential that was TNG, DS9, & Voyager are once again being lived up to, and possibly even surpassed. I would say if you are an old fan watch it, but I simply cannot imagine someone who loved TNG needing to be told to do so.Afterthought: I wrote this before reading any of the other reviews, and...I don't want to let this devolve into social commentary, but for the sake of something good and wonderful: it is profoundly disheartening to see the extent to which we live in an era of profound cynicism. No, nothing is ever really perfect, and no, we cannot go back to our loves of the past. As someone who deeply loves Star Wars, I am sickened by what has been done to those movies, and I all too thoroughly understand the violation of art out of ignorance or for personal profit, yet I nonetheless hold out hope as some better shows have come around. I cannot for the life of me understand how someone who likes Star Trek could watch this series and come away saying such awful things unless their heart is simply full of bile. This series is different, it has a different tone, true, but it also has a deep sense of meaning, purpose, and theme. It is not an empty and flashy quick sell, nor is it a pandering to nostalgia. I love the older series of Star Trek in much the way as I love an old friend, and it is this same sense of feeling that has made me so sick with many of the new Star Trek and Star Wars movies: they are empty, artless, soulless, and targeted only toward gathering as much money as they can. This series truly has both heart and art, and it is a shame that those so filled with toxic cynicism cannot appreciate something so wonderful and precious in an era where so much good art has withered and died.",

I really wanted to like Star Trek Discovery, but it quickly became too manic, action packed. It felt too much like the new movies and not at all like the television shows, especially Next Generation.Picard is starting out at a much more even keel, with more character development and a slower pace with a plot I can wrap my mind around. It is really good to see Picard again trying to solve a mystery fraught with moral delima. However, it is not at all (at least yet) about space exploration-- and so it is missing some of the heart that made the original series so great.However, Michael Chabon is doing a great job here. But is it just me, or is he such an egomaniac that he put himself in the show not once but twice. I mean the pilot and hologram characters, who to me are dead ringers for Chabon. I think this goes to the artist, like Chabon, putting himself into his work allowing himself to work out a relationship with the world he is trying to create. I don't know if this is a strength or a weakness, but I am sure that is what is going on here.I hope in future episodes that Picard keeps its even pacing and it would be nice to see some of the old cast and crew, though I understand why they chose to introduce new characters.",

Moreover important issues aren't handled with the ease you see in TNG.\nOf course Sar Trek: Picard also ends with its kumbaya ending. But frankly, the rest of the series makes it digestable. You start with a detective, a puzzle that needs solving. The story keeps you wondering what will happen in the next episode. That alone already makes it more modern that the original series.\nPatrick Stewart's cracked voice needs a bit getting used to. The actor is getting old and you notice it. Of course he's a great actor but that doesn't mean it's credible to have a man of his age running around and fighting the way his character is.\nNevertheless it's nice how they didn't do a retake on the old concept and tried to make it more realistic.

This was something I liked and could get behind, but then it goes into a Blade Runner themed naughty replicants/synthetic humans who for some reason are involved in the destruction of the Mars colony. It does not stop there, it then goes into a plot of a top of the range replicant which has links to Data, and if you are familiar with the story of Blade Runner, like me you might start rolling your eyes.I don't wish to be a cynic but I do fear that this could ruin the Star Trek franchise and it was the fan base who demanded a new Picard/TNG story to blame/",

What constitutes life, are some lives worth saving more than others, and what should we decide to do with the precious gift of life? What is the responsibility of organizations like Starfleet in thag respect? And what is our responsibility as individuals when those organizations fail?

There is more cruelty in the universe, more crime etc. (especially episode 5) And yet, as the story unfolds, there is a hope in the darkness.

It's not what it was or it's just not such-n-such in reference to the show that they were ultimately expecting to see renewed is usually the remarks that are forced upon the reluctant recipient.Having transported now nearly all his time & life through space respectively. The once mighty and affluent Jean-Luc Picard is presently earth bound and in a retiring stoic state mostly due to an accident that has afflicted his interactions with the real worlds he used to know. During an interview about his past transgressions an outburst erupts & ignites his path to reconnect with the faculties and factions he fought along side. This breach of his exterior leads him on his new path with a sparsely set trial left to his subconscious by his old non-human friend Data. Through an interactive coherent dream, coincided by an interruption of one of the androids daughters who is also a hyper-improved albeit illegitimate form of Artificial Intelligence. Seeing that Jean-Luc is now a much envisioned old man he must enlist the cohorts of a past and present to uncover an alien conspiracy within the federation he loved so dearly.This role fits Patrick Stuart well hinting at his age prominently adding an enlisted sense of his spherical simple stoic side much as he did in X23 with Hugh Jackmans belligerent spent wolverine. A few old faces from alternative time lines and a whole host of new interesting ones who inherently semi-remind you of some fragment of a previous trek. Sharp deep & wounded if a little charged figures mixed with dark new wonderful characters have this mellow-drama/Sci-fi action take on a new premise for a Star Trek series, television has boldly gone to where no man has gone before this just happens to go that extra light year or two. As homages come and go and new tv shows emerge in to a golden age were reminded that age isn't the distortion or the distraction it once was.

I'm 5 episodes in and it feels like a bad version of The Expanse, I'd rather watch that.The Raffi character is absolutely generic, playing out the disgruntled ex-military service type, who begrudgingly joins the protagonist. The most irritating aspect about her is that she can't bring herself to say \"Jean-Luc\", too much of a mouthful apparently.Take interesting concepts like the Federation, Borg collective, AI or any scientific idea and don't use them to develop the Star Trek universe. Instead rely on soap opera drama and homogenize the story lines with a good dose of today. Its supposed to be the future, one I would hope to be part of. For crying out loud... the characters interact with holographic Ads... that reminds me of TODAY, all the garbage of today! Why would anyone want that in a Star Trek episode.

Its almost as if had simply skipped the last 25 years following TNG's ending and continued where Picard continues, you wonder where the times are gone! The quality of the acting and writing is far superior to many of the \"Star Trek\" formats out there. You notice within five minutes of watching. Whether its the case of being so pleased to see Jean Luc Picard back or if its a case of simply enjoying the characters like a pair of well-worn boots. However, the constructs of the initial storyline and the Easter Egg at the end left me screaming \"NO\" at the TV, waking half the house up and looking to see when the next episode is on.Not to give spoilers out, yet the good old TNG action and storyline resumes two decades after the events of Nemesis. Picard having trouble with his dreams starts to mix reality and replaying historical events we all saw through the lifetime of TNG. Some of the old favourites are back, No.1 is still his trusty sidekick, although we can laugh at it when all said and done.In the end, superior all round, we'll worth full marks!",

It's got the same characters sure, but tells a new story.This show is new, but doesn't tread on the old.

I remember when each Episode of TNG had a reason and a moral lesson but now it seems they are trying to turn it into a long and drawn out feature film. It just doesn't work. Face it, when Gene died so did any semblance of the Star Trek we know and loved.This is so painful to watch. If you are new to Star Trek try watching The Next Generation first then watch this.

From my point of view, it has perfectly captured the essence of the saga, making room for it in the presentation of a more realistic futuristic world.I still love TOS, but it's hard to see nowadays, TNG is getting older..., so this new look makes perfect sense. (Though I still keep on watching the old series continuously...). In fact at first I rejected TNG after spending years watching TOS, Kirk was my captain... but Picard made me change my mind, so I could not see again TOS in the same way. Now we experience the same, the evolution, but I'm accepting this perfectly naturally. We have the chance to take advantage of this perfectly shaped character called Picard.Thanks for the production, the first episode has touched me, perfect.",

And not gonna lie but, some of the so called classic star trek is boring.The show is great and makes you invested in the characters. There is action but not excessive which makes Picard instantly better than Discovery. The only main issue I have with the show is the F bombs dropped by certain characters, it just doesn't suit their personality.I know the show is being picked up for another season which to me seems very unnecessary given the way the first season ended.

The spirit of the series is not only perfectly preserved - a rare thing indeed - but the ideas, storytelling, camera work, and CGI have evolved and advanced, positively. Dialogue is at times highly intellectual, aimed more definitely at an educated adult audience - something I really appreciated. And themes and characters, so familiar to any Trekkie, are delicately and delightfully woven into the story as it progresses.\nWhile I could offer many more compliments to all involved in the production, I'm not blind to the few faults it does have. The dialogue and performance by one actress in particular are more akin to a b-grade soapie. It's a real pity, but thankfully these scenes are few and far between (and I think she gets wiped out eventually) and didn't detract in any significant way from my complete absorption in and enjoyment of this fabulous experience.",

He didn't want it too look anything like TNG and it is fresh and inspiring for the franchise.\nIt is also an interesting take on the Romulans and Borg. I read several reviews about bad writing, but the story is so creative at every level. Shame on all of you during a time like this. The world needs Star Trek forever and we should be praising this show and the newness it brings. Seeing Picard, Data, Riker and Troi again warmed my heart and it made me smile so much. I never thought it would happen. All of you anti-fans need to change your reviews and give this show the proper review it deserves. TNG wasn't perfect at first and we all stuck with it to watch it grow into an amazing show. Picard has great new characters and is trying to meld together all that has happened in the Star Trek Universe. You guys are so picky with your ridiculous comments. It is a tv show made for our enjoyment and it was entertaining with really good special effects.

It's definitely not a traditional Star Trek show, but I bet they did this because there is already the Discovery(show) going on as \"traditional\" version of Star Trek. This one is more real, more connecting with reality, and storyline in a way much more like TNG then Voyager or DS9, but with interesting enough subplot(of both UFP internal politics and galactic politics). Writing is great, acting and dialogue are also super. There seem to have a habit to put some \"action\" in to every episode(on 6 now), I think they did this because they afraid some people might find episode lack of action boring.One important thing I suggest every people does is watch the show and form your own opinions! There seem to some type review bombing going on here(and same ppl keep saying Picard shows numbers has be manipulated,lol!), now days one cant really trust review numbers any more. But I like that studio have the balls to try something new. Same was like DS9, breaking the illusion of perfect paradise. But you will get some heat and hate because the different way you go.Also there seem to disturbing many \"review bombing\" this show because the strong women in the show, and calling this show driving feminist agenda? o.O. LoL! It always hilarious when some people can be scared off by strong female characters...",

            "content": "Star Trek Picard feels like a sort of fan fiction written enthusiastically by children that grew up loving Star Trek without actually understanding what it was all about or what made it great. In that, I'm not speaking of social issues, which of course have always been a corner stone to the Star Trek universe (I've been seeing that as an awkward counterpoint to many notes of criticism), but rather a depth of story and breadth of imagination born of developed and mature characters and narratives that provoked thought and expanded perspective. I started watching Star Trek Picard expecting/hoping for a new story with that same (or perhaps even greater) degree of thoughtfulness and sophistication, featuring the 90s character representative of the pinnacle of that thoughtfulness and intelligence, Picard himself. What I got instead was a rag-tag crew of misfits (Picard included) racing their way through a tumultuous plot progression of fan-pleasing reference points and half-witted dialogue written, apparently, with no more thought or artistry than what was absolutely necessary to create the next drab bridge point in plot; A plot ripe with fan favourite references and surface level social commentary, but utterly absent in depth, development, or inspiration.Perhaps I can't speak for all Star Trek fans. Perhaps I can't even speak for most. But, for my own part, the thing that stings most about this new era of Star Trek isn't the social commentary that everyone's been obsessing over; It isn't the hyper-stylized lens-flare, or the new uniforms; It's not even the casting or the ship design or the countless threats to continuity. The thing that stings most is that while I've gotten 30+ years older since I first fell in love with this expansive and dynamic sci-fi franchise, gaining wisdom and experience all the way, Star Trek has, at best, reverted. While I've gotten older and more discerning, Star Trek has gotten younger and more child-like. Softer, and less sophisticated. It's become... puerile. And I hate that. I hate the implication. That Star Trek fans somehow don't need depth. That we don't need sophistication. That the original Star Trek was \"silly\" and so it should all be \"silly\" and needn't be more than that. That we should all somehow be satisfied with... comic book fan fiction. Perhaps that's the idea. Perhaps Star Trek today is for a different audience. My children, rather than myself. But when I was a boy watching that big, beautiful ship drift out of space dock, it wasn't just for me at all... it was for everyone. My parents, my grandparents, my friends. Star Trek's lost that. At least as far as I'm concerned. And that's sad.",

I really have felt of late that most shows revolve around everyone being a detective or a hit man. Having a show with different ideas and creativity is really noticeably refreshing.\nThey did take liberties with the general aesthetic of previous star treks and merging with a modern touch so it kind of felt a little off in that way. When you look at \"next generation\" it has a kinder, gentler touch. Picard makes a nod to that, I believe, in the amazing cameo with Number one.\nOverall the writing and the way they weaved it all together is really great.

I'm not going to get into how this doesn't feel like Star Trek or get into a twist about F'bombs being dropped into the show (which never bothered me) or how some characters have very thick accents that don't suit them.All of that doesn't really matter. What matters is the writing, the story and whether or not Picard is truly 'our' Picard that we remember from the show.Well, no, he isn't. He's aged, but not like a fine wine. And that's the problem; part of it is Patrick Stewart's performance, which isn't bad, but it certainly doesn't scream Picard. It's as if he's playing another character entirely, or himself!However, most of the blame goes to the writing and the supporting cast. Good god its awful. And it gets worse as the season goes on. The writing is shockingly simplistic and linear with no depth, no substance; no character.Characters feel like they've been ripped out of cliche tropes we've seen time and time again. Examining the credits of the writers, its apparent that a lot of them worked on Discovery.I liked Discovery. It was flawed, and had its moments of increasingly bad writing, but the grittyness of it and a strong cast (not talking about Burnham) saved it for me.Which surprises me to see how wrong they got it for Picard. I can't really go into how they really ham-fisted in some character romances without going into spoiler territory. Really really forced it in there and it made no sense.Plot was drivel and uninteresting. Decent premise ruined by cliche sci-fi tropes we have seen before that really did not need to be touched upon for what should have been a sensitive yet thrilling experience in Picard's last voyage.Patrick Stewart wanted to draw inspiration from Logan when he signed up for this.I'm sorry to say, as much as I loved Logan, there is none of that in here. It has none of Logan's gritty charm and rather than being influenced by it, the writers took their modern sensibilities and crammed it into Picard.And that is why I am not looking forward to Season 2.

My bar was set low, and I was very happy to say right-hand say that, upon watching the first few episodes of series one, I was pleasantly surprised. The story had a fair amount of intrigue, a lot of the dear old actors from the ST franchise, and NG in particular, and I found it quite engaging and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.I was very pleased that they continued into series two. This time, however, it seemed to start quite slow for me. Perhaps I should have watch series one again before beginning series two. That may have helped to get me back into the mindset and environment.As series two progressed I found the storyline a little too fantastic, but, at the same time, it was still entertaining, and allowed me to gain my ST fix.Each series gives me the impression and comes across like a mega-length episode of ST:NG. Sometimes it can feel a little slow, however they pace also takes TV r opportunity to delve deeper into some of the pasts of the main characters, and that is interestIng in itself.Overall I am really enjoying watching this ST Picard. It's totally worth a binge watch on a rainy day, or, in my case, where I have been forced to lay up for a few days after suffering a bad fall.I do hope others feel the same and enjoy it as much as I have. It's been fun and a good story.At the end of the day people need to remember that this is totally fictional, and, if taken too seriously, it will only lead to disappointment.",

These writers have lost sight of what it truly means to tell intelligent stories, ones that don't involve profane and immature reactions. Star Trek is set in a universe where the most wise and the most experienced use their unified skills to achieve seemingly impossible solutions. It's supposed to be, anyway.

I hope this will change during the upcoming episodes.Same goes for the \"old\" characters of TNG. Old trekkies aren't properly served with Star Trek Zeitgeist yet.There is plenty of room for this new series to develop. Although, there are some flaws within the first episode (strange action scenes, weird adoption of old technology freshly made for younger spectators and so forth) i am more than confident this new series will have a bigger impact than Star Trek: Discovery and surely Star Trek: Enterprise.",

I know there are others on the writing teams too and I think they presented a fresh story that new fans can get into w out watching every ST 2000xs like I have; but us hard core fans had plenty of canon and call backs tonight to satisfy2) Patrick Stewart was artful and showed his acting prowess out of the gate. And the cast tonight rose to his level.3) Great locations, action and tech. Warm tones and colors and a reflective opening theme song.4) A thoughtful, promising, engaging and very well done first show. I tried to have no expectations and didn't think to much about what it might be. Tonight's premiere was thoroughly enjoyable and I'm excited for this series to Boldly Go!!!",

It is woke agenda pushing, poorly written, in cohesive soap style garbage in a sci fi theme with the Star Trek logo put onto it. Jean Luc is a big push over and shouted and pounded at by EVERY female character in the series (men are bad okay!!). His legacy is gone and is actively being crushed! A trailer trash hippy calls him JL, an all female powered Star Fleet spit in his face and scenes dedicated in showing the fact that people do not know one of the biggest legacy captains the Star Trek universe has ever seen...only a couple of years earlier within the time line! In gods name...why? Why call a series Star Trek Picard and then both crap on Star Trek...and Picard.There is simply too much wrong to mention here but as a life long Star Trek fan I feel highly disappointed. If you like a quick rush, shallow, sci fi themed soap opera, then this series is for you. If you are looking to once again feel like watching a Star Trek series like you use to (OST, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterpise), then stay miles away from this nonsense as it will only frustrate and disappoint you.I say it again, shame on everyone involved!",

This has some great characters, least of which obviously, is (Patrick Stewart) the aging Jean-Luc Picard, but also a much more grounded 7-of-9. Oh, and a peculiar young fellow that keeps reminding me of, Dwayne 'the rock' Johnson in something where he acted as a spider or something. Anyway, this dudes character, played by Evan Evagora, is a bit clich\u00e9 as 'Elnor'. Raised by a sisterhood that taught him their ways, which hold him and Picard in good stead for their journey, I hope to see more of him. We have appearance by some of the Next Generation crew, (yes, some did end up living happily ever after) but it doesn't diminish the story.

The Original James Tiberon Kirk played by WS in comparison was a simple brute.TNG gave Star Trek the intellectual density back that GR originally intended. See also later non Star Trek related later works of him (Andromeda, Earth - The Final conflict).The other later Star Trek Commanders like Benjamin Sikso and Kathreen Janeway are also far better than the original Captain Kirk, but both do not rise to Jean Luc Picard.I personally have the feeling - while I cannot prove it - that Patrick Stewart really identified himself with his role. And since he was via TNG the most successful Captain for Paramount - he was given the previledge to modify Jean Luc Picard in the TNG series. And so the real Jean Luc Picard was born, which is clearly visible in the later TNG series.A man with a deep personal history (Chateau, Family, Wine Maker) who was raised with the objective to open his eyes and to keep this eyes forever open, and the utmost importance to become and to stay a responsible person.His determination to fulfill his obligations is also visible in the later Star Trek cinema films, in which Jean Luc Picard appears.Now the series PICARD tries to relate to this great history. And I have to say in this regard, PICARD is far better than Discovery, although I have to concede that the Commander that for the first time resembled this deep personal history and this felt true conception of someone taking really responsibility is Micheal Burnham in DISCOVERY.So I have to admit that I like both.My personal order of Star Trek Favorites is thus modified:1. TNG\n2. PIC\n3. DSC\n4. VOY\n5. DS9\n6. TOS\n7. ENT.",

If for no other reason, the show is a tribute to Picard and Data and the resolution of them is well worth the show.Should also be noted just how awesome the previous TNG characters are in this. They are fun and again, makes the show well worth your time. This is a solid Star Trek show if for no other reason, gets back to the philosophical nature of humanity in the face of challenges or new ideas. The show also gets credit for keeping an open mind, unlike \"Discovery\" a show that already imagined all its major show moments, it just uses the show as a excuse to watch them play out, boringly. There's no upper debate on anything.Yes the show works. There are moments the magic is back from TNG, and full resolutions to characters was well recieved. My only complaint was the show felt a little slow at times, but does pick up in future episodes.",

What you have here is a great story blooming out through 10 episodes with excellent graphics, sounds and brutally good fight choreography. I really enjoyed it and it was very hard to not binge it in two days.I think that anybody who gives it 4 or less and is a star trek fun, they just feel disappointed due to nostalgia reasons as they are wating for another TNG instead of these smaller story driven shows but if you look at this show independently with great references to TNG characters and events, it is actually great for any star trek fan!",

Addiction, poverty and classism are back in Picard. Everything the Federation has stood for since Archer took the first warp ship into space has been negated within a time span of 30 years.We get treated to a myriad of inconsistencies with the old series. Old series often left me thinking about morals, spirituality and science after an episode. Picard just leaves me with questions on why they had to ruin a franchise just to make a generic scifi show.The acting seems fine. Old characters seem out of character. Space battles seem boring, despite the modern special effects they never get suspenseful like the fights in TNG, Voyager or DS9.\nAfter watching 3 series with bad special effects lasers I was ready to finally see a faser beam tear across the hull.........instead we get all these quick flashy shots that leave you with very little idea of what is happening in the battle.Star Trek Picard is just a TON of missed chances. They could've given star trek fans what they have been yearning for for over 19(?) years.\nInstead we get this awful looking future and boring spacefights.Also..........Romulans now have a Legolas from LOTR......it's a thing.....I dunno how or why......I started writing this wanting to give picard a 5 star review.

            "content": "I think this site needs a different kind of user review. This show is good. Really good. Not perfect, but as perfect as it can be. Let me explain.This is a show where an octagenarian plays a nonagenarian. It's certainly the first tale of its kind in Star Trek, and one of only a few in any genre. Picard is a man who once was a paragon of strength, intelligence, and bravery, all of which is much harder for him to continue to be in his age. But, Picard's capacity to trust and love that was hard-earned through seven seasons of TNG is still very much intact, and likely will be what brings him and the federation through this troubled time. If you want to see the true mastery of the show, just watch the heart to hearts between Picard and the other characters. Heck, any of the characters -- all the actors are more than pulling their weight.As for the plot, they literally couldn't have picked a better arc. The episode \"the measure of a man\" was an early classic in TNG, and to see the ramifications of that episode and how pivotal they have become is downright fascinating. And the writers rarely leave a stone unturned, forming a very deep, rich and intriguing plot that has me begging for longer episodes.To make a few other rebuttals:Currency: the lack of currency is purely a federation concept as a communist society. Every other domain has some kind of currency. The original series has plenty of episodes centered on trade, TNG introduced credits, DS9 had gold pressed latinum. Quit whining about currency please.Roddenberry's vision of Utopia: Rodenberry never, ever implied that things were a-ok in the federation and always would be. 75% of all the episodes ever showed that without constant vigilance and sacrifice by the captains and crews of the Enterprise etc., the Utopia would have collapsed hundreds of times over, either from outside forces or from within. When Picard and his crew resigned, and with no one of caliber to take the mantle, is it so surprising things have deteriorated?Rebuttals aside now: relax, watch the show, and enjoy it. Every new series of star trek has their haters, even TNG had them when it launched. If we had listened to them with TNG, where would star trek be now?",

This show is, at it's worse, still better than the average TNG first season episode. I found it well made and entertaining, liked the new characters, and, at the end of the day, Jean-Luc Picard is just a character I find it comforting and enjoyable to spend time with. Maybe this series isn't your particular cup of earl grey hot, and no, it doesn't look a lot like classic Paramount era Star Trek, that doesn't make it some sort of 1 star travesty, that just makes it different.There is a legitimate issue that they lay on the bleakness of everything and the misery of everyone incredibly thick through the establishing episodes. I can see how this is offputting to those wanting the eternally optimistic Trek of TNG. But part of what made the first couple seasons of TNG so mediocre is Roddenberry's dictate that all the characters had to have no conflict with each other. So while the 2020 angst of this one is overblown, I'll take overwrought conflict over no conflict any day. And it was establishing a starting point. The season ended is a much less bleak and dystopian place than it began. I'd say it was a tacked on happy ending, but honestly the tacked on happy endingness with everything tied up in a neat package was the cheesiest, most 90s Trek thing about it.It definitely takes its sweet time to get anywhere (episode 1 seems like it has Picard ready to set out on his quest, yet somehow it takes until the end of episode 3 to get off planet.). The fact that we in the audience learn where the person he is setting out to find is in episode two makes it taking him until the end of episode 5 seem like some unnecessary stretching. The expansive whole season plot is another way in which it is sort of the opposite of TNG, where every episode had to end with everything resolved (and any guest characters gone and never mentioned again). It feels like some pace in between these extremes would be better, but I prefer a bit on the slow side to underdeveloping things.I'm sure if you set out to hate this you will succeed in doing so. I'm sure if you are lukewarm on it having a couple of the episodes in the first half not really seem to significantly advance the plot is a bummer. I, binged it all over a couple days, and might have not got into it enough to get hooked if I had to wait and watch it one episode a week. But, having waited for the season to finish, it was a lot easier to put up with a lackluster episode or a frustrating episode ending because I could cue up the sequel immediately.I watched it on Amazon Prime's CBS service, and they place the ads seemingly at random. Cuts mid-sentence, completely spoiling several dramatic moments. It's the only thing that really bothered me about this series.",

            "content": "Star Trek is an integrated part of many lives so I did have high expectations to begin with. The expectation has been met and moreIgnore some of the negative comments of people. I think they simply don't understand in many ways or they are affected by the sign of our times of a growing number of people who live their lives based on a story that challenges the idea of a civilization with a religion based on a fixed ancient idea of doom and hell which sees wars and destruction as only solution versus the idea of star trek which is in line with science and the extrapolation that its very possible that life out there is artificial not human. Probably in a mix with people who are stuck in the past and don't see that also television series are part of the time and environment they were created in comparable to comics in the 80's (simpler, less complex storylines, hero, enemy, done) and comics nowadays which have multiple storylines, deep complexity and much more complexity and more realistic characters which are \"real\", not a disney princess. They simply can not handle more complex stories that is the core thing. It needs to be simple therefore references to e.g. Orville. Their brains can not handle stories like this. They are Romulans: stuck with a fixed vision, unable to change and therefore unable to undertand the message of Picard.It has multiple layers of story to think about. Both from personnel perspective as overall angles. The acting is above par. The eye for detail is astonishing. The usage of symbols is smart and it catches the essence of star trek perfectly. Better than any series around at the moment.Apart from this it was uber-fantastic to finally not see the actors on stage during a con event answering questions but they are actually on screen... cool, as a gift to loyal fans, with their personalities and in a great story with a gazillion references to the past. And this intermingles with the experience: on the stage of the con we heard that the makeup of data was irritating and the annoying lenses to wear. But the cast did it here. Instant recognition and coolness.The main idea behind the story is overall interesting in line with Nasa's expectation of intelligent life in the universe and it explores what the implications are of this. Because probably.... it is so... I'm anxious to know more about this hidden ai in a hidden dimensions and it has of course resemblences with Asimov's Foundation and the \"ending of that\": where are now all the \"robots\". Only a different twist. Who knows ... now that we are in the \"caves of steel\" at home .. maybe star trek in the end... will merge with the Asimov universe and Picard will meet R. Daneel Olivaw who left 8 suns in a certain order behind.At the same time it intertwingels with the theme of AI as probably this has never been put on screen as good as in this series. Since everyone studying AI will have \"data\" in the back of their minds. So it will have lasting impact and probably even on the conscious AI's that we WILL one day create. Will they watch this series and take away the message? Will humanity follow the views as depicted in Terminator Judgement Day or will they follow the views as Picard laid them out.And at the same time it has its own viewpoint on what will happen when we are able to copy our brain over to a virtual environment. But a much star trek answer than e.g. in Black Mirrors San Junipero. Which is another interesting viewpoint and a novel one. I really like the element of choice here and describing life and what it means and the conflict with e.g. a future where we will copy our brain in a virtual environment and live forever in a thousand different copies and environments. What will it mean.The acting is formidable, each of characters is well worked out and you are drawn in each character's reasoning and a part of their why they are what they are. You can replace yourself in each character and auto start thinking on why, who, what and how. There are dramatic moments of a drug addict mother who has a son wishes to no longer see her to moments to laugh about.The scenes are put together in an incredible detail and a a lot of love for details including e.g. the language of the butterlflies by someone who passed away and the butterflies appearing later to signify and tell a butterfly storyline.The borg's artifact, the way seven fits in this (and way cool to see her as a dramatic hero still fighting for the good in difficult conditions) is also worked out very well and it fits and touches the overall theme from yet another angle which is pretty smart and amazing that all of this fits it 10 episodes. Which adds to the overall feeling that nothing is rushed. Everything is worked out well, in details and a \"logical\" puzzle piece, as opposed to many other stories.The ending is superb, smart and all the lines click together and... it gives a new crew so I hope there will be many more new adventures with this crew. I'm going to watch this series many times more.",

The actors are all OK with one exception, and I'm not sure whether the main fault with Michelle Hurd is that she is not a good actor or her character has nothing to do except to be pointlessly petulant. John de Lancie is fun-- I wish that he was around more than he is. Patrick Stewart tries to inject some gravitas into the proceedings, but too often comes across as a cranky ponderous grandpa, whom few would follow to the corner store, let alone to the ends of the universe.There are two major problems with the second season. The first is that the plot is terrible, bordering on non-existent. The cast is stuck in 21st century LA, where nothing interesting happens. None of the story arcs are interesting, let alone compelling. There is no Star Trekking going on-- it's just dullsville. I don't know whether it is laziness, lack of original ideas, or budget cuts, but it is just bad TV. There are a few good moments, but most episodes feel like pointless filler, killing time until... well, we don't know, because nothing much ever happens.The second, related problem is the terrible writing. The writers have nothing interesting to say and they aren't good enough to dress up the lack of ideas with a distracting sense of fun and/or adventure.The only social commentary here is banal and heavy-handed: 1. Homelessness is bad; and 2. ICE shouldn't bully undocumented immigrants. Politically, I completely agree with both points, but the commentary here is so shallow and obvious that it doesn't accomplish anything except make me roll my eyes into the back of my head. Still watching, but not really enjoying it.Even after learning to loathe Discovery after a decent first season, and being sorely disappointed in Picard, I am still foolish enough to hold out some hope for Strange New Worlds....",

What I'd say to all the nay sayers is, if you want to watch Next Gen or Captain Kirk, go watch them, they were and still are awesome.

            "content": "A lifelong Trek fan, I am gobsmacked by the number of people destroying this brilliant, clever and considered series in the reviews here.The theme of the discontent seems to be that this just isn't star trek - that it is dark and pessimistic and that (horror of horrors) people occasionally use swear words. Well this is partially true - there is darkness and people definitely swear, hilariously in some instances.But for those of you that watch til the end and don't give up halfway through as many seem to have, you will discover that the series is absolutely and wholly intentionally ABOUT the things that some are complaining are missing - ultimately (without spoilers) this series is all geared up around the questions of diversity, acceptance, the importance of choosing to love and not to hate, to not pre judge or use preconception, and ultimately the eternal fight of good (freedom and acceptance) over evil (judgement, condemnation and fear of the different). You literally don't get more Star Trek than that!The production values are high, it looks beautiful, the acting is first class ( a few dodgy accents from Rios and one from Picard aside!) and the story is complex and engaging - is it different from TNG? Yes, very very different - did it need to be? Of Course!It isn't 1965, or even 1985 anymore, and you can't escape that Star Trek, like everything else, needs to evolve with the rest of the world - Data's Day isn't going to cut it anymore, neither is a cutesy pastiche of a sherlock holmes ham up on a holodeck - that's just not where we are any more. Star Trek in it's own way has always addressed social commentary, and it does again here, just in a way that will suit the next generation (forgive me) of Trek Fans that will come through.If you want old Trek, try The Orville, a brilliant show with classic Sci Fi values that works because of it's homage nature and it's kitsch/modern fusion that is handled so well by the genius Seth McFarlane, and if you really want nostalgia, well...just watch old Star Trek. But don't bemoan the lack of acceptance and diversity in this show, as you could fall into a crazy irony trap and fail to show the diversity and acceptance of a newer, different generation who live in a different world to the one we grew up in - and if you sit back and go with it, you will find out that in the end this is 100% pure Star Trek ethic, beautifully delivered.

Just like there will never be a Back to the Future 4, there wont be another Star Trek TNG.Honestly, a lot of these reviews I read on here were not great and they all say the same thing. \"Oh it's not like the old Star Trek...\" \"Oh it's too dark and and there's too much lens flair..\" If you want something like the old Star Trek go watch The Orville (which I like BTW).I get that a lot of hardcore fans want more of the same but it's been done. Patrick Stewart said it himself that he wouldn't come back if it's the same old thing. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to people that it's not. I got into TNG because my Dad loves that show and I've seen every single episode. It's one of my favorites. Picard will always be my favorite captain.This show is darker and slower and not episodic and I like it. To me it's more like a long movie that should have been for TNG. All these negative reviews I feel are expecting a TNG reboot and this is not it -- it's not meant to be.In a nutshell, It's about Picard's final mission, and the aftermath of losing his friend Data. A woman comes to him for his help, which uncovers new information that threatens the Federation. If you liked TNG and like more dramatic shows like BSG it's worth the watch. The series is still just beginning so to write a complete review isn't fair. However, so far, I'm enjoying it and we'll see how it plays out.STP is not an exact continuation of TNG the show. It's a different story about Picard, the man, set in the TNG universe. In essence, the creators of the show are following the mantra -- \"to boldly go where no one has gone before.\" It's a show for a new generation.",

Just seeing Patrick Stewart refill his role as Captain Picard should be reason enough to watch this series and revel in awe at the simple fact that it's happened. It's like watching Connery return as Bond in an alternate universe. And even if this show was an absolute pile of s**t it would still be worth watching for that fact. Luckily that is not the case.Although it's still very early in the series, Picard is already showing all the hallmarks of an instant classic. It does rush certain aspects that I would have preferred more fleshed out, but understandably it has to get to the point pretty quick and unfortunately forgo some character development with the new players (which the haters would have hated even more since they unjustly call this show \"boring\" to begin with). And that leads me to my next point....Picard is not boring. Both character and show intended. Subtle, subdued, introspective, yes all of the above. But todays audience just seems to want thrills and spectacle and nothing else. Even the original Next Generation wasn't like that, it was quietly bold and supremely existential in it's best episodes. And that's what I hope for going forward with Picard.Patrick Stewart as Picard is like an old friend you haven't seen in ages... Awkward for just a second then it's as if you never spent any time apart.

Especially seaon 2 is a great arc about Picard's general motivation and yes, at some points it may be a bit cheesy, but over all the characters are very likeable.Is it the strongest of all ST shows - maybe not, but I honestly don't understand the nearly religous way some people think about the older series, which all had their flaws, but still all had their own charm.So if you like scifi and like ST in general, you should really give it a try without being to fixated on the idea that everything is fixed and has to be a certain way forever.And I like the couple at the end. ;-)",

            "content": "Season 2 update: Not Star Trek, not Picard.Picard continues to show that Kurtzman et al have no clue or real care about Star Trek, and its painfully bad to watch.There are so many stupid character decisions and things that long-term Star Fleet officers would NEVER do, especially when dealing with time travel.Speaking of time travel, this show is jumping the shark HARD in the second season.The number of stupid decisions and characters is truly astounding. I would have thought it hard to do, but Kurtzman has managed to make me dislike Jean-Luc Picard. In this show he is an egotistical, moronic, stupid character that thinks a very old man should still be an action star, for some reason, even though Picard was never an action-based character (outside of the movies). It was his intellect and adherence to Star Fleet and doing what is right over what is easy that made him stand out.The universe of Star Trek, once a hopeful and optimistic view of what humanity COULD become is now a wretched show about how nasty the human race truly is, in Kurtzman's view.Do yourself and the world a favor. Do not watch this show. If you have, stop watching it.Older review below.If you're looking for something that feels even remotely like the Star Trek you know and love (from literally any of the series before CBS got their hands on it), then this is NOT the show for you.Star Trek was a show based upon future humanity overcoming the majority of pettiness in a unified attempt to explore their galaxy and learn about the mysteries held there.This is true from the OG Star Trek up to even Discovery, and while each had varying takes on the formula, you could still *feel* the Star Trek in most of them (movies not included except for the OG movies).This show has more producer credits than cast and crew combined, and its helmed unfortunately by Alex Kurtzman. In the grand tradition of current remakes that have no real point or originality, CBS has been desperate to make Star Trek a thing again, yet they have no care in actual Star Trek and only care about more action, more killing, more swearing, more nonsense that doesnt hold up if you think about the events occurring. And under no circumstances is there supposed to ever be a feeling of STAR TREK in this Star Trek show.In my last paragraph I joked that there are more producers than any other cast, and thats honestly what it feels like. Oh, sure, theres extras walking around waiting to get blown up, decapitated, disintegrated, shot full of holes, etc., but the actual cast of the show is roughly 8 people.Unfortunately, the newest additions are painfully bad, with the Soji twins being of particular note here. She has no agency, no real character, no growth or anything worth noting. She is essentially a human mcguffin there to just make the plot sort of happen. And sort of happen it does!If you want to take the skin of the Star Trek universe and then shove The Fast and Furious underneath, then just create a new show! If that sentence sounds exciting to you, then you just may be the target audience!!If you like Star Trek, skip this, if you like sci-fi, skip this, if you like Sir Patrick Stewart with his sheer Fing hubris, skip this, if you want to see old actors retake their mantles, just watch those few episodes with them then sigh in disappointment.The plot of the show thus far is nonsensical within the Star Trek universe. Everyone, with the exception of the old crew, seem to have their own secret plots, which in turn seem to only exist as an 'in hindsight' moment, where the show wouldnt make ANY sense, so they went back, added 15 new producers, and wrote in scenes to try to cobble it together. It truly feels like Alex Kurtzman was a 'woke' 12 year old they hired to give them ideas and then tried to create some semblance of a story.A. K.: \"I like ninja assassins!\", Producer 13: Ninja assassins are too male centric! I KNOW LETS MAKE ONE COME FROM A SECT OF FEMALE ASSASSIN NUNS!A. K.: \"Robots are cool! Data is cool!\", Producer 7: BORG AND DATA ARE BACK BABYYYYY except wait... data wont hold up as being Data so we'll just show him a bit in dream sequences... and to make it appeal to a female audience, Data has a daughter, NO TWIN DAUGHTERS!! TWIN DAUGHTERS THAT HE HIMSELF CREATED!!!! YES! I CAN SMELL THE MONEY ON ITS WAY ALREADYA. K.: \"I like space explosions!\", Producers 3, 7, 22, and 41: Hell yea space explosions rock!This show is not Star Trek. Picard is NOT the Picard you knew, nor are any of the others from TNG.This is not a 1 star show due to the work that went into it, but nowadays special effects arent much of a draw anymore. The practical effects they do use are sometimes nice, sometimes very stupid (like the Romulan town that hasnt changed AT ALL in decades and is still a space western town.... A. K.: I LIKE DESERT WESTERN TOWNS!!! PUT ALIENS IN THEM!!!)Sigh...Maybe next time, guys.I'll be looking forward to Star Trek: Ensign Wesley Crusher in 2027 if we arent wiped out yet by then.",

It's like the writers wanted to virtue signal, but had no idea how to pull it off--and they failed miserably regardless.After the season finale, it felt like Picard's character was diminished and undignified. The second season didn't break down Picard's character to explain something meaningful. The second season destroyed any respect for the Picard character and tried to rebuild Picard as someone different.

Pacing was slow. I immediately don't care about these people- the writers failed to reel me in.Effects- it's the future- at least try to make San Francisco look like the Abrams-verse.If I have to choose between the horrendous Doctor Who season 11 & 12 and this train-wreck of an episode - I'll choose Doctor Who- I don't have to pay for that.",

Perhaps part of the reason is that it's been a long time since there was good Trek, but I am honestly blown away. Hats off to Terry Matalas for turning the ship around and pulling this off. What's been missing from the new shows is the comradery and togetherness of the crew. The infusion of all the old characters from TNG instantly brings all that back. At the same time, the show is molded into a modern non-episodic format. It works! I think part of the reason the new shows have been having a hard time finding their footing is that there's just not enough episodes being produced. With the old shows, we got about 26 episodes per season, and lord knows there were stinkers, yet even still, every episode is a little piece of character development and crew development. Strange New Worlds has the potential to achieve this, however there just aren't enough episodes being produced. Discovery technically has had enough episodes, but they haven't managed to build the characters and crew properly. I so wish there would be more Star Trek: Picard after this season is done! But before the season is over and done with, I think we've got a hell of a surprise in store for us. Can't wait!",

It works with a lot of emotion (without beeing cheesy) and some complex characters, a thoughtful woven story and a lot more action than you would guess by reading all those reviews here. It may be slow paced, while taking its time to unravel its story arc, but in a good way, giving you time to experience it, build up immersion, feel with the characters and struggle with them. And that is something this series can do way better than good old TNG.It is just darker, grittier, with deeper, more \"real\" charakters without leaving Star Trek credibility behind . Infact it is way more ST than 'Discovery' or the J. J. Abrahms Movies. (yes, suckers ^^ - think about it)I wanted to give it a nine, but before it gets crushed into oblivion by all these bad critics, i had to give it a ten out of ten ;)So from one oldimer to the others:\nThe 80s and 90s are gone - cope with it. Good sci-fy reflects the present, and as 'TNG' had this naive (end of cold war) optimism, when we watched it as children or teenagers - 'Picard' is the cynical grown up version of today. This series is really good, you can see that they really cared by making this show. So discard your childhood-memory nostalgia and give it a chance. Get out of your trekky bubble, be grown ups, brush these hurted little-fanboy-feelings aside, watch it and think again. Cheers!",

The camera work and lighting are dire. Are they trying to be artistic in being this bad with the production values?There is the other elephant in the room. One of the great things about the first two series was their effortless depiction of liberal values. I became an engineer because I wanted to be Georgi La Forge so bad. The fact that he was African-American did not even enter that ten-year old's mind. Tasha Yar was security chief. Of course she was. She's a tactical and close combat expert. I nearly because a medical doctor because Beverly Crusher was awesome. Dr. Crusher was an awesome doctor. She was not an awesome woman doctor. Her gender and race were irrelevant. The TV series is so blatantly virtue-signalling, cry bullying, and obeying the rules of woke, that my wife got up and walked out with a \"Oh beep off\" at one pathetically contrived political statement. The only thing that might get me to watch the remainder(I won't) is to see how they will work in an anti-Trump statement(I'm not American, and I couldn't give a hoot one way or another about Trump).I've officially given up on this franchise.

            "review_title": "The best Star Trek since 1999 -- by far",
            "content": "This reviewer's background, for you to put my words into a context: I'm a huge Star Trek fan since 1987, when I started with the Original Series, have seen all Star Trek shows and movies ever since multiple times, was active in the fandom for a while and have read about 300 Star Trek novels. Star Trek has almost the status of a religion for me. This is where this review comes from.That said, I've not always loved everything about Star Trek. TOS, TNG and DS9 are my favorites, I love each of them and could never decide between them -- but in my opinion, even back in the 90s, VOY set a yardstick for poor, badly written and utterly childish Star Trek. And although I found ENT was a considerable improvement over VOY, it never quite reached the first three show's brilliance (though season 4 came close).I'm not a \"NuTrek\" hater. The new movies are mindless popcorn fun and I could enjoy them as such, but I was missing the depth \"old\" Star Trek used to have in its best times. Similarly mixed are my feelings about Discovery: While this new show is technically brilliant and superficially entertaining, its season 2 nods to TOS nice, its characterizations are lacking and its storyarcs -- pardon my language -- dramatically aimless BS.Long story short: Ever since DS9 went off the air in 1999, I was looking to find the old brilliance in new Star Trek, without success, despite its occasionally successes at mildly entertaining me.Then came \"Picard\" -- and after 3 episodes, I'm blown away. It's *exactly* the show I have been hoping for all the time! I'd go so far saying it's like I hoped the TNG movies would be, back in the 90s, but failed to be. \"Picard\" is to TNG, what the TOS movies were to TOS. Making up for the mostly poor big screen entries that followed the tv show.And, frankly, I am totally at loss understanding where all the negativity in the bad reviews here stems from. \"Unintelligent\", \"dark and gritty\", \"pessimistic\", \"action oriented\" -- when critics use these words to describe Picard, I have a very hard time believing they were watching the same show I watched.On the contrary. For the first time in decades, I feel we have *intelligent* Star Trek again. Finally there are Star Trek authors who know how to read, who make literary references or use self-irony: Like a Picard who says about Asimov's \"Complete Robot\" that he never found a relation to SF. Or a rogue Captain who reads Unamuno's \"Sentimiento Tragico\" -- a heroic Don Quijote character obviously, I'm curious to learn about how he'll handle the tragedy of a lost cause -- and programmed an MHN after his image to externalize his inner monologues. At least hints at a meta-discussion about the meaning of myth, narratives and truth at the example of the Romulan concept of \"mythology\" (we'll see where this will lead). This is *smart*. In fact, it's the smartest Star Trek in decades. And in best TNG tradition, a show that had lots of references to the history of mind and science, from Shakespeare over Sigmund Freud to Steven Hawking playing himself in a poker game with Einstein.And is Picard \"pessimistic\" or \"dark\"? Well. I'd say it's at least not \"darker\" than DS9 (and I never found DS9 \"pessimistic\", despite its darkness). On the contrary, I find Picard hope inspiring -- because it reflects our current state of the world. Just like \"old\" Star Trek did in its best times. For me, Picard's approach couldn't work better. Just like I witnessed my happy optimism of the 90s, after the end of the Cold War, the \"end of history\", crumble after 9/11 in 2001, when the Western World saw a surge of paranoia, fear and militarism, Picard's personal history was shaped by a similar event, the android attack on Mars, 15 years prior to the new show. And just like the current state of world politics, the rise of ignorance, populism, authoritarian government everywhere, disinformation, fake news, hate on the internet and meddling of autocratic foreign powers, the once great Starfleet is fallen into paranoia, prejudice and infested with Romulan influence.That a person that stands for ethics and integrity like no one else, my dear Jean-Luc Picard, finds himself now in a similar situation as I find myself in when I read the newspapers, allows me to identify with him like never before. And that he will most likely be able to once again change the world for the better, is incredibly hope-inspring. Just the fix I need in these dark times when reality looks bleak.Yeah, I understand, some old fans are missing the \"idyllic, ideal world\" of TNG, the \"mobile living room\" that was the Enterprise-D. Perhaps the same people who hated DS9 back in the 90s. Fair enough. If that's where the bashers and haters come from, I can see where they come from. Picard is not that kind of show. But I'm glad Picard is not a rehash of the old formula we have seen hundreds of times before, on TNG and VOY.Just like each show, from TOS to DS9, was one step forward in the evolution of Star Trek storytelling, Picard is the next logical step (after VOY, ENT, NuTrek and DSC failed to go forward -- both on the time scale, as storytelling-wise). Its storyarc is more complex. Its serialized format allows for a much larger scope (the next logical step after DS9 broadened Star Trek's scope by telling longer arcs). But at the same time, while I feel it's an expansion, it couldn't be truer to the spirit I loved about TNG.It's fresh and relevant to today's real world -- not a rehash of old 90s storytelling. But at the same time maintains Star Trek's soul, by applying it to a world that has changed in the past 20 years.I've never enjoyed watching new Star Trek as much as the first three episodes of \"Picard\", ever since the DS9 finale in 1999.Clearly 10 of 10 stars from me -- though I might reevaluate this rating, if the remaining episodes turn out to be a disappointment. But so far, I see no indication that they will.",

Very little of a Sc-Fi nature really happens in Picard imo or not enough. The story starts ok but soon deteriorates into a silly mess. They throw in the likes of J. Frakes, Mirana Sertis and Brent Spiner but their roles are too little too late. By half way you do not really care about the characters and it just does not go anywhere. I thought 7 of 9 was the best of a bad lot.Update - Season 2\nStarts off well enough but this is the Flag ship of the Federation supposedly manned by the best the federation has to offer but the security team cannot even obey a simple order from the Captain as in \"Cease Fire\" not that he even gave them the order to fire in the first place.

I'll admit I'm a Trekkie of old.This show isn't like ST:D which is fast paced and makes very little sense. It is a fast paced show and so far my old turtle brain is able to make out the connections from scene to scene. But they're really pushing it though. I think they've deliberately gone away from the pacing of ST:TNG and the Orville. Let's hope the writing keeps up with the pace.This is show isn't like ST:D which is overly manipulative and wants to tell you exactly how you should feel about every scene and every character. This show doesn't have mountains of exposition from characters we have no connection too which always frame the scene. This show has amazing writers!So far the writers on this show haven't debased good actors by making them brag about defcon level .The special effects and cinematics on the other hand are just as good as ST:D. The new art and aesthetics that the JJ Trek universe look beautiful in the twilight of the 24th century and match perfectly. The beauty and modernity of the set design unfortunately threw me off a bit when watching ST:D, which was no fault of the artists and set designers.They've written a story about the connection that Data has to Picard and how Picard will do anything to protect that connection.We care about these characters and we are not being lectured by the director or the writers on how to care.I love it.

It's not a criticism of the show in any way, I'm simply holding a mirror to what was once considered cutting edge Sci-Fi. There's no blame to be placed, the show was just a victim of its own time.So when a follow up show like Picard comes along, set far into the future from the original series and written with a contemporary pen it's such a breath of fresh air.It's great to see the old characters again (sadly not enough of them make an appearance for my liking though) in their new lives post serving on the Enterprise and so cleverly written into a thrilling story line.I appreciate the production values of Picard are very different to the old way of doing things within the Trekkie universe but in my opinion it's for the better. I get the feeling that this has been created for people just like me who were, in their youth, keen fans. It's as though the show has aged just as I have in terms of suitability. I'm now a grown up who likes to watch grown up TV/film. There's even swearing now, AND I like it!!I'm not going to say anything else other than I think one should form opinions based on the entirety of a show and not just a handful of episodes. Judge for yourself, don't believe the majority of the trash reviews on here. I suspect they were written by ardent fans of the William Shattner era and his incarnation of what it is to be a Captain of the Enterprise. If I'm not mistaken, similar negative things were said about the Next Generation when it made it's debut yet it stood the test of time.

Star Trek it's about excepting differences and being different. The show makes people want to think about exploring into the unknown. I think any sort of Star Trek fan might like the show or dislike the show. And I think if anybody is thinking about watching the show but is discouraged because of the reviews, I think you should watch the show for yourself to see if you like it or dislike it. Slight spoilers ahead. I want you to enjoy it for yourself.Many people have been frustrated about the show because it isn't like the Star Trek that everybody is used to. The Star Trek universe is usually about trekking into the unknown to find new planets and new civilization.And I understand that this show isn't exactly about finding all that, but I think that's a good thing. If the Star Trek universe continued to expand on the universe they'd have to create new aliens that we may never have heard of. Which I'm OK with.I've been a fan of science-fiction since I was 11 years old. It was actually Star Trek the Next Generation that got me to love sci-fi. So when I first saw Star Trek Picard it made me feel like a little kid again.Seeing Picard, Data, Riker, & Deanna Troi again made me feel so happy. I never watched Voyager but I recognized seven of nine and I was really happy to see Hugh again. I remember being young and watching the Borg, Romulans, Klingons, Vulcans, and more Aliens thinking how big the Star Trek universe could be. I am a fan of the TOS, TNG, The original movies, and the new ones which is called the Kelvin timeline.I honestly love this tv show and I cannot wait for season two. If I know anything about Star Trek, I know Q is going to be in this to bother Picard and I really want to see that.I give this show a 10/10. This is my personal opinion. I hope whoever reads this enjoys the show.Live Long & Prosper. \ud83d\udd96",

I knocked of a star for unnecessary use of profanities which shouldn't be coming out of Star Fleet admirals and the love scenes were a bit unconvincing.

We feel betrayed that they'd \"trade-in\" the old story-telling ways, in favor of the ultra fast talking, multi-line story waves, turning complexity into something that was once fascinating into something we have to decode. That is the way stories are told now and like Picard, we have to navigate this process and fit in with the new.

By doing so granting characters from those series to make pop bys would also have been a great thing! Hopefully thats still a possibility!",

Yes, some series have been better than others but (in my opinion) all have been eminently watchable. I cannot understand the negativity expressed by so many of the reviewers on her regarding Picard. What do you want people? Some are complaining because instead of stand alone episodes we have a serialised story. Some seem to want everything exactly as it was in the original Star Trek or TNG. Everything changes. Do you really need instant gratification with short stories and no development. For me, this new series has left me frustrated only because I want know what happens next. It is set in a time where the Federation is cracking and seems to be withdrawing from it's ideals and only Picard and his former friends/colleagues/shipmates are aware of it. I think I know who the baddies are but do I. I am loving every episode and can't wait for the next one.",

Actors get older and our lives become more complex. Issues in the world will always influence media whether it be film or news. This series is no different. Personally I've loved every episode. John Luc is much older and more frail. He's been humbled by life. The plot has me intrigued. And the fact that life has taken its tole on him is believable. All other reviewers are slating this series because they want it to be like the old Star Trek. Here's a little heads up. That series finished 26 years ago. You want Sir Patrick to be the old Picard? Seriously? Are you still the same person you were 26 years ago? I for 1 am not. I've been more humbled by life and am more cautious, wiser and settled. Everything evolves and if you can't deal with change and are looking for modern day nostalgia this may not give you your fix. I am enjoying this series.

            "content": "So I'm a die-hard ST:TNG fan. I can probably quote most of the episodes, and I often leave the show on repeat in the background of my home while doing daily tasks like laundry or dishes. Honestly, if I look back at it with adult eyes (and not the teenage eyes when it was originally aired), I see that it's pretty cheesy in a lot of ways. The characters have some good writing, but there was a ton of (at the time) \"current\" social commentary coupled with unbelievable plot fixes. As for continuity, there were at least four episodes in which major characters from ST:TOS appeared as major or minor characters in TNG, and one major motion picture shows the twice-over death of Kirk as a cross-over film.None of that is a problem; in fact, it's what most people come to expect from all Star Trek franchises. The problem I see with many of the reviews here is in the expected concept of Star Trek: Picard. I think that some of the reviewers on this site seem to want that 90s version of ST:TNG here in ST:P. They want a TNG sequel here.But those same reviewers seem to forget the movies which are also part of the franchise and were produced after the television series. I thought some of those were cheesy too (Insurrection, anyone?)... and while First Contact was definitely the best of the bunch, Nemesis was gritty, dark, and just plain sad. Unfortunately, ST:P comes in the storyline after Nemesis... and there is a direct link from this film, rather than from the 90s television show. If seen through that angle, the show makes a lot more sense. The whole first season seems to be, at its heart, an epilogue to that film which had (to me) a very open ending.Yes, there do seem to be elements of capitalism in ST:P, but DS9 had an unhealthy relationship with gold-pressed latinum, in my opinion, and there were several TNG episodes (\"The Price,\" \"Haven,\" \"Bloodlines,\" \"The Perfect Mate\") where money or gifts or prices are discussed. So while First Contact shows Riker and Troi telling Cochrane about poverty and want vanishing after his warp-induced encounter with an alien race, the truth is actually a little more complex.But all of this is in the backstory of ST:P. Here we have Picard, the character, who is truly a human... beset by regrets and his own failings, and we see what can happen to a person who has been at the height of his career and power who is truly thwarted by a far-reaching conspiracy. If we look back at a lot of his character's arc in both the television show and the movies, it's usually been less Picard who was saving the day and more the other characters working with him... Data especially.In this season, we are introduced to the fascinating idea of an \"ex\" Borg cube, which shows those who were previously assimilated (like Picard himself) trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. I hear echoes of \"Descent\" in the Hugh story.The delightful backstory of the synth homeworld (or, at least, where Soong and Maddox do their work) with its synthetic cats and butterflies and planet-defense-orchids is imaginative and reminiscent of many \"away\" missions. For that matter, the Mom-AI that Soji accesses and the Narek-meditation sequence were extremely thought-provoking for this sci-fi-nerd. And of course I loved hearing echoes of \"Measure of a Man\" in Soji's question to Jurati \"Am I a Person?\"We also now have an \"after-story\" for not only Picard and Data, but Troi and Riker (with a daughter named Kestra from TNG's \"Dark Page\") and this was one of the best episodes of the series. I also loved meeting Rios and his emergency holographic versions of himself.TL:DR- if you go into this show wanting a ST:TNG sequel, you are going to be disappointed. But if you watch the series as a continuation of the TNG franchise, keeping in mind the gap in time that has passed since the films, you might be as satisfied as I have been.",

Patrick, you are a truly wonderful actor.To address some of the bad reviews, however; Some people are wanting the show to be like TNG, or even TOS. I find this an odd attitude for several reasons:1. If one didn't accomedate for a newer generation's tastes, one would make no money, and there would be no Trek.2. The only sci-fi to successfully return to it's roots has been Red Dwarf (IMO). This is because it is suppposed to be 'low budget' and 'cheeky'. If the sets from TNG were bought back you would not be able to take the show seriously, as the audiences suspension of disbelief would not tolerate the wobbly walls and terrible effects (and some truly awful acting from guests in parts, let's be honest!)3. Nowadays people expect plots which span multiple episodes\\series, as opposed to everything returning to the status que after just one episode. And why not? Can you really tell a good story in 45 minutes?For me, it's a bit like going back to a computer game I loved as a child. Compared to the modern computer games, old games such as \"manic miner\", \"Space Invaders\", etc seem incredibly quaint - somewhat laughable. Should all new games be in this format still? (Hint: No.)To enjoy Picard, stop expecting the past and accept the new series as what it is - a good story in the TNG universe being told well.Lastly, I couldn't help but laugh at the irony of the fans wanting to live in the past, as it mirrors some of Picard's feelings in the show.",

Roddenberry challenged the imagination of audiences decades ago, even on restrictive network television, to see a future that worked, while exploring timeless moral dilemmas and conflict through adventure. Picard, on the other hand, is like a night time soap opera with multiple personal dramas unfolding in which the imaginative technology and adventure are just a back drop for personal drama. And frankly an 82 year old running around in space with his previous crew mates that are almost as elderly is simply not believable on any level, but especially not in what is purported to be adventure science fiction. Again, if you want Star Trek adventure and story lines without all the \"space opera\" watch The Orville on Hulu or Disney. They nailed it.

But there is also hope, because all this characters are on the edge to a healing process, and this process started with Picards mission. And I doubt they are still broken and lost when this mission is over. If you miss the old Star Trek, watch the old Star Trek. Ist nothing wrong with that, I still love this shows dearly. But I\u00b4m also excited about the evolution of Star Trek with all those new ideas, they are do not just produce rip-offs. But they also honor the old Trek shows I grow up with. And I do not understand why people are saying the writing is bad, in my eyes its excellent, clever and they do not spoonfeed the audience like usuall. Its like reading a book, from time to time you will need your imagination and your brain. So the show goes literally boldly where no Trek Show went before....",

And you don't need to have watched old Star Trek Series to understand or appreciate them.\nI've watched some of first episodes of Next Generation now and Patrick Stewart seemed old already then, more than 30 years ago, and now is 80!!! and perhaps also a better actor.\nThat's incredible for any man to perform like that at that age and the series would be worth to be seen only because that, without mentioning the fact that the age of Picard itself have a strong and inspiring (yes!) meaning itself: it's never too late and you're never too old to repair your mistakes and change the world.",

To put it simply, I watched the trailer for Picard months ago and it seemed like a welcome and better change from the newer ST movies and series like Discovery that had big potential but I don't think they quite hit the mark.Without stating too much of the obvious, it's about an aged Jean-Luc Picard and wanting to understand and unravel some very interesting events that unfold before him, both within the two decades since TNG ended and in the present (Present as in the time period that he's living in). It's definitely interesting to watch and I'm loving the way the story is unfolding (Presently on Episode 6).Call this a \"paid\" review or written by a millenial (I'm 40 years old, by the way), I don't care, but I think some fans just need to grow up and accept that there are plenty of people out there who are enjoying this new series and are very eager to see how it pans out. I'm reminded of Stargate Universe and how, when it was cancelled, it signalled the death of the entire franchise for now. I was very vocal about how Stargate Universe sucked at the time but now regret it and I'd rather the same thing not happen to ST.",

An old man biding his time, takes on the opportunity to make a difference one last time and to try to make amends of his perceived failures. Failures that irk more due to all the successes he is used to. The way Picard deals with frailties that are natural part of ageing has been brilliantly portrayed. You do not get your invincible captain instead you get an admiral who confronts his limitations but yet shows the passion and determination that made him \"The greatest captain ever!\"I am a great fan of the Utopian society that TNG presented to us when were growing up, but it also interesting to explore a world that turns bad in spite of the greatest good intentions. And the way the season ends is so typical Picard. All the scenes that seem pointless are tied together neatly in the end and give a larger understanding of how the characters were shaped.There are also great visuals on how technology possibly looks in the future and the way we interface with it, while keeping to Star Trek roots of capturing the mystique and grandeur of space and faster than light travel.To end, Picard is a thoughtful, poignant continuation of the Star Trek story with all the baggage that time and their experiences would add to the shows main characters. It is how they deal with it and still stay true to the principles that made them who they were is what you should take away from the series and it is a \"fascinating\" watch!",

Picard brought a bit more stability and maturity. I can understand the reverence some fans feel for the series and star-trek universe as a noble and ideal future, but it al feels way too naive, a denial of human nature. i still like to rewatch some old episodes, but more out of nostalgia. That's why i was/am happy with the new series, not only because it stars my favorite captain, but it represents a much needed update to a more real universe. the episodes are rather short and the pace is slow, but i love the atmosphere. it stars some of my favorite characters like Data, Seven and of course the Borg, the best villains of star trek period. it is in no way an intricate study of human nature like with Battlestar Galactica, but i'll take it gladly anyway. it's a shame that every new attempt for a reboot get's so much hate from the zelots who only seem to want more seasons from an already milked-out concept!",

Really this project is more aimed at fans of brainless action fantasy - into the realm of contemporary comic book movies. I say that because Picard makes up science as it goes for convenient story devices, and in the process ignores previous Star Trek world rules, and logic.I admit Picard is watchable. It maintains continuity. Characters are built, develop and change - It isn't like Picard is devoid of content - or that it isn't occasionally entertaining with special effects or action sets. If watched for light entertainment, without a deeper look, one might think this is above average.But this is Star Trek. It should be watched close. It should live up to a standard set by Gene Roddenberry.

            "content": "I'm staggered by how bad the writing is in Picard. These people are paid to write for a living and they come up with... this?I've seen many Trek fans attack Picard for trying to be too edgy; for the swearing, and the gore and violence. That stuff actually didn't bother me. If used appropriately it could be of great benefit to the franchise (for example discovering an alien race that's so brutally violent that it's a level above any other race previously encountered, the gore being used to emphasise this).No, those things were neither here nor there. I was far more insulted by them constantly bringing back beloved Trek characters only to kill them off, often in the space of a single episode. That seriously pi**ed me off. It happens three times in ten episodes!Another major problem: the key story arc is boring. This is a huge issue, because Picard is a serial tv/web show. Trek has some fantastic story arcs, from the Dominion to the Xindi. And even some that had fantastic potential but which were under-utilised (Voyager's journey home, which could and should have been more serialised, like a several season long version of the two-part episode Year of Hell). The story arc in Picard was neither well executed nor did it have great potential from the outset. There is some brief potential towards the end, when the prospect of an incredibly powerful race of evolved synths look set to invade Sar Fleet space, but it's quickly cut off.Yet another major problem: the new 'crew' are almost to a person completely unlikable. None of them are charismatic, none of them interesting, even the emergency holos are cringe-inducing. If they all died in the opener of season 2 I'd be happy - at least with a reset crew there's a chance one of them would be worth investing in.Plot holes galore, characters constantly making stupid decisions, Romulans now look and act pretty much like humans, cliched sequences of events you can see coming from a mile off, and actions not having approriate consequences. A member of the crew somehow manages to commit murder, is told she'll be turned over to Star Fleet, isn't, and then it's never mentioned again - at the end of the final episode she stands on the bridge with the rest of the crew as if all has been forgotten and forgiven.The more I think back on the season the more disappointed I become - I'm starting to question if a 4 is too high for this dross.So let's see, what are the upsides? Well, at least it's more sci-fi television, and I can't get enough of sci-fi, and specifically it's more Trek. So that's good, even if it has been somewhat butchered.It's good to see Seven again... I guess. My second favourite character from Voyager, I was expecting to enjoy her return more than I did. She's changed a lot, but I guess that can be put down to her personality and 'humanity', now more jaded, developing a lot in the time since Voyager returned to Earth. But is that really why her character is so different? Or is it just that the writers have changed her to suit their own ends, and there's actually no reasoning or thought behind her personality changes at all. It's hard to say.Seven in Voyager was a subtlely kick ass character, a deadly machine almost, hidden behind a mask of Borg stoicism. In Picard it's more a case of an outwardly kick ass character - like the only way the writers were able to portray how strong she is is by turning her into some sort of grizzled street fighter and gun for hire. 'Look guys, strong female character; she can even carry two phasers!'. I'll take Seven from Voyager any day over that sort of childish attempt at fan service.Season one is basically a Trek series with bad writing and a completely unlikable cast of characters. The latter we're pretty much stuck with, but there's always hope the writing and story arc for season 2 will be much improved. It needs to be.",

It presents a futuristic world in which people behave as they've always behaved, and history continues to repeat itself.. after having been all too quickly forgotten. On the one hand, this approach is heart breaking.. because it shatters the overly optimistic (but false) illusion that we can be better. On the other hand, the quality of the production is superb.. in every aspect. There is a lot of potential for this series to take a fresh (albeit more cynical) look at the Star Trek universe.",

TNG each episode stood on its own. This series tells a story. The format should be familiar to everyone since all the best modern shows are doing this now. The pacing is slower but in a really good way. The characters are not one dimensional. Everyone has flaws in a way that makes more human, more believable. This helps is presenting the questions of what does it mean to be alive, to be real. Even \"the bad guys\" are driven be motivations that seem logical and reasonable from their perspective. I can't stand stories where the bad guys are just plain evil. Everyone thinks that what they are doing is right (unless they're sociopaths). There's a lot of things that should please old Trekkies yet sophisticated enough for a modern audience. There's a lot of undeserved bad reviews for this show that I suspect are mostly written by the same person or small group of people with multiple accounts. It's really a very good show.

At first people hated it but now it is generally regarded as the best of all the Star Trek series.That being said, this series is different. It is much darker than even DS9. Most of the characters are new. However, the plot is consistent with the overall ST canon. There are even elements of Battlestar Galactica in this series, which I found compelling. I could even see a tie-in with that series in the future if they were not produced by competing companies. And, it was a mystery that continued to unfold throughout the ten episodes.Generally, I think most people dislike this series because it wasn't what they expected. Most people expected a continuation of The Next Generation, even though the producers said up front that it wouldn't be. Personally, I love the possibilities with this series. This crew could have some seriously interesting adventures.I liked it and I say give it some time and we may see a lot more people jump on the bandwagon as they did with other shows in the Star Trek franchise.",

You also get heart, tears, compassion, food for thought, and actually some interesting action. You also get lens flares, but hey, we should be used to them by now.\nSo, if you like Star Trek, again, watch it.

He wanted something that would inspire hope and given the world leaders in the West from 1945-70 it was possible to half believe that one day it would be true.The 80s gave us a string of movies and a new generation; the first season and a half was still locked in Gene's mould, and Gene's lawyers blocked episodes, but eventually Berman came onboard, Riker got a beard and things got better.DS9 was definitely the darker, seedier side to the federation. Between the inner working of Quark's mind, the war with the Gamma quadrant, and let's not forget that Section 31 first rears its head here.Voyager it seemed was a return to the benevolent federation, but with an intrepid crew facing the worst and the best, (but mostly the worst), that the Delta quadrant could throw at them.I'm not touching Enterprise, and while I personally love Discovery, I can see where the big departures from the norm will have upset many.Picard though. I think they're completely on point here with what we may see in the future, especially given how much more dystopian the world is today. We see a man who has made a life from doing what is right by standing up for the oppressed, the minority, or the threatened, whether they be Federation or not. We see his word, his iron bond ripped from him when the Federation will no longer support his efforts to stage a mass evacuation and by gambling his career and reputation on his last throw of the dice he loses everything. A man once hailed as the greatest of captains has no standing with Starfleet anymore. The government to which he has given his best years are happy to see the back of him.I'm not going to sit here and write out a bunch of spoilers and neither am I going to say that everything has made me happy, it hasn't. But I feel like this is more like a believable human tale versus a utopian dream. I was at odds with things that have happened to old show members, and have felt chills, throat lumps and shed genuine tears at the acting during some reunions of characters. Like it or hate it, but this simply feels like a tale worthy of Star Trek for the twenty first century audience. I have heard from friends and family who didn't really like ST, but are loving Discovery and Picard, quite simply because it feels more real and not like a soap opera in space. Both shows certainly seem to be more realistically human in nature.",

I will admit that I haven't delved into the cannon books of Star Trek, which may have changed my opinion on the direction they choose to take (such as it did with Disney's Star Wars). In my opinion though, the final episode of season one alone is worth watching this slow starting series and was a true testament to the character of Picard we all enjoyed in years past.",

And that was that - or so I thought ...In a chance conversation recently, where we were comparing TV that we watch and like, my colleague said \"Picard\" and I retorted \"Yes but shame it was only one season\". That's when I discovered that there was indeed more.The terrible reviews nearly stopped me from bothering so download season 2 but I reasoned that they have been \"wrong\" before and so I ploughed on regardless. And I am so glad that I did. It was brilliant and getting to see Seven again was a true bonus. (Yes, she has always been a fantasy woman for me - I mean, come on; resistance is futile)So here's the thing - I cannot fathom why the nay-sayers claim that it is a \"snooze-fest\".

            "content": "The old Star Treks were based on a different premise, that they were on a big mission, with set goals and mission parameters. Under those parameters, each episode had it's own story to tell that started and ended, so it moved quickly. They were usually upbeat an optimistic, but in reality unrealistic. Real life is darker than that and is often not optimistic. Picard takes the viewer in a different direction than the old Star Treks, one that I think is more in line with the times with which we live... think of Game of Thrones or The Dark Knight; hero movies with a gritty a realistic feel to them that tell the truth about the world. I think that is the direction where Picard took us with it's story. Visually, it is Beautifully made. The cinematography is beautiful, not like the old once a week low budget shows we used to watch, but high quality, high budget work, set initially in Picard's beautiful vineyard that he longed for all of those years aboard the enterprise. Later, the CG work aboard the star ships is fantastic, showing exceptional detailing and texture, better than any of the Treks that came before, and the technology has even been updated to include Artificial Intelligent interfaces and VR and AR control interfaces for the ship. The abandoned Borg ship (artifact) is extremely interesting, as is the mystery surrounding the existence of Data's apparent offspring. Unlike the single story per episode, the story-line runs through the whole series, which, I suppose is why some people think it is slow, compared to the old shows... but the format is not different than other series that are out, and is actually the rule, more than the exception. I actually like it better; It gives more time to develop a more complex story than in just a single episode. I also like having the mix of new and old characters in the show. Introducing new characters leaves the show open for new seasons to develop as old characters drop out and new ones develop. I hope there is another season. The haters need to stop complaining or they won't have any Star Trek to watch. This Star Trek was well done!",

And a conspiracy within the conspiracy within the conspiracy and on and on. Everyone is triple/ quadruple agent, because you know..! Basically the same crap you can see in say, every single other series/ movies coming out these days? Star Trek used to be original, innovative, thought-provoking, entertaining!

            "review_title": "A sad state of affairs (Season 1)",
            "content": "4/10\nWhere to begin with this show? Firstly, I liked the production value and some of the music - also the actors seem to give it their all. Apart from a few story beats and some nostalgia stuff, that's pretty much it.It's very hard to wrap one's head around this mess and review it. But I'll try.Star Trek Picard is trying to appeal to a broad audience - which is it's first mistake. The producers wanted to have a character-driven drama about an old sick man coming out of retirement, but also wanted to have a mystery secret agents prophecy cyborg action show where the universe is at stake.They (18 producers!) pack this show full to the brim with any concept that seems interesting (cybernetic life vs. Human life, android rights, Brexit, secret organizations, quasi-religious cults, external threat to end all life in the galaxy, feminism, coming-of-age, spies in love, incestual relationship between brother and sister, substance abuse because of trauma/PTSD, rich vs. Poor, isolation because of setbacks, immigration, refugee crisis, Picard as an old man, what it means to be an ex-Borg, moving on from depression, self identity/Jason Bourne, chosen one story, racism, being a parent/losing a child and so on.)\nThis would be fine but they only have 10 episodes and they fail to really explore any of the above topics. (see Westworld, Narcos, The Expanse etc for reference)\nAs it is it's like an Orangutan shooting darts at a dart board.For example, why should the audience care about synths? We have the dumb work drones on Mars and we have the hippie-esque synths on Coppelius who come awfully close to wiping out all organic life in the galaxy. Soji seems a decent/boring girl, I guess? Until she builds a signal tower to call for extermination of all organic life, that is. Should I root for them? Why?To add insult to injury, they change the basic tenets of the Federation and Starfleet. Now, they are racist xenophobes being duped by a couple of Romulan spies. Again, it would be fine if the writers would justify this. And I don't mean this hand-waving (\"they gave in to fear\") or constructing this unbelievable plot about a shipyard at Mars being attacked by synths and therefore the Federation won't help out a species threatened by their exploding sun. I just don't buy it. The evacuation of Romulus was already under way and how exactly was the existing fleet destroyed? Were they all at Mars? Why? Why is the Federation building ships to rescue Romulans? Do they have enough time for that? How long until the supernova?(The writers also added f-bombs to show how mature this show is.)The whole plot of the season also feels very choppy and weirdly paced. First, they want us to get onboard with the story of an old hermit coming out of retirement to save someone's life. Okay, but then the story crawls around at a snail's pace and Picard remarks that Soji might be dead so they might as well stop at the Romulan refugee planet that he abandoned 13 years ago.And then we have a pointless and awful supposed-to-be-funny dress-up episode (same episode where Icheb from Voyager gets his eye brutally removed on-screen) where the story just drags until something finally happens and then we go to the Riker and Troi planet to shoot the breeze. All the while the tedious romance/betrayal plot on the Borg cube just keeps going around in circles.It's just such a cynical and bleak show. They try to give Picard some speeches about humanity but it feels hollow when this show is populated by so many problematic characters.Picard had a great career in Starfleet and saved the Federation countless times, yet he got fired over the refugee crisis and then just gave up and became a hermit. He says he is passionate about this crisis but he didn't even give an interview in 13 years (let alone calling his friends like Raffi.) It's just so bizarre that Picard wouldn't have friends in high places, proteg\u00e9s and resources outside of Starfleet. Why is that? Because the plot needs to happen. Largely, Picard just follows the female characters around anyway who drive the plot forward.We also have another two Starfleet washouts that pretty much gave up on society after they encounter hardship: Raffi and Rios. Also they both have substance abuse problems.And the writers wanted to have a samurai/ninja on the show to cut people's heads off. You might think, \"what could he do against phasers or disruptor weapons\" but there you go. There is nothing much else to Elnor, except that he just pledges his life to anyone who fights a hopeless cause. What a stupid piece of bread. You could cut his character from the show and it would be an instant improvement.Then there is Agnes. Agnes is a murderer. She killed her former lover after seeing a vision (i.e. Garbled mess of images) of ...something bad happening. As a top scientist, her first question is obviously \"What do you need me to do?\" What a wonderful rational mind! It's just not believable, sorry. Agnes is not brought to justice but seems in a happy relationship with Rios at the end of the season. How quaint! But, you know, she said she's done with killing people - so it's okay!Soji almost destroyed all organic life in the galaxy but nobody cares (everyone makes mistakes I guess!) Not even Starfleet stays on Coppelius and prevents the next hippie android from committing genocide. It's okay, folks! Move on! We have to wrap it up!And Seven of Nine shoots an unarmed criminal instead of bringing her to justice. Glad to see that all those years on Voyager learning about humanity brought her to being an alcoholic psychopathic vigilante murderer. Isn't that an advancement for feminism! Janeway would be so proud.There are so many head-scratchers:\nIn the beginning they introduce Picard's Romulan former-spies combat-housekeepers and then they just leave them on Earth for some reason, never to be heard from again.The supposedly awesome Romulan Tal'Shiar operatives try to extract information from Dahj and beam into her apartment to kill her boyfriend with a knife and put a bag over her head! In the 24th century! Just to have another hand-to-hand combat scene with people dressed in black leather (Star Trek seems to need this now.) Also instead of just stunning the victims, they beam in and kill the boyfriend with a throwing knife. These are the worst operatives I have ever seen! They apprehend a synthetic lifeform (who they know can \"activate\") and immediately scream at it where the rest of their kind is!The Romulans are an advanced society but since their relocation they're dicking around in grubby wild west towns with swords - yet they have a fleet of powerful ships just to wipe out androids! The mind boggles...Dahj had visions of Picard for some reason. It's sort of explained that she was cloned from one of Data's positronic neurons. But why Picard? Wouldn't she see Geordi - you know, Data's best friend?You have mustache-twirling villains (Narissa and Commodore Oh with her stupid sunglasses) who are completely uninteresting and I guess you got to have those in a \"slow character-based show about older Picard\" that was advertised. Their one-note characters are just awful. Remember when Star Trek didn't need villains but had adversaries?There are magic devices who show the past or can repair anything with the imagination - which sounds more like Fantasy than Star Trek.Riker just becomes the commander of an emergency fleet although he said a couple of episodes before that he's no longer in active duty (how did this happen?) At Starfleet headquarters, they become aware of the threat and say \"who is our best captain to command this task force of the most powerful ships we have? ... Do you know, there is a retired officer living on an obscure planet who hasn't commanded a ship for a long time and makes pizza all day - that's the perfect man for the job!\" - really?How is Maddox a genius AND deceptive, sends two android agents to investigate the synth ban but wipes their memories? Doesn't that stand somewhat in the way of doing any investigating? Being so brilliant, he also placed the location of the synth planet in Sojis mind.What's the difference between androids and holograms? Wouldn't sentient holograms (who appear in Star Trek) also alert the Zhat Vash? Where were they?I could go on and on but it's just not worth it.I hate to be one of these people to say, this isn't Star Trek - but it's not. This is utter nonsense that baits us Star Trek fans with empty nostalgia to get subscribers. Listen CBS: I don't have to watch shows that aren't good - even if they're called Star Trek.As it stands I have no interest in the second season. There are some good bits here and there but this is mostly whatever is popular dropped in a blender with some things from the past.Remember Riker? Remember Romulan Warbirds? Remember Icheb? Remember the Borg? Remember the \"Captain Picard Day\" banner (who would keep that?) And soon, it will be: Remember Geordi? Remember Guinan? Remember Q?It's an empty exercise in nostalgia porn.Oh yes, they kill Data.. again! And then they make Picard a new body. I guess doing the same for Soji's dad (Data) was too much to ask.Almost everything good about this season felt unearned by this show but was earned by better things that came before.Stay away from this garbage. This reeks of desperation. It's only a brand now that rapidly loses it's identity by getting pulled into too many unfitting directions.",

There are not a lot of space battles either, but the few they have are essential to the plot.Visually, it is beautifully designed, directed and filmed: pastoral countryside sequences; the bright and cheerful \"graphite and glitter\" of futuristic San Francisco and Starfleet buildings; the bleak, dark and moody aspects of interstellar travel. All the disparate pieces hold together somehow in an off-balance way that keeps the viewer paying close attention.As you would expect from a series with Sir Patrick at the center, it is character-driven. As we are introduced to new characters we are shown the explanation of how each one fits into Picard's current and past life. Some will find this exposition slow, but people who watch Star Trek for the characters will enjoy this depth of backstory. Real fans who are accustomed to Star Trek's casual relationship with the unidirectional nature of the time continuum will have no problem following the related flashbacks.All in all, I am predicting the reboot fans won't like it, and folks with a Kirk fixation from ST:TOS won't like it either.But the acting is superb. I can't think of anyone who gives a bad performance. The writing is so magnificent I found myself making notes of well turned phrases I wanted to remember and savor. The plot is not simple enough for a casual viewer, but it is nicely complicated and fresh in a way that will be very satisfying to folks who have been absorbing the ins and outs of Roddenberry's vision for decades.It is morally complex in the way that the best Trek episodes are, with the grey areas of good guys/bad guys taking twists at just the right times. The Federation political intrigue and parallels to current world situations are very well done. And there are constant references to morsels of information and favorite people from the rest of the Star Trek universe that dedicated and observant fans will notice with delight.So if your favorite episodes from the Star Trek universe are the ones that blend the science and action elements with the infinite complexity and intensity of human drama, and if you realize the greatest unknown to explore is the realm of emotion, memory and the experiences that make life most precious, then Season One of Picard will hit you in the gut in a powerful and unforgettable way.Last but not least, if you are already an admirer of Sir Patrick Stewart, and acknowledge Jean-Luc Picard as the best Captain in Starfleet, it is criminal that you have not seen this already.Clear a weekend for watching the first season as though it were a trilogy of feature-length movies. Do it ASAP.This series alone is worth the cost of a Paramount Plus subscription.",

It might be the curse of Gene Roddenberry but every Star Trek series stumbles out of the gate. My eight stars rating is based on the fact that this denied season is maybe the second best debut season after Deep Space Nine's debut season.I've been watching Trek since the beginning (ok, almost beginning, I was 11 months old when it started, lol) and this certainly is a new vision for Star Trek. Watching the after show hosted by Will Weston, \"Ready Room\" available on CBS all access and YouTube has helped me understand why they made some of the controversial creative decisions that have rubbed some dabs the wrong way and I'm firmly in the camp of patiently letting the story unfold to justify those bold choices rather than passing snap judgement based on an expectation that this would simply be a modern update of the Next Generation formula of Star Trek story telling.From the first time Sir Patrick Stewart announced the show two years ago on the Comic Con stage describing it as something new and different, we have been told over and over this want going to be your parents version of Star Trek. The food of sour grapes from people who wanted more of the same old formula are useless and uninformative about what is good or disappointing in Start Trek Picard. They are only a laundry list of the differences between preconceived expectations and a bold new story.I recommends classic Star Trek fans watch the series as if it had no past history and evaluate it solely on its own merits and not against preconceived expectations. If you do that you will discover an interesting story with complex the dimensional flawed characters and an idealistic world no longer living up to its ideals and struggling to recapture it's soul.I think this is a compelling start to a new journey and I'm eager to learn where this is headed.

It's the latter that Picard really takes its dramatic queues from, and thankfully to great effect.Indeed this end of century Federation is a place made out of the strife of that war, the destruction of Romulus and how these events have worn on the steadfast optimism of our favourite captain. In true allegorical style, much like the last 20 years of war have worn on all of us.Picard is tending the family vineyard when we catch up with him, rebuilt where his brother and nephew died in a house fire years before. He's reserved (if he could be any more so) protective even. Weary of days spent tending to his crops and employees (though a pair of extremely funny and charming romulans).Enter Dahj (The absolutely perfectly cast Isa Briones). A woman who seemingly 'knows' him, deeply. She will in fact be the catylist for what will pull him out of his comfortable retirement, on to an adventure that will bring him to face what's left of the romulans, his demons with the Borg and finally his regret in loosing his dearest friend, Data.Kurtzman, Goldman, Chabon and Beyer respected the hell out of everything that came before in this one without bogging it down in a thousand references that the uninitiated would need a fan wiki for. From the opening shot of the 1987 enterprise D to a bar sign that reads 'Quarks' on a lawless planet somewhere in the fringes.There are genuine moments of real depth and feeling. The way Picard describes Data in a conversation with Dahj would move anyone, even without context. Every actor fully committed. In particular Allison Pill goes through an amazing if somewhat torturous arc, and Santiago Cabrera will surprise everyone with his range.If you were expecting TNG 2.0, this isn't it. If there's one thing star trek has shown us, it's that although it really never changes, it can also never go back. It was the first 'shared universe' and each story into the future progressed and changed with all of us. Right now this Picard is meant for us, to show the way and hopefully grow along the journey.

I still expect characters to evolve in difficult situations, in times of conflict between beliefs and pressure of circumstances.\nI hate some scenes that seem terribly outdone (transporting Picard to the planet the little boy is watching, transporting Elnor, who puts his sword in during the transport (and looks more like an elf from the Lord of the Rings (well, they probably want to attract viewers and elsewhere ..), Picard shots from different angles when transporting the seventh out of nine .. etc.\nStill ...

It is actually a plot point they address in the show. \"I've not been living, I've been waiting to die\" he says.The series explores ideas and themes from TNG, such as Picards PTSD from being assimilated by the Borg and his relationship with Data, along with many other callbacks and easter eggs that fans of TNG will recognise. It does this while still feeling fresh and like its own seperate thing. It is not trying to be a TNG remake and thats a good thing.Old school 90's mystery of the week TNG is great.So is this.",

The sentimentality that Jean-Luc (\"JL\") expresses towards his old friends and crew, the fallibility of his character and the harsh universe that Picard depicts are all, to varying degrees, at odds with the universe built by previous series in the franchise.But to those who see this as a corruption of the franchise, I would just say that challenging the status quo has always been what Star Trek was about. Jean Luc Picard was never perfect, and the Federation was never an infallible institution.Picard explores the later stages of life for the crew of the Enterprise and of other \"ships\" that I won't discuss to avoid spoilers. It expands on Jean Luc Picard's character, arguably the most well constructed character in all of Star Trek, and adds a whole new level of complexity and understanding to some old races that we previously hadn't seen in such depth.The sound track is fitting, and it's worth listening to John Russo's soundtrack for the series on its own.Finally, I completely understand that if you come at hoping to see a depiction of the utopian culture that is the Federation in the earlier series then you'll no doubt be disappointed. But Star Trek can be so much more than that, and I for one really enjoy the corruptible and visceral Federation that we are beginning to see in the newer iterations.",

The borg can do time travel in their sleep, so it's no stretch of the imagination to think the borg queen(s) are made in the future. Data after all had the borg Queen drilling around in his head, who is to say the plans were not inserted into his memory. I think this storyline is developing into the ultimate storyline that explains everything. So looking forward to seeing if I am right.

I'm giving this a 9 out of 10 Stars because I have always loved the diversity and the outside the box thinking that the writers have used and it's this type of thinking that enables us as human beings to move forward as a whole. The way certain episodes of this new series tie in to that of the next generation I feel was brilliantly done. In fact I found myself re-watching the original series of next generation from episode 1 all the way through so that I could re-familiarize myself with all of the references such as the painting that lieutenant Commander data had painted of soji/dahj. and the Borg Hugh. It appears as though they have cleverly taken bits and pieces of individual next generation episodes and have tie them all together and what I see as a form of writing brilliance. As I said before the first few episodes are kind of weak but it does get stronger and I am looking forward to the future episodes. I do highly recommend that you watch the next generation episodes just prior to watching this as you will understand it much better once you have re-watched TNG.",

            "content": "February 14, 2020 - I feel strongly that I need to revamp my entire review after watching the third Episode and the Wil Wheaton Shows after each Picard episode. It is made clear in the Wheaton Shows that everybody involved in Picard, from the Music Director, to the Show-Runner, to the Producers, to the actors that the love of Star Trek - The Next Generation is very much a respected and beloved show to ALL of them.Star Trek was envisioned by Gene Roddenberry as taking place in a universe that endeavors to see this universe through eyes that are searching for equality in all creation and ultimately peace as the ultimate solution. Having watched every version of Star Trek except the cartoons, some many times over, there was NEVER any illusion that any species is perfect. Many hateful reviewers in here are NOT truly familiar with the Star Trek format. To equate Star Trek with race hating or trying to shove a particular political belief down the viewers' throats is to truly NOT understand the Star Trek Universe.And yes, the references to a \"feeble\" old man are still setting me off. We have just seen the set up in the first three episodes of what is to come. I lean toward the conservative middle in my personal ideology. But even I understand what Admiral Picard was trying to accomplish when the Romulan sun went nova and his mission to try and save this race, the most hateful, distrustful race of people in the entire Star Trek Universe. ALL of life is precious and to try and save them is noble and shows Picard as he has always been, a man of impeccable character. To watch him wake up from this \"hell\" for him, the Picard Vineyard in France and to try once again at the age of 91 (in the show's timeline, in real life, he will be 80 in June or July) to rally good people to find out what went wrong with Star Fleet 15 years before to suspend the salvation of the millions of Romulans from death at their sun's demise, is to see the Picard from TNG who never gave in or gave up.And despite what has been said here in other reviews about this not being up to ST standards? It EXCEEDS any of the Star Trek shows I have watched 100% and thus my 10 rating. One thing about my rating, though? It is from a Star Trek fan through and through who completely understands what Gene Roddenberry was trying to convey in his conception of Star Trek. I know, in my heart, that this show is exactly on point in the Star Trek world. But more than that, it will resonate with those who have never even watched Star Trek. There is a mystery afoot! And as Star Trek has always tried to impart, patience will ALWAYS be rewarded with excellence.Many negative reviewers spend paragraphs trying to explain how this series doesn't do the Star Trek franchise any good. I see a completely different vision in Picard. I see a man who had been a hero, well respected, highly decorated, who fell from grace because of some nefarious virus that somehow infiltrated the Star Fleet Federation and tried to erase the program of saving the many millions of Romulan enemies from a death they could not escape on their own. And I now see that man find his inner character again, especially with an incurable disease, who decides to right a wrong. That IS Jean Luc Picard!!This is not an uncomplicated series! But then, if you are a true Trekkie, you know that none of the Star Trek universe is uncomplicated. And yes, Discovery is the one that jumped away from everything Star Trek! I KNEW having read many interviews with Sir Patrick Stewart over the years, that it would take nothing but him jumping into the true Picard spirit to bring him back to Star Trek. This man doesn't need the money! He should be comfortably retired, enjoying his sunset years. But look at this fine man. I know, without a shadow of a doubt, that Sir Patrick is as much a fan of Star Trek as the rest of the true fans are. And I know that unless this show IS all things Star Trek, he would never have agreed to play this part again.To keep pointing out the small things like a very few curse words and the untrue put down of pushing a particular agenda or talking about bad cinematography is a smokescreen for people who, for whatever reason, do not want Picard to succeed. So, when I call them haters, I think it fits. And yes, everyone is allowed their own opinion, but when that opinion is two lines of \"this is just terrible,\" I have to question the reality of that reviewer's opinion as whether they have even bothered to watch the show or, as they claim, that they are, indeed, Trek fans at all!In the end, as in the Star Trek Universe, I believe good people will end up winning. I hope enough good people watch Picard and give it a second, third, and fourth season. It's too bad we are even fighting about a TV show! No wonder this whole world is falling apart!!January 31, 2020 - I just watched Episode 2, and after five minutes, it was over. Anybody who cannot see the brilliance of this show, isn't watching it, and isn't a fan of the Star Trek franchise. Star Trek was not always positive and peaceful, there were many instances of war-like stories in every arc of every Star Trek series and movies. But what REALLY burns me up about the hater reviews, are the constant references to Picard being old and feeble. For a man of his age to pull off the intelligent dialogue and the story being woven, which is absolutely believable and brilliant, is to be lauded, not mocked and not criticized. Sir Patrick Stewart still has strong acting chops and still maintains and projects the personality and drive of the Jean Luc Picard I knew and loved for seven years of TNG. After reading hundreds of reviews in here, I suspect there is a concerted effort to bring down this new series for whatever reason that makes no sense to me. This is a cohesive, smart, well written and executed beginning of an exciting story with SO many places to go. Period!! And the ageism in here is despicable. Those who are downrating this series based on Sir Stewart's age? We should all be so lucky to have our facilities and abilities to pull off a character he played 20 years later the way he is. The second episode was better than the first and now we see a story being set up about a covert Romulan sect who might have caused the breach with the synths in the beginning. A brilliant story with intelligent dialogue that is far from boring and is setting up I can already project, a brilliant and fitting continuation of the Star Trek series. For that? I am extremely thankful. STILL 10 stars that nobody asked me to write nor paid me to give to this review!",

There is great character development and they feel like real people. Story isn't predictable at all and you don't have a clue what will happen next. When main characters are in combat, you actually fear that they might die, because they can. Starfleet is a political organization and it might crush you to survive.

It's turned Starfleet itself into a diverse hire paradise where every single senior officer is female. It takes established and beloved characters that we grew to know over the years or even decades and deconstructs them into obscene parodies of themselves. This show undermines the basic message of hope and optimism. Instead, it presents a bleak, hostile, greedy dystopian version of the Star Trek universe. It revels in gore, torture, violence and destruction, in a show that once had taken a higher path using rationality, understanding and diplomacy to solve problems. It does all of this, and for what, to tell a story that nobody wanted in the first place. To explore ideas that have already been handled by past better writers. To seamlessly forcing the creator's political views that none of us asked for or care about. Or was it just to squeeze the last remnants of fun enthusiasm from a franchise that pretty much has been run to the ground by people who don't know what the hell they're doing.Star Trek Picard is just another sad example of what happens when arrogant, talentless, shameless hacks try to elevate their own mediocre work by standing on the shoulders of giants.",

Each episode gave an entertaining mix of jeopardy and balance. Picard is still unwaveringly Picard. The rest of the cast each give amazing performances and support the spirit of TNG as well as I could have hoped. I can only imagine that the regrettable current wave of right wing populism that would object to the inclusiveness I so much enjoyed would have been responsible for some of the down voting.

The trouble is, The Next Generation, though an outstanding oiece if late eighties television, could often be too perfect. Too sickly sweet. People would fall out then smile it off at the end of the episode. There were rarely consequences. And then came Deep Space Nine... Something people are only really appreciating in retrospect. Lets not forget the original show here, an egocentric and obsessive Captain, tortured second in command, bad tempered doctor and cranky (and possibly) alcoholic engineer. Yes, the best Trek series had the most flawed characters, in the optimistic setting of the show. An optimism that emerged from the 1960s that saw the world move to the brink of a (nuclear) third world war, a cold war, a war in Vietnam.Its something we've forgotten in a world where political uncertainty is strife. Where economic fragility is glossed over. Where isolationalist nationalism has replaced globalisation. We are, once again, in uncertain times. And we need positivity.What this series has done is begin in a less certain Trek universe than the one we left. A post (Dominion) war where the universe we knew was turned on it's head. Bit like the 1950s? And to remind us, this show has mirrored that. Throw in fear of AI, terrorism(?) and racial tension, Star Trek has once again mirrored the time.What Picard will ultimately demonstrate is how we can either focus on that negativity, or listen to people (like Picard) and work towards a positive outlook society had perhaps forgotten. And to show us that, it begins in a dark place.And I think that is great. I am a life long (42 and counting), devout Trekkie. And I feel this series is soeaking to us about the world we are in now - and what needs to be done to get us to the bright Trek future Gene Roddenberry created. Flawed characters that work together, perfect in their imperfections - and in those of other people.Picard has a story to tell, and a legacy to leave.Embrace it.",

But why is that bad?It's too different, you say? What's wrong with different? Different is good.If that's your problem, then go watch the originals! Those will never change. That's a simple fix. After all, everything you watch is different. You're looking for familiar, and comfortable. I'm afraid nothing will change your mind.It's not real Star Trek? I know this is just another way of saying \"It's too different\" but I'll address it anyway.What makes it \"real\" Star Trek? Jonathan Frakes directed a few episodes, Patrick Stewart is the star in each one, there are call backs to previous characters, episodes, and plots. It's Star Trek. It's real Star Trek. If you had said \"This isn't Pokemon\", then you would have a valid (yet insane) argument.Now, no, it's not episodic. It's one long serialized episode. So you need to watch them in order, starting from number 1. Personally, I don't know why anyone has a problem with that. It allows for more detail on a given story unlike older Trek where character development required episodes dedicated to that on their own, and sometimes resulted in a rather uninteresting and very skippable episode.Finaly, a simple answer to the \"It's a cash grab\" crowd. Read this carefully now:\"IT IS MEANT TO MAKE MONEY!! IT IS A PRODUCT!!\" TV shows are not free to make, actors are not free...you get me?There are many other arguments, but when you read them, read them carefully. I even read one review that said \"They only added so-and-so to advance the plot\", you are reading the words of someone who does not know how stories work. The naysayers are simply wrong. The story is enjoyable, the casting is brilliant, there's enough humor, action, heart, and social commentary that it feels like Trek. If you disagree, then fine. Disagree.

If you are looking for a fast-paced action-packed series, there are others more suited for you. This is methodical and complex, I loved it.",

Season three is more than I expected and it feels like that this is what I wanted from the very beginning but not really expected from a TV series. I wanted to have a final movie to close the storylines. Season three is giving that to me and I am more than happy and did not even expected this quality.

Most people are very tired of that kind of stupidity in our daily lives. We need a break.

            "content": "This is my first review, so bare with me.I've been a Star Trek fan as long as I remember. Born in 75, I grew up dreaming on the imaginary of Gene Roddenberry.The premisse of the original series was simple enough: humanity advanced to a higher level and no longer had to endure the difficulties of nowadays.\nPeople were better in every way, at least the human sort. The bad guys weren't human, they were Klingons and Humans were better then Klingons, because they were human. They had compassion and values we all identify with.Later, there were Romulans and Borg to worry about (on different ages), maybe that's why humanity united and forgot their petty quarrels.Star Trek Picard focuses on a different era. JL Picard is old and retired from it's glory days on Star Fleet. He lives his days sipping on wine on his old Picard Chateau, frustated by Data's death on the aftermath of the Synthetic attack on Mars. Data, as it seems, gave is life for Picard, and he's been dead for 14 years.\nSynths, as Data, caused the death of thousands of human lifes on Mars and were forbidden since then, on the failed attempt of saving Romulus from it's fate.This is the premise of ST Picard.\nIn no way did I see \"the memory of Gene Roddenberry\" maculated in any way. So I don't understand why on Earth there are dozens of reviews classifying this with 1 star. Visually, this is an impecable achievement and although there are small flaws with the writing, in no way should this be classified with 1 star.\nActors do their job competently, storywise, I see no flaws, screenplay is done impeccably.\nCritics are clearly biased by God knows what, maybe by a personal idea of what Star Trek should be like (which in turn, follows a religion-like star trek assumption theory, that everyone seems to blindly follow). Among so much trash nowadays on TV, this should be cherished, not trashed.Now, don't get me wrong, this show isn't perfect.Patrick Stewart is aged and it's noticeable. But his frailty adds to the series, because we're used to see him as a powerful figure, the one who came back from the Borg. This is another plus you'll get from this series, you'll get to know more about the Borg and even learn that those who were long assimilated, are recoverable, at least in someway.\nThe show moves slowly, developing the characters and the story itself and I found myself actually caring about the characters, which is how it should be I guess.Star Trek Picard shouldn't be bashed the way it has been, it's extremely unfair. All those who gave it 1 star, think well why you did it... 1 star, really?\nUnbelieavable.\nWhat they're really saying is: \"you haven't followed the original formula, so in return, here's 1 star rating, because the original formula should be used ad nauseam...\".All things evolve, even Star Trek. And I think this one evolved the right way.\n8/10 from me, just to contradict the other trekkies :)",

I'm so fed up with us men being portrayed as obsolete. This IS offensive trash.Oh look, there is a problem with the world. Send in the empowered women, and make sure the men know their place. In chains, on their knees, and subservient.I walked out of the room today on Episode 3 of Season 2. Watching the women beam down perfectly, and Seven of Nine being asked if she's a super hero. Rios basically broke his face. I assume his teleported malfunctioned? I was losing interest since mid season 1. I only watched bits of it here and there while my gf had it on the tv. I just played my rpgs on my computer.This is not Star Trek at all. This is a crime against Gene, and Majel Barrett. I'm seriously disgusted with this show. *PUKE*Trek to me growing up was about exploration, science, egalitarianism, and humans in the final frontier. It was about a hopeful future, and a mixed species galaxy where we want all interactions with races to be a peaceful one.Think Darmok and Jalad! <3<3<3<3<3This is a forced narrative wrapped in a successful franchise.

So much about our nature threatens that Star Trek future, but that's part of the reason I was so excited Picard was coming back. Even if we can't be those evolved humans, maybe it'd help us to at least have them there as examples to aspire toward. My generation couldn't manage it, perhaps we could inspire a new generation.The production value of the series is great, the acting leaves nothing to complain about, but I just watched two humans straight up kill two others, brutally and for silly reasons.

It's something we're not accustomed to and it's okay not to like that. That said, it's important to recognize that just because something isn't what we wanted it to be it doesn't mean it's inherently bad. ST:P is good TV. It tells some captivating and emotionally engaging stories in a grittier world than we're used to in the Star Trek Universe.To refer back to my title, we have Star Trek available in a number of flavours now. Star Trek has always been a commentary of the socio-political landscape and it still is. If you want that commentary in darker, grittier season-long arcs, you've got Picard. If you want something that has the more optimistic, hopeful, and perhaps slightly more sterile feel of the Kelvin timeline movies, you've got Discovery. If you want to harken back to the episodic storytelling of old with a shiny new veneer, you've got Strange New Worlds. The Star Trek franchise can cater to a wider audience without that being a bad thing. It's okay if not all of the Star Trek universe is for everyone.",

Setting my personal opinions aside, if you are rating this show an 8 and above that means you feel it compares to some of the best shows sci-fi ever made.

Don't watch.Yes I know that playing Picard's mother in a flashback might not be the big role you hoped for, but you got paid for that job, and for that job you only had one single name that you are absolutely not allowed to butcher: That of your own son, which you allegedly helped name. And still, actress Madeline Wise, playing the role of Yvette Picard - who judging by her first name is supposed to be French as well - says \"John, look!\" to her son, instead of \"Jean-Luc\" and speaks with the most posh British accent. French isn't my first language either, but it's really not that hard to learn how to pronounce a French name like the French do.This is the most basic job of all basic jobs, pronouncing the name of the show's main character correctly, and you'd expect that they would have her say the name \"Jean-Luc\" during the casting process for the role. Did the casting director fall asleep and was too ashamed to admit it? And how on earth did the filming director sign off on her pronunciation of the name when they filmed it?I don't mind if other actors that play linguistically challenged American characters pronounce his name the wrong, American way, because it makes sense. But if you're supposed to be a French character, then you have to pronounce the name in the correct, French way. I mean, even Patrick Stewart pronouncing his own name \"John, Look!\" is somewhat plausible, given that he's probably been called that his entire life and he's probably given up by now that anyone will ever live up to this minor phonetic challenge of pronouncing his name correctly - and after all, as we saw, even his own mother was unable to pronounce the name she allegedly gave him. If we accept his mother's wrongful pronunciation as part of the lore, it is reasonable to assume he even grew up thinking that \"John, look!\" was his actual name instead of \"Jean-Luc\".Also, the make-up artist who did Laris' Vulcan ears did a really horrible job. I was so distracted by these HUMONGOUS and distinctly angular ears. I mean, in the Star Trek universe, that's just about the most common and easiest job you can have as a make-up artist, right? And to screw that up so royally...12 minutes into S02E01, the USS Avalon is shown to be thrown off its course by a spatial anomaly that suddenly formed out of nowhere. They send the following transmission back to starfleet command: \"We've detected a spatial anomaly. Please advise.\" Lol, what kind of advice is starfleet command supposed to give on the basis of such vague information? Really, the least information they could've given is that they were thrown off their course by the anomaly, but instead they chose to use the word \"detected\", which could mean a couple of lightyears away depending on scanner range. Honestly, what was the writer of this scene thinking? Or did he intend the entire bridge crew of the USS Avalon to look like intellectual bottom dwellers who try to eat soup with a fork?It's even worse that later on, Seven of Nine, a former Borg, sees this anomaly, and fails to notice that the anomaly is glowing in the same green as all Borg-technology. A little later, Picard, a.k.a. Locutus, also sees it and doesn't think about the Borg. And once Picard hails the sender of the mysterious signal coming out of the anomaly - whaddoyaknow - a Borg ship appears. Surprise.I'm sorry, but these green energy emissions have been part of Star Trek lore for 3 decades now, and you're telling me that not even two former Borg saw this coming? Because I saw it coming the second this anomaly showed up on screen.And despite these massive flaws, the long anticipated return of Q at the end of episode 1 with the line \"Welcome to the very end of the road not taken.\" sent shivers down my spine, because Q has always been one of my favorite Star Trek characters and I've always been a sucker for elsewords stories. 2 Birds, one stone.I thought at that point that it will be interesting to see how, or if, they will tie the narrative knot from the borg incident to the sudden, so far unexplained appearance of Q.Well, let me tell you with every minute watched, it got less and less interesting. And more convoluted and disoriented and cringe. And at some point I caught myself hoping that all the characters would just die as soon as possible so that we can give this show a wrap. Watching all 10 episodes was agonizing, a sacrifice I thought I had to make in order to write a fair review.This show was a mess from the beginning, but somehow it turned into an even bigger mess with season 2. So, in the final episode, they kinda tied most of the narrative knots, but the way they did it (by straight up spelling it out) was just as bad as the rest of the season. And the knots they didn't tie up - tbh I don't give a s... because I don't care about any of these characters anymore, not even about Picard - because he stopped being Picard in season 1 already and drifted off even further in season 2.This show is Star Trek by name only. Yes, we get to see some familiar characters from the TNG Universe, but nothing else fits in the Star Trek Universe.",

It moved with the times and instead of clinging to an outdated, albeit beloved, legacy it renewed without losing any of Roddenberry's inspirational spark.

            "content": "There are a lot of very negative reviews on here, but it's not really a surprise since this is a show that will polarise opinions. I love it however, for several reasons.Firstly, it IS Star Trek. It's not the camp, 60s Trek of Shatner and Nimoy but it follows the other series pretty well. Earth has been bombarded by the Borg, then there was the Dominion War in DS9. That series, for me some of the best Star Trek has to offer, was pretty dark and Picard follows on from that. It continues the themes of what sentient life is from the TNG episodes involving Data like Measure of a Man and his \"daughter\" Lal and the Voyager episodes about the Doctor and the rights of holograms. It has the Borg and the Romulans, the two biggest and baddest TNG bad guys in it. There are plenty of nods to the original series and those that follow like having Maddox, Seven of Nine, Hugh, the Tal Shiar et al all involved and it suits the way the modern viewer watches TV, wanting a continual storyline with character development and jeopardy rather than the episodic \"alien of the week\" way that stories had to be told in the days of syndication. I guess if you prefer that single, hour-long episodic melodrama then classic Trek is more to your taste than this.In terms of storyline, there is a long game to be played out and there are a lot of little set piece action scenes as well as plenty of opportunities for Sir Patrick Stewart to show his class by bringing a sensitivity and sense of age to the character we all love in Jean-Luc Picard. His age has caught up with him and he can't physically cope with the demands of the task but the old dreamer still thinks he has one last mission in him and will do everything he can to preserve the memory of his friend Data. I'm struggling to see how anyone can hate this show so much.Yes, there is swearing but coming from the UK it's always hilarious to me when US dramas have characters who DON'T swear (especially police procedurals, shows about drug dealers and the mafia etc) simply because of an outdated moral \"code\" on their network TV. Of course people in Star Trek didn't swear in the old TV shows but not being on network TV allows for a more realistic way of presenting the frustrations, hopes, fears and everything else than trying to avoid some naughty words. Yes, it's lefty, with its message about helping refugees and pointing out that a military organisation might not have the same interests as the general population or the more optimistic dreamers but Star Trek has always been that way and will always continue to be that way. And yes it has the lens flares and the Dutch angles and the non-linear storytelling but do we expect colourful sets and uniforms, cardboard sets and terrible lizards like the Original Series when filmmaking has come on for far in the 60 years since that time?Watch it, don't watch it; but don't believe all the haters who say it isn't Star Trek or that it's a muddled mess. It's not TNG, it's not DS9 but it is good. It's better than Enterprise, Voyager and Discovery. Give it a go if you're a Trek fan and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. And if you aren't a fan then watch it for Sir Patrick Stewart alone.",

Then in Broken Pieces this same murderer is allowed to roam around the ship freely without anyone being concerned about her mental state. Neither Captain Rios, nor Jean-Luc suggest that perhaps she should be put in the brig.

When Kirk and Spock came upon other civilizations that were jacked up they interfered. Kirk on more than one occasion gave a speech on how societies need to fight and struggle through their problems and learn to grow, ideally together. The Next Generation crew were a little more hands off, but still racism and hate existed, sex was still a major player (even with an Android) and things were far from perfect though they sure tried to make it that way.\nRoddenberry realized that the world is far from perfect. He wanted a world without racism and senseless violence, but there was always violence in Star Trek. Along comes Picard after so many other shows showed promise and the world, the universe has advanced to a more realistic, not-quite-dystopian existence. The Romulans are still untrustworthy. The Borg have been conquered, but still elicit fear in some. Things went terribly wrong in the last 14 years and we zoom in on Picard and he's unhappy with it all. He's unhappy with the recent past, unhappy with the present and not so sure he's going to be happy with the possible futures he sees. What is more real than that? On top of that, he's 79 and he's no longer the standard hero type. He needs others to help him be a hero. He can't assemble the old crew, so he picks up what he can. Yeah, Rios is a little like Han Solo, but maybe a little more complicated. Raffi isn't the stalwart officer she used to be. People are flawed. I love it. It's real. Yet, it's still the Star Trek universe.\nMake no mistake, Picard wants the Utopian society. He wants to set things right, but he knows it comes at a price. When Deep Space 9 came out, it was supposed to be darker and grittier and at times it was just laughable. Not until the later seasons did it get a little darker. Star Trek: Picard is saying you can't have the light without the dark. You can't have good without the bad. Things don't always get resolved in 45 minutes. Characters move on and chose paths that suit them (like 7 of 9).\nI was dubious about this show, but I think they pulled it off. I think they gave us a problematic world and a struggling, former hero who still wants to do the right thing. He wants to make the universe a better place, but he needs help. He stumbles along the way and makes mistakes (how terribly human), but he keeps getting back up and fighting. I'm loving this show. This is what I've been waiting for since the first series ended. It's not perfect. There's some bad dialogue and some stupid things that happen, but it's a fun ride and it keeps you guessing.",

She looks absolutely fantastic and after 20 years has barely aged a day even though her character's look is rather gritty compared to her former appearance, but she's still beautiful and sexy.She's about the best thing I can say so far about this series. I don't understand how such A HORRIBLE series could actually be made but as a serious Star wars fan and strong Star Trek fan, I'm noticing a bizarre pattern here. It's as though these studios and directors are purposely going Out of their way to destroy these beloved franchises!you have JJ Abrams who comes in and remakes Star Trek back in 2009 that completely changes the size and of course the entire galaxy by using the age-old retarded time travel trick because all these directors really care about is making their own mark on something and they have no concern whether it's good or bad. They simply want to make something their own that they don't give a dam about what the fans want or care about nor what any other director has done before, nor about keeping any kind of continuity. It's all about leaving their own mark on something regardless of the backlash.Then you have Disney buying Star wars from Lucas and again JJ Abrams takes the helm for the force awakens which is soon as I heard that he was directing I KNEW he was going to do the same thing here did to Star Trek and he's going to completely alter the feel, the science, the characters and the way the entire universe works.. And he did.Then you have Ryan Johnson who comes in and COMPLETELY Nukes everything that was Star Wars by killing Luke, Ackbar, and all the other God AWFUL things he did in that movie, then Abrams along with the completely incompetent Kathleen Kennedy comes back and puts the nails in the coffin that was the most beloved and profitable movie franchise in history in just a few years.Now we have Star Trek Discovery and Picard and ONCE AGAIN the pattern repeats itself and they have COMPLETELY altered and destroyed everything that was Star Trek. EVERYTHING is completely different from the entire universe Galaxy itself, the way the ships and technology looks and works, the special effects though impressive LOOKING are somehow devoid of any real feel or depth. It's as though the entire show is one big hologram. Even the Borg cube is completely different.. And that stupid scene where the guy and girl are sliding down the metal deck in their socks... What are they 4 years old? How stupid and ridiculous!I'm shocked that Johnathan Frakes is directing this but just like Abrams destroying Star Trek and Star Wars with Kennedy, these writers and directories are now doing the EXACT same thing to Picard!Something must be going on because there is DEFINITELY a pattern here. Hollywood just plain sucks and this is why Sean Connery when asked why he doesn't act anymore said that it's because there is no one in Hollywood who knows how to make movies anymore and the directors are just terrible.It seems that anything that once gave people hope and joy and the promise of a better tomorrow is being systematically destroyed on purpose. It can't be coincidental that all these series are being changed Soo much from they're original successful formats that worked for DECADES as it's almost inconceivable that nearly every writer, director, creative consultant etc could actually be this incompetent, out of touch with the plethora of source material they have, and so unable to follow the successful formats unless it's being done on purpose for some reason.Picard is only a shell of his former self and ass with every other TV show and movie made today, the ONLY thing that seems to matter is pushing their endless SJW agendas, having ridiculously and unrealistic alpha Female characters galore and almost all beta males. You can CLEARLY SEE the feminist influence in this as it's all about forcing down the patriarchy of the white male represented by Picard's character and having the women be the leaders, thinkers, problem solvers and always out fighting, out thinking the males. Even in TNG almost every admiral was female or the head of every major division was a woman. It was already annoying then, now this and everything else makes Star Trek Picard just Trash and completely unwatchable to meSummary: Another SciFi franchise destroyed, just disgusting.",

What might have come of the Federation. Is each season basically one long drawn out episode? Yeah, it totally is. But I was still into it. Did I love it? No. But did I really enjoy it. Yeah! So relax and enjoy. And if you're a Trekker, I guess you'll hate it.",

Maybe the environment changed, you changed or yous just simply grown out of it.I really can\u00b4t tell what it is, that destructs me so much about that new Picard series. Maybe it is the really bad Alex Kurtzman script writing, the Jar Jar Abremesque directing or the simple fact that Star Trek Picard is becoming a Game of Thrones kind of game. Every scene is painted in a over dramatic manor. Every scene wants to be overwhelming, wants to catch the audience emotionaly, just wants to be to much of everything. But foremost it want\u00b4s to change the charecter of a rational thinking, brillant Star Fleet captain/addmiral into a emotional acting tattering old man, totally ingnoring a life time of responsible serving as a captain and an admiral. The most sad part is that it\u00b4s getting worst and worst from episode to episode. Man I loved Sir Patrick playing Picard in TNG but I start to realy dislike him for playing in that stupid little series, full of darkness and violance called ST:Picard. This series has nothing and I mean absolutly nothing to do with Star Trek. It\u00b4s just labeled with it.Gosh, maybe I\u00b4m getting to old to enjoy the new Star Trek that it has unfortionaly become. Jar Jar and Kurtzman changed the whole game. Star Trek isn\u00b4t about science, exploring and growing as mankind anymore. It has just became stupid. I guess that Gene Roddenberry is already turning in his grave.Also some of the reviews telling Trekster and Trekkis that this is not our Star Trek and we have to take it the way it is. I Say that Star Trek is nothing without it\u00b4s fans and supporters. Without the guys who spending tons of time, passion and money (sometimes trevelling around the globe) to visit ST conventions in costumes and living their passion. We need to show CBS that we the fans are the ones who decide about what Star Trek should be and avoiding to watch every ST series that is already aired or will be aired in the future on CBS",

            "review_title": "Familiarity Spurs Believability",
            "content": "Here are my impressions, a review of sorts, of the series.Firstly, I have always loved Patrick Stewart, in any role he has played but by far my favourite is Jean-Luc Picard. I watched Star Trek:The Next Generation when it premiered in the '80s and while not my favourite in the Star Trek Universe it has some of my favourite characters. That being said, Picard opened slowly. Patrick Stewart is old, and that reflected upon Picard. (Hindsight, maybe that was intentional). The first three episodes moved very slowly as character, plot, and setting development were all introduced. It felt a bit disjointed and we were unclear what three story line aspects were the focus of the storyboard and which characters we were supposed to fall in love with. After the third, um fourth episode, things moved a bit quicker though the plot still was a bit disjointed; at least we had a clearer understanding of the objective.\nSecondly, I loved the introduction of former cast members of ST:TNG. Deanna Troi and Will Riker were fan favs of mine along with Data, Seven of Nine, and even Hugh. I would have liked to see where the Star Trek Universe would have taken Wesley Crusher but ... continuing. I had forgotten about Deanna and Riker's on again/off again trists in the original NG series. It was nice to see them together. As for the newly introduced characters. I liked Cristobal Rios though I do believe Santiago Carbrera plays all his roles too similarly, think Taz on Salvation or Santos on Transformers. And I was thrilled to see Michelle Hurd in the show. Her character was totally believable and real. The cast, old and new, worked well together and complimented each other nicely. In the end I fell in love with each of the \"crew\" members and look forward to the continuing voyages of Picard.\nThirdly (is that a word?), the slow beginning to develop characters, plot, and setting was crucial for the last four episodes (7, 8, 9a, and 9b). I so loved the course of the series and understood the mindset of each and every character. It is important to know why a character is where s/he is and why s/he is there and Picard explained that nicely. For me. It was shown here in Germany on Armed Forces Network from episode 1 to 9b as a binge watch which concluded at 0400 Monday morning! Eek. And though I told myself at 0100 that I was going to bed I just could not stop watching (you cannot record AFN). The show was speeding along, I fell for each character and had a need to know what would happen next. I was not disappointed. I did \"know\" inevitabilities and outcomes before the show ended but did not know exactly the \"how to get there\" details and I was moved to tears throughout the season two-part finale. The wrap up was exactly as it should be for a Star Trek Universe series, which has always maintained \"a hopeful future\".\nConcluding, the entire 10 shows felt like it should have been shown on the big screen as a movie. There was an intensity about the series that just felt like a movie, to me. I appreciate the small screen approach though which proved invaluable for character development. The closing scene I sat and thought, \"what a great movie, this would make for an incredible series\" almost totally forgetting that this was a series. Well done and hats off to the writers and directors. I am a huge fan of this \"crew\" and look forward to their \"continuing mission\".",

To top it off, they took a show about space and the elevation of the human condition and twisted it into a show set in the present, with no space ships, no worlds to explore, and a dismal and dreary view of humanity. We don't want a Star Trek series to tell us how horrible the present is! We already know! We want Trek to show us a more optimistic future and do it with style, intelligence and excitement.

What about Robert Picardo? Sure, you cant fit all old Characters in, but this EMH, sorry.. Just no!!Other Thing is the Violence... Do Star Trek need it? No not really, but i found it welcome. It is war, and war is bloody. Even Star Trek had some Blood Scenes.\nI think everyone found this abnormal, because of the Character who gets slashed.\nStar Trek definately can have some Violence and Gore, i dont have a Problem with that, it makes it more Authentic.Picard the Series for me is Dead. It had big Potential and delivered nothing.\nIt tricked everyone with the Trailer, that you must thinked \"This will be a big reunion of all super Characters in one Series\"... YEAH, That believed everyone!\nIt was cutted to awaken that feelings to trick the audience.Sorry, Picard will not get far... Its a Shame for James Stewart, a Shame for Star Trek, a Shame for all Fans.Beside Picard, Discovery looks great, and Discovery was also not a big bang,\nbut Discovery never promised to be the Series of the Century.\nDiscovery was ok as it is, but Picard..

As a sci-fi fan, I also like Star Trek movies and series ( I grew up watching the original series reruns on tv) and it certainly has a very important place in my heart. But I'm a Star Wars fan, and as so, I really don't know or have much knowledge about Star Trek lore. I know what most people know... captain Kirk, Spock, the Entreprise adventures, some main antagonists like romulans, klingons and KAHNNNNN!, all the spin-off series, those red shirt dudes who are meant to die...\nDue to that fact, I was not sure what to expect regarding \"Picard\". What I know is that Star Trek: Discovery was a total flop. Weak script, weak characters, dumb klingons... while Star Trek New Generation, in the other hand, was a huge success and Jean-Luc Picard is considered among the greatest capitains ever in ST universe (In my opinion better than Kirk, who is a wrecking train, despite all his courage).\nSo, I was becoming more and more eager to watch Picard. First ep is awesome, Data shows up, there's action, good fighting scenes... and a promising plot. But as the series develops, it becomes dull and low paced. I really like Patrick Stewart as Picard, but Picard isn't working that nice as an octagenary, mainly in fighting scenes. it simply makes no sense... writers should have come with a better idea to improve those moments.\nDialogues are very dumb in severeal scenes. Some decisions are plain pointless. I quit watching after some episodes.\nNothing against Mr. Patrick Stewart, a honed actor. I just cant let off the thought \"what a waste of good acting\".",

Even if he is the one who demanded the show must go on, someone should have kindly refused him.I have the utmost respect for the honorable Patrick Stewart. Paramount? Zero.

There is (almost) no Enterprise (yet?). It is also a product of its time, it evolved. We are not living in the 1980's anymore.\"Picard\" is a series about what it tells you in the title: Star Trek's beloved Captain / Admiral: Jean-Luc Picard. You rejoin the life of Jean-Luc Picard, now retired, and whatever crosses his path. It is an ode to friendships, established over the former decades, camaraderie, and the wisdom that you acquire with the years passing. If you were/are a real Star Trek: The Next Generation-fan, you will enjoy \"Star Trek: Picard\". It makes some subtle nods, but from a personal point of view: Picard's.Furthermore, the main protagonist is Patrick Stewart as 'Jean-Luc Picard', an octogenarian in real life playing an Admiral over 90 years old. (Picard was born in 2305, and the series is set in 2399) If you feel this in the pace of the series, this is (more than) normal. It however gives you the time to enjoy the stellar performances of the new cast and the surprise appearances of some well-known faces.For me, it was a show that warms the heart, and makes you think. My only regret is that it's only 3 seasons that are planned.",

Picard is clearly pining for the old days when Starfleet was a noble and peaceful institution, rather than the increasingly political and cautious entity it has slowly changed into.Picard change anything from the helm of a mighty starship anymore, so he has to do it with the resources at hand. The new characters are intriguing so far, with plenty of their own baggage. You won't find the easy camaraderie of TNG here yet. This is a ship with a crew that has to sort some issues out first.The show takes a little while to get moving, but as of episode five, it seems to be well on its way. Plenty of Easter eggs too that fans of the old series will love.If you're a fan of of Star Trek, give it a shot.

But I made a bitter realisation around 10 years ago, after going to my first Star Trek convention. The magic, optimism and joy all Star Trek fans understand and enjoy, had been quietly replaced behind the scenes. Don't get me wrong, I know that money needs to be made and actors grow tired of their roles. But I started to realise that fans of Star Trek were seen as foolish cash cows by the franchise owners, and mindless morons by the actors (not all, though).When the JJ films landed I was disappointed but I enjoyed them for what they were. As long as I told myself they weren't really Star Trek, I could accept them. Discovery, a politically driven and unapologetic lip service to woke ideological nonsense was both insulting and disturbing. But fortunately, felt so far removed from Star Trek that it almost went by unnoticed. There were at least characters I liked and moments I enjoyed.Now this...There is nothing positive to take from STP. The writing is both aweful and politically motivated. If I thought Discovery was driven by woke agendas then Picard just took it to a whole new level. The acting is appalling, especially by Patrick Stewart. The fictional science is unbelievably dire. It's cheap and crass (the swearing is vile). People don't watch star trek to be lectured by over paid fools with no grasp on reality. The entire series seems determined to dismantled a great male icon (I point out the male part since women seem to be the ones constantly attacking him). Patrick Stewart is a disgrace for taking on this role again and allowing the legacy of Picard to be mutilated. He certainly has no place in the hearts of true Trek fans any more. A sad end, indeed.",

Since TOS the next series is criticised for not being like the last, why would you want it to be?! You can watch the old one, there is no growth in that, Star Trek would die otherwise. Your favourite series is normally what you saw as a child, when you were young, dumb and full of for mentioned optimism. Yes kids can't watch it because of the swearing, violence, drug references etc. But they're not supposed, it's rated a 15 for that reason.Wow, thanks for letting me vent, now about the show.It's a well crafted love letter to Commander Data. Who started watching this and forgot Data was dead? Me, because we all remember the end of Nemesis right?! I remember Tom Hardy is in it & he's a clone of Picard, that's about it. So this new series rectifies that full stop on the TNG series and somewhat mediocre films. Giving Data the true send off he deserves.Along the way we encounter old friends like Seven of Nine, Riker, Troy and poor old Hugh. There is some great acting by the cast especially Alison Pill, Santiago Cabrera and the standout Lulu Wilson as Riker & Troy's daughter, great things could be in her future.The story is something different, a narrative driven mini series revolving around synthetic life, has been touched upon on previous Star Trek episodes, especially in TNG, but not like this. They bring in all aspects, androids, the cyborg borg and synthetic humans weaving in the new and old characters. Like who thought Seven & Picard had something in common, never thought of it until now. It's well conceived and written from a place of love for TNG. The plot is a little thin in parts but it's enough to keep you interested and wondering what's next.Yes it's not the Picard I grew up with, but times change and so must we. It's not perfection, but what is?! I gave it a 10 out of love not rational thought. If you love TNG and didn't shed a tear at the end, what kind of monster are you?!

There is some very intelligent writing and its nice to see CBS embrace Patrick Stewart and the idea that Star Trek is primarily about exploration, philosophy, camaraderie, and examining the human condition. In Discovery, they gave us a bunch of bad writing, big flashy space battles, and dumb villains. This show has some rough patches and a lot of violence, but Patrick Stewart is still a great actor, and Michael Chabon obviously knows how to write good science fiction.",

So I grew up with Picard, and the cast of TNG. Watching this was more than nostalgic. It was very good.Series does a great job of showing that things can change, and sometimes people don't adapt as well as they could. If fear controls you, bad decisions are the result. Picard proves this in spades. That is the way of the Romulans--secrecy and fear. Even Star Fleet can lose it's way--temporarily, and might need to be brought back in line with it's principals.I found the series to be refreshing. It wasn't filled with ideological pureness. I know some people are upset about that. Instead, it showed what can happen to lofty aspirations when they bump up against fear and cynicism. This series did a great job of showing that contrast and it's effects. How the Prime Directive itself can be ignored if fear and hysteria of an unknown takes over. Then, how reason can once again take root.To me, that hits Rodenberry's main theme on the bullseye. So those saying this missed his vision, I say hogwash. It just approached it from a different angle, but respected it all the same. Sometimes people make mistakes, lose their way, and struggle. But our best impulses can help us rise above in time. That is what this series is about. Overcoming fear to be out best selves. Even Star Fleet is not immune from losing its way.",

            "content": "As a fan of Star Trek since 1966, I have been mystified at all the hate being thrown at the Picard series. It is visually gorgeous, has complex layers of plot and characterization, and is backed by beautiful music created by one of the best composers working in TV and movies today.\"It's not Star Trek,\" they say. Yet every Star Trek series had its own look and feel and its own emphasis. Why complain that a new series does too?After thinking about this a bit, it occurred to me that the problem is that people don't like change in general. They want to hang on to something they loved in the past, and they want more of the same. Unfortunately, the reality of life-- and art-- is that things change and develop. As they should. There is tremendous creativity going on in the Star Trek universe, and that means there will be new and different ways of presenting stories. One might not like this or that detail, but overall the constant effort to create something wonderful that has never existed before, while honoring the past, deserves admiration.I wonder, if new stories and characters were put in front of those who hate recent versions of Star Trek that did nothing but rehash the old ones, if they would complain about that too.Star Trek is still telling stories that have immediate social significance. It's not fluff. It's darker than it used to be-- so is the world. But it is still about hope and about doing the right thing no matter how difficult or unpopular that may be. The fundamental Trek values have not gone away.The crucial thing about the Picard series, to me, is the exploration of what a man does with the time he has left when he knows the end of his life is bearing down on him. Picard is still absolutely Picard, and those who say he is not never really paid attention to TNG. Great man that he is, Picard has a streak of arrogance that has led to his undoing. (Melinda Snodgrass wrote in \"The Measure of a Man\" that he was a pompous, and we do see that aspect of his personality get him into trouble at times.) Yet he is still every inch the hero we need him to be.And the exploration of Romulan culture is great fun.For those who dismiss all this with terms like \"garbage\" and \"in the toilet,\" of course you are all entitled to your opinions. But please, let's see what stories you have written, what costumes you have designed, what characters you have brought to life in your own productions, since you obviously know how it should be done.",

Because of that, last two episodes felt rushed. They used technology to try and solve the problems with how they'd written the story. Also the final reveals with what they did to Picard didn't work at all for me.

However, no matter how hard I try I cannot find anything to admire about Picard (and the equally execrable Discovery). Quite simply, they are not Star Trek as I know it, as it has been - successfully, I might add - for decades. The happiness and excitement I felt when this show was announced now feels like a cruel joke.All the previous series share common DNA, in both aesthetic and philosophy; a strong sense of positivity and righteousness, a faith that as long as you strive to do the right thing then all will turn out ok in the end. Those underpinning principles have been well and truly cast aside with Picard. It is grubby, ugly, nasty and very, very stupid. The writing is some of the poorest I've witnessed in a big-budget TV show for a long time, perhaps ever. The characters, if they can be called such, are so paper-thin that it takes several episodes to even remember their names. They are defined almost entirely by their many faults, and this is compounded by a stylised direction that allows no room for any meaningful relationship building or character development. They are essentially a bunch of cardboard cut-outs, thrown together into the emptiest-looking spaceship in the history of science fiction (seriously, it makes a Spartan house look like Liberace's boudoir) and hey presto! They're all friends now, for some reason.Between this and Discovery, it is apparent that CBS have zero interest in continuing to make Star Trek. They are instead making insipid, nonsensical, eye-achingly hideous shows in space for stupid people, and have draped them in the carcass of Star Trek in order to fool more people into watching them.

First off, the series does start slowly and a little lack luster. Now looking back I can see they were setting a mood. It had been twenty years and Picard was walled off from the world in his vineyard sulking in his failure and morning the loss of his friend Data. Enter Soji and we find our old captain is still in there somewhere just need in a push to get back in to the action.We find Star Fleet is no longer a socialist utopia but a broken shell of its former self that has been infiltrated by Romulin spies. To get things done Picard must rely of former friends and one time allies. Is this point the show reminded me a little bit of Fierfly.The show does have a mature rating so I was not surprised by a few f- boms, while they were technically not necessary they did feel \"human\" to me. The violence is more real than TNG and I can understand some not liking it, but in my opinion it was not graphic or sensationalized I would call it tv14.At the end of today's episode I yelled at my tv because I didn't want the episode to end and I can't wait for next week. In a world of binge watching I hate having to wait for the next episode but when a story is this good and the writing and acting is this good I will gladly wait.Final thought, with Star Trek : Picard and Discovery, The Mandalorian, and a possible Sg1 reboot. Could we be on the cusp of a Syfy renaissance? I hope so.",

It's depressive, dark and dead wrong for this franchise. And I loved Deep Space 9, that had dark and grim moments.There is only minimal good sci-fi in there. Instead what you get is lot of character talking about their feelings and losses and failures in life. It's depressive and seriously don't watch it if you are down in life!\nOld characters are all over the place and they had a personality wipe from the Kurtzman team. They don't behave as they did in the old series, movies. As usual all men are miserable, bad, or weak, while all the women have the power and strength and \"badassery\". Another stab to Gene Roddenberry's future equality. The dialogues are closer to CW DC cheesy series and some of those are sometimes actually enjoyable. It's very boring.Also it's full of tropes of mystical things and mcguffins, \"the chosen one\", searching for the big \"truth\" trash stuff, that was done to death. It's your typical mystery box, from the creator of the new Mummy movie that flopped. It wont advance your critical thinking as the older Trek series did.\nWhile they say it's in the \"prime timeline\" of Star Trek it's not the canon Star Trek. It's a bastardized mix of the old and the \"Kelvin timeline\". Beside everyone swearing and poverty suddenly again a thing on Earth you can see that by the warp effect, that is clearly from the Kelvin timeline movies. Federation suddenly don't want to help a species, because they fear them, while Kirk himself who lost his son, killed by a Klingon, still managed to make peace with them, but this Federation can't do the same with the Romulans.\nThere is not much traveling between stars and even when they finally gone to somewhere else, to another planet, it's again just to talk there about their feelings, not to show interesting and unusual world in a scientific way, making your mind work.So all-in-all if you want to be depressive, sour and hopeless, ending up lacking the mental power to wake up the next morning to make the world better, I can recommend Star Trek: Misery, Picard edition.If you want something opposite, watch The Orville. Also you want to see good gritty sci-fi with good, strong characters, watch The Expanse.",

            "content": "Season 2 update:\nStarted out promising but quickly turned to boring family flashbacks, useless dialogue, cheesy romance, extremely stupid in-your-face contemporary politics (a smart and proper Star Trek would've set up a sci-fi allegory on another planet to make its political point, but there was no one smart writing this one) and several scenes of pew-pew. This season is a disgrace. The only consistently good part of the \"Picard\" show is ironically dr. Jurati, both character subplots and actress performance. I would be perfectly OK with renaming it \"Star Trek: Jurati\" lol. Beyond her there are very few good parts, mainly the ones where we find out some creatures we already knew about could do things or have things happen to them that we never thought possible, pretty much the same types of good points as season 1, again just thrown in there and put to very little use.Season 1:\nOnce I accepted, based on the trailer, that this would be yet another dark and conflict-focused show, I did like what they came up with as the focus of the conflict, because it was a new type of being, which is good for a \"Star Trek\". And I allowed myself to be pleasantly surprised by how they used some of the old ST technology we were used to in some new ways (like for a certain fight scene).But beyond that it's been disappointment after disappointment, and I haven't been able to watch most episodes without some fast-forwarding. First of all, most of the character writing and acting is bad, everyone's \"too cool for school\" and throwing snappy replies all over the place, just like the totally obnoxious characters from Discovery. Picard himself is unrecognizable, there's no ponderous and dignified attitude anymore, he never wears the uniform, no longer stands up for Starfleet's high principles, instead runs around with some ragtag band of misfits, which is completely un-Picard-like, and worst of all he's the focus of some strange \"Picard Cult\" the writers have created INSIDE the universe. WTH is that?! There was never any premise for that in TNG. He was just one of many Starfleet captains with healthy attitudes and principles, there was no reason to make him out to be this VIP that everyone knows about. He's a great hero for US THE VIEWERS, not in-world! It's very tiresome to keep seeing characters give all kinds of extreme reactions on finding out who he is, that was never what Picard was about - being a galactic rock star.Really the only likeable character in all this is dr. Jurati, because she has some realistic non-superstar modesty and is well acted. The main female character, while she does have some humility, is not well acted at all, the actress they picked does not have enough emotional range, even though she's almost passable because at least she's not acting like a superstar all the time.And while I fully expected there to be some throwbacks and a conversation or two about the good old days, it turns out that there's almost no episode without some sitting around the table scene, having a boring conversation about how things used to be and irrelevant stuff that happened in the past that does nothing to move the plot forward. This is just bad writing.Then on the tech side they also failed to make this a \"Star Trek\", with the most annoying part being the ship interfaces, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the LCARS we used to know. I could forgive the fact that they went with this popular stupidity going around these days of making the GUIs transparent and therefore unnecessarily hard to read, but they could have at least preserved the general \"okudagram\" look, to make them feel like \"real Star Trek interfaces\" to us TNG fans. But no, they threw that part out as well.Bottom line, there is no trekking, nobody's seeking out new life and new civilizations (we're practically served the new life on a plate in the first episode), and this is not Star Trek. Thank Seth we have The Orville, which I can't wait to see continue.",

Typical modern day bs of woke and LGBT+ needs to be in your face. Man are weak and dumb while women are smart and strong. Story starts fast then after first episode it get slow and lots of holes in the story that dont make much of a sense.They have nostalgia elements in this show with old characters but thats about the only thing that is good about it but not fully. Take Echeb from Voyager just to brutally pull out his eye from start of an episode and that was needed in the story for what ever reason. Then one character have son that is shown just so he can say something about moms paranoia and then later never see him again. Why was it needed in the story ? Constantly we as audience know more of the story and character play catch up in the show that takes time and is boring.Introduce us a big bad apocalypse enemy then show a bit of it in the end and it gets solved to easy and is totally useless. All the story was that synths will contact enemy that will come and not that they will open a portal for it like it cant come on it's own. First 4 episode search some guy and then kill him off that wont again solve us a lot of things in the late end of the season.

I thought maybe TPTB learned something from the backlash to Discovery.It's better than Discovery, but this isn't a show about exploring the stars and the sense of wonder that brings with it. It's not even science fiction at all. It's a straight-up drama with a Star Trek theme. The only trick they have up their sleeve is bringing back an aging Patrick Stewart. Don't let that fool you into thinking it's a great show. He plays his role as written here well, don't get me wrong. In fact, he turns in an excellent performance, but that alone still doesn't make this Star Trek.It's one of the reasons I didn't really care much for DS9. It was too much drama, not enough space exploration. Then they returned to form with Voyager and Enterprise.The other problem is that every single scene is trying so hard to be as dramatic as possible. I've noticed this is a trend in recent years in many shows, I think they're trying to make sure you stay super-engaged so that you keep binge watching, but it's just kind of tiring when everything is full-throttle all the time.This isn't Star Trek. I grew up on The Next Generation. Maybe I'm getting old and the times have passed me by. I'm only 35, but I mean, maybe.I wrote off Discovery as a misstep that they would learn from, and was eagerly awaiting Picard, but now it's clear. Star Trek, as those of us who have been watching for decades knew it, is dead. RIP.

It's having a midlife crisis where it's suddenly immensely insecure with its entire identity and has to get piercings, tattoos, a flashy car and act all badass.Welcome to Picard. Everyone involved in this show clearly feels and (and shows) that Picard and Star Trek are old and \"square\" and they need to be \"hip with the kids\" by making it all dark and gritty and making all the characters cool hipsters who don't let the Fed(eration) keep them down. They swear, they vape, there's numerous sex scenes, there's incest. In any other show I wouldn't care about these things but this is Star Trek, not Game of Thrones or Rome or Spartacus or some other show that would likely air on HBO or Showtime.Nothing in this show is Star Trek.\nThe sets look ripped off from Star Wars or Blade Runner.Soji is basically ripped off from Summer Glau's Firefly character.Alison Pill is almost exactly her Newsroom character, just in space. Same \"quirky\" neurotic/anxiety/insecure and overshadowed character.Heck, they even had to plumb the depths of Voyager's plotlines for episode material and bring in Seven of Nine. Most Trekkers consider Voyager the worst of the 90s series so if Picard is having to dredge them for materials and characters what does that tell you?The sad thing is that Stewart is almost pointless in a show that he's supposed to be the frontrunner in, that carries his character's name. He does the bare minimum to get things moving but is mostly just a passive passenger to the plot. Gone are his epic speeches, his fire, his love for Starfleet and law and order. Now he's just a lame, quiet old man who lets people walk and talk all over him and around him while he does virtually nothing. No one is expecting the 80 year old Stewart to do action scenes but he's constantly on Broadway making himself heard and yet he can't even speak up for himself when being insulted to his face and mocked repeatedly in this series.",

Your mileage will vary.If you're looking to recapture that feeling you got watching syndicated TNG reruns as a 12-year old after completing your homework, you're not going to find that here... Oh, except for those rare moments where there's a high likelihood you will.If you're disenchanted with the more action oriented direction the Star Trek franchise has taken, you're likely to remain disappointed... Except when you're not.More than anything, Picard's first season feels like a disparate grab bag of ideas and references (virtually every prior iteration of Star Trek is referenced in some capacity here, even the 2009 reboot) awkwardly and not entirely convincingly stitched together. With that in mind, individual moments occasionally shine through, the cast is uniformly fine, and Jeff Russo's score is terrific. The story reaches for--and occasionally achieves--emotional resonance, but it's undermined by a lack of internal logic. Some plot threads go nowhere. Others appear out of nowhere, seemingly at random, serving no larger narrative purpose.Overall I'm forced to admit that I think the show represents a swing and a miss.

There's an incredible amount of gratuitous violence, including little girls who can defeat ten men single-handedly, and people being dissolved by acid, and gigantic explosions. The preamble to Star Trek states that it's the Enterprise's mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before\". Now, not only is the Enterprise gone, but we're also going to old tired places where we've already been before. Romulans. Sentient androids. The Borg. Blah.The reason I love Star Trek is that it gave me hope for the future. It was inspirational. It made me feel that human beings are capable of being good.

It's a mess of absurd ideas, completely unbelievable and unrelatable characters, all thinly strung together across far too many episodes, with the end result being not only very bad, but also insulting to the intelligence of the majority of people who have more than a passing interest in the franchise.Kill Picard and make a robot copy of him murder a copy of Data? Yeah, sounds like BAD fan fiction to me, and it is!It's disrespectful to the legacy of everyone who has ever worked in the franchise before this horrendous reboot. There is NO STORY! It's just a bunch of depressed, broken, miserable people I really couldn't care less about, in a miserable distopian universe, and they, like the writers and producers have turned their backs on Star Trek, on the fanbase, and on every value the show ever had.THE WRITERS AND PRODUCERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND STAR TREK OR WHY PEOPLE WATCH IT! And then they blame the audience.I instantly regret watching this now that I go back and watch canon trek reruns, I keep getting flashbacks to this horrific future they all end up in eventually, so what's the point in ever being hopeful about anything?I don't think I will be able to enjoy Trek ever again after what I've seen in this. Congratulations CBS, that's quite an achievement. You've broken the trust and indeed the interest in the franchise of millions of fans, and then flipped them off.If I could wipe my mind of this I would do it in an instant, but the damage is done now and ruined the enjoyment I from reruns.",

Unfortunately, the plot then went on a 7 Samurai road, as Picard travelled the universe, assembling his rag-tag crew, with plenty of fan-crap chucked in when really, I just wanted the series to stick to the plot!Going by all the negative reviews and people giving up the programme after a few episodes, I was not alone.Eventually, Picard arrives at a Borg cube - where he should have been several episodes sooner - and I found myself to be getting back into the programme (despite an actual samurai tagging along). Also, it was SO REFRESHING not to have been inflicted by the Woke disease! Yes! Star Trek had learnt (just shame about the mess of the plotting).I won't spoil this for anyone, so I'll fast forward to the end, at which point, it felt like an absolute eternity of dreariness and preaching before the series did, actually end. To be honest, it was the inevitable outcome to the plot, yet still, it was massively unsatisfying.\nTacking on an addition (almost) 20 minutes only made the finale worse.In the final sequence, we then see two female characters linking fingers in a cringe-inducing, totally unnecessary moment that made me wonder if American TV shows have a bare minimum Woke quota before they can air, and I fear for the 2nd series - seeing as how one is in development - given the poor writing, needless nostalgia, plain soppiness and how two of the key female characters now appear to have entered into a lesbian relationship.Thankfully though, Picard was void of Woke for the most part... it's just a shame that its creative team were also void of any good ideas or originality.\nPerhaps Worf will appear in the 2nd series to add some much-needed charisma to its bland cast? However, given how insipid this series was, I'll still have to be on lockdown before I go out of my way to watch it.",

She constantly refers to Picard as JL... which is constantly annoying.The Picard character, what to say? I'd opt for a lobotomy rather than watch 'Picard in his last years'. His scenes are consistently depressing slogs, and it's a shame that this will be one of Stewart's lesser pieces of work.

            "review_title": "What a letdown",
            "content": "Lately, Star Trek as a franchise has been increasingly disappointing. Simon Pegg, who passed himself off as something of an expert in all things Trek, foisted off Star Trek Beyond on an unsuspecting public, complete with Fast and Furious director Justin Lin's Fast and Trekious. An upcoming franchise entry promises to have a gang of teenagers finding a wrecked starship a la Scooby Doo. Lower Decks promises to make Trek funny.And then there's Picard. Picard was a major letdown. The story, such as it is, is a mostly meaningless mess, with perhaps 3 episodes worth of plat stretched out to 11 episodes. How did they manage that? Well, there's the episode with Picard in a zoot suit on the crime syndicate planet (stop laughing, I'm serious). There's tons of material with Borg and Romulans which has no bearing whatsoever on the main plot (such as it is) or the season's conclusion.And about that conclusion. There's an attitude around current Trek, on full display in Picard. I can best describe it in an online conversation I had with a fan, when I pointed out that the show was incredibly fluffy and light on story. The response was \"But Picard is now sooooo woke!\" as if that in and of itself was sufficient.So surely the characters make up for the lack of story, right? Uh huh. First, Picard himself is a shell of his former self. This would be OK if the show explored this development, but it really doesn't. It has Picard morosely feeling disappointed in former life choices (and be warned, everything in this show is morose) but it doesn't address his aging. At the same time, whenever there's action, it's hard to escape the feeling that the actors around Stewart are fearful of breaking him.Few of the other characters come off any better. Agnes Jurati comes off as incredibly neurotic, even before she's subjected to a Vulcan-style mind meld which may have completely compromised her. She kills a man who may have been her lover, becomes deranged...then everything is OK, and all is forgiven. No, strike that. All is NOT EVEN mentioned.For Voyager 7 of 9 kills someone who may have been her former lover. She's morose throughout the episode, but she's smiling by the end, even though the thing which apparently apparently made her morose has had no resolution.Rafi Musiker is apparently meant to be a third major character. When introduced, she hates Picard enough to threaten to kill him. But she changes her mind (because the script requires her to do so), and by the end, she's smiling along with everyone else.And Picard? He has the best ending of all. He dies, and then after a short scene he is brought back as an android. There follows an explanation that nothing will have changed for him. He can still be killed, and he will still grow old and die, yadda yadda yadda. I'm tempted to say that he died because the episode was running short, but I think the truth is that Stewart wanted a death scene.Is the show completely worthless? Almost...but not quite. The Doj and Soji characters have something of an interesting (yet rushed; not to producers, less Borg and Romulans, less traipsing around in search of clues, more character development). Riker and Troi are back, and unlike their former Captain they have character development and it's believable. They also have a daughter who steals the show, and scenes with her and Soji are the season's best.Is that enough to make it worthwhile to watch the show? For me, Picard is ten hours of my life that I can't get back. I would have to be paid a lot to get me to watch any more of this drivel.",

I don't find The Next Generation to be great, certainly not Original Series great, but I find it tolerably OK and I watch it when there's nothing else on to attract my attention.This show is a train wreck. The characters are for the most part, flat and dull, and worse they make no sense. Musiker, for instance, hates Picard when we first see her. She threatens to kill him. Suddenly, everything is OK and she's willing to Trek along with him. Jurati goes crazy, kills a man, then all is forgiven.The only character who is truly endearing is Riker's and Troi's daughter. The actress is charming and natural, and her scenes with Soji are the high point of the show, although that's a sadly low target to set.The story, such as it is, is similarly pointless. Picard et al rush to some location to get a clue to solving their mystery, which sets them toward rushing to another location to get another chunk. We're given information that's supposed to make us care about them, but it rings hollow. Musiker, again, is supposed to hate Picard, holding him responsible for the end of her Star Fleet career. She doesn't seem particularly committed to here ideals, however.Then there are the tons of characters who have no real point at all in the story, although they suck up a lot of screen time. Of them all, 7 of 9 is probably the worst. She's another tortured person (there are a ton of them), but the reasons why are vague, and it's OK because, like all the rest, she's happy at the end. There are a pair of Romulans who appear to be Picard's servants, but who also appear to be trained operatives, who...just disappear. Then there are a ton of ex-Borg including our old friend Hugh, who...just disappear, although at least he dies, so we understand his disappearance.And what does all this lead to? A conclusion which I believe is supposed to make us feel good. It's composed of two primary elements. In the first, Soji is ready to give up on all corporeal life in the Milky Way galaxy. She requires very little convincing to support this course of action. She's just ready to kill us all. And then, she's not. Changed her mind. Why? It's a girl's prerogative.In the second element, Picard dies. After a brief dialog between his \"spirit\" and Data's \"spirit,\" he's back. Those responsible go to great lengths to explain that, while he's been resurrected in an android body, he's just like he was before. He has his own soul, his body will wear out, he will die, etc. In other words, he's died, and nothing has changed.Granted, Star Trek has been on a long downhill slope for decades, but this is the bottom of the barrel.",

So Romulans are spiritual mumbo-jumbo folks now?Are those drones being \"reclimated\" still alive? ... or are they being set free from their Borg bondage so their spirits are finally at rest?Three times now, these super-duper Romulan ninjas have gotten their asses kicked. Once by the recently activated Dahj (I forced myself to accept this one because of what she might be) and the second time they can't overwhelm a android girl and Picard in an open setting - they got their target by accident!

I grew up with TNG and it has influenced my outlook on life significantly and even inspired me into a career in the space industry. TNG dominates my top 10 favorite sci-fi TV episodes. Picard will always be the best Enterprise captain in my opinion and Patrick Stuart has earned my respect for consistently excellent performances in other franchises too. After watching the first episode of Picard I was really surprised with what I saw. So I watched it again and I'm still surprised how different it is to the Star Trek I know so well and love. In the TNG there was a great episode where the Enterprise crew had to stop other universes merging with theirs. In that episode they had to destroy an Enterprise from a universe where the Borg had wiped out the federation and the crew didn't want to return to their reality. I kinda feel like Picard is set in one of those alternate universes, a Universe where character arcs are filled with non-sequiturs. I really hope it improves with the next episodes, but there is so much wrong with it that I don't have much hope.",

It created a sense of adventure, inspired us to be better than we are, and gave us hope that a bright and peaceful future was possible.This was well established in ST:TNG, where the Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future was fully realized. A powerful captain and electic crew that was galvanized by morality, passion, diversity, and common values. Clever plot devices, characters both strong and flawed playing off each other, and bold stories for the time it was in still resonate today. It was truly a hero for many of us and still is.ST:TNG was everything that \"Star Trek Picard\" is not. The flaws are easily seen in the first episode, where they simultaneously ignore (or dismiss) an established universe while tearing apart the moral foundation of the Federation. No pilot episode should have familiar fans scratching their heads during all of the world building.It was immediately confusing to me that the Romulan Star Empire did not have the resources to evacuate Romulus by themselves. It was well established over TNG and DS9 that the Romulans were the equal to the Federation. Many head scratches followed when the Federation was portrayed as a xenophobic and militant organization against Romulans and complicit with the destruction of their homeworld, the Federation is now an organisation not interested in saving other life. It has also become an organisation that has built a labour force out of androids, an idea that was effectively axed in the classic TNG episode \"measure of a man\".Picard himself is not the man I remember either. He was once a role model, a man who stood on principle, breaking the rules to do what is right, a skilled diplomat that taught us violence is not an answer, and a man who did what he could to stand for what he believed in. Now, we have a man who gave up, a man who, despite having saved the galaxy numerous times over a 40 year career, is now forgotten by history or downright ridiculed. It is mindboggling to me that such a well established and iconic character who embodied some of the best qualities to strive for is now treated as an annoying old man that should just \"mind is own business and stay out of the way\". (Also, hearing an admiral use the F word after his impassioned speech was quite cringy).I could go on about this show, but to summarize, it is quite obvious to me that Alex Kurtzman has either never watched Star Trek before, doesnt care about it, or is too afraid to create a show filled with hope. Regardless he now relies on cheap and nonsensical plot devices with flashy SFX and cliche angsty teen drama. Rather than being the bright and hopeful future that was TNG, we now have an embodiment of xenophobia and Trump's America that is now referred to as The Federation.The hero has now lived long enough to become the villain.",

This is some dystopian version of both. How it got an 8+ rating is beyond me, unless there are a ton of paid shill reviews.This series might almost work if it was presented as a totally unrelated space opera, if it weren't so SLOW and stodgy in moving the story along. Oh, there is some \"action\", but no imagination. Even the violence... I won't say what, so as not to spoil it for those who haven't watched it, but trust me, some of it is unnecessary. Not to mention that this Star Trek is full of uncultured, foul-mouthed people. And what's up with the Romulans? They are just pointy-eyebrow, pointy-ear humans. At least they act that way.It is not even that the actors are bad. Certainly Patrick Stewart, Santiago Cabrera, Alison Pill and too many others to name are good actors. You just have to watch some of the other shows they have appeared in to know that. They just need to be given better material to work with.Has no one involved with the production even watched Star Trek (the real Star Trek series, not the JJ-Kurtzman versions). Nothing in this show reflects the forward thinking ideals presented by those. This show is all about criticizing the current state of the world and telling everyone what is wrong with it. In short, it is a show for today's 'woke' people who require everything to be done to their agenda or not at all.Personally, I am looking (mostly in vain) for shows which present a hopeful outlook on the future.

The positive side is the CGI and that Patrick Stewart is back, very nice they did they brought back the Enterprise D in the first episode.Now to the Cons which consists of terrible writing, terrible acting, to much action for a TV series and it makes it look more like a film than a series, weak plot and they seem to stretch out the series, which probably they could have done the entire series in just three episodes.Bottom line this is not Star Trek, it is a cheap copy of Star Trek, Blade Runner, Terminator, Lord of the Rings and so many other series, and there is nothing original in this pile of crap.

In episode 5, I am expected to watch a man get his eyeball drilled out of his head and listen to him screaming all the way through it.

It seems now that to writers for TV are trying to dumb down characters. Why in a supposedly enlightened future are high ranking officers using expletives to make points? Did humanity regress to a lesser state? The writers in many series do this, and usually it comes with a loss in ratings (just look at the last series of Designated Survivor). Beyond that, the credibility of characters is damaged by the weak acting and direction, for example since when did Romulans have Irish accents? yeah yeah I can't be too picky here given a so called french guy has an English accent, but at least that is more established. Surely actors have not lost the ability to character act?So in short, the potential is there, it may be too late for the first season, but lets see.

Instead of the old star fleet of professional officers, we basically get a show written as a teen drama with emotionally immature characters but one staring old actors instead. It makes me wonder who they have writing this stuff or who they think the Star Trek audience even is. The first season felt like a sub par Next Gen movie. It wasn't terrible and was entertaining enough to keep me interested but it was already the weakest addition to the franchise aside from Star Trek Discovery. By the second season, I'm already dropping off. Ive watched every single episode of every single Star Trek but I've fallen asleep several times with this one. There's nothing challenging about it. Nothing trek. Just the usual brain dead platitudes to show the audience how enlightened the writers of the show are and boring sci fi story lines we've seen countless times. It's not only not good, it does that thing that movies and tv shows have been doing lately where they just become insufferable and full of them selves. It's like the writers are putting way too much of themselves in place of who these characters are.",

Here were characters navigating difficult situations and showing the best that humanity had to offer. in addition the original Star trek actually had science fiction concepts behind most of the plot. There is none of that in these new series and in fact I would argue that they're on the level of Star wars level science fiction and that some magical widget is going to save the day.

This isn't Jean-Luc Picard, either.Almost every character here treats Picard the way the Simpsons treat Grandpa Simpson -- like a senile, doddering old fool who should only sit in the corner and not say anything unless he wants to be talked down to.I watched a few old TNG episodes last week by chance, then watched this mess again. Wow, the difference. The Jean-Luc Picard we all know from TNG had dignity, strength of character, and commanded respect. In TNG, he stood up to Romulans, Klingons, survived Cardasian torture with strength of will, stuck it to the Shelliac when he found a loophole in the contract they had with the Federation to save the day, etc.ST: Picard's 'Picard' is not that guy. Here he only seems to be there to be talked down to and disrespected by everyone around him except for the Elf warrior that follows him around -- whose sword skills are somehow vital for his protection in a world where the primary weapons are phasers fired at a distance at you.Character wise, Picard is only Picard in name. Jean-Luc Picard naming his dog 'Number 1'? Cheap writer gag that got some 'ha ha' from someone in the writing room, but there's no way Jean-Luc Picard would ever do that -- he'd consider it tasteless. Raffi calling him 'JL' all the time? The old Picard would have corrected that in a hurry on the deck of the Enterprise.The only positives are the small references to and cameos with the old TNG cast (not surprisingly). This show is all plot holes, logic gaps, unlikeable characters, revisionist history to ST canon, and Romulans that look like regular humans who went to the dollar store to buy pointy ears. The one on the Borg cube in particular looks like a cosplay actor with a bad wig.The toss in swearing here and there is a really out of place and a cringy way for the show to pretend it's 'edgy' but it just comes across as feeling out of place and uncomfortable.In the end, this show has nothing to do with actual Star Trek. They've even had Picard say he doesn't much like science fiction or understand technology lol.....the former Captain of the Enterprise, whose starship flew all over the galaxy and used his ship's resources himself without a problem many times. These lines actually got green lit to put on screen.Season 3 of The Orville is coming back soon. Looking forward to it. Yes, it's a bit more humor laden and a touch cheesier at times, but it's easily a hundred times more Star Trek than this.",

What happened next was just insulting. What could have been an interesting, relatable and personal journey for it's leading character degraded into a generic soap opera loosely based on it's source material.In fact, the writing disrespects \"TNG\" to the point the main character is unrecognizable. The stoic, pragmatic, fierce Starfleet captain is not present in the series that bears his name.While it's a huge turn off for veteran Star Trek fans, one could argue that newcomers could still enjoy the show. I have bad news: as a series on it's own, \"Picard\" has no charisma, uniqueness, compelling characters, dazzling action... nothing. You never feel there's really anything important at stake. Actually, you don't even care.\"Let's make sure history never forgets the name...\". On that note, I must say Captain Jean Luc Picard's name is forever written in every trekker's heart.

The biggest issue is for a 10 episode season, the setup is taking half the season. The plot isn't terrible compelling and it's taking alot of time for it to get off the runway. With that said, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Why is exactly is this called Star Trek? Every franchise has their own brand. You go see Fast and Furious because you want to see cars and stupid crazy action. You see Mission Impossible for the thrill of the ride. Star Wars mythology and battle between light and dark is engrossing. The Star Trek brand is known for presenting real world human problems in a very unique (sci-fi) way that allows us to judge the entire picture objectively. It's obvious that the writers and show runners understand Star Trek in a superficial way with superficial fan service. I'm all for making changes, but I also think it's important that Roddenberry's vision be at the core of each show. At the core of his vision, he saw a united and harmonious humanity that had respect for all life. The fact that the writers suggested starfleet/humanity has lost respect for Picard because of his compassion towards the Romulans fly in the face of Roddenberry's vision. With Roddenberry no longer around to set up rules for Star Trek writers, the brand is slowly becoming nothing more than 2 words.",

The most recent episode I saw, \"The Impossible Box' got good, sort of, but took a long time to get there. Currently watching Nepenthe which brings back Troi and Riker but I doubt even they can save it.So I've realized, yeah, I know, duh...the same folks running this show (at least one of them,Alex Kurtzman) are same folks who did the 'reboot' movies with original series characters (first two movies were decent I thought, third one was just action movie BS) and same folks doing Discovery.So you have yet another dark, slow-moving, serialized show (which is funny because I loved DS9 yet...). why can't they, please, return to episodic TV? why is every TV show nowadays a serial? no wonder I don't watch much TV. you can maintain a story line, as TNG did, without having to serialize it. you can do the main arc, as DS9 did, if you have an arc, but also do stand alone episodes as you move along with the narrative, inserting what you need in the episodes to carry it further. but, no, aparently. so what we now have with Discovery and Picard is an ongoing narrative bereft of the initial wonder of Trek, no discovery, no exploration, no new aliens and wonders of the universe to encounter and/or figure out each week...sad.Yet as a Trek loyalist since the days of the original series, I keep tuning in, hoping, as do many people like me. So the producers are playing with us and we're suckers for it.Bottom line: the original series and TNG, and to a lesser extent the rest up to Enterprise were, for me, Trek shows I wanted to repeat view because I enjoyed them so much and I've seen original series and TNG episodes literally probably hundreds of times, many are like me, we know the dialog by heart, etc. etc. There's just a magic to those shows.There's no magic to these new 'imaginings' of Trek. I have no desire or compulsion whatsoever to repeat view any of the movie reboots, Discovery or Picard. Because there's no magic.But, I don't begrudge those who enjoy the new shows. And I will keep watching them, hoping, out of Trek loyalty. But, I continue to be disappointed. Then again, when Enterprise was cancelled I was disappointed because I thought it was improving, but I and I would presume many others were fine with the franchise shutting down. Nobody asked for reboots or new series or, at least, certainly not what we've been given since. Sigh.",

There don't seem many artisans left in this trade, or maybe there are just too many productions and there is no time or willingness in this next you-tube generation to dedicate themselves to this craft.\nIt's all left to the craft of the movie-makers to turn the blank spaces on the page into meaningful screen-time.I love Patrick Stewart, a high quality actor, but unfortunately even he can't lift this series off the ground. The script is very slim, almost to the point I thought this was originally written as a movie, and got rewritten into a series.\nThe series is slow, because many scenes live long past their existential reason. Emotional exposition is painstakingly lingered upon and there is a distinct lack of interesting interactions between the characters. There's an overarching story, and everyone floats about the current. Instead of looking for engrossing the viewer into the intricacies of its world and characters, it chooses gratuitous action to counterbalance its otherwise bleak canvas.This series needs an infusion of side plots and deeper character exploration leading to more meaningful moral, political or interpersonal conflicts, the latter remaining very shallow in current episodes.",

The choices here baffle me - The federation has abandoned its principals, Jean Luc has been embittered and done little but pick grapes with Irish Romulans for a decade and a half. The Gene Roddenberry utopia that was the basis of Star Trek is now an Alex Kurtzman nightmare.Why would anyone choose to revive a beloved series only to make something that barely resembles it?

Or worse, serve cereal and tell the customer that ordered omelette that in fact, their cereal is an omelette?!? This kind of gets to the heart of my confusion with 'Picard'. Are they trying to force a new recipe on me? Did they not understand what it was they were making? Or are the people behind it so arrogant they felt they had a better idea of what to do and ignore what came before? Whichever one of these is closest to the truth, the results are... disappointing.The dialogue ranges from sloppy to bizarre, the pacing is slow and the design is ugly. Costume detailing is horrible and the technology is equally upsetting, even implausible. I will however praise the acting because they do great work with awful writing.If like me you are a Star Trek fan you will almost certainly be disappointed. Such a wasted opportunity makes me sad.

Of course they completely fail to realise that Star Trek was still making brand new TV shows 2 years before Kurzman and Abrams got their hands on the franchise and rebooted it for no apparent reason whatsoever other than a cash grab.This is like one long boring drawn out episode that (when taking into account the montages of the last episode, the next episode, the title sequence and such) actually leaves about 36 minutes of watchable content. I say watchable loosely, as I am now only watching this with morbid curiosity, like slowing down to look at a car accident.The plot is predictable to the extreme, bears no resemblance to any version of Star Trek before 2009, has zero science (just writers making up Doctor Who type fantasy timey whimey gibberish with no grounding in science WHATSOEVER), seems to go out of it's way to destroy and retcon whatever of the Star Trek universe it can get it's hands on, has nothing even slightly positive or motivating, and worse of all it's ruining the legacy, just as Discovery did.Canon violations galore, no where even close to family viewing, miserable and dumbed down once again.This is Star Trek written by people who hate Star Trek for people who hate Star Trek's fundamentally positive and intellectually defined character. Decades of world building thrown out like an inconvenience. It's bland, formulaic writing with desperate needs for endless cliffhangers of characters and plot lines that aren't even interesting to mentally question where it's all supposed to be going.Welcome to Star Trek: Dystopia, where people ram their view of divisive politics down your throat, because let's face it if you voted Brexit or Trump then you're fundamentally wrong, bad, evil, and everything broken in the world is all your fault, because democracy is bad now, and the future is written by people who fail to give loser's consent after they've lost a vote on anything. What a petulant and exclusive mindset to write into a franchise as it's death rattle. I suspect much of this is Patrick Stewart's fault, and if the articles of his interviews are anything to go by, he's become a bitter old man completely unable to relate to either the Trek fanbase who (it now appears) idolised the wrong person all these years.

It resembles nothing of genes vision and its a real waste of talent. Picard, Data and all the others deserve better. I tried real hard but couldn't get into the plot of this girls story, I just wanted to see the old crew back together with maybe additional characters from other trek shows but instead they've ignored fans and made a guardians of the galaxy type show.. I hope there's a season two and with it, I hope they get back to star trek.. The franchise doesn't deserve this Hollywood cash in treatment, they've got the cast and endless material from the franchise. If they don't use it then they could hurt the franchise.",

What?! That's their backstory?! Picard doesn't get his way, so he takes his ball and goes home?! JEAN LUC PICARD just gives up and has essentially does nothing for 14 years??!!! WTF??? What lazy writing! That is NOT the Picard I know! Star Trek: TNG's Picard would have kept fighting! He would have stolen a ship and found a way to rescue as many Romulans as he could anyways! He would have called on his friends and allies! Picard is NOT a quitter! He never would have just given up and retired to the countryside to live out the rest of his days and die of old age! Can't believe Stewart allowed them to disrespect his character like that!\nThe plot, writing, and dialogue all feel forced and contrived. Even the nostalgia feels forced. Episode 1 managed to stuff \"Earl Gray Tea\" into the dialogue no less than 3 times in the most awkward ways possible, ugh...\nThe characters feel like cardboard cut-outs; contrived stereotypes making inconsistent decisions based on unclear motives. There are more holes than actual plot in the predictable storyline that lacks any real substance. Kept hoping it would get better, but couldn't even bare to watch past episode 3.

In reality, that happened 30 years ago with DS9.

Absent from real Trek? Certainly not. Poverty rages on many planets. Not on earth, of course (but maybe Raffi just hasn't figured out how to use a replicator). Paranoia is handled masterfully in DS9 in a way that fits the canon and is more poignant than this show could hope to be.DS9 explores complex issues of identity and discrimination regarding genetically modified humans. That's reflected here in ST: Picard's discussion of synthetic life forms, but the former example fits in the world, and the latter is overblown and implausible given what we know about the Federation.Looking at this show in its own right, it moves like a sloth with a myriad of irrelevances and non sequiturs. It does nothing new and everything poorly.To be fair, it looks good. It's a shame it does, in a way - if this had a lower budget, CBS might have allowed some competent writers near a Star Trek series rather than seeking a beautiful but vapid crowd pleaser.Elevating this beyond the lowest possible score are a couple of watchable (and even, for some blissful minutes, enjoyable) episodes and some stellar costume design. There are some great new outfits and updates to old alien fashions. Most of these are seen on ancillary characters since the show is embarrassed to be Star Trek.Let us hope that the Federation finds a way to escape the grip of Alex Kurtzman.",

Stunning cinematography, a decent story in itself (a welcome variation on a bad guy with a super weapon trying to destroy the earth and Starfleet stopping him but at great cost). The scenes with Data, Riker and Troi were all satisfying.\nWhat's not to like? Plenty, unfortunately. Messed-up, dark characters who don't seem capable of bonding with each other. Torturously long story, with numerous really boring episodes as a result. A Romulan intelligence agent who looks and sounds like a final-year London architect student, and his sister, played by Peyton List, who did a decent job in the CW series Frequency, but who is awful in this. F-bombs (must we?). A Romulan Ninja who can't decide if he's Steven Seagal or Forrest Gump. A neurotic scientist who alternates between being all teary and vulnerable to murderous and deceitful.\nI loved Star Trek Next Generation and engaged with all the main characters, especially Picard. I was surprised to find myself not caring when he died in this series and actually being disappointed at his resurrection.\nIt would have been great to have Picard in proper command of a Starfleet vessel again, with a crew we care about and who bond with each other.\nStar Trek TOS, TNG, Voyager made us feel optimistic about the future. A homicide detective once wrote to Patrick Stewart to say that after a hard day dealing with the worst aspects of human nature, he would come home and reach for his TNG box set to make him feel more positive about humanity and the future. The poor guy might be a statistic himself now if he gave this a go..",

They ruined it all!Seriously, this is not Star Trek and here is why:Why does Data only call out to Captain Picard?\nGeordi La Forge has always been Data's closest friend in TNG!He respected Data right from the StartHe was always giving him help and advice regarding Data's wish to be human without making fun of himSo why does he not send for Geordi to help him? Especially since Picard was\nalways \"mildly annoyed\" by Data. The captain respected Data merely on a professional level, but a deep close friend to him, he was never!So where is Geordi?Why do the Romulans need help from the Federation?The Romulan Star Empire is...well...A BLOODY EMPIRE... with hundreds and hundreds of planets under their rule, a huge Starfleet to enforce their law and keep the empires peace.\nAnd now you are telling me that this SUPERPOWER of the galaxy cannot mount its own rescue mission and is also not able to relocate its refugees on the hundreds of hundreds of planets they rule?This! Is! Absurd!Regarding the above, keep in mind that these refugees are the inhabitants of their former home world, so basically the most romulan Romulans there are. And now the rest of the empire leaves its own core-people living as poor bums without any help what so ever scattered in federation space.... Yea, right!I could go on about the Romulans in this show, since they are portrayed so immensely wrong and unlike the Romulans in original Trek but that just would take too long.Speaking of poor bums:\nIt has been established countless times in original Trek, that poverty, hunger and suffering has been abolished in federation space in the future...Remember when Seven Of Nine was a gun wielding super mercenary in Star Trek Voyager?What? You do not remember that?Well that's probably because she wasn't. She has always been a scientist and later a teacher to the freed Borg kids.Data had a \"daughter\". Her name was Lal. He loved her dearly and was actually sad when she died in TNG.\nSo why was he painting this Soji-person and dreaming about her as his daughter?They cloned Data...an android...how? How does one clone memory from something that does not store memory...what is this nonsense?Am I the only one ore does this show strangely feel like they were trying to copy the Expanse...just in the Star Trek universe?\nRocinante in the Expanse, La Sirena in Picard...Spanish named ships in both shows-rag-tag group of people who have to do something in a dystopian dark future, also in both showsCom on...it is obvious...with the exception that the Expanse works...STP does not!There is more wrong with this show, but these are the things that bothered me the most.\nIt is as if the creators of this show did not watch original Trek since they know nothing about it.Hurr Durr, who famous in Star Trek?\nHurr Durr, Picard and Data!\nLet's put in show!\nSeven Of Nine also famous, Hurr Durr...and hooooooot!\nLet's put in show, too and they have to do THING in space!\nNOW SHOW GOOOOOOOOD, Hurr Durr!This is how I imagine the creators planned this. Nonsense! Shame on them!No all jokes aside, my final recommendation:\nIf you are interested in Star Trek and want to enter the Universe, don't watch this! Focus on Original Trek and start either with The Original Series (the 60s style of this isn't for everyone, granted) or The next Generation, which is a must see!\nBut this show is garbage and should not be regarded canon!",

(lol)narek - goofy emo romulan that shouldve been killed 3 or 4 episodes in lasted to the finale...elnor - romulan ninja kid cool in theory but terribly written. totally naive dives head first into any sitation without regard for his well being.seven of nine - i kinda enjoyed her character here. im probably on an island here but i think the stress of being assimilated for so long and then trying to reintegrate into society would absolutely turn you into a revenge-fueled mercenary.rios - comical at times, suave, one of the few likable characters here. unfortunately his slew of dopey holograms really killed and diminished him.final thoughts/tl;dr: style over substance. these people cant write sci fi. i admire the adherence to trek lore but unfortunately, there was nothing original here. plagued by bad writing and character work the entire main cast is totally unlikable and too contemporary. picard himself sucks. i dont know who that man is but its not picard.4/10 hey at least its better than discovery... barely",

This Star Trek universe is dark and dystopian, which is OK with me but I am really upset with the plot points that lead no where, the constant waiting for something to happen, the long shots with almost no dialogue and the pointless backstory on minor characters. OK, Jean-Luc tried to save the Romulans from a supernova which would result in their extinction. There were those in Star Fleet who thought this was not the best idea but reluctantly gave assent. Then, things went sideways and Jean-Luc resigned and retired to his chateau and vineyards in France. A mysterious girl walks into his life. She is a synthetic human, an android, a replicant, if you will, who is unaware of her own origin. She is destroyed and now Picard and a surly, hired Captain and a cynical former Star Fleet officer who served under Picard and calls him, \"JL\" and a naive scientist are off to find the android's \"twin sister\" before she is destroyed too. Why? Because the Romulans hate androids. Why? Because of some obscure Romulan myth? Maybe. Or maybe there is a larger plot to destroy the Federation and Star Fleet or to bring the Borg back or to breed Tribbles, or to distill Saurian brandy. Who knows? Every plot point is ultimately a McGuffin. Every Romulan acts like a human. Every Star Fleet officer acts like an idiot. The only one who is the least bit decisive is Picard and even he does not really know why or where he is going or doing despite having four episodes to make up his mind. And don't get me started on the lens flares or the really poor acting and dialogue. I had hope for this series, but alas, my hopes were misplaced. I will finish out the first season only to see if the writers actually do have an ending to this, but it appears that the scripts were written by the Ferengi, who only are interested in profit,",

(I debated, because we were already paying a lot to watch the shows we enjoyed.) Anyway, I was excited to see Patrick Stewart reprise his role as Jean-Luc Picard. Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed in the series so far. (I have watched 8 episodes.) Here's my list of complaints:* The shows are painfully slow.* Picard's character is a downer, very different from the captain we knew and loved from TNG. (Yes, the situation is grim, but he is not the same Picard as before.)* The series must be watched in sequence. You cannot just tune in an episode and watch like in TNG. You would be completely lost.* The series is full of bad language (as in cussing). I personally say \"bad\" words now and then, but they aren't necessary in Star Trek, especially the \"F\" word. To me, it seems the swearing is added in an attempt to sound \"cool,\" and it just seems forced and out of place.* Some of the gore is not necessary. It used to be if there was something bad happening, they wouldn't show it. Now they go so far as to show someone's eye being popped out without anesthesia, among other things. Really? Yuck and no thank you.* I repeat, the shows are painfully slow.The one thing I have enjoyed is seeing some old \"friends\" again, if only for a short time, including Data, Seven of Nine, Riker and others. I will watch the remainder of this season. However, if something doesn't drastically change in the next couple of episodes, I will cancel my CBS All Access subscription and give up on this series. Too bad, because I had high hopes. After all this time, I expected something MUCH better.**************\nUpdate after watching the last 2 episodes: The felt the 2-part season finale was good. However, it was slow going to get there. Although it was nice to see Picard and others from previous Star Trek series of the past, I much prefer the older series (TNG and Voyager especially) and will stick with watching them instead of continuing with Picard.

            "content": "It is one of those sad, hard truths in life when you realize one of the best TV series of all time has deviated so much from its origins that it is now bordering utter-rubbishness. Then again, we live in a time when our society is in utter social, moral, and imaginative decline, so it really doesn't surprise me that Star Trek too got gobbled up by the lies and deceptions that took hold in every corner of entertainment , media, politics, and cultural dialogue.Patrick Stewart is the only thing that matters in this series. And sadly it isn't enough because the other characters are sabotaging him with the way they are written and are acting. He doesn't have a moment where he truly shines like he did in TNG. After all, this is supposed to be \"his\" show, no?It's more like \"let's turn Picard into a sad old man, and forget everything he has ever accomplished\" Heavily toxic feminist overtones hanging over this theme too; in fact the woke ideology is so conspicuous in some scenes, it made me sick. Starfleet is now an all-female bureucracy fuming with toxicity and rampant personality disorders. Given the present, I guess that's the kind of society they really want us to have in the future: angry females that did away with most males via gene editing and landed on a path to became a monogendered society across all races. I see the Asari connection (ME fans looking at you! The material has been hijacked) (In a funny way, that was a possibility explored in many other strange words the original Trek series explored) So, that's the good future Star Trek gives us, no?Either way these are far cries from characters like Kira Nerys, Dax, Captain Janeway, B'elanna Torres...all compelling female leads or coleads in previous Trek incarnations.People already called this out but bears repeating still. Unfortunately, this show has the DNA of Discovery (an abomination of a show).. Akin to what we see in Discovery, there's no exploration, no adventure, or sense of wonder in Picard. Long gone those intelligent dialogues, plots, and character development that was the trademark of TNG, DS9, and Voyager. Instead we get lots of characters bickering and they overdrive on emo-drama. Seem to mirror the current conditions of our declining society. Very anti-Trek, no?What else...The guy who flies the ship expects payment from Picard. There's reference to latinum later (the Ferengi money). But we were told in TNG that there's no need for money in Federation any longer. So did that utopia really change overnight and they decided to follow the model of Ferengi, the anti-thesis of Federation?What else....Too many lascivious scenes that don't add anything to the story - TL;DL: Too much meaningless / forced romance that comes out of nowhere and wastes screen time. My eyes kept rolling endlessly. Cringe on overdrive.Watch the original Treks while you can because I see a future where they will be banned from public viewing for not being woke and cringeworthy enough. That's where we're headed as a society.And please don't go around blaming millennials in a blanket way for demanding a show like this. I'm a millennial too and I'm often dumbfounded when I see my supposedly well-educated peers' utter ignorance and foolishness for giving license to material like this.Put this thing out the airlock admiral.

I won't mention the lame wokeism as I think that has been appropriately covered in other reviews. Not a single hint of what made Picard's original character great can be seen in this show. It almost feels like the show isn't really even about him. They've shoehorned a completely unnecessary backstory about his childhood in there as an obvious attempt to give the character new depth, but it just doesn't really work. It just adds to the increasing distance you feel from the character. The dialogue is absolutely woeful. Each scene just feels like you're waiting for the next witty quip. The plot just seems to stagnate around a few themes without really moving forward. Episodes 5 and 6 in series 2 end with basically the same cliffhanger. They use \"sci-fi\" technology to brush past absurdly convenient events that seem to only happen so the characters can find something or go somewhere. As others have alluded to, the writing is just absolutely terrible. If you're a Trek fan, my sincere advice would be to not watch it. The only reason I'm persevering is because the finale of series 1 was okay and series 3 sounds moderately promising in terms of its cast.",

If you were going to go the route of a single plot spanning the entire season or even series at least do what DS9 did and still have episodes that have their own story and frame them in the larger one.\nI love Patrick Stewart but no matter how he tries to make something out of his character this Picard just has no depth. As the matter of fact none of the characters have depth or even purpose except for wasting time and pointless conversations about feelings. Yeah, I get it, we all have feelings they get hurt we get ... can we now go find some strange alien life forms already?\nWe do not need gunfights in each episode. We need good stories that tickle the mind and the imagination. There is plenty of violence on TV but no such shows as TNG. TNG was about human values and adventure, and science and wit concurring the galaxy. I'm not even going to mention any other Star Trek series.This Star Trek is no different from any other show on TV, these days, except for different name for their guns.\nIn conclusion, if you are a Star Trek fan look somewhere else.",

He has no energy, is disrespected at Star Fleet and talked down to by the other characters, and accepts that behavior.

The characters, if they hang around long enough, don't inspire.I get that Picard is retired and much older now so we're not going to see the old Picard leading a Star Ship. That makes sense to me. But where the writers took his story arc by the end of season 1 is beyond reasonable.As far as the woke agenda some reviews talk about, yes there is some of that also in season 2. A statement is made about a particular group of people that is clearly based on lies and misrepresentation. Why would the writers do that? They did nothing but push 50% of the audience away.This is Star Trek in name only. There's nothing about Picard that reminds us of what made Star Trek so popular.On a positive note, regardless of storyline it was nice to see some of the old characters in action.

Nothing really ever happens, and they don't even really tell us what happened in the past apart from a few messy scenes/images.2) Probably the worst writing I've seen in ANY series recently.\nThere are a bunch of recurring roles, who are invariably shallow, useless or boring, if not plainly bad.\nThey keep introducing familiar faces from previous Star Trek only to kill them off in the most useless and nonsense way, for no purpose really.\nBut the worst, ALL of these characters are so incredibly unreasonable: they say one thing (\"I cannot leave you! I devoted my life to the mission of helping you!\") and then immediately after do the exact opposite (\"we have to go? No I'll stay here, hello\").\nReally, I don't know how many times characters of this show did the exact opposite of what they kept repeating, believing or so. Always without any reason or sense.\nI'm still trying to get one single role I lilke in the show, apart from Picard (who in a sense doesn't even seem to belong to the show at all)..3) It's not just dark. There's gory violence.\nOk it's not Star Trek, it's not happy ending after all, and the future is much darker than you'd imagine. But here there's more - a very visual and gore torture sequence, showing violence and death of a known character, just to provide some minimal background to another character which leaves the show perhaps 15 minutes later.4) Cameos parading.\nEntire episodes devoted to one or two cameos of actors/characters from Star Trek, TNG or Voyager. Always to no real purpose apart from \"hey look how old he got\". They say nothing about the character, so we discover nothing about whatever happened to them. So, what's the point? Just to add another useless episode?All in all I give 2 stars just because there's Patrick Stewart acting in this, but I feel sorry for him.\nPlease, please, please: fire the writers and the producers and get someone who knows what he's doing.",

However, your brain's understanding of what you can and can't do is constantly in flux. Day-to-day experiences can impact it.If you've recently tried something and failed, your inner critic might still be licking its wounds. Studies have shown that, when we blame ourselves for something not working, we're - at least temporarily - unsure of our abilities to successfully do other things.New SituationsBecause our brains use past experiences to guide us moving forward, new situations can throw us for a loop. This is normal and - for most people - it's perfectly healthy.However, for some people, particularly people with anxiety, fear of the unknown can be incapacitating. Even if the situation shouldn't feel scary.Underlying Mental And Emotional Mental Health ConditionsAnxiety and depression are linked to negative self-talk and low self-esteem in a number of ways. In fact, scientists aren't entirely sure of all of the connections.Some people believe that low self-esteem causes anxiety and depression, while others think it's the other way around. Still, others believe that it could be some combination of the two workings together or that it depends largely on the case.How Negative Self-Talk Gets In Your WayIf you spend most of your time feeling lost or overwhelmed, you might already understand how these thoughts can prevent you from living a happy and healthy life. However, many people don't even realize that they have these thoughts or don't realize how these thoughts are holding them back.",

The problem for me is that Picard is nothing but a washed up coward running for cover in a couple of scenes whimpering and getting his backside saved, why do i want to watch a series about a whimpering old man?. The characters are bland and if they all died in the first episode I wouldn't miss them. 2 main faults especially for a Star Trek series, and what is it with having \"powerful\" female characters now in a series needing to use the F word at everyone, are they incapable of conveying themselves intellectually now??? This for me has no place in any Star Trek franchise, there's no need for it. There have been many strong female characters throughout the franchise that have shown intelligence over profanity. This series didn't feel like Star Trek at all, until for the penultimate episode and the 1 prior, some may know what I mean. Star Trek has always had characters, always had a bit of humour, Original had all the main crew, TNG had about half a dozen characters, DS9 had Odo and in particular Quark, Voyager at least had the Dr, but this, noone. The best part for me was cameo appearances by Data, if it wasn't for him, my rating would have been lower. Riker wasn't bad and wasn't too fussed about Troi but good to them 2 still together for this series. How do I rate it compared to other series? Obvious Original is the best, followed by TNG, DS9 comes in 3rd and I would place Picard inbetween the poor to ok Voyager and the terrible Enterprise.Data was the best this series has to offer, especially the final episode which without spoiling it too much, poignant.",

You have dialogue that seems to have no thought - just flippant banter that does not evoke the sense that you are dealing with mature or intelligent people.Finally, there is Picard himself, a frail shell of the man he once was - his voice weak and quivering, unsurprisingly unfortunately, and he does not inspire any feeling when you look at him - just sadness that he allowed his legacy to be co-opted by this band of social justice warriors.This is not Star Trek.

            "content": "Bringing back a beloved character after years away brings expectations and a history that needs to be built upon along with being part of a franchise that constructed a universe and a way people behave within that world. Through Star Trek, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager the Universe of Star Trek was built and created a all-ages family friendly Science Fiction adventure show with characters that behaved in a disciplined and mature manner. The character of Picard was a dignified, well respected character with gravitas and authority.In Star Trek Picard the character of Picard is reduced into a meek, wounded man, that commands no respect from the characters around him and his gravitas and authority are blunted. This is not the same man we saw teach us about leadership aboard the flagship of Starfleet. The show does try to explain this away by showing him having quit Starfleet on moral grounds and living with his regrets in his vineyard but ultimately this is a flimsy contrived premise to remove such strong character traits that made him who he is. Even though he quit Starfleet his accomplishments and history with the organisation (the respect he very much earned) should protect him from being sworn at by an Admiral in a juvenile, undisciplined display by a character in a military organisation that would ingrain a sense of control and discipline into how they conduct themselves. This scene is very much there for shock value.The show tries to contrive conflict between Picard and other characters in a sloppy way. Raffi for example hates Picard because his act of resigning from Starfleet got her somehow fired. Why would she get fired for working with and following the orders of a superior officer in difficult circumstances? Why does the public resignation of Picard result in even a court-martial? She hadn't done anything wrong to even warrant a slap on the wrist. This is contrived conflict which gets forgotten about pretty quickly as Raffi begins to forgive Picard for some reason that's not explored.The subject of Raffi allows us to explore the gritty for gritty sake aspects of the show as all the characters have to be damaged in some manner which means that Raffi is now a hermit & drug abuser to add grit to her character. The rest of the cast fall into place with equally dramatic backstories and resultant personality damage.The show also employs gratuitous language and violence to really make this a gritty universe with is a complete departure from the family friendly, sci-fi and adventure TV show. The creators have obviously seen the success of Game of Thrones and wanted to replicate it here but took the wrong learnings from that show as the grit for GoT was part of the medieval world where humanity was still quite primal. GoT was never successful because it showed bad language and gratuitous violence it was a success because of the characters, intrigue and plot which Star Trek Picard doesn't handle well.The other problem is from the story where there are 3 stories vying for screen time in the Romulan Relocation, Borg Reclamation and Synthetic Ban which don't really connect except in order to provide plot devices for each other and none ultimately get done well with the synthetic winning out. This is a mash up of \"cool\" concepts that don't really pay off. The Borg Cube could be replaced with a Romulan waystation where Soji is volunteering helping refugees and the removal of the Borg wouldn't change the plot of the show (in fact it would streamline it).The synthetic story is just a rehash of a plot that has been explored time and time again in Sci-Fi and done better time and time again. A franchise like Star Trek was a trailblazer of sci fi story telling but in Picard it just comes across as derivative here with nothing new really being explored making the show a bland telling against a back drop of sci fi being done better elsewhere.The problems with regard to 3 big ideas all vying for space, really weak storytelling and contrived circumstances lead to a bloated series that could of been 4 episodes shorter. An example would be in my favourite episode of the series \"Nepenthe\" which is actually the first episode I would cut as its a waste of time from the main plot and doesn't really do anything but to set up a cameo for later on in the series. This episode also takes the Rikers and in its Gritty for Grits sake gives them a tragic backstory which by this episode had become incredibly tiring.With the Rikers we get fanservice which is the only real reason why they pop up. With fanservice we get the addition of Seven of Nine in this show who has also become a jaded character with tragedy in her backstory in which we are actually shown a violent murder of a character from Star Trek history.In conclusion this show really wants to be something other than Star Trek by changing the family friendly sci fi adventure show into a gritty adults only show with a weakly executed sci fi premise. The show is bloated and relies on contrivances of both character and plot with the main character acting very much out of character.I was actually going to give this show 5 out of 10 but after writing this review I cant really justify such a high score.",

            "content": "The two worst Trek episodes of all-time are Tuvix from Voyager and Cogenitor from Enterprise. They are about condoning cold-blooded first-degree murder (done in collaboration with the ship's top-ranked staff) and condoning slavery (with a strong dose of sexism and heterosexism thrown in), respectively. So far, this series hasn't managed to unset those and I don't expect it to. What it does instead is torture the audience with cartoonish banality.This series vies with Discovery and Enterprise for worst Trek series. The final season of Enterprise, with its brain-dead war game plot (featuring Insectoids! And a bunch of other oids) not only had so many bad episodes, it had the Cogenitor episode. So, it's strong competition. Discovery lacks one of the two worst episodes of all-time but is suffocatingly obsessed with its Mary Sue lead, her boyfriend, quick fixes, spelling everything out in capital letters (even more than Enterprise, possibly), predictability, and advertising for the psychotherapy business.Picard is the least Trek-like series I've seen from the franchise, especially season 2. Discovery is so heavy-handed and predictable, especially in its latest season (I think it's season 3 but it's not important as all of the seasons are weak). Enterprise was mostly dull and disappointing throughout. Phaser fight? Check. Brawl? Check. Ship battle? Check. Boring speech? Okay. It also suffered from the cardinal sin of playing games with the personalities of the characters - not being true to character. The way Tripp's attitude was reset after the Cogenitor episode is a classic case of poor production.Picard, as a series, is a pile of clich\u00e9s, as is Discovery and as was Enterprise before them (for the most part, at least). It tries its hardest to rip off (regurgitate) all of the moments that were memorable in ye olde Trek and fails badly every time. Season 2 has the show especially floundering, not knowing what kind of show it even is in episodes like Monsters. I can't imagine things getting better and had to force myself through that episode.One of the most irritating aspects of this series is its use of sword fighting. It's as if the production staff are intent on trying to siphon every unique aspect from popular franchises, dump them into a pot, stir, and see what floats up. Well, what is floating to the top isn't a great Trek series.",

They had breathed life into 7 seasons of TNG and must've been well connected to what made that show such a success.I've watched the first 5 episodes of Picard and I feel a bit shell-shocked by how much has changed.In TNG, and even DS9, Voyager and Enterprise, we have a hopeful future where humanity reaps the benefits of enlightened ethics and morality. Unfortunately Star Trek Picard takes a big step in the opposite direction, painting a picture of a dystopian Federation.Where previous incarnations of Star Trek were relatively family friendly with comparatively mild fight scenes, Picard lowers the tone with low-brow graphic gore and torture scenes. It's just so cheap, you don't need extreme graphic suffering to make a story enjoyable.The Picard universe has a very different look and feel, probably mostly due to gaudy CGI effects - you feel like you're watching Guardians of the Galaxy or Ghost in the Shell. It just feels trashy and inauthentic - it's not the Alpha and Beta quadrants you remember.If you're looking for another dose of the good stuff you loved from The Next Generation you're not going to find it in Picard. Some of the actors may be the same and you might encounter a few liberal lashings of obvious nostalgic references but the the good spirited, bright optimism of principles and integrity, of a future to look forward to has been eviscerated with cheaply bought thrills and garish CGI. Gone are the days when the story line mattered more than the special effects.My recommendation - re-watch The Next Generation and pretend that Picard never happened.",

Thank goodness I didn't as episode 2 and three fall back into the puerile nonsense writing again with all the intelligence and cleverness of Saturday morning teen drama.Episode 4 was cringingly painful to watch as the writers once again started butchering established characters for faux drama and gags, with their obviously little interest or knowledge of canon it very quickly becomes overly distracting and unwatchable nonsense. You really get the impression that it's been written for teenagers by teenagers in an after school drama class. All of the characters are immature and unbelievable, the scenes are disjointed, uninteresting and meander from one to another with irritating melodramatic soap opera style going nowhere.It seeks not to continue Star Trek, but to copy and paste over it with generic action and bad dialog which seemingly belong in a cartoon. The actors are caricatures of a Star Trek parody.None of the characters are believable or relatable, and what little dignity Patrick Stewart had and the legacy of Picard has been completely vandalised into unrecognizability. It's not Picard, it's Patrick Stewart playing 100% Patrick Stewart. There's no difference between his acting in this and his commentary in interviews talking about the show. I've no idea why it's even called Picard as he plays no vital part in the story, simply being dragged along for the ride in an inorganic and quite frankly uncomfortable way. His gravitas and presence aren't there at all, and he does have visible difficulty getting the mish mash of dialog out. In the first episode of TNG an aged DeForest Kelley has a scene slowly hobbling through an Enterprise corridor talking to Data, handing off the franchise from one generation to the next. Now, if we instead had that character hanging along for the ride for two seasons you can easily begin to see how forced and ridiculous that would be, yet here we are doing exactly that with Picard.The plot is once again thoughtlessly constructed with no sense of direction or purpose. There's no subtlety to the ideas presented, it goes right in for the kill with current day political issues front and centre without allegory or juxtaposition of any kind, which comes across as really not liking the audience by straight up insulting them. No matter what your position on socioeconomic position, you're just a punching bag by taking ideas to the extreme with a one-sided and forceful presentation without any room for discussion or investigation, no shades of grey, no cleverness. You're simply a bad person because you live in 2022, unless you're a whale expert, I mean a doctor for the homeless. The entire plot is a straight up rip off of The Voyage Home. Slingshot around the sun to try and save the present from the past, land in a cloaked ship with power generation issues, Chekov hurts his head and ends up in hospital, the same punk on a bus, swearing left and right by all characters, and not a glimmer that the cast present relatable characters. It's an insult to the intelligence of the viewer in the same way that Star Trek Into Darkness went down with a terrible plot written for terrible characters straight up hijacking previous star trek stories. I think the writers think they are being clever and \"paying homage\", but that's not at all how it completely misses the landing.Every time Picard pulls from TNG they open a massive can of continuity worms which shows poor understanding of the show this is supposed to be a sequel too, and why is that? It's because the writers are not Star Trek fans, none of the actors are star trek fans, and no one bothers to research readily available information that most productions would kill for - memory alpha. If you don't want to bother keeping in the well established universe, then why bother to set the fans up for massive disappointment time and time again. Not a scene goes by where sloppy writing and lack of research take centre stage, and there's only so long you can keep letting them add up until the goodwill runs out and it all falls to pieces into an incoherent mess of overall bad stewardship of the franchise so far disconnected from everything that made it great to the extent that it really has nothing whatsoever to do with Star Trek. It just borrows some of the intellectual property like a child playing dress up, and all involved don't seem to realise what a terrible and saddening job they are doing.It's totally unwatchable after the first episode and quickly falls into the thinly spread surface level farce of the first season again. Completely abandoning the franchise's core audience. The writing is of a poor standard not befitting the Star Trek universe with unlikable characters and an uninteresting mystery box plot which takes serialisation to the extreme and will no doubt end with an unsatisfying badly rushed conclusion that I have no interest in wasting my time watching.I couldn't care less anymore, this just isn't in any reality Star Trek and my time is more valuable than the childish drama being served up. What was my favourite franchise is long gone now, but at least I have found other more intelligent and well written stories in this golden age of sci-fi. I just never expected Trek to go from the best of the bunch, to the worst.What a pity.",

So many different episode and movie story lines are represented here. I love the fact CBS was able to get Sir Patrick back, I love the idea of it, but looking at the whole picture I feel it's a fan service piece.I'm looking forward to more episodes, but I'm worried it's going to get bogged down with it's stories and plot and it's going to lose itself by episode 3. I feel it's all very forced and all very convenient.Side note: I loved the episodic nature of Star Trek, each episode it's own story. Discovery was a crazy push for Trek, several arcs driving the plot forward. I wish they would have done Picard before Discovery, giving me the familiarity of the characters with the vision of a season driven story line. I'm going to finish Picard and see if I change my view of Discovery.",

Another train wreck from Alex Kurtzman.I was watching it with low expectations after the first episode. Kind of like a B series you have in the background or something to pass the time. That is until I reached episode 5, stardust city rag.Spoiler alert - I was really pleased to see a cameo from a certain voyager former Borg lady, that is until Alex literally butchered Echep - her surrogate son. The way he directed it actually made me angry. It was unjustifiably violent and disgusting the way they graphically ripped him apart. It dishonoured and disrespected the whole memory of voyager which was a fun and enjoyable journey. All for clickbait and \"likes\" and \"impact\".I was so put off I stopped watching after that episode. The series lost my respect entirely.I then googled to see if anyone was as annoyed as I was by the disrespect. Indeed there were many, to the extent a director addressed it in an interview. His excuses were \"we did not have much time to explain the back story with seven, so we had to find a way to make her story and hardship as impactful as possible\". Basically he is saying they butchered Echep to save time on explaining a back story or to gain any depth of sevens appearance or backstory since voyager. A real unclassy cheap and disrespectful move. If you weren't happy with the time you had, you shouldn't have done anything. Or you should have left it hollow, as you have done with the rest of your show.The other point he made is \"violence is art\". This is utterly deluded. Gratuitous violence for likes is not art. It's violence for likes, and it is unacceptable to try and justify it to the consumers.Patrick Steward is elderly. I can understand him getting tricked into acting in this show because he likely thinks he is being \"current\" and appealing to a new generation. However, I am genuinely surprised any Star Trek hero would sign off on this embarrassment of a show, especially with the dishonour they have wrought upon the Star Trek universe.Aside form this, the plot is predictable, the characters soulless, dislikeable and gormless, and it is a total waste of space. I am glad I had the foresight to pull out when I did as I cannot see it getting any better.Alex Kurtzman, you should seriously consider retiring from directing Star Trek.

            "content": "I don't really know where to begin - it's hard.Star Trek is supposed to be a utopian society where humanity has learned its lessons from the past. Earth is a relatively boring place where there is peace and tranquillity. There is no disease, poverty, or greed. Society is intelligent and works to better itself and the lives of all others. The Federation is an organization of numerous planets that have all proven themselves to be evolved, non-discriminatory or violent. The mission of Starfleet is to facilitate first contact, encounter the unknown, create peace, cultural exchange and acquire or share technology with other alien races.The struggle within Star Trek has always been one of morality, ethics and principles. Issues arise from outside situations, as many alien races hold different beliefs about what's right and wrong. Humanities gift is that of peace, reason, mutual understanding and friendship, one which is in conflict with other races whose primary focus might be the accumulation of wealth, power, war, secrecy or strong religious beliefs.Star Trek explores the possibilities of \"what if\" and \"the unknown\". It puts humanity on the forefront as it challenges us with difficult questions about our existence and how we deal with adversity. It attempts to showcase the absolute best qualities that humanity has to offer, and ties in everything we've learnt through our evolution to make the right choices within certain strict guidelines laid out by The Federation and Starfleet.The ships in Star Trek are extremely iconic, they all have detailed layouts and are very well thought off. Star Trek ships have never been copy paste reproductions and stand today as being some of the most intriguing and creative designs in science fiction history.Alien races are also exceedingly well detailed and intriguing. Some have even got their own languages, but there are experts on Trek lore that could go on about this for hours.Humanity is also on constant trial by a very powerful race called The Q Continuum. These omnipotent beings look across the universe in search of measurable growth and a higher form of thinking and development. If the growth of a civilisation stops and a society reverts to its petty former ways, then they are denied protection which ultimately leads to their annihilation and an end to their existence. A character named Q would often help Picard overcome a lot of dilemmas and ultimately lends a hand to save all of humanity with his power because he believes in their potential. He however warns Picard that \"the trial for humanity never stops\" and if they were to deviate then they would cease to exist.Now... absolutely none of that is seen in Star Trek Picard the TV series. It doesn't exist. It's like all of what Star Trek actually is has been erased. What you're seeing with this TV show is some very watered-down science fiction version of the old Star Trek series, with inaccurate reduplications of former characters and events. This show is also set in the future, but instead of resembling a society which has grown into something utopian and great, it strongly resembles a politically left-wing minded version of the world we see in today's modern times. Poverty exists on earth, the acquisition of wealth is a thing, Starfleet has an admiral who swears every other word she speaks, people have and condone slavery with the synthetic lifeforms, there seem to be no real governing principles or ideas which hold The Federation together anymore...The show also features a lot of the TNG cast, however they depict them in really inaccurate ways, and misinterpret their relationships possibly due to not really watching or knowing what the previous television shows were all about. It is like a Chinese whispers chain of events which constantly breaks down and changes to portray something more bizarre, nonsensical and embarrassing. We see a love story between a robot and a Romulan guy which is void of any real passion or substance. Seven of nine is now some bad ass cowboy chick that goes on wild lesbian encounters. Picard is old \"rich\" man in a vineyard surrounded by Romulan guards (which is very contradictory to the old series). Romulus (a planet formally tasked with secrecy and subversion) has been pointlessly destroyed in this universe. I could go on, but there are some insane discrepancies here for fans who love Star Trek which makes this show really difficult to watch.I watched the first 8 episodes? And then I stopped watching, I couldn't take it anymore, the plot lines were weak, the characters and their relationships were bizarre, this show condones murder and accepts a crew member who outright kills her lover. The characters are all very largely uncharacteristic of who they used to be in the television shows and movies. There is also nothing uplifting or no moral wrestling in any of these episodes, it's just action, nonsense and a really terrible uninteresting sequence of events.It's just not Star Trek, and is certainly not the Trek that I remember. A lot has changed, JJ Abrams made those horrific Star Trek movies, we had Enterprise which was a terrible and now this. It's sad to say, but just like the Star War Universe which came to a horrible demise with the last movie, so Star Trek has now met its final end with Picard.Is this what Patrick Stewart meant by giving people \"hope\" when they got back home after a long day's work?I would highly discourage anyone watching this series. I wish I knew that Picard would be another Discovery like rehash. If I was aware of this then I would've skipped it and honestly saved my emotions and time. To the new faces out there who are enjoying Picard, well I empathise. When I first saw Star Wars Episode 1 (as a child) I thought that it was the greatest Star Wars movie ever - that was, until I watched all the other Star Wars movies that were made prior.",

Production quality is amazing, acting isn't terrible, the writing-- well, it flirts with a modern topic that I feel is extremely significant.What's wrong with it?Many other reviewers have alluded to an issue that should be obvious to any long standing fan of the series... Star Trek has historically represented an optimistic view of the future. The old show seemed to communicate that in order for us to make it in to space as a species, we wouldn't just have to be smarter, we would need to be more effectively good to ourselves, and the show depicted a future that was a reward for pulling that off.This series (along with Discovery), for some reason, resorts to dramatic tropes that detract from the ultimate spirit of Star Trek.At least in the case of Picard, the writing seems to have opportunities to explore the implications of modern technologies on our future. We live in an era where AI/machine learning technology is seriously misunderstood. While there are many famous personalities that have voiced their concerns about our future in this context, there are many that hold optimistic views about these things.I really had my hopes up that the series was building up to a positive outcome that reconciled a human existence with that of advanced machine intelligence. I suppose that it is still a possibility, because the ending to the season simply IMPLIED our universe had a super-machine-intelligent-entity that was a destroyer of all things organic. It did not outright confirm it.In any case, I am getting caught up in the details. I am going to keep watching, but I agree that the noir quality of the show is annoying.

Everyone else is off here or there pursuing their own selfish desires, giving Picard his one and only true role for the movie: A nostalgic Gandalf of the Star Trek universe. He's been turned into this weird, connected-in-some-way-to-everyone motivational speaker running from one place to the other rallying everyone to his cause.I've been watching star trek episodes almost every week for over 15 years. There's a certain algorithm (or theme, if you will) to Star Trek inherent in the majority of the episodes that dedicated fans should be very familiar with. This algorithm consists of 3 main overarching points that Gene Roddenberry wanted to convey to his audiences.1. We (as a people) are flawed, arrogant, and self-obsessed; and we need to improve ourselves. (This is very biblical, by the way.) I listed this first because I believe it's the most important theme in Star Trek.2. The future is bright, because humanity \"has grown out of its infancy\".3. Life, in any form, is important and should be protected from harm, even if it's hostile toward you.These themes are not present in Star Trek: Picard. The directors/writers came up with some interesting plots, back stories and action sequences, and while these are necessary parts of a good tv show, Star Trek at its core does not revolve around them in the slightest. Star Trek is about the internal struggles of the characters; their growth, their failures, their struggle to get past all the $H1T us humans obsess over, like the want for power/money, our egos, self-indulgence, devaluing others, etc etc etc. There's a very long list, as humans are a very F'd up species to say the least. These things connect us with the characters. Star Trek is also about the characters' love, excitement and optimism about this paradise they live in. The future is supposed to be happy. Humanity has evolved past all the stupidity of it's past. We are an enlightened, enthusiastic people; eager to get out into the unknown. ST: Picard just doesn't have any of that. It's just.. wrong.To be fair, staying true to the \"grand design\" of the original Star Trek creator probably wasn't what the writers were hired to do. Obviously the writers are just trying to \"sell\" a product, and don't have the creative liberty that the Star Trek writers of old did. I guess I can't blame them for that, as we all have a job to do at the end of the day. Maybe they can hire a crazy Trek fan as a consultant?I do really like that Star Trek is still \"a thing\", and that some of my favorite actors of the past are getting roles again and making some extra dough. Hopefully they can bring back all the others, like Dorn, Brooks, Crosby, Combs, Auberjonois, Shimerman, McFadden, Visitor, etc.",

But the dialoge is aweful, the future is dystopian, not hopeful, there are 18 minutes off dumb action scene in the first episode, phasers don't exist anymore, it is far more effectiv to kill someone with a knife, a woman that has been cloned from an android (i'm sorry i can't even say that with a straight face)...The list of stupid goes on.This is Dumb Trek, not Star Trek.For someone who really understood what Gene Roddenberries vision was about, this series pains me greatly. Star Trek was about tolerance, freedom, hope, cooperation and the possibility that humanity could become more enlightened than we are now.For Kurtzman, JJ Abrams and their cronies, Star Trek is a franchise they can exploit, rape and kill over and over again, until it is a stinking husk that no one will touch ever again.The real Star Trek ended with TNG.",

            "review_title": "Sadly, this is not Star Trek",
            "content": "When Star Trek Picard was first announced, with certain elements of earlier Star Trek seemingly coming out of hiding, I was hopeful that with this TV series, we could leave behind the awful mess that was Kelvin timeline movies and Discovery, and get back some proper Star Trek.Sadly, this is not what Star Trek Picard is, in fact, it's not Star Trek at all.\nGene Roddenberry created the Star Trek universe as this utopia of the human race having developed into something better, more enlightened people, and thus creating this future that is positive, hopeful and inspiring. Stories based on that were uplifting, even when dark and difficult topics were the subject of an episode or movie. Gene's vision was a future that was positive and inspiring, something that the writing and production ALWAYS reflected, right up until Star Trek Enterprise ended in 2005.\nWe remember, Star Trek The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine featured some of the best story telling in TV history, while action sequences were always a tool to emphasise story and drama in an intelligent way.\nAnd we also remember the wonderful production design and visual experience that was beautifully crafted and consistent from 1979 up until 2005. You immediately recognised Star Trek and it made you feel right at home.Then came JJ Abrams and Alex Kurtzman, destroying all of the above with their first Star Trek movie in 2009, dumbing it down heavily and changing the theme to an action-based, depressing franchise, continued with Star Trek Discovery. And Alex Kurtzman has done just that with Star Trek Picard. It is nothing more than Discovery in disguise, like they realised that Star Trek fans were not going to like it, thus injecting some well-known TNG universe prop or tune here and there.\nBut it doesn't help, even the great Sir Patrick Stewart can't correct the mess that Kurtzman has created.Yes the overall idea of a story based around the character of Bruce Maddox is intriguing. But then the writing around it is awful at best:Romulans: The producers and writers of Picard must have never watched any Star Trek prior to 2009, because Romulans in this series are nothing like the race we see in the TNG era. They don't act, talk or look like the Romulans we knew. In Picard, Romulans behave, act, talk and look like egocentric humans, just with pointy ears.Starfleet: The members of Starfleet we meet in Picard act nothing like it was established back in the TNG era. Instead, everyone is just making stupid decisions and acting only in their self-interest. No trace whatsoever of the enlightened organisation that had exploration at its core.Visual experience and production design: Alex Kurtzman once again completely disposed of all the careful work that was done by Rick Sternbach, Mike Okuda or Michael Westmore. Picard does not look nor feel like the Star Trek we all loved prior to the arrival of JJ Abrams. Ship design, prop design, no trace of that grand Star Trek universe we once knew. Starships, arguably one of the most important things in a Star Trek setting, look NOTHING like the skilled work created by Okuda/Sternbach, no trace of Starfleet, Federation or Romulan DNA in them.Writing: It is awful. It is NOT uplifting and optimistic, at all, and it does not have science and exploration at its core, in fact none of the values established by Gene Roddenberry. It's simply depressing and superficial story-telling.As I had written above, this is simply another iteration of Discovery, with all its bad characteristics and decisions made by Alex Kurtzman and inspired by JJ Abrams. This is not Star Trek.\nI want proper Star Trek back, you know the one invented by Roddenberry, and ever so skilfully executed by people like Rick Sternbach, Mike Okuda, Michael Westmore, Rick Berman, Ronald D Moore or Ira Steven Behr. The one that is intelligent, beautiful and optimistic, exploring the galaxy with science at its core.",

Picard reconciliation with his past, or something like that.So, where to find enemies when all of them became the new best friends?Why not the Star Fleet itself (again)?!

Take the familiar characters and uniforms out of it and it could be any bland sci fi. It's far too dystopian for Star Trek for one.Star Trek also always had dark moments, take ds9 for one, but there was always optimism and positivity at the end. Picard is just needless gore and unlikeable characters living in a ruined part of the galaxy.The way they treat the character of Picard in this is nothing short of a disgrace too. The final episode of TNG showed an elderly Picard, the main cast didn't trust he was completely \"with it\" but respected him enough to give him the benefit of the doubt which proved fruitful in the end because it was bloody Jean Luc Picard! In this show everyone seems to forget what he has done in the past. Even if the Romulan evacuation was a failure how was he to blame? Starfleet definitely was in this case and they are so petty that they are passing the blame on to Picard and completely ruining the character. Don't get me started on the Admiral randomly swearing at Picard for no reason, she's in uniform, on duty, tone it down. I'm all for swearing but not just for shock value which this show seems to do quite well, case and point with Icheb getting his eye ripped out on screen really for no reason.This was not Star trek. You can call me nostalgic, you can call me a whiney fan boy all you want but I don't care. I could excuse some of the show's failings but the story was awful, there was no focus to the script, no substance, it was a mess of a show, no character development and too much \"Pew Pew\".

IMO the makeup/CGI they used on Data (Brent Spiner) was fantastic. He looked almost exactly like he did playing Data in the 90's on TNG. Even though the scene was only like 3 minutes long, it made me feel a brief level of nostalgia that brought me back to when I was a kid watching TNG in the 90's. After this scene however, the show basically goes off a cliff.\nThe authoritarian Picard you know from TNG is long gone.

What came from the seeds of a generally family-friendly show in the days of The Next Generation (admittedly with a few exceptions), has now mutated into yet another vehicle for the current agenda of bringing scenes of bedroom intimacy and obscene language to a family audience. We were shocked and turned the TV off rather quickly when the language turned blue (after having already skipped through a rather salacious scene!). Our family feel totally let down by the new series, as stooping to such base lows was completely unnecessary for a family-viewing show and rather than enhancing the plot, served instead to disgust and disappoint.

Through three episodes it's seems as CBS wants all access viewers, and the \"producers\" wanted a science fiction allegory vehicle to preach to us the evils of the Big Meanie and spread their woke beliefs. They really must think the audience are deplorables and sorely in need of some hollywood education.So far this is an overly complicated space action soap opera with no connection to the world of star trek other than Picard. The writing is better on some of the Christmas Hallmark movies my wife watches. The actor do the best they can with the awful material.Maybe Hollywood should just get back to entertainment and attempt creating great shows with compelling stories. The Expanse is a show that does just that. This is just plain awful.",

            "content": "I just completed watching the tenth and final episode of \"Star Trek: Picard\" on CBS All Access. The series is created by Kirsten Beyer, Akiva Goldsman, Michael Chabon, and Alex Kurtzman. Patrick Stewart is the executive producer and stars as Jean-Luc Picard along with Santiago Cabrera (Crist\u00f3bal Rios), Michelle Hurd (Raffi Musiker), Evan Evagora (Elnor), Alison Pill (Dr. Agnes Jurati), Harry Treadaway (Narek), and Isa Briones (Soji/ Dahj). We also get to see some familiar faces such as; Jeri Ryan (Seven of Nine) Jonathan Del Arco (Hugh) Brent Spiner (Data) Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker) and Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi).In the March 27th issue of The Guardian, Stephen Kelly's review of Star Trek: Picard, says this in part, \"Trek used to be a vision of an optimistic future. . .\" Kelly goes on, as he sets the scene of a speech made by Captain Picard to some folks just revived from suspended animation, \"A lot has changed in the past 300 years. People are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things. We've eliminated hunger, want, the need for possessions. We've grown out of our infancy.\" In these couple of sentences, Kelly paraphrased exactly what Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, had in mind when he envisioned the futuristic world of Star Trek in the 1960s. Throughout the numerous television series and films those ideals were held true. Although I loved revisiting old \"friends\" and learning what became of them after 26 years, I was disappointed that the original Roddenberry vision was jeopardized in this latest Star Trek outing.One thing \"Star Trek: Picard\" does have is plenty of action. Plenty of dynamic visual effects. Plenty of stories. Plenty of history. And plenty of new faces; such Isa Briones who does double-duty playing a mysterious young woman, Dahj, in need of help from an old friend she does not know, Jean-Luc Picard. Dahj, unfortunately, survived two episodes when she was murdered by a secret society of Romulans. But she has a twin, Soji, who oversees a Borg reclamation project deep in Romulan space aboard an old Borg Cube they call the Artifact.There are other new faces such as Dr. Agnes Jurati (Alison Pill ) a doctor working at the Daystrom Institute of Advance Synthetics Research lab in Okinawa. The Daystrom Institute, if you recall, is where Data's creator Dr. Noonien Soong, was a professor of cybernetics. Then there are two former Starfleet officers each with their own demons. One close to Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, Rafaella \"Raffi\" Musiker (Michelle Hurd) was a Starfleet intelligence officer who served as Picard's first officer during the Romulan evacuation. Crist\u00f3bal Rios (Santiago Cabrera) is captain, pilot, and owner of a starship for hire called La Sirena. And lastly, there is Elnor (Evan Evagora) who is a Romulan refugee rescued as a child by Picard during the Romulan evacuation.A lot has happened in the 2 decades since Star Trek: Nemesis 2002. Of course, we all know that Data sacrificed himself saving the lives of his captain and shipmates. The crew of the Enterprise all went their separate ways with their own commands and assignments. After a short marriage to Jean-Luc, Dr. Beverly Crusher commands her own starship (USS Pasteur) providing medical assistance where needed. There were also two huge events that impacted Picard in the worst way possible.Ambassador Spock approaches Picard about his concerns over a star near the Romulan Republic that is about to go supernova. The Federation agrees to help their former enemy evacuate Romulus and orders a fleet of starships ready to transport the billions of Romulans to a new world. Here is where Nero the Romulan time traveling villain from the Star Trek 2009 reboot gets involved, creating the alternative (Kelvin) timeline from the original Star Trek franchise.Meanwhile, in the Picard timeline, Admiral Picard, being the true humanitarian that he is, prepares plans to move billions of Romulans from their home-worlds before the Hobus Star goes supernova. When the Utopia Planitia shipyard on Mars is attacked by a group of rogue A.I.s called \"Synths\" on what would have been the 323rd anniversary of \"First Contact Day\" leaving over 3000 dead and the Federation to band all synthetics.Due to the lack of resources because of the attack on Mars, the Federation had to renege on their promise to help Romulus, leaving Admiral Picard and his first officer Rafaella \"Raffi\" Musiker in a precarious position with the Romulans. As result planets, Romulus and Remus were destroyed. Being of strong character, Admiral Picard resigns his commission in protest of the Federation's decision to abandon Romulus.Now enough with the history lesson, my thoughts on Picard is mixed. Yes, I loved all ten episodes. And the new characters especially Santiago Cabrera as Captain Rios and Michelle Hurd as Raffi Musiker. The chemistry between all three characters is dynamic. Did I happen to mention Cabrera's other five characters? They are all emergency holographs and provide a little bit of humor along the way. There are plenty of protagonists onboard. Newcomer Harry Treadaway as Narek who is Soji's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Peyton List as Narissa Narek's sister, a member of the Zhat Vash and Tamlyn Tomita as Commodore Oh a half-Romulan and operative of the Tal Shiar are wonderful as the Romulan villains. Another character to keep an eye on is Elnor played brilliantly by Evan Evagora, the Romulan refugee, who does not know either to hate or love his old mentor Picard for abandoning him when he was a child.There is plenty that I do like about \"Star Trek: Picard\". I will recommend this as a MUST SEE. But there is one point of contention. The same point that Stephen Kelly brought up in his article in The Guardian. When Gene Roddenberry created the Star Trek universe, he envisioned a world free of hunger, vices, wants, and the need for possessions. Throughout any of the series and movies for the exception of the Ferengi, there was hardly any mention of the need for money and personal profit. Perhaps, in the end, Roddenberry was envisioning some sort of a Socialist culture. He was defiantly promoting humanity.With every reiteration of any television or movie franchise that comes along, the new producers and writers feel the need to \"modernize\" the story. Keep in mind Star Trek happens in the future, what is there that needs to be modernized? I appreciate the \"grittiness\" of Picard. I appreciate the dark pessimism in the Federation. I even appreciate the morally bleak outlook for humanity. I appreciate that the producers maintained a lot of the visual history of cities such as Boston, San Francisco, Paris, and Okinawa. Who knows how these cities will look like in three or four hundred years?In the effort to modernize \"Star Trek: Picard\" here is what I do not appreciate; the foul language, the vaping, the divisiveness, and the needless use of pain and suffering. This is not the Star Trek that Gene Roddenberry had in mind. A lot of what we saw in past Star Trek stories had nothing to do with television broadcast standards of yesteryear. We saw how Roddenberry pushed the envelope when Kirk and Uhura shared that kiss on broadcast TV. We saw it because Roddenberry truly believed the kiss would not be an issue, in three hundred years. So why now are we seeing Star Trek characters vaping, suffering from addiction, cursing at one another, randomly chopping heads off, androids having sex, and treating others badly? Yes, all this is real, it happens today in 2020. But not in Roddenberry's futuristic vision.Michael Chabon, defended \"Star Trek: Picard\" new direction in an Instagram post; saying that \"shadow defines light\", that \"if nothing can rock the Federation's perfection, then it's just a magical land\". While I can agree with rocking the Federation's perfection, I cannot agree with how we get there. To enjoy the next two seasons of \"Star Trek: Picard\" we must lose the language, the smoking, the gratuitous sex, the vaping and addictions. I get the need to \"modernize\" a classic to include the vices of TODAY, but Star Trek happens in the world of TOMORROW where all of these have been solved or eliminated.One more pet peeve, if androids, synthetics, or A.I.s are all as sophisticated in the future world of Star Trek's future, why the need for retina scans or any kind of security to unlock a door? Aren't these synthetics already connected to a network of some kind, and all they must do to unlock a door is just command it through the Positronic Brain's neural network? Just wondering.",

It is as if the writers at The Telegraph and Rolling Stone do not know the meaning of \"genuine,\" \"thrilling\" and \"sensational.\"\n1) Given that Star Trek Discovery was horrible, I was hoping Picard would be better. And, Picard is better, but only marginally. The performances/actors are significantly better than those in Discovery, however they are limited by a disjointed story line. I get that the writers were tasked with reconstituting Picard - no one should assume this is an easy task - yet the episodes (1/2, 3, 4, 5) are painfully disconnected. Each installment is essentially a new story. It is as if the writers have no concept of flow/continuity. There should have been more of the story and/or a smarter story to provide an effective sense of continuity. But I suppose a clumsy story should be expected, since the Discovery story was abysmal. IE, I would not be surprised to learn that several of the Discovery writers worked on Picard. Beyond the disjointed story, the obvious giveaway that Discovery wrote Picard is the use of foolishly unnecessary 20th/21st century idioms/phrases, \"Pain in the ass\" and \"Out of luck.\" There are more issues, for example the unforced error at the end of \"Absolute Candor...\" right?\n2) A brief comment on Patrick Stewart: I like Stewart, he is a great performer, but in Picard, he is not \"sensational.\" Frankly, he comes off as decrepit/old/tired. I do not know if this is Stewart's current reality or if this was a character choice. Regardless of the circumstances, Patrick Stewart's resulting performance is bland.",

When it comes to series like Picard and Discovery, they have \"updated\" it so much, that the things which made it special and unique have been erased. I am actually quite surprised that actors and actresses who featured in some of the traditional Trek series and movies, do not have a problem with the evolution of the series under the new regime.I have watched all of season one of Picard, and it's hard to stomach. It's a little bit like any new Science Fiction series of our time. There's not really much we can say except: \"Well, at least the CGI was awesome.\" I find it difficult to watch TNG and Voyager now, as some of my favourite characters from those series have been sullied and re-written in a distopian and depressing future. The whole point of Gene Roddenberry's Start Trek universe was that humanity was going to end up in a better place than they are now. Picard portrays humanity as a race of regression. Why? Who knows. To make it more relatable and edgy? Perhaps. It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't being produced as \"Star Trek\", but rather a spin off of some kind.I appreciate that a lot of hard work has been put into these series, but if the new producers and directors aren't up to the challenge of creating a shows which honour the previous shows; then there's literally no point in making them at all. Star Trek has history and requires very precis continuity. It's not just something which can be inferred or assumed to be accurate on a case by case basis. Every episode mocks the history of the hundreds of episodes and dozens of feature films which came before it. Peace and optimism has been replaced by gory violence and playing on whatever social justice topic is \"on tend\" this week. Star Trek was always able to stay topical to its time without being obvious and exhausting.",

The story is populated with mostly uninteresting characters and a plodding plot that fails to pick up until the middle of episode 7.

He will fail, he will need powerful, woke females to do everything for him, he will be sat down and scolded by a female standing over him in each and every episode. He will be called dismissive names, \"JL\".. he will be sworn at with the foulest language used in any Star Trek TV or movie.

Patrick Stewart approaches the age of 80 but why is he depicted as an old indecisive man in the series? NG characters are mainly there to be there and don't play a key role except for a brief moment, at best. The Federation is more like a corrupt government. New characters are not appealing. Most of them have an hidden agenda, probably the writers thought that this would spice up their attractiveness, but no, it doesn't. Computer graphics sometimes barely exceed the Original Series level and speed of action, often too high nowadays, is too slow here. Finally: after watching all episodes I still have insufficient the idea where it was all about.If you liked the intelligent plots of the NG where issues were solved with what humanity has developed into, in that era, you will most likely not rate this show any higher than I do. I was trying to discover why the average rating is so much higher and found the '10 star' ratings with little explanation why. I think the 1-4 star ratings much better explain why a low rating would be more appropriate.We won't need Amazon Prime Video for season 2 - unless perhaps it will be something totally different from season 1.",

I grew up on Voyager and I absolutely adore DS9 but I'm not one of those nostalgic fans that can't take new things in. Picard started out good but with 7th episode it's getting harder to remain interested. Every episode is a copy of itself, the plot is unecessary dragged, emo talk and tense moments could be two seconds shorter, the dialogue is plain stupid, witholding of critical information when there's an oportunity to spit it out is outrageous. Repetition of same lame sentences aimed at Picard's ego is brutally annoying and I don't understand how such an amazing person can simply forget to clarify things with the android in distress. I thought it's going to be nice to see Riker and Troi, but that's all it is, nice. The script of that particular episode is so incredibly bad that even them two can't help it. It was really fun to see Seven of Nine though, and regarding the new crew - there is humour and they seem to be likeable, although 7 episodes in and we're not there yet. Take The Expanse or Battlestar Galactica for example. You connect with the characters instantly and no mater how dragged it sometimes is you enjoy those shows. Picard is surfing on old fame waves while the new crew should be the new core and it certainly has the potential. Also having a closer look into Romulans and their mistyque is a very good move, especially for having them more 'vampirized'.\nI will not go into the kanon and how Gene believed in the best of humanity and this is not it and so on, the change is the only constant in life, all fans need to accept that. The Federation had it's slight downfall (about time!) and I do like conspiracy detail within the Starfleet (or whatever it is) and outcast worlds and troubled planets similar to Uncharted Territories in Farscape. If Picard takes direction of Farscape there won't be anyone happier than me, but that's a big bite to chew on, however it has obvious aspirations towards Farscape and Firefly wich makes it less borring. But for God's sake, do something with that writing and horrible sentences.\nAnd to finish, Star Trek Discovery has wonderful characters, a lot of humour, action, and awesome fight scenes, and fans are disappointed nonetheless (not me obviously). Picard has only nostalgia playing, shy and badly written introducing of new characters and it seems beyond cowardly made in that sense. But to the hell with the old fans already, people will always nag how something was better in the old days. Just make us a good series.",

This gave me hope which became what Star Trek was all about for me.I am not prudish but what did the bad language add to the story here? I do not want to imagine a future where sucking on a fat cigar is still considered \"cool\". ST Picard strips away all that is good about Star Fleet and makes it just another political body that has learnt nothing from history. It may be \"real\" and I have no objection to this vision being explored in other films or series but it has no place in Star Trek.Add to that some of the characters are distinctly dodgy. Rios is a very poor imitation of Hans Solo, the baddies ham it up to pantomime levels and I find Raffi and Elnor particularly unconvincing.I enjoyed the cameos of a few of the old TNG gang and whilst the storyline was not the most original it was not as bad as people are making out.

I have listened to the uncensored audio book about the history of Star Trek many times so i do understand what people said about Gene Roddenberry, i very much looked up to him when i was young, and as an adult, i understand that he was subject to the human condition. But he did something very few other people have done, he gave us a positive outlook on life, he showed us that we are not hell bent on destroying ourselves and that we can one day travel to places that we can only now imagine. I saw those lessons very much in TNG. Every episode had some lesson to teach and i founded my moral ground on that show.\nI am not saying that this new show does not have some lesson to teach, but i believe the whole franchise has drifted away from what Roddenberry intended. I realize that story arcs are a common factor in todays shows, but the appeal of TNG was that every week we had some new adventure to go on, you could sit down for 45+ minutes, watch an episode, take in not only the action and adventure, but the message that most of the episodes delivered, and you could get up and feel a little better about yourself. That feeling gets lost easily in story arcing. It took me all 10 episodes to find a message from this show.\nI also loved Star Wars as a kid as well, but Lucas dropped the ball when he handed his creation to Disney, and they destroyed it.My suggestion for the creators of this show.. sit down and take a good long look at what made TNG popular. Look at what made Star Trek in general popular. I am sure there are many many many others that think as i do about Star Trek. Your audience has not changed after all these years, and i dont mean the die hard trekkers, i am talking about the newest generations that get lost in shoot-em up video games, and watching people play video games on YouTube. One day i will attempt to get my children to watch the original, TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT so they can have available to them, the experience i had, but these new shows are YOUR chance to deliver that experience on a updated scale.

Maybe it is the really bad Alex Kurtzman script writing, the Jar Jar Abremesque directing or the simple fact that Star Trek Picard is becoming a Game of Thrones kind of game. Every scene is painted in a over dramatic manor. Every scene wants to be overwhelming, wants to catch the audience emotionaly, just wants to be to much of everything. But foremost it want\u00b4s to change the charecter of a rational thinking, brillant Star Fleet captain/addmiral into a emotional acting tattering old man, totally ingnoring a life time of responsible serving as a captain and an admiral. The most sad part is that it\u00b4s getting worst and worst from episode to episode. Man I loved Sir Patrick playing Picard in TNG but I start to realy dislike him for playing in that stupid little series, full of darkness and violance called ST:Picard. This series has nothing and I mean absolutly nothing to do with Star Trek. It\u00b4s just labeled with it.Gosh, maybe I\u00b4m getting to old to enjoy the new Star Trek that it has unfortionaly become. Jar Jar and Kurtzman changed the whole game. Star Trek isn\u00b4t about science, exploring and growing as mankind anymore. It has just became stupid. I guess that Gene Roddenberry is already turning in his grave.Also some of the reviews telling Trekster and Trekkis that this is not our Star Trek and we have to take it the way it is. I Say that Star Trek is nothing without it\u00b4s fans and supporters. Without the guys who spending tons of time, passion and money (sometimes trevelling around the globe) to visit ST conventions in costumes and living their passion. We need to show CBS that we the fans are the ones who decide about what Star Trek should be and avoiding to watch every ST series that is already aired or will be aired in the future on CBS.",

Others have said it already, but it's just bad on about every level. There is no intelligent conversation, no real exploration of new themes and moral conundrums, just a plot staggering from one returning original cast member to another, and a crew that cringy, bad guys who are cringy, sex, language, graphic violence.. just not Trek in my book.I've watched the TNG series 3 times through, DS9 twice, TOS, Voyager, etc. Haven't been inclined to try Discovery, and given the parallels drawn from those who've seen Picard and Discovery, I won't be wasting my time.I hope enough people speak up about what Trek is becoming that it'll make a difference, but I fear it won't.",

The writers seem to have simply recycled the same plot as season 2 of Discovery - but they just added in borg.Characters for this show are not developed or well written. Everyone is a caricature of a person. Raffi - no nonesense, says it like it is alcoholic. First time we meet her, we get a classic...\"you got a lot of nerve\" scene (by classic i mean completely overdone and cliche).Rios when we meet him, has a random piece of metal in his shoulder and no shirt on. No sign of damage. No mention ever made again. He is docked at Earth - again another cliche. Every time he pops a cigar. Cliche.Pacing is a terrible mix of slow and too fast. The whole show is building to a big \"mystery\" one that you already basically wrote in season 2 of discovery. Just a few small changes. There is nothing subtle about the story or development of story - writers spoon feed you everything slowly or just write everything to be so contrived and on the nose. Example. They literally wrote the Rikers a son and killed him off with an incredibly rare disease - just so they could have Deanna say \"real isn't always better.\"They killed of Hue. That's fine. But with about 2 minutes of screen time what was the point of even having him? I bet they thought they were really clever when they killed him, having Elnor (who represents absolute candour and honesty) square off against the villain (who represents misdirection and manipulation) and oh - he was deceived. Hue dies...in a scene with zero emotional weight because the writers didnt provide us any interactions between Elnor and hue, didnt build up to it at all, and didnt demonstrate how it impacts Elnor.Sloppy writing. Awful editing and production (looks like a Michael Bay and JJ Abrams love child.The writers managed to even make Picard himself unenjoyable to watch on screen. The casting and character development is an absolute tragedy. Generally the strength of Trek series is the chemistry between the cast and character driven stories. We have no chemistry and the characters seem to exist only\nto advance the plot - which makes them very unenjoyable to watch.I wish producers would stop giving their incredibly loyal fanbase the middle finger with overproduced and poorly written series.",

The story was kinda meh, but it did pique my interest.After watching episode 2 at a friend's house, it followed true to the new Star Trek form, profanity that was totally unneeded and apparently solely there to assure the audience that the \"tough\" female character is indeed \"tough\" because look at how \"tough\" her language is and everyone around her now knows for sure that she is \"tough\".

I liked the \"Tea, Earl Grey, Decaf\" line because it's like saying here's Picard but he's changed a little, but calling his dog \"Number One\" seemed lame and something Picard wouldn't do. Also, I'm not seeing Picard with a dog, especially that dog. But more than that Picard just doesn't seem quite like Picard and I'm mostly blaming that on poor directing and writing. It's the words he uses and the way he says them.It was nice to see Data in there and somehow they made him close enough to the old Data considering the actor is now 70 years old.I won't spoil the plot but it does seem a bit gimmicky and unrealistic so far. TNG was great because the science-fiction almost always seemed believable.

This season is too heavily weighted toward character study with very little focus on what could have been one of the best plot lines in Star Trek. It frankly has almost no sense of Star Trek appeal thanks to some overly heavy subject matter that is like a sledge hammer to the face. Previous actors are brought back with no real purpose and only serve to clutter up a sloppy plot line. So they go back in time and tell themselves... \"don't let them know we are here!\" and what does Rios do?! Bring a couple people back to his ship and show off all the technology!!

The same stands for Raffi and Elnor and Raffi and Seven, they are often together and talking emotionally, Agnes and Borg queen are talking often too. Another off-topic event is Picard's dreaming about himself as kid and finding the end or this dream. The last episode is the worst because Q has been enemy always since The Next Generation but in the last episode he is like a friend and Picard hugs him.

            "content": "\"The Next Generation\" was my introduction into the world of Star Trek. Captain Jean-Luc Picard was always decisive, always in control, never wrong. He was as close to a living saint in Starfleet as a society without religion can get. So what happens when his halo becomes a little tarnished?It's clear that the United Federation of Planets isn't quite the utopia it once was. A war with the Dominion (Deep Space 9), and skirmishes with the Maquis and Klingons would leave any idealistic society a bit disillusioned. So for someone like Picard, who absolutely holds dear the ideals of the Federation, it makes for an uneasy existence within it now that things have greatly changed.This show, however, begins with a brooding, retired, Admiral Picard who recalls in an interview that he was leading a mission of mercy to rescue and relocate Romulans after their sun had gone supernova when, without warning, androids (synthetics) working on Mars had become murderous. The ships being built there for the relocation were destroyed, and the relocation of the Romulans was brought to an end, much to Picard's dismay. So much so that Picard openly criticizes Starfleet and greatly embarrasses himself in the process.It's at this point we're introduced to Dahj, an android that doesn't realize she's an android until some super secret Romulan agents enter her apartment, kill her boyfriend, and activate her ability to defend herself. As she's running from her apartment she sees an image of Picard and seeks him out.After Picard and Dahj meet, he has a dream in which he sees his friend Data painting a picture. That leads him to Starfleet archives where he finds the painting, and finds out it was painted by Data and is titled \"Daughter\". Picard concludes from this that somehow Dahj and Data are linked together, but before he can find out for certain Dahj is killed by more Romulan agents.Picard eventually goes to the Daystom Institute where he finds out that Dr. Bruce Maddox, who at one time wanted to disassemble Data in order to study and replicate him, believed that it was possible to make a synthetic life form, one that could be confused for being completely human, from a single neuron from Data's positronic matrix. And that such life was made in pairs, meaning that Dahj had a twin who might be in danger.So Picard gives himself a mission: find Dahj's twin, find Bruce Maddox, and protect them from the Romulans. But as he's figuring out exactly how to do that, Starfleet refused to reinstate him and give him a ship. So he forms a ragtag crew made up of people he pissed off, but follow him anyway, and people he picks up along the way, such as Seven of Nine from Voyager, who has now become a vigilante.Along the way they discover what's really going on. A shadow organization behind the Romulan Tal Shiar had learned that several hundred thousands of years ago, artificial life had nearly wiped out all organic life. This organization committed itself to safeguarding the universe from such a threat again. It was this group that had been behind the synthetics attacking Mars, and by extension sabotaging their own rescue. And now, from Dahj's twin sister android Soji, they have learned the location of the planet where these new synthetics are being built. So, for a nearly destroyed empire, they manage to assemble 218 heavily armed warships and deploy them to the planet in order to eliminate the threat that is represented by the synthetics.But the Federation sends a fleet of ships, led by Picard's former first officer Will Riker, shows up. Meanwhile, the synthetics are preparing to defend themselves by summoning the artificial lifeforms that nearly destroyed organic life, that is until Picard gives one of his speeches and Soji shuts down the array that summoned them. But then not long after Picard, who had been suffering from an incurable disease the whole time, ends up dead. But not really because his consciousness was transferred into an android body, so that the show can go on.I liked that Picard showed a broken, disillusioned man who had made some mistakes. I liked that the Federation and Starfleet had changed, and Picard had to deal with that. But what I didn't like is that even when it was revealed that the people Picard was trying to help, the Romulans, were responsible for ending their own rescue, Picard doesn't admit that he was wrong and that Starfleet was right. A people who would put an end to their own rescue and in such a violent way is capable of anything, and Starfleet had a responsibility to the Federation to protect it. But Picard would not concede that, he bought into his own hype and convinced those that joined him that he could not be anything but completely right.The Romulans also, to an extent, were right. If given the opportunity the synthetics could and would destroy all organic life. So their actions, ironically enough, were to protect not only themselves, but the Federation and all the other races of the Star Trek universe. And they even showed themselves not to be the helpless refugees that Picard saw them as, as they assembled an impressive fleet of ships ready to battle the synthetics.When you take a step back, you realize that this definitely isn't The Next Generation. Too much has happened in the world both inside and outside of Star Trek for it to be. So, I applaud the writers and producers for understanding that. But at the same time they make old, brooding, disillusioned Picard someone who, despite being wrong and pissing people off, someone who ultimately can't be wrong, and his self-righteous behavior and even wrong conclusions are simply glossed over. Having to deal with how wrong he had been should have been the way this show went. It ultimately wasn't.",

Dialogs are shot with more cameras than I could count and the shot changes after almost every sentence. Are the new hyper HD cameras overheating from all the lens flares?

Cool, right?The Expanse received similar critique for their transparent pads (like, how do you actually see stuff and keep it private), but at least they follow some reasonable style guidelines, their interfaces seem useful and it did not distract from the show. Here the only major accomplishment is making it harder to see and hear what's happening on the screen.I can deal with the dystopia, the selfish characters and even the violence (these are bleak times, ok) - just make it watchable, I'll still believe that in the end the good will prevail and the Federation will rebuild itself.

            "content": "The series is now finished and it's a real mixed bag.Even though it's only 10 episodes long, the story progresses at a snails pace until the last 3 episodes. I am a fan of steadier story telling but the early episodes didn't really justify their slow pace and didn't use them for anything very interesting, oddly the last few episodes feel really rushed like they are cramming everything in even though they had plenty of time earlier.It may not sound like I'm giving good reasons for a rating as high as 3 stars but there was also a lot to like here. For the most part Picard feels like an older more tired version of himself from TNG, although he doesn't always. The new characters are mostly likeable and interesting although feel like they had one purpose on the show and then just hung around for the rest of the season, I can think of atleast 3 characters that fall into this trope. Some older characters get some really nice closure and tender moments that they didn't get in previous films and series, without giving anything away.For me Star Trek has always or mostly taken sci-fi ideas and have created very unique stories with them. Sadly this isn't the case with Picard just like discovery. Picards over arching story will be very familiar to a lot of sci-fi fans, I won't say what but it completely rips off a central story of another very popular sci-fi franchise, which there is just no excuse for, it's actually quite hilarious how exactly the same it is, I thought they would have atleast tried to disguise it more.Despite how it sounds I am trying to be objective and not all negative but am also trying to be honest. I believe the current production team behind current Star Trek needs to change completely. Discovery and Picard hasn't really felt like sci-fi to me and has been what I would call Science fantasy, similar to doctor who. There is nothing scientific on display here just plot devices and conveniences that seem like magic sometimes but we are told are some kind of technology.I really think Star Trek needs to get back to its roots and be put in the hands of people who have a passion for the franchise.",

Star Trek Picard is the most outrageous show ever named Star Trek. It has nothing to with it apart from luring the fans with bits and pieces of what once was the most awe-inspiring show.Star Trek, by Gene Roddenberry, was all about bringing the best of what humans can achieve, about a future that inspired generations to seek out knowledge through science, exploration and community cooperation. It promoted the idea that the future can be bright with TNG and VOY reaching the peak of this utopian world.Now, CBS threw everything it once was and made another lame dystopic future show. Forget about a bright future. Greedy, wars, drug addiction, money in the first place, division, f* words is all that the future holds. The motto \"Space: the final frontier. (...) Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before\" no longer applies.Outrageous, disappointing. Star Trek Picard is a continuation of a demonstration of disrespect to the work of Roddenberry that has been happening since he passed away.It's sad to see actors who once were inspiring a generation now putting themselves up to this.And finally, revolting.

With infinite free energy and replicators, money and the stratification of society were a thing of the past. The pursuit of the mind was the worthy goal of the various federated races. That dream is now dead. With such cliche's as finding and hiring a captain and ship, visiting slum worlds, drug and alcohol abuse, filthy language and more, we find ourselves in a universe far closer to the Star Wars series than the Star Trek you knew and loved.If you, like me, viewed Captain Jean Luc Picard as a surrogate father figure, get ready to view him as a doddering old fool with very few lines. Everywhere he goes he is ridiculed and disrespected. And like a good whipped dog, he simply bows his head and takes it. After all he did in his illustrious career he has no friends, no allies but the tired old cliche of a ragtag hired crew which still doesn't respect him in any way - only his money. The once potent Picard has been relegated to playing (barely) a poor second string. This series could have and should have been so much more. It certainly isn't due to a lack of talent in Patrick Stewart. No, but as with the Star Trek with Michelle Burnham, in the new 'woke' world of Star Trek: Picard, Strong Female Leads (tough guys) abound while the powerful, calm and compassionate white male leadership of TNG has been put firmly and irretrievably 'in its place' - the past.If you loved the character of Captain Jean Luc Picard, take my advice, don't sully your memory of him with this dreck.",

It contradicts most of the known Star Trek CANON. It also portrays humans as some greedy and malevolent capitalists. That's not what Star Trek is about...Federation society in Star Trek was mostly an utopian egalitarian communist society, whereas in \"Star Trek: Picard\" it seems like capitalism is still the driving force among humans. For example Raffi doesn't seem to have any money or ressources and lives in some run-down-container in the desert. She is abusing drugs. Absolutely ridiculous.That whole plot with the rebelling Androids and Romulans wanting to destroy all cybernetic and robotic life is ridiculous and contradicts canon. It also seems that some Romulan secret agency can freely move on earth and bomb things without repercussions. Where is earth police? Where is section 31? Where is Starfleet? Don't they have sensors and cameras to notice something like this happening?All Starfleet vessels seem to be of the same class at the beginning of the 25th century. Starfleet always employed multiple ship classes. Was CGI for many different ship classes too expensive? The Romulan Star Empire was huge, with hundreds of worlds, spanning dozens of light years, but the Romulans are incapable of evacuating their own homeworld? Seems rather unlikely. That whole storyline regarding the cloning of biorobots from Positrons seems rather incoherent. Picard in TNG was a wise leader and figure of authority. Old Picard in the new series is a naive and weak person. Most of the characters are clich\u00e9d, annoying and oversimplified. The comeback of the Borg, Seven of Nine and Hugh was unnecessary, because it added nothing to the storyline.They should enlist better writers, e.g. Ronald D. Moore and Manny Coto. They know how to make a good Star Trek and SciFi Series. Or maybe Seth Mcfarlane. He is a big Star Trek Fan and creator of \"THE ORVILLE\".\"Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms. [...] If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there.\" - Gene Roddenberry",

I can imagine that at the writer's table they were repulsed by the idea of the show being lead by an old, white, straight male. So they quickly shoehorned in a plot involving a strong female minority who could beat up men with one arm behind her back, so that their fears of loosing half their millennial audiences would be quelched. You can see that at the very least they felt they needed to start the season off that way, so that later if and when it does revolve around Picard, at least they already hooked their supposed fan base.Next up, identity politics, where it wouldn't surprise me if we learn that Data's daughter was born male.

It makes the betrayal so much worse.The essence of Trek was that humanity had evolved beyond money, beyond bigotry, beyond nationalism, racism and imperialism. It had joined (not initiated) the Federation. It wasn't in charge of it, it was a member of a multi-species confederation, introduced to it by the Vulcans. Starfleet was a quasi-military fleet for Earth. The Enterprise, in all it's iterations, was a ship of exploration as well as a flagship involved in defence. Voyager was even more an exploration ship. Starfleet eschewed aggression. The crew found itself in various situations and worked together. It respected all life, even if it seemed dangerous. It recognised diversity, and the underlying value of all being \"life, but not as we know it\".Picard violates all that. Earth is now isolationist, and all the thousands of other species just gave up the federation. Starfleet is racist, and controlled by spies for Vulcan or Romulus. It's a dystopian world. Picard gathers together a plucky band of rebels and misfits, a la Firefly, and sets out to get some guy, and murder anyone in the way. Some Romulans are salvaging a Borg cube that looks like it came from Blade Runner, with dry ice and wandering light beams in dark background. Other Romulans are apparently in \"third world\" poverty, with almost nothing (and they've all developed dark skins). There is a group of female Middle-eastern Romulan Hashashim who hate the Tal Shihar. Picard come is like Sahib. All he needs it a pith helmet.It's a complete violation of everything that made Trek what it was, without being anything but derivative and poor SciFi. If the producers wanted to do a story like this, they should have done it without invoking the framework of Trek. But it would have been a sad series with nothing that hasn't been done elsewhere better.There are several good actors in this, more the shame.

I went ahead and read many of the most recent reviews and was not surprised to see the numerous haters crawl out of their basements and downrate this fine show. I am sorry to see them denigrate this fine show, however, because that hurts those of us who want a season 2's chances of getting a season 2. Whatever, so much hate for such a lovely show. I am slowly losing all faith in humanity at the level of hate being spewed not just on this great show, but many others as well. I think this world might be having a collective nervous breakdown. All of season 1 is a set up for season 2. I get literally ill reading so many hateful, ageist reviews in here. Sir Patrick? You are STILL Jean-Luc Picard onscreen and the music in this show was a wonderful fit for the story. All of Picard was excellent. I was in tears just seeing this update of TNG, my favorite show of all times. I had no expectations going into it. But I loved every minute of every episode. Go ahead haters, do what you do best in life: HATE. As for me? Life is too short for your vitriol and nastiness. I prefer to walk on the Star Trek side, with hope and positivity.

I remember the original Star Trek ( TOS ) fondly and at least all the later additions to the franchise were watchable.Seven of Nine ( and CDR Data, of course ) was key to the plot; cameos of other TNG characters added little, possibly even detracting.IF you're as big a fan of the Star Trek as I ( still ) am I guess you'll need to watch it.

Sadly there are so many negative aspects that the surface positives get overwhelmed.Characters seem to almost always go straight for direct head to head conflict in a most unnatural way, even (especially) old friends. The reason for their conflict is often contrived and we know that in two seconds it'll fade away and they become buddies again.Direct verbal exposition (i.e. characters telling you what's happening) is the way of the walk here, missing numerous great opportunities for striking visual scenes that would reveal the plot in a much more stunning way. In one episode later on the characters all sit around and list, chronologically, the sequence of events that we've already been shown AND told before, and verbally piece it together in the way that most viewers capable of joined up thinking have already done.And using whimsical Emergency Holograms (with terrible Irish and Scottish accents) may have seemed a good way to spoon feed the plot to us, but instead of a subtle breadcrumb trail it's like the whole loaf whacking you in the face.This series is to Star Trek what The Last Jedi was to Star Wars. My only hope (and not a new one) is that, despite the obvious linkages, the next season of Discovery continues in its own way and doesn't succumb to this \"Star Trek for the Attention Deficit generation\" approach.",

It has many faults.Biggest problem for me was the bad language, the FBombs. What were the show runners thinking putting this in the show. It's not Star Trek. Calling Picard 'JL'. Everytime she called him that made me so angry. The real Picard would have never put up with that. It copies The Expanse too much in its style, dark nature and setup, not that that's a bad thing as the Expanse is a great show. It again just isn't Star Trek. Picard is out of character sometimes. He would never tolerated JL and the bad language thrown at him. One of the things that's plaguing a lot of shows and computer games is political gender. It creeps into this show in spades. Too many female leads, the feminists got hold of this one. Also there's the racial politics. Why suddenly do we have black and asian romulans with natural skin tone colours and beards. I thought the romulans in TNG had a greenish pale tinge to their makeup with black hair and a pointy fringe.\nPotholes galore. Where did Soong decide to have a son. Think back to the episode Datalore. He mentions Data and Lore being his only sons. The series as a whole was very poorly written and executed and made to compete with Marvel to look cool for the teenagers. The ending I'm not even gonna go there just to say it was terrible. The worst ending of a series I've ever seen on a TV screen.\nNow what I liked was Episode 7. Nostalgia kicked in on a very emotional level for me with this episode. The director nailed it and it was perfect. But that was the only good episode other than the 'yeah that was ok' pilot. Picard's dreams of data, yes a nice touch but was he really that attached to him in TNG. If I remember it was only First Contact you saw Picard connected strongly to Data in the way it is in this series but that was only because he got captured by the Borg. Picard would have done the same for any of his crew.Such a shame and wasted show for me. I have no interest in seeing the second season unfortunately.",

Everything else about it makes it a different show and experience completely, and not in a good way.Approach:\nThe storyline does not unfold in a typical Star Trek fashion, where there is a dilemma and a mission to resolve it; but rather it's more like Lost where something happens that you don't have a clue about, and it gets explained slowly over time and through flashbacks. Not good.The style:\nShips use a UI that is more like a tablet of today, with scrolling and pinching motions, except on a holographic display. It's more like they are copying Avatar than Star Trek. The effects are cool but inapropriate. If anything the future would have neural interfaces.\nThe language is crass with fbombs, which is not dignified alongside Admiral Picard. This is Star Trek and I want to be able to watch it with my family, not an adult action movie. Totally out of character and tacky.\nThere is a lot of cheesey cliche too. Like how every episode has Picard harping on about earl grey tea. Just do it once or twice. Remember what this kind of cheesey cliche approach did for indiana Jones 4?Storyline:\nFinally the storyline just isn't very good. It's boring. It feels like they could have told this storyline in one or 2 episodes but instead they have dragged it out over an entire season. The whole beauty of Star Trek is that each episode is stand alone and has its own plot/mission. But Picard is more like a full movie that had been broken us into segments. And moves very slowly in a strange order.Overall I see this as a totally new scifi show that hasn't got much to do with the real Star Trek or Picard, with a weak story and poor execution.",

So I think of myself of someone who can appreciate well played femaled roles in Sci Fi series like Star Trek.Now with Picard, it's a different story. Like in Star Wars, the writers try to force diversity on us viewers. It's no real benefit that all major roles besides Picard (and Data) are played by women.

Every aspect of that series was extremely well thought out and actually seemed plausible.

There was a clear beginning, middle, and end, yet this series doesn't even come close to it. This series is more like cringeworthy young adult garbage- something like Thirsty by M.T. Andreson.We start out in Picard's vineyard, like the one we see in All Good Things. Then it switches to a girl whose boyfriend is shot by some guys wearing masks. Then switch back to Picard, who is making a speech about how the Federation made a mistake with the synthetic ban. HOLD THE PHONE! This isn't Star Trek, we already have too much exposition. Who is this girl? Why did the Federation ban synthetics?I'm going to skip over everything here. There is no logical reason for the Federation to ban synths for a single mars attack, and then drop everything. It doesn't make sense, and the only reason this sort of thing exists is to force the show to go down a dystopian world, where there is a certain group of people who are an \"enemy of the state\", and that one of the main characters fits under that category.Honestly that is a very sloppy sort of plotline that has been done to death. Look at Detroit: Become Human, or Thirsty by M.T. Anderson, the Cirque du Freak series by Darren Shan, hell even Undertale. This type of trope where one person is part of a certain ethnic group that the government sees as evil, is quite frankly bloated out of control. It is an attempt to give the main characters a sense of dread, hopelessness, and a demand for change, all the while trying to hide one's self, and run away.Take away the Star Trek name, rename all the characters, change the uniforms and the organizations, and it is a pretty shallow series. Sure, there is some development, but the series tries too many things at once. It is hard to keep track of honestly, because there are so many things going on at once. The androids wanting to do a revolution and wipe out humanity, alright that seems like a good idea, but then the whole thing was just dropped. This sort of reminds me of the Last Jedi, where snoke was killed just to progress the plot. Like, seriously?There is no real tension, there is no suspense, or well very little of it. The twist of the androids wanting to wipe out humanity and all life was ruined by the fact that the romulans were going to wipe them out, blah blah blah. It's just hard to keep track of the plot.All in all, this season was just a mess. It was nice to see Picard, and I enjoyed it at first glance, but looking back, it just doesn't feel like star trek. The Federation is evil, the Romulans are evil, and so many other things. A shameful attempt to make a dystopian tv show ripping off the Star Trek brand. It's just tiring. There is no real structure to this story.",

Then we had late TNG, DS9, Voyager, that was different, but still had something of original idea. And since i enjoyed Enterprise, i still feel that Star Trek went far away from the idea. Current media can't repeat early success, so they are trying to sell us an emotion, inviting old actors into the series, but they are missing an old idea. Star Trek Picard full of modern \"idea\". \"Go girls\", \"gender equality\", \"social drama\" This themes aren't new, we had strong women characters before, like Ripley, G.I. Jane, Sarah Connor, e.t.c They were persons who made themselves, who was better not by the fact that they are women, but by the fact, they can do better than rest of the cast. This series is full of stereotypes. We have \"trouble girl\", \"wise girl\", \"danger girl\", \"carrying girl\", \"sexy boy\", \"roudy boy\", \"wise grandpa\" and ofcourse, since US is struggling with migrants problem we have non white characters, just because they have to be, not because plot will have something from them being \"not white\". This is not a series about story, this is a series about modern stereotypes and how they coexist. This is a series in a universe, we all came to love, about the problems of the modern society of a USA and some of the EU countries, and that is a major problem. I'am not sure, that i can withstand the rest of the season, all its achieved, is that i want to rewatch old series, when we had good and mostly neutral story, with some basic moral and questions.

Yes, is used in the ST universe.I swear like a trooper in RL and am far from a prude, but I just don't want to hear in in Star Trek, it's out of place.Like Discovery it looks amazing, it's beautifully shot, fabulous effects and music. However, this long, slow arc thing with no individual story week on week is tedious. Babylon 5 got this arc thing spot-on. Yes, have a storyline over the series, but each week, something needs to happen, there needs to be a story happeneing in each episode.They can't even avoid the clich\u00e9 of nasty Brits playing baddies with the casting of the plotting Romulans.

How can anyone read these reviews and determine whether to watch or not with so many 1s and 10s and little in between?! It's very reminiscent of and has the rhythm of STNG. Patrick Stewart, showing his 80+ years, is one of almost ten EPs but also stars. Though he was run out of Starfleet, this is a very fawning treatment of Picard (and certainly by extension Patrick Stewart). I mean this show is designed to adore and deify him and that really takes away from its appeal. There's a large scale intergalactic story happening here, and as such with his hastily cobbled together rag-tag crew recalls the original Star Wars trilogy - there are definite similarities. A few more things I didn't like: there was a fight scene in ep3 that was just stupid with an unarmed Picard and other unarmed colleagues beating back an attack of armed/trained Romulans, so that was a scene-fail. The repeated treachery AND forgiveness of Agnes Jurati, then, the season finale was epic but feels like three episodes edited into one which kind of ruined it - seriously, key people die then are immediately resurrected with no complications/ill-effects, etc. Probably the biggest disappointment is that the predetermined protags-must-prevail trope was so obviously done just dispensing with any realistic conflict. The finale could've and should've been GREAT but it marched to a Disney-patented good-guys-prevail ending and then there's all of the social justice signaling/indoctrination which we're all just so over. I started to watch S02 but it's just more Picard fantasy porn. Other misc stuff, you'll see some of your favorite STNG characters return glad-handing Picard in good 'ole reunion style (so annoying), but they've aged and gotten fat.",

I wont bore you with details as MANY users have already explained them more eloquently than I could, all Ill say is; as a Star Trek fan - hell, as a fan of compelling entertainment - I was utterly disappointed.Thankfully I wont have to despair that Star Trek is dead (and it is dead) because The Orville has supplanted it completely.Don't watch this show if your a fan of entertainment.",

Some may argue that Enterprise was also a mistake, and I get that, but Enterprise had a couple things that Picard doesn't.1.) Character development and comradery between crew members. In Picard, it seems like every member of the La Sirena crew is just an independent person of no crew on their own mission, with their own agenda, like they only happened to be on the same ship or something. I care for none of the characters, aside from Picard himself. On any other ST show, even Disco, the crew is a family that look out for each other and become friends. The characters are likeable in those shows. STP? Not even close.2.) Dynamic episodes. Throughout the first two seasons, all the episodes with the exception of a couple two-parters were their own unique adventure, with ups and downs along the way. Not every episode ended on a happy note, but unlike Picard, they at least had SOME episodes that ended happily for the crew. Over 50% of the episodes centered on exploration of a new idea or object, with some fun action squeezed in there. In Picard, it's just depressing episode after depressing episode. All sense of wonder is destroyed, and the beginning of Ep.5 really took me completely out of the ST universe. I have never experienced writing as abysmal as this, ever. .You can really feel the 2020 writing in these episodes, and it is awful. Creative decisions? Where? I see none.All creativity seems to have been completely cut off. What was once one of the largest tv franchises in American history has now become a second-rate pay-to-view streaming show, even with the A-listers such as Stewart and Jeri Ryan.Can we talk about Icheb for a second? What was the point of his character arc in Voyager for him to just get randomly murdered? So stupid how this character I really loved, one with a learning arc of redemption from his time as a borg and his journey to self betterment, just gets horribly mutilated and shot at the beginning of the episode. Voyager left a legacy with him, and Picard just threw it away like it was garbage.For all of this, I do not consider Star Trek: Picard canon. STP will NEVER be a part of my canon. My canon ended with Enterprise.To CBS: GET A GRIP NOW. Nobody wants this. If you are going to tell a story with these legendary people, you'd better respect the greats that came before you. You have lost my respect, and by the looks of things, the respect of millions of ST fans.If you're gonna spend millions on a new series, then get Anson Mount, Ethan Peck, and Rebecca Romjin back on screen for a Pike series. Invest in writing that you can expand upon. You have a decade to work with before Kirk takes over as Captain, so add to canon! Seems like such an easy decision to make, that millions of us are willing to pay for. You had an opportunity with Picard, and promptly wasted it.",

What annoys me the most is the way this story is presented, so damning self important and dull. No humor. No ideals. No progress. No sense of improving ourselves as humans. No exploration of our emotions or ideals of what makes us human. It seems stuck inside some dull emotion of a 12 year old. It only makes me tense .",

Just endless talking dispersed by the occasional action which lasts for a few seconds and then more endless talking. This series is a drama, has very little to do with Star Trek, and reckon the producers of this travesty deserve to be sent to the gulag for creating such an abomination. RIP Star Trek. \ud83d\ude1f",

There are many reviews to that effect already, so I will try to be as succinct as possible:1. Soundtrack and opening sequence - lackluster, not memorable, not inspiring, with no hope of becoming iconic or easily recognizable2. Futuristic technology - unimaginative (in the 60s they had a better idea and execution of what future technology would be like)3. Not a family show - 2 f-bombs in the second episode, both by women4. Main character - old, frail, visibly struggling as opposed to strong, awe-inspiring captains of the respectable installments of the Star Trek series5. Characters in places of authority - all women, but not good ones - swearing admiral, angry Romulan commodore, poison-spewing Romulan sister. Seems like feminists are trying to shoot themselves in the foot.6. Camera work - horrendous to say the least, angles from behind with half the heads cut off, angles from below, sunrays, reflections, odd glares. Amateurs can do better.7. Speech tempo and vocab - too fast, too vernacular, trying too hard to sound scientific, but failing to give the audience time to process8. Young actors - no charisma, no skill, no personality9. Star Trek shows always had a self-contained story per episode as well as an all-encompassing arc. Nothing of the sort here. It is one long overextended story broken into segments.10. At the core of Star Trek there is always nobility, striving towards higher ideals and a better version of oneself, hope, positivity. This show is bleak, bitter, angry.11. Picard gets cussed at by a Starfleet admiral, Romulans are servants to humans, Data's daughters are plain slutty (cannot hold a candle to Lal) - this cannot possibly be conceived as part of the Star Trek legacy.

But I am most surprised at Mr.Stewart for deciding to participate in this. Obviously he doesn't get it as well.You must understand that most people watched Star Trek for these reasons;\nIt was intended to explore the better part of ourselves, to get back in that awe state many of us lost when we left our childhoods. To come closer to the beautiful and glorious vastness of space.\nTo learn compassion and respect for every form of life. To stay hopeful. To get rid of our negative thoughts, which are basic part of our human mind.

I get we can put more pew-pew now in each episode. I get it that the show needs to evolve, season-long story arcs feel more \"serious\" than \"dilemma of the week\". That's fine, evolve away. But who is this show even for?If it's for the existing fans of the ST series, then the makers should take into account that those fans have grown older so ST should become more sophisticated to keep up, not come up with plots seemingly written by 6-graders and cover the silliness up with technobabble. Same as other reviews have noted, ST didn't used to be about solving problems with weapons and kicks.If the show is oriented towards capturing a new young adult audience, then why bother bringing back Patrick Stewart and the gang? Season one was ok as a nostalgia trip, one last hurrah for the ST: NG crew. A gentle last goodbye.Season two... ugh... gets sillier by the episode. Although the scenes with Picard either have better-written dialogues or Patrick Stewart's delivery can make any nonsense sound wise. I choose to believe that he's actually had some degree of creative control over his own lines and that's why his scenes are actually mostly quite enjoyable.S02 starts with the \"Don't step on butterflies\" principle of time travel but ends up with \"this was always supposed to happen\". WTH...Last but not least, while I like the character of Rios, his obsession with smoking is jarring. I can swallow it when he's on his own ship. But as a captain of a Starfleet starship, he's on the bridge with a cigar in his teeth? I think that level of inconsideration toward his officers would be unacceptable in Starfleet. But we never actually see him smoking. My suspicion is that's because because showing someone smoking would have changed the age rating of the show. But we do want all those sweet-sweet tobacco dollars! So what do we do then? Make it suggestive AF without actually showing it, so he holds the cigar in his mouth, plays around with the lighter, later - with matches but never actually smokes on-screen. Even supposedly dies \"smoking a cigar\". Whoopy Goldberg must have gagged when saying the line.Conclusion: If you're an existing ST fan, Orville has more ST spirit in it than Picard. Go watch that.If you're not an existing ST fan, skip it. Why would you waste your time on a dying franchise?",

This is deliberate I guess, but I wish they would let some of his character's cunning shine. He is just going along with events asking people to trust him.\nIt's also part Firefly/Cowboy Bebob ragtag spaceship adventure. And part espionage, and part action.

I might wait til the series end and try to watch the rest at once, it is not keeping any week to week interest for me.\nDiscovery had it's slow parts as well, but it was fresh, new, and most importantly: we had no expectations from it because the main characters were new to TV.\nReading the reviews here, I think most of us were expecting something different. The show's content could be fine, but the presentation and pacing are god awful.\nCompanion characters are also nothing spectacular, and then they went and cloned 2 or however many extra ones of the pilot with the emergency holograms.

Plus they bring back 7 of 9, who is a great great character, and it's not at all clear what she's doing, and the plot that concerns her seems to exist sort of in a back room with no relevant connection to the main plot. The main plot is extremely confusing and has something to do with androids/AI becoming violent and destructive while at the same time some intolerant forces have banned androids, and this is seen as evil even though the androids were im fact violent and destructive.And commander riker and counselor Troy had a child who died of an illness which would have been prevented if they didn't banned artificial intelligence because artificial intelligence had some sort of a cure for that disease.If you are not enjoying my review I assure you you will not enjoy the show because my review is just as in comprehensible as this terrible terrible program.And there is some bizarre romulan spy who is involved in doing research on a Borg cube (??) who has a evil sister, and they're trying to kill and artificial life form , whom captain picard is trying to save, even though she IS in fact the destroyer of the Galaxy that everyone fears she is.....\nI think I only wanted to write this review to see if I could try in a few minutes to make some sense of these 10 episodes.

            "content": "UPDATE After Watching Season 2:So, I down rated Picard and am sad to say, Season 2 was absolutely awful. After watching the brilliance of Season 1, I eagerly awaited Season 2 to see where the crew went after the stunning conclusion to Season 1. What happened? Did ALL of the main people except the crew leave this show? Season 1 left us wondering with anticipation about our heroes future as Picard ended it with a smile and an \"engage,\" (or whatever, number 2 was so bad, I am going to make this short. Rather not spend any more time on this one!) Instead? We got a messy, disjointed story which was nearly stand alone. Meaning, you didn't even have to watch Season 1 to understand 2. Sloppy, lazy, rambling, messy. JMHO. I have never in my life seen a show shoot itself in the gut (metaphorically speaking, naturally), by having so much potential and then, throwing it all away with too much emotion and dull, disjointed plots in the sequel. I sure would like to know what happened to the people behind the scenes to have one amazing season, and then trash the whole story on us. Star Trek deserves far, far better than this, and Discovery. It's like nobody even watched TNG, or Deep Space 9, or even Voyager. It saddens me a lot that these shows are what the younger generation will remember of the original series. Progress seems to be running rampant throughout the U. S. A. Sometimes, in many things today, progress runs against what many Americans want. But who cares about us? Most of us work hard and have huge, complicated situations going on in our private lives. We watch TV to relish the escapism of the stories. I wish Hollywood got this! I also wish you (Paramount) had watched over this 2nd Season filming and kicked their lazy butts for taking what had great potential and smashing that potential to pieces. So, so sad!Original Post 4/2021:A \"doddering\" old man? Boring? Why why why? These are called talking points when you see the same words written over and over again In the first scroll down on the reviews of Picard. I smell a rat. And that rat is not Picard, but an ageist anti-Star Trek group working hard to bring down the ratings of this fine show.When the reviewing began a year ago, it was mixed, for sure. But I could not find an end to these similarly written rotten reviews of a show that was actually very good. I am asking IMDb to look into this, please? If you refine your search and set it for seeing only reviews of 10, it is still in the highest category. Which implies there were fair reviews at one time, but NOT NOW. Where there is smoke there is fire and I believe there has been an invasion of some sort of twisted group organized, for whatever reasons, to take out Picard. These reviews are short, with very little detail given except what I wrote at the beginning. These people are not real reviewers - they appear to be part of a group, who have no idea HOW to write a proper review unless talking points are handed out. This is not fair to the show and especially to those who did REAL reviews on a very good show.I have read many reviews on many movies and shows in here and never have I seen the barrage of similar 1 and 2 star reviews that completely sucked the air out of the reviewing process. Let's try to get to the bottom of this, OK? Picard was not perfect, no show is. But it was NOT boring, and that \"doddering\" old man was meant to be played that way by Sir Patrick because he was deeply depressed in the beginning. You all needed to watch the series to the end to really see the brilliance of this new Star Trek entry.And, um, I thought Millenials were \"woke.\" They appear to be written by 6th graders. And I also thought they were against hate and nastiness. I think maybe I got a view of a younger generation without respect, or the ability to be honest. A 10 rating for Picard - the entire first season, had any of these reviewers watched it or done even a little research, was to set up an exciting new story for the rest of the series which this group is hell-bent on heading off at the pass. A sad commentary of humanity once again as U. S. borders are overwhelmed, our statues are falling and our cities are burning, the police defunded, and people are moving away from the messy areas in record numbers.I am quite frankly more heartbroken at the evil words written over and over again as far as I scrolled, than what these evil words were trying to accomplish. When will the hatred, the lying, the fear, and group thinking end? Or have we seen the end of individual thought? Please, people, I think that onslaught was meant to silence those of us who loved Picard. We cannot allow them to seize Picard like they are trying to do with so many traditions and values this country always stood for. Start writing some great reviews - do NOT bow down to the bullies!!",

            "content": "I have been a long time fan of star Trek and have basically liked all the series related to the original franchise, but Picard is unfortunately, in my opinion, bit worthy of being in the Star Trek family.I had a lot of expectations, Picard is arguably the best captain in any of the series, and with him and part of the original crew involved this could have been a hit.The first problem is that it is extremely slow. The 10 episodes in season 1 could have been very adequately been done in 3. The rest is simply forgettable filling.\nThe second problem is that it somehow feels disconnected from classical star trek narrative, in terms of the way the episodes are set up.\nThird there are a couple of opportunities for intense action, but they are simply not used. The most iconic one is the final confrontation with the Romulans, Nearly 400 ships ready to fire, no shots taken, completely missed opportunity for an amazing battle scene. While at the same time they show these awkward, unimaginative looking, robotic tentacles starting to emerge from a space time hole that was created, very a la Avengers. They did not look good, at all, and the scene could have gone elsewhere, with more action and getting you much more involved.\nClassic Picard characters are not bad, new characters are good too, but the feeling I had after watching the whole season was that it was an opportunity not fully taken.If there is a second season hopefully they will change the shows direction, and make it more involving and use the opportunities it presents to engage the viewer in more intense action. If it does not get better, there surely will be no third season and Picard, one of the greatest names in Star Trek legacy will have a bad ending to it.",

In all honesty, this reminds me of the Battlestar Gallactica remake where writers/directors/producers felt the need to try and be ground breaking to the series.Unfortunately I think Gene Roddenberry would very much disapprove of this new direction the show has taken. From episode one, we get the introduction to vulgarity (I can recall when Captain Kirk said \"Hell\" in the 60's and it was a big deal...how things have changed). Then of course the sex is introduced, and then the violence and gore. Pretty mind blowing, and a lack of real writing to make things entertaining without all the adolescent BS.I'm pretty disappointed in Patrick Stewart thinking all of this was needed to make a quality continuation of Star Trek. Much of this junk leaves out the younger audience, an audience that Star Trek and subsequent Roddenberry series were able to capture both young and older audiences. Wow. I hope reviews like this are read and taken to heart. Maybe season 2 can be cleaned up some and back on track with what the Star Trek Universe is about.Update 5/1/2022. Season 2 is here. More disappointments. More Hollywood conditioning that ICE and Border Patrol in the USA are evil and treat ALL migrants with cruelty. Then in a later episode, you have more references about how corrupt law enforcement is in our century.I'm really trying to give this show a chance, but it really is hard to digest with all the modern day woke mentality it spews.Maybe Strange New Worlds will be better...we can only hope.",

This isn't entirely fan service as well, although there is certainly elements of that.No, this is a journey telling the last voyage of Picard. The show has a somewhat interesting if shaky premise that's been a familiar trope in sci-fi for sometime now; the idea that AI will, eventually, rise up and revolt.And that there is a mysterious faction at work that zealously hates and distrusts AI, but their goal seems to go deeper than that.Problem with Picard isn't so much of an overused trope or the premise, but the writing and setup of the supporting cast. My issue isn't with their acting capability; if anything, its generally decent and acceptable.The issue is the characters themselves and how they were written. I really dislike the idea of a 'samurai' romulan wielding a sword and being utilized for his skills. We are supposed to believe that this singular romulan individual grew up to be a remarkable swordsman simply because Picard spent a few minutes fencing with the young lad.Then there's the attack by the secret romulan cell on Picard himself and Data's daughter. In one scene, we see Picard and his friends at his Chathour viewing remarkable security footage of the first incident, despite apparently leaving no evidence behind (and not making it clear how they got this footage) which also leaves a glaring big massive plot-hole as to why Picard didn't show this amazing clear footage of an attack to Star Fleet intelligence when he had the chance.For a secret romulan cell, they seem quite incompetent at taking out an old man and a pair of talented and skilled former intelligence operatives (but only two of them) not to mention leaving behind a trail of evidence, bodies and weapons which I no doubt, will not find their way towards Star Fleet intelligence because, well, because the plot demands that it doesn't.Picard is by no means without its flaws. Its marred by 21st Century tropes and writing habits that some of these writers seem to be having an issue leaving behind some old habits.I just hope the rest of the scene is an improvement upon what I've seen so far.",

Whoever Patrick Stewart is playing it is certainly not Jean-Luc Picard, he displays none of his authority, humility and mannerisms.

The people who made this show clearly did not watch and understand ALL of the previous Star Trek shows. It was misunderstood in Discovery, and now not just misunderstood but thrown out the window for Picard. As captain (now admiral) Picard once said: \"there is no logic in this at all!\".The story is so full of plot holes, it would have made Spock want to leave our planet and designate it as having no intelligence. A major one that was supposed to drive the story is If androids/robots/AI were the enemy to life itself, why didn't the Romulan 'KGB within KGB' (Zhat Vash of the Tal Shiar, I listened!) go after them in the previous Star Trek shows? And the way they went about it of going after them makes them not just horrible people to their own race they swore to protect, but ****ing stupid and illogical.The 'KGB of KGB' want to extinguish all synthetic life by hacking into the androids on Mars to destroy the Federation ship building stations; when those same ships were needed to rescue the Romulans from their home planet being destroyed by a supernova. The Federation gave up on following their own core protocol in saving lives, because some species threatened to leave if they persisted, and thought the best way to save face is to blame \"synths\", and therefore banning them. And then they hear someone continued anyway with Data's remaining synthetic brain cell in creating a group of androids, in duplicates, with Data's full memory, but not really, on a secret planet. So, they play the cat and mouse game of finding the new androids before the androids could unleash mayhem by bringing forth the synthetic equivalent of a demon god from Romulan mythology.For starters, if they knew a supernova was going to happen, couldn't the Romulan STAR EMPIRE have prepared something about it; especially with their large armada of ships that were evident to have existed but not appear until the last 2 episodes of this show?! If they had the technology to hack synths, then couldn't they have done it with the androids as well? And instead of having them commit genocide on everyone, just do it to themselves? Also the Romulans are a cousin species of the Vulcans, so they are strong and intelligent but also clever and cunning, downright mean; hence why they have an empire and not a federation. If their 'KGB of KGB' are supposed to be very intelligent patriotic-spies, then how could they not have considered that if the \"synths\" were pushed in that dire straits of a situation, then they might just revolt, for example, by calling down on their synthetic god?! They're not very bright are they?!?!Those were just some examples of major plot holes. Now imagine that, big and small, all over the place in the entire season. And then to top it off have bad dialogues, illogical science (compared to the usual you would hear and make some sense of in other Star Trek shows, that's a low), blatant sexism, some ageism, propaganda driven, 180 character changes (since when were Romulans nice or carry swords in their day and age?); and then displaying it to you as if you're a baby. I bet the people who wrote this watched Avatar The Legend of Korra and thought it was a good show, and the final scene of Korra and Asami leaving together displayed the best surprise ever; because that's what they did in the final scene with Seven-of-Nine (of all people!!) and this new character Rafaella, who was nothing more than a whinging, smoking, stoner, alcoholic, Picard-battering, terrible mother who kept calling Picard \"JL\".The only thing good that was worth mentioning is decent to good graphics, and seeing some of the old cast come back. But Christ did they do the old cast dirty, especially to Picard and Seven-of-Nine. For crying out loud they didn't even get the lore right...",

Yes, it took some time for world building and character development in the first 3 episodes, but that's ok - since there was need for unfolding the new Star Trek universe after 18 years of absence on TV and the big screen. But at the latest with episode 5 the same plot problems appeared as with \"Star Trek: Discovery\", which I prefer to call \"Disgracery\".BUT this show is better than \"Disgracery\" and has much more potential. The story unfolding in the first three episodes is really amazing:\nThe Federation has lost its idealistic and open minded approach and is in a veritable crisis. Androids are forbidden after a desastrous attack on Mars. But it is hinted, that this attack was a conspiracy by a Romulan extremist group called the Zhat Vash. The Romulan Empire is no more, at least not as we knew it. The Romulans control a Borg cube, so the Borg are in this too. And Jean-Luc Picard is a disenchanted old man, sometimes even smugly. But he finds a new mission: the search for Data and what's left of him - and on the way he discovers a great conspiracy. Picard is still the idealistic spark in this Star Trek universe.But beginning with episode 6 the writers always took the quick way, always the easy way to tell the story. They always prefer senseless show effects over consistent story telling. There are so many plot holes.I guess, the problem is Alex Kurtzman and his team. They just don't want a modern TV show which admit to really (not faked) serial story telling. They always take the short cut, always use \"deus ex machina\" to solve the stories they unfolded before. So they create a dumb AI-god instead of using the amazing AI they already have: the Borg. Then they let Picard die, just to revive him again as a Synth who fakes to be old (I mean, it would at least be a bit reasonable, if they wanted to replace Patrick Stewart by a younger actor - but that they didn't dare). Nonsense and so lazy writing!Just imagine how many great seasons this could have been, if not this stupid AI-god (which for sure we will see no more) is the origin of the ancient message the Zhat Vash discovered, but instead the ancient culture that created the Borg and then was destroyed by them? Just imagine, what stories we could have seen, if these uninspired writers room of \"Star Trek: Picard\" would have used their own tracks and hints and not let them lead into nothing? And make a quick solution by using massive \"deus ex machinas\".Instead the producers prefered Easter Eggs for nothing, nostalgic show effects and a story that in the end is as trivial and as episodic as the old 90s TV show stories.Not state of the art, not nearly in the same league as really great TV shows nowadays.

            "review_title": "Constant retcons destroy what made things interesting in the first place --- but there are also many pleasing aspects about this show",
            "content": "First of all: This is very emotional for me. I'm born in the very late 1980s and grew up with the 1987-2002 TNG-era Star Trek, as TNG+DS9+VOY had constant reruns on mainstream German TV stations until the late 2000s. So there is nostalgia in play, and nostalgia usually isn't a good reviewer. But a fan's lore knowledge can also help to sort things out.So straight to every fan's most important question: Does the show respect and uphold established Star Trek canon? The answer to this question is: Sort of. Considering the state of Star Trek since 2009, this is a success. And a cornerstone of this success is that a contemporary Trek show made with modern movie tech and a big budget has much less trouble integrating into the Star Trek timeline when it is set 20 years after ST10 like STP rather than 10 years before TOS like STD. That's simply because in a sequel the advancements in production standards can be explained away as in-universe advancements, while a prequel completely destroys suspension of disbelief.And they really tried to link STP to TNG/DS9/VOY visually while still appealing to \"the next generation\" of consumers! Let's take LCARS for example: The OS evolved since we last saw it on the small screen in Voyager's Endgame, but you can clearly see it is still LCARS - just after the installation of some updates over the two decades. It's like the evolution of Windows during the last two decades: It changed, but the basic layout and iconography stayed the same. The producers also made sure to provide visual links to established TNG-era elements, like with the items in Picard's exhibition room at the Starfleet Museum, er the esthetics of the replicator or by making the Galaxy class USS Enterprise-D and it 10 forward bar appear.So far there aren't many significant canon contradictions. Okay, in TNG S01E26 Data said that TV didn't last much beyond the year 2040, yet we see TV newscasts and Picard doing a TV interview. But admittedly we already saw a TV newscast in Voyager's series finale \"Endgame\", and I personally can live with such small and infrequent canon offenses quite well. But I can't live with the big ones! Big ones like shuttles from Discovery flying around everywhere while the beautiful TNG-era shuttles were nowhere to be seen! This is a bad artistic decision and it makes no sense canon-wise, as Discovery is set over a century before Picard while Voyager with its beautiful shuttlecrafts is set only 25 years before Picard. Such inconsistencies suck!On the other hand we get much nostalgic balm that will please every fan's soul. We can spot a dermal regenerator in action. We see both TNG-era uniforms - and they look good. We see the communicator that was used in Voyager and the latter half of DS9. We see many recreations of props used in TNG like the Kurlan naiskos, a Klingon bat'leth or the banner from Captain Picard Day. (The original props had been sold as part of the \"It's a Wrap!\" auction, but the recreations look very, very convincing.) We see established alien species like the Trill.A thing that can be noticed quite negatively however is the surprisingly cheap looking VFX. Enterprise-D's ten forward can easily be recognized as digital set, the shot of San Francisco's bay area looks like from a 2000s Syfy channel movie and the CGI model of the Enterprise-D looks inferior to his physical counterpart(s) from the 80s/90s where real light was hitting real surfaces. (TNG aged very well and it is hard to live up to its standards!)But the worst thing is the horrible writing. The first episode has a clear jumping the shark moment where massive hack writing is setting in. You will immediately realize what I mean when watching the show. The first 40 minutes of the series are making it quite clear that we can expect an unrealistic as well as contradicting storyline full of plot holes. And yes, I'm positive about this after the first episode.",

I don't know if I'm spoiled but it's not enough of everything for me.Do you know that feeling when you're looking forward to a game, it's coming out, you think it's cool, but it seems unfinished? The episodes in Picard are too empty for their length and that makes the seasons of only 10 episodes all the worse. It's like currency reform - you only get half as much but it costs more. It's like they've been too lazy or too impatient to decorate the episodes with enough plot but still have to stretch everything out to 10 episodes. TNG episodes were just as long, but despite the main plot, each episode was a whole story and so much of it that after each episode you felt as satisfied as if you had watched a whole movie. It's like this development in the gamer scene. You get a bit of the main game, later a DLC, etc. All in bits and pieces but not too much - you could have fun after all.It's enjoyable, but if you are looking forward to rich filled episodes you might feel let down.",

Sadly, it all unravels rather messily from the middle of the series, like a rather confused ball of string.\nI have to admit, at this point, I don't consider myself a Trekkie... I'm a big fan of TNG and DS9, and will happily watch the original series for nostalgia and giggles. But I was never a fan of the other shows and the movies are a mixed bag for me. I do love those NG characters though.\nThere has been much said about the dark tone of this series, and it not being in line with Roddenberry's positive vision of humanities' future. It is darker for sure. I thought this may have been an interesting take on the downfall of a once idyllic Starfleet utopia. Saying something, perhaps, about modern America. But sadly, this is just an aesthetic. There are some nice performances in the series and I can't really put my finger on an actor I didn't like. Perhaps with the exception of the Romulan lead, who I thought was mis-cast in the role. The trouble is entirely in the writing I'm afraid.\nOnce again, we see a well loved franchise wheeled out for the punters as a cash cow, with no real ideas, or direction, or point. Too many plot points don't make any sense. Too much dialogue is clunky and expositional. It feels simultaneously slow and bloated. As the series progresses, far too many elements are just kicked to the curb entirely, to the point where it becomes insulting to watch. The last couple of episodes feel almost like they were re-written purposefully not to carry plot forward. It's an opportunity missed. There are good characters hidden here and interesting subjects to explore - but can somebody hire writers who have something to say about, well... anything. It certainly doesn't feel like Star Trek, to the point where characters I cared for and had a warm fuzzy nostalgia about at the start of the series, I didn't give xxxx about by the end. And that brings me to my next point. Star Trek was always a family show. I'm a grown up, I'm not offended by swearing on TV. But I wouldn't watch this series of I had a young family. Star Trek - please don't start dropping the F Bomb half way into a series - It's not big and it's not clever - and if your characters weren't two dimensional you wouldn't need to!",

However, the first few reviews I see here seem to be in the same vein.The first episode was quite good... the second was weaker... and then I started wondering if all the money went into hiring Patrick Stewart and making a great first episode. Admittedly, I have seen neither Enterprise nor Star Trek: Discovery because I did not hear good reviews about them, but I had hoped that with this show the producers of Star Trek would have been past hiring actors that can't act (I won't be specific because I realize they are real people); they obviously aren't. It also seems that they can't afford decent writers, because twice in the first three shows I saw a dialogue contrivance of character A earnestly submitting a shocking idea, character B scoffing at the idea, and then effectively saying, \"you're serious?\" as character A maintains the earnestness. There was also the shockingly bad confession after \"can you keep a secret\", and the relationship between Narek and his sister is painfully laughable.Both Allison Pill and Patrick Stewart have been given material that they must be wincing at. I know Allison Pill is a good actress, but it would be very difficult to tell just from this show; she must be a diehard Trek fan to have taken on this role. And Patrick Stewart must be wondering what he got himself into after the promising first episode descended into episodic TV. For a show that is about one story arc, they needed to not cheat the fans and simply turn it into a miniseries featuring only the number of episodes needed to tell the story.

Admittedly I wasn't all that won over by the first few episodes as I thought the show had a bit of a slow start, but it is growing on me and now I can't wait to see how S1 endsReading a few reviews it's pretty clear many purists simply don't like the feel of the show, that it's not true to form ST, darker and abandoning it's principles. While I always loved Star Trek, there was always a side of me that thought it was just a bit pompous and overly self righteous, and that it didn't get itself dirty enough, obviously that's not a problem with Picard. I know part of the cleanliness of the previous shows was probably to do with Roddenberry and his utopian beliefs, and maybe also to do with the fact that they were on cable, but Picard being on CBS All Access, they can be more graphic and drop F bombs all they like. I know some people may strongly disagree with this and say it's too foul for kids, but personally I've never found ST to be much of a kid show to begin with. So overall I welcome the darker and quite frankly more earthbound feel to itAs far as the story itself, I'm glad it's about something different, not centered around a specific ship or station, but more free reigns to just follow a story line wherever that goes. However, that said I'm wondering if this particular story arc about Synths vs Romans will continue on into S2 which I think would wear thin, or wrap up at the end of S1, and if so, then what's in store for S2? It's kind of funny how the Orville blatantly copied so many ST things, except machines rising up against organics and yet Picard is building off a very similar arcAnd then there's the aspect of Picard's brain condition, which we finally see symptoms of, and a 79 year old Patrick Stewart playing the role, and as good as he still is you have to wonder how long this thing could go? Sure they could conjure up some miracle cure, but given the name of the show is Picard, it really is revolving around him and he's the glue holding this whole thing together. I can't think of any series show where the main lead is almost 80 years old, so I guess time will tell there.As far as reusing old ST cast members, this feared me a bit as it usually makes for lackluster episodes or future developments, and typically serves to just give some screen time to someone who's over the hill. That said I'm glad about Jeri Ryan's appearance in the show and don't mind a bit if she becomes a supporting regular as she's still got it. I really hope we don't see any more of Marina Sirtis as she's just not aging well, that and I never liked her pointless character in the first place. Far as Franks, I prefer him behind the camera instead of in front of it. I did like seeing Hue again even if it was brief. Overall I hope they don't have too many more reunionsTo sum up, yeah I thought it started a little slow, but I can see why, good stories take time to build. But things started to pick up in the middle episodes and as we got more into the third act I'm intrigued to see how things are going to end for S1. I really hope they don't screw up the ending, I guess we'll see8/10",

Making sure each and every character has their own set of individual conflicts that they deal with. Where it falls short is it's consistent reminiscent dialogue between characters, which ends up taking the majority of the episode's time. This gets old very quickly making for mundane scenes.

The Borg are back and this time they are in-sync with what our modern day technological advancements are. A foe that was trully held back by 90s standards and lack of real life tech , I have always felt that the Borg would be today the most mighty of enemies seeing that they embody the technological threat we fear in today's world , but even more powerful.Con :\nAs with season 1 , the writters have decided to continue with their un-star trek ideals of portraing smoking as the new norm. Of all the terrible decisions made with STP , that of having a cigar smoking captain that acts like a cowboy rather than a starfleet officer should be making poor Gene spin in his grace at warp 9 right now. Not only is it a thousand steps backwards ethically but also completely contradicts the entire franchise and numerous episodes of TNG where picard himself points out the terrible nature of smoking as part of the decadence of the 20th century. Lest we forget even Captain Kirks reaction to the \"filthy habit\".Pro :Q is back!! There he is , in all his glory ! What you need more ? Ok ... Guinan too !! Both being just as you remembered them! Older yes , different no!Con :\nMany parts of the episode are hard to watch without wondering \"Is this serious or is it a star trek parody? \". Indeed a few years ago , many script and story elements would and could only be found in indie star trek parodies , and yet .. here they are .. in the franchise itself.Pro :\nIf you watch the last 20 minutes of the episode only , you might just be tricked into thinking that Star Trek Picard is the worthy continuation of TNG and Star Trek : First Contact. Finally they have got it right and this is going to be great!Con :\nIf you watch the episode from the beggining , you might turn it off before you reach the last 20 mins of find yourself skipping to the end just for Q.Pro :\nIf you are a fan of JJ cinematography , you will be happy.Con :\nIf you expect your favourite Jean luc to return ... don't.Sadly , Patrick Stewart is just not up to the role or character. In all , Star Trek Picard is an ego trip for an actor rather than a reprisal of a memorable and inspirational character. Fans of TNG are confronted with their beloved character behaving in complete opposite to what he did and preached during TNG. A role being played by an actor who appears to have never seen any of the episodes he acted in during the 7 seasons of TNG.From barely walking to romancing his aid like a care home patient , and constantly looking lost like Homer Simpson's father to barely being able to speak , let alone ask the computer to self destruct , Star Trek Picard is well and trully on its way to Geria-Trek Picard.",

            "content": "I loved the first season of ''Star Trek: Picard''. And that's no small thing considering that, at around the same time, i was also watching great shows like ''The Expanse'', and ''The Boys''. So it makes it all the sadder that season two of ''Picard'' is some of the worst, by the numbers, cliche ridden, barrel-scraping, cookie-cutter garbage that i have seen in decades. And i don't mean that it's just dissapointing compared to season one. That would be understandable. But season two is bad compared to the worst of anything that TV has ever had to offer. And i don't just mean within the Star Trek franchise either, or even within science fiction in general. I honestly and seriously mean that season two of ''Picard'' is one of the very worst things on screen, ever.The very moment i heard that the plot was the team travelling back in time to (more of less) present day L. A. then i instantly cringed. After all, it's not like it's been done before is it? Oh, except by Kirk, and Janeway, and probably others slipping my mind for now. And it's also not like there are any other citys in the world either. We all know that everything happens exlusivly in LA, New York, or at The Whitehouse. There are simply no other locations on Earth (are there Hollywood?)But if that wasn't basic, template writing enough, the second that the team arrive in Earths past one of them gets hurt and rushed to a clinic. From there, i knew for certain that i could tell you almost all of the plot for the next couple of episodes, and half the plot for the rest of the season. He meets a hot nurse, he then seperatly meets her precocious and annoying child, who explains (without much reason) that his mum is currently single, various members of the team get arrested, etc, etc, It's like i'm watching almost any old Trek from the last half a century, and all that's changed is the names and faces. And there is only one small jokey reference to kind of say ''Yes, THIS again''. To be honest, they could have littered season two with those self-deprciating-humour scenes, and turned it into one long bad self-parody. Yes, it would have been like a second rate version of ''The Orville'', but that would still have been a massive improvment on what this is.Because next we get a baddie inside someones head that nobody else can see or hear (done endlessly in ''Farscape'', and WAY better in ''Altered Carbon'' and ''The Expanse''), a whole episode inside Picards mind (not far off the ''it was all a dream'' cliche), and even a damn song! And that's me out. When i somehow get so far into a book, film, or TV series, and still don't have to see the end, that's when i know it sucks. Because IF i've made it past the halfway point, and i can still bail out without even wondering how things go, then it must truly be garbage. And i have only done that about four times in roughly forty-five years. But yes, this gets THAT bad. And from having been so good (I. M. O.) to start with, that must make it one of the biggest, or at least one of the fastest drops in quality in TV history.",

In most episodes absolutely nothing happens. Whole episodes filled with important conversations, chain of events etc. Taking place on a few scenes. For example: One episode a crew member got injured and the whole episode is about his stay at hospital with an arrest by the immigration agency. Next season the whole plot is how the other crew members free this crewman. Next episode everything takes place at one banquet etc. Etc. Thats silly stuff without any interest you can mention as little side story but not to fill a whole season with.2. Frist episode is great and draws interest for more. Guess what, everything is smashed with another stupid time traveling story that has nothing to do with the promising plot of the first episode.3. Unbelivable character design and stupidity of those characters just to force the climax of the season. A brilliant scientist believe the lies of the borg queen and let the queen assimilate her because she feels lonely?! After that she is surprised she can't control her own body anymore?! WTF?! Are they serious?!Season 2 is a joke and they better do a great job on season 3 otherwise they spend the money better on welfare instead burning it with another season of this mess.",

Can't use the exact same ships and characters. They have to be significantly different. While Discovery(terrible show) was filming it's second season, producers, show runners, and CBS said this won't be the Star Trek you remember. Patrick Stewart said the same thing, way before Picard premiered. So your review is \"This isn't Star Trek\"??? Have you not paid attention? In actuality, it is Trek. It's not just another bi-weekly holodeck malfunction, or who gets to fall in love in this week's episode. It's an overarching storyline, meant to tell a good story, which it is doing. It's real life. It's great character development(unlike Discovery). The tech and plot make sense(unlike Discovery). How many times did Kirk or Janeway or Sisko or Archer or even Picard disobey Starfleet to save entire races or prevent war? How many times has Starfleet been infiltrated or made the wrong decision? That's some utopia. Officers can disobey orders on a wim. That's not how orders work. That's some utopia. Picard is a hardcore, well written show that actually remembers what it did in the last episode. It doesn't have magic tech to solve plot problems(Discovery). It has great characters who each get a chance at the helm. It's not just about one character. You want problems solved in an hour? Go watch the old stuff. The old TNG is great, but so is this. In it's own way. Not agenda driven. This is gritty and good. If you haven't seen it yet, please do. Don't let the naysayers cloud your judgement. You won't be disappointed.",

Gene Roddenberry would have hated what Star Trek has become. I am also very surprised that Sir Patrick Stewart (someone who should have understood what the star trek world was) went a long with such a let down.If someone made a Star Trek series in the way it was intended, a series of exploration, diplomacy and inginuity...... they would be the most watched ST series out there.

It is totaly believable. I love seeing Patrick Stewart again and all the connections to TNG. It harkens back to loved Episodes like Familiy, Measure of a Man, all good things, Insurection, and the Offspring. It is finally the continuation of the Star Trek i grew up with. I almost cried in some scense with data.Even for my Girlfriend it is perfect to watch.

Immediately the show deviates from the traditional Star Trek formula by stretching the main storyline across the entire season instead of having episode-contained stories with occasional multi-parters.The filming techniques used also deviate from traditional Star Trek by having harsh camera angles in an attempt to make otherwise boring scenes dramatic.As for ths story, if you can even call it that, it is written like a bad fanfiction with minimal effort. It seems the writers skimmed through a few popular episodes of TNG and threw references into the series from them. Data and Picard's relationship was never as close as its made out to be in the Picard series and the idea that one attack would turn the Federation, an organisation made up of hundreds of planets, into anti-synthetic racists, is completely stupid.In summary, this show is Star Trek in name only. After three episodes I have become bored and moved on. I should be disappointed with the turnout of the show but my expectations were very low from the moment I saw the first trailer and realised that this was rebranded Star Trek Discovery with cameos from popular Star Trek characters.

The pacing of the plot is all over the place. The acting is variable but generally not great. The characters are one dimensional and forgettable. The dialog is poor. The action is implausible, in one scene old man Picard gets blown off his feet in a huge explosion in San Francisco and wakes up back at home in France. In fact, the hole show has forgot time and space, its not clear how much time is passing between scenes or how travel is taking place, people just seem to pop up were ever the writers demand they need to be. I wanted this to be great, but its not. Every now and then you see a glimmer of hope only for your hope to smashed in the very next scene. Disappointed but not surprised.

When episodes of Star Trek, like season 2 of Picard, would appear in the past there were usually only 1, perhaps 2, in a row. Certainly not an entire season of the same thing. Season 2 is very tiring. Additionally, one can clearly notice a marked decline in Patrick Stewarts gait and movements. (He would have been 78/79, at the filming of season 2.) Season 3 is just starting and I have high hopes for a return to the Picard Season 1 style of Star Trek.

Nemesis was by no means great; but the horrible retconning of its events is just cringe Discovery writing at its peak.Nothing is believable about Star Trek: Picard.Hell, the so-so MMORPG somehow manages to build a better story and universe than this crap.

Perhaps this is his illness, but if this is farewell to JLP, it is a rather calculated character assassination of a true role model to many people.

            "content": "I think maybe the negative criticisms for this series are too harsh, (and I gave Discovery a 1* rating, and bashed the crap out of it, in my review). I do see the points people are making though, and more or less agree with them. But I also have been enjoying some of those same things, about this series.Anyways, let me just address a few of the things, I've seen other reviews complaining about.Dark: I do hate the new trend of tv shows being dark, in general. And this definitely suffers from that. Not only the story is dark, but also the visuals.As far as dark visuals go, that is never good, (i.e. the CW look) and it's not good here either.As far as a dark story goes, it can go either way. I do kind of like it here (unlike most others). I feel I can relate to Picard's darkness. I'm getting pretty old myself. Things I was once cheery about, just feel me with sadness now, with a sense of loss. Like Picard, I've lost loves ones, more and more each day. I myself used to be so optimistic. But, like Picard, I'm finding less and less to be optimistic about. I think Stewart's acting really captures this. So, I do like this aspect of the story.Cameos: I absolutely love this aspect of the show. Every episode I've downloaded so far (pirated of course), I just can't wait to see if another old favorite will appear.Non-episodic format: I do agree with the others here. I dislike it when any show has a non-episodic format. And, unfortunately, this is like that. I think what I dislike about it, with Star Trek, is that with old Star Treks I can watch episodes over and over again. I still watch Voyager and TNG episodes every day. (I have those series downloaded.)But, with a continuous story format, it may be good on the first viewing. You can't wait to progress the story each episode. And it's like that here too. I am anticipating each new episode, caus I want to see what will happen in the story. But as far as rewatching later, (I like to rewatch shows on a random shuffle in my media player) that wont work with this. Once you know the story there's no point to see it again.Violence: Here I totally disagree with the other reviews. Well maybe not disagree. I do see their point. Star Trek in the past tried to avoid violence, and acts of violence by beloved characters. However, in those past series, that annoyed the f##k out of me. I felt it was brain washing, to try to make us sheep like slaves. Or even worse, they did do alot of violence on almost every episode of past Star Trek series, but then hypocritically denounced violence. In other words, they did just as much violence, if not more, than ST:P, they just didn't show it's effects (i.e. bodys were vaporized instead of stabbed).Here, I think the violence is the best part, to me at least. When I told my brother about this series he asked, \"Is it any good?\" I replied, \"It's ok. It has alot of pretty extreme violence.\" He replied, \"Well that sounds good.\" So anyways, I really like the violence. It's the only thing that breaks up some of the boredom that the show can tend to have.Boredom: I have to agree with some of the others here. Like many shows that try to be serious, it can be boring. This whole series so far, really could have been done in a few episodes.I don't really blame the show though. People are just boring now days. They don't even know what excitement is. How could they make a show about something they can't even imagine. Maybe only us oldbies, from a time before internet, when we had to go out and do crazy things for fun, can remember excitement.Anyhow, I just finished episode 6 and the excitement level has definitely picked up. ( I rate ep. 5 and ep. 6, both very good, and exciting.Future setting: Finally, a new series or film that isn't a f##king prequel or remake. I could rant about prequels or remakes all day. (lol) And I won't feel satisfied until every person who ever made a prequel is dead. They ruined Star Trek with Enterprise. They ruined Star Trek with Discovery. They ruined Star Trek with those films (who's names I never even bothered to learn). The whole point of sci fi is the future. Not a point in time, between now and the future.So, I am so very glad that this isn't another prequel.Characters: I'm liking all the characters so far. I particularly like the guy with the sword. I like his ultra-violence. But, he is also funny. He is one of the few funny things in this show. Which is saying something, since he doesn't even talk much. Just the look on his face, and the few things he does say, always make me smile. The other characters seem good too. I don't know any of their names yet (on ep. 6), or I'd mention more characters I'm liking.Final thoughts: It may not be the best Star Trek (not even close). But it's still worth watching. I've been enjoying it, and eagerly anticipating new episodes, each week (Unlike Discovery, which I completely quit watching). I.m on episode 6 now. It could change. But as of now I'm giving it an 8. Before you say, \"That's too high.\" In my rating system, an 8 means, fairly enjoyable for a one time viewing.",

Picard was always my favorite captain so I'm glad they chose him for a series. It was so nice to see so many characters from TNG and one from STV! It pretty much stays with TNG canon of events, including the movies. Lastly, this series didn't get bogged down in new Millennium relationship acquiesces which are over-exposed in ST Discovery and almost all new shows and movies.\nThe bad: As much as I like Picard, there were times that I felt like I was watching the befuddled Professor Xavier from the last wolverine movie: Logan. (Which I did NOT like!) Because almost all backgrounds involving the interior of ships are CGI now days, they keep them intentionally fuzzy and dark so we won't scrutinize the scenes to closely. This is much darker than TOS and TNG - it is obvious that Rodenberry's future vision of the universe doesn't play here. Lastly, there is the ending might be a bit of a shock although I understand there will be a second season. (And that is a good thing!)",

The creators might have had Firefly in mind when putting this together, because it comes across as a bad copy of that format, overwrought emotional displays, a sometimes goofy style, which is perhaps a matter of taste. But star trek this is not. There is of course plenty of room to make changes to a franchise, to update, or explore new ideas without discarding all the good stuff. That is not achieved here. This is stylistic, lens flare goofiness, following on from the mindless action that was the Abrams reboot. It also, like those movies, seems very American, in a bad way, in that it has lost the sense of being science fiction. We do not feel like we are in the far flung society of the future, but rather as if some random north Americans were rounded up at a bar and then given a spaceship. It's boring.Something strange about it is that although written in a way that might appeal to adolescents, it has a lot of graphic violence and adult language.

            "content": "I'll leave my original review after season 1 at the end of my update (after I watched season 2).After season 2, which I watched in full: potential totally wasted. They made the show's possible strengths consistently into weaknesses, and tedious melodramas. Plot holes and neglected subplots aplenty. Total disrespect for Trek lore and feel is now the rule.I really wanted to give this show the benefit of the doubt after season 1. But I'm sorry I did.The showrunners need to steer this franchise train wreck back into sanity. I then assert: put this show to Ira Steven Behr and Ronald D. Moore if they're at all willing, immediately. They might be able to at least salvage something from the trash heap. Kurtzman is increasingly steering this franchise into disaster.I give it three stars now after season 2, because of good production values, and special effects. Most of the rest is subpar.I can only hope season 3 salvages something, but all bets are off at this point, frankly.Post season 1 review:Recommencing Star Trek, in the age of Netflix and Marvel dominance, and more modern audiences, was always going to be challenging. I don't agree with people whining this isn't exactly like TNG, Voyager, and DS9 of their memories. TV has changed since then, and it's ok to try new things, rather than just milk nostalgia.Centering it around though perhaps TNG's greatest asset - Picard - was a smart move. Patrick Stewart is great throughout, and brings gravity and dignity (and smiles, in a few great comedy moments).Pluses aside from this:I liked some of the new characters in this new crew, and discovering the scars on their history - it's important they haven't obsessed about pulling in just old characters, but building new ones.An episode with Riker and Troi was wonderfully done, and seeing again Jeri Ryan as Seven has been a highlight - you'll probably enjoy her character development. The 'return' of Data, curious though the plot around him is, has also given some tender and thoughtful moments at the beginning and end. These moments mark out the series, for anyone who's followed this wonderful android's tale in the Star Trek universe.The plot didn't go where I would have liked - exploring the extent of the aftermath in the Federation's rebuild after the Dominion War, and Voyager's return from the Delta Quadrant - but choosing Romulan relations after the desruction of their empire, was fair enough as a way to go.The cons - the writing has been very up and down at times.The villains in the end though aren't nearly as great, consistent or memorable as in some Star Trek in the end, after a promising beginning. Romulans are a practical and secretive people of course, but not stupid - and their holding to a relic and fantasy of 'all artificial life will doom us!' just felt like it insulted their intelligence, frankly.A continuing romance happening between two of the leads, after one had just lost her partner in an absolutely horrific way?! - this felt silly and tactless to me.An elf type character, based clearly on Legolas from Lord of the Rings, was irritating at times, and obvious.One memorable TNG character being revisited only to be killed off later, with only slight exploration as to his development in the meantime, was annoying.Some good character driven writing at the start, and midway, went sadly thrown the way of the dodo too towards the last few episodes - some buildups had little payoff.The climax wasn't as bad at least as some TV - looking at you here, Game of Thrones! However it still reeked of Star Wars and Marvel type influences - having to have a 'huge mega battle' and character turncoats a plenty. Macguffin reliance, and 'it all ended happily ever after' itis slotted in at the end too? Uneccessary, and silly.Rushed and staggered plotting too at the climax threw off the coda - sad when at times it had built up certain things nicely.Summary: glimpses of genius at times, but needs to build itself, and think about it's writing and character development more across a series.Hopefully season 2 will improve, and this does have a lot of potential. In my world, think about bringing the likes of Ira Steven Behr and Ronald D. Moore back on board please, if you're into serialised storytelling. Nobody has marshalled Star Trek better than these two for serial stories, and I'd love to see what they could do with this series.In the right hands this could be a blinder of a Star Trek show - even the best of them all - but it needs to learn off the first season's many mistakes, and adjust accordingly.",

This show is melodrama on steroids and it completely misses the mark. ST has used drama to great effect in its many incarnations, but the Picard writers are in such a rush for us to care about the new cast that they've forgotten to give us a reason to care.Whenever some excitement threatens to break out in any given episode, the writers manage to find a way to shut it down by having the cast spend 40 minutes per episode talking about how upset they are.The other characters also do not act like real people and behave in implausible ways, which become evident as you make your way through the episodes. Picard is also a victim of this, as the writers flip Picard between being a cautious wise old owl, or being totally impulsive and stubborn, on a whim.One character looks and acts like a rip-off from the Lord of the Rings and I'd be quite shocked if CBS haven't received some correspondence from intellectual property lawyers.Roddenberry's vision is a major casualty of the new series. The post-money utopian world of TNG has been displaced by jealousy, greed and drug addiction. The writers never get around to explaining why this is the case as they are in a rush to parody the Trump-era zeitgeist.Then there are the plotholes. A jaded and retired comrade of Picard's suddenly in comand of an amarda? Sure. Someone killing their ex-lover and an episode later it doesn't seem like a big deal? OK. Someone joining the Borg Collective and then leaving after literally 5 minutes like it's no a big deal? Yeah why not. Suddenly trusting a guy who you suspect of murder? Yeah I'm on board. I could go on. The writers do not know how to go from A to B and as a result we are given storytelling that is simply bad.The pacing of the storytelling is a major flaw. This is painfully slow Star Trek and it feels like 10 minutes of storytelling has been stretched to fill a 35-50 minute episode. By Episode 6 it felt like enough ground had been covered to fill 20 minutes of a single TNG episode.Then there are the deaths of known characters. None of them were done in a way that meant anything for the furtherance of the plot, other than to give other characters a reason to cry. None of these deaths felt like they offered to raise the stakes or offered any increased jeopardy. As a viewer I felt repeatedly short-changed.The only hope for ST Picard is that like the TNG it simply improves after its first season. However season one has given me no reason to stay watching.",

            "content": "The Good= At last a Post Star Trek Nemesis Project that I actually liked when it comes to Star Trek Projects (Duh). Because to be Perfectly Honest every Star Trek Project that came out after Nemesis it's not all that good in my personal opinion. And hare's my mini reviews for each. Star Trek (2007) at the time I was totally confused because JJ Abrams the creator of the Chris Pine Star Trek Films, said that it's supposed to take place in an Alternate Timeline but not Huh? Aside from that it just felt a little too much like Star Wars to me. And I've already made a Review in hare for Star Trek Into The Darkness or as I like to call it Star Trek II The Wrath Of Khan Remake. And as for Star Trek Beyond I think it's the Best out of this Trilogy of Films. And even then it's really largely forgettable but enjoyed the closing scene. Then as for Star Trek Lower Decks, it feels a little too much like Family Guy or Futurama but with a Star Trek Skin. And I already made a Review in hare for Star Trek Discovery right hare on IMDB. And as for Star Trek Prodigy, quit simply way too childish for my tastes. And Finally as for Star Trek Strange New Worlds to be honest I completely lost interest in it after the Third Episode. And aside from that one character the one that kind of looks like a punk, feels more like a Fan doing one of those Fan Experience at a Star Trek and or Sci Fi Convention, than an actual character.Anyways back to Star Trek Picard I really think the Show stared Strong and Deferent from your usual Hares The Starship for the Show and Hare's all of the Characters for the show now let's go on adventures type of Star Trek Show. Instead it tells a cohesive story for each season. I like how in the First Season it shows that not everything was all Hunky Dory like you might expect it to, and it was also nice to see two actors from my all time favourite Star Trek Show Star Trek Voyager. Show up and even better one of them was a main character in Picard like they was on Star Trek Voyager.Then there is that Season One Finally wow that was not only crushing to me Personally but, more importantly I thought it was a great conclusion to a Certain Character. And moving on to Season Two I admit not all of the points hit but I found it more often than not it was a well rounded season. Even thou I'm not happy with the whole season being basically Back To The Future. But in either case just like with the First Season the Season Finally for Season Two was also Pretty Solid in my opinion. And unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should do it for the Positives.The Bad= Most of my Problems Lay in the still going Third Season Currently. At Point Of Review. To start off I feel that the Trailer lied a little as to regards of getting some scenes in the light. And so far I just feel that the First Three Episodes of the Final Season ONLY had Scenes in the Dark. So Dark in fact I've just simply given up due to. Me having some Game Of Thrones Final Season flashbacks.Next is I feel that the USS Titan is way too Durable, I mean a wreckage of an another ship was literally hurled right at them. And on top of that the USS Titan was constantly under attack since the Second Episode of the Season, by another Ship that was Stronger and I think More Advanced than the USS Titan. And of course it goes with out saying they never got the chance to retreat nor hold a proper meet to see if they could come up some kind strategy and maybe repair the ship before going in for the next round. And not only that some one on Board even tried blow the Ship to High Heavens. Although the Bomb did go off but the Ship was not only fine but also still in one piece. And keep in mind that was a relatively large Explosion.And I really didn't like the direction that they took Raffi for this final season of Picard. And speaking of Raffi I'm really disappointed that they did not at least that I know of capitalized on her and 7 Of 9's Friendship from Season Two. And as for the 'Big Bad' for this season she's so hidden for most of the time I just simply don't care her nor about the big mystery which also doubles as this final season's story. I'm mean I didn't even care about the Star Trek TNG Characters that I'm used to and in a way grew up watching from of course Star Trek The Next Generation (TNG) nor about there relationships with one another on Picard. And if you can't even do that in my opinion you've Failed Miserably. And Lastly all of the Original characters from the First Two Seasons of Picard seems to have disappeared with out even a mention. Aside from of course Raffi. And unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should do it.Final Thoughts= As far as Shorts go for The Physical Release of the First Season of Star Trek Picard. I love I thought it was touching even though it was maybe a Fifteen Minute or so short, they really make you feel something for each of the two characters in that short, and by the I don't know the title of it. The only thing I wished they gave was a little bit more back story for both of those two kids in the short, in terms of their past with one another.",

They showed in TNG and Voyager that individuality weakened the Borg (Hugh, Lore as leader of a group of Borg), Borg don't ignore individual traits, they integrate them and spread them in the collective. And then the Queen was introduced, a Borg you can negotiate with and trick. And she is a single Borg who, if killed, weakens the whole collective.

The plot doesn't make sense, is Star Trek even profitable anymore? This whole series inspired me to look back at the old show and see if it was this confused in its tone. It wasn't.I don't think I have even a little perspective into Picard through this series, wasn't he like a reserved politician guy? Does this whole show base its poor character writing based on the pretense that characters change during the time off-camera? Also, from what I saw that dude didn't seem like an idiot, what happened?Besides, wasn't Star Trek about exploration and stuff? They spend the first few episodes on earth and it's revealed it sucks. Like, that's cool and all but the length of time they spend on earth is way drawn out and there is like no variation on the locations.The characters never act the same and the choices they make are just excuses to make action things happen. Maybe that's appealing to some people who want to tune out and watch some dumb action but I'm good.This show leaves me with only question and try's to tell you a lot through dialogue but all it did for me was make me actively hate whichever character was spouting it. In conclusion, if you know you don't care about character motivation, fundamental flaws, lapses in logic, and a character mishandled almost as much as my future, you'll love this series.

TL;DR: It's bad when you don't look forward to the next season.Pros\nPicard is trying I believe, moreso in 7 and 10. But the character needs to be written better.Supporting cast is stronger at this point already than Discovery, which is not saying much.Episodes 7,9 and 10 are the strongest and tie up loose story ends, not well but ok-ish enough. (only a couple story ends, there are still many questions and some plot lines were just dropped)Cons\n-Alex Kurtzman and the other top 3 producers made a non-family friendly Star Trek-CBS PLEASE REPLACE THEM\n--cussing - F word pretty much every episode (WHY)\n--decapitation\n--gory violence\n--quickly killing off beloved characters\n--depressing often BLEAK\n--No star trek fan want's this!Summary:\nCBS please pick a different showrunner who respects Star Trek as everyone else does.\nWE WANT REGUALR HOPEFUL STAR TREK IN EPISODIC FORM\nLIKE TOS/TNG/VOY/DS9/ENT",

I love the main Star Trek movies and series (no deep space 9 crap or those types) and find this new series quite entertaining. It wouldn't be Star Trek if you didn't occasionally wish they didn't say or do something (and when did we bring back swearing and smoking?) but cmon Patrick Stewart is unreal and this is a well developed series. I've talked to friends who also love it and in a time of binge watching kind of wish I could watch multiple episodes but I admit I do look forward to next week like I did the xfiles. Thanks for getting this series and the cast back together I think it's great! And whoever posted about the fake 10s which I gave the show I hope that didn't happen. It delegitimizes my 10! Really bad if true but I don't rate much and I enjoy the show.",

            "content": "It seems like a lot of people think the creators are doing their damnedest to destroy the legacy of star trek as a whole, and I just can't agree with that. People don't usually set out to make something bad or mediocre.I myself am not a fan of neither Voyager or Enterprise, but I can appreciate what they were trying to do.Like with Discovery, the team trying something new, and it's not working. Not for me, and not for a whole lot of the audience. I do commend them for trying, and I think it's unnecessary to attack them over it.That being said, I find that a lot of the characters aren't fleshed out enough, and the writing isn't always great. Romantic relationships just kind of manifest out of nowhere, and motivations change on a whim. There's an exploration of past trauma that I find to be presented very oddly, and doesn't have the resonance I think the writers were hoping for.There's also the inclusion of some humor that, for me at least, falls really flat.The music and a lot of the camera work is great, and the actors are really giving it their all.Patrick Stewart's age reveals itself whenever there's an action scene (and there are many). The man is 80 years old and surrounded by a bunch of actors under 60, so this isn't surprising.But when they let him stand still or sit down, or walk at a normal pace, his monologues and dialogues capture your attention and holds onto it. He is, as he always has been, an acting powerhouse, and I'm really sad that I'll probably never get to see him on stage.I heard rumors that originally, this show was gonna be Picard living at the vineyard with his dog, and solving petty squabbles in the local community.I would have much preferred that version, and I know I'm not alone in that.Give the show a chance if you love Trek, but if you're anything like me, you'll be sticking around for Stewart.",

The characters of Picard and Seven of 9 look the same but that's the only similarity. It's like they died and came back from Pet Semetary. The writing is terrible and predictable and where it's not predictable it's just dumb. Forced.Please fire Kurtzman!! He just does not get Star Trek at all and he's killing a legacy for me.",

Why do we need everything gloomy. I know there's an energy crisis but couldn't they afford a few lighting rigs?Finally, in season 3, episode 4 power is running out, they're making savings by getting crew to congregate in common areas and yet Picard takes his don into the holodeck. Really?It's worth watching just to see Jeri Ryan.",
