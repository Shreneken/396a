Plenty of metaphor and allegory to sink your canines into but just as easily taken as a genuinely honest tale of right over wrong, good conquering evil and the perpetual endurance of love, truth and nature.",

            "content": "Wolfwalkers is a 2020 Irish animated film and tells the story of an english hunter(Sean Bean) and his daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey from A Christmas Prince) who traveled to Kilkenny in Ireland from England and they are set to kill the last of the wolf pack as they are wolfwalkers. However Robyn befriends a young girl named Maeve(Eva Whittaker)who transforms into a wolf and bites Robyn who also turns into a wolf. Will Robyn protect Maeve and her clan?. The animation is gorgeous, the story is very good and the story was also very good even though we have seen this type of story before e.g. Pocahontas,Brave,How To Train Your Dragon.Overall I loved this film as I have a friend who begged me to see this film and I finally got to see it before it was released in December.If you love Brave and How To Train Your Dragon then you are gonna love this.\nTommy Tiernan as voices a charcther.Let's hope this will get a nod at the Golden Globes and Oscar's 2021.",

While the story doesn't showcase anything we haven't seen before, the movie does deliver it in a way that feels wholly fresh and original. There are beautiful messages of unity, kindness towards animals, and a gentle push for people to look outside their own comfort zone in order to see the world differently. It's an enjoyable and visually distinct experience from beginning to end.",

            "review_title": "No Words to Describe How Beautiful This Is",
            "content": "\"The woods is getting smaller everyday.\"I can guarantee it right now, this will be the most underrated animated film of the year, or even in the past decade or so. With big name films that Disney produces, it's hard to remember there are other studios making animated films just as great or even better. Wolfwalkers falls under this category. Like the other films from this studio, it focuses of Irish tales and folklore. Song of the Sea amazed me when I watched it only a couple years ago. Wolfwalkers is just as amazing and some may even say better than Song of the Sea. I'm not apart of that group but it's a really close call. The animation is the first thing that caught my eye. This is the most beautifully animated film in years. The autumn colors look beautiful on screen. And with the style they use has so much details. And I loved looking at the patterns within. I'm not the person to talk to about animation since I'm no artist, but all I can say is that it is just stunning.The story feels sort of familiar in ways, but is done well. The predictability factor, typically in animated films aimed for children, isn't too strong. But I wouldn't even go to it being aimed towards children. As lore, I feel that this is for everybody. I felt engaged the whole time. There's always something exciting or interesting happening on screen. The characterization isn't as strong for everyone, more towards the main antagonist, but by the end you feel connected with these characters. The voice acting is all good. The two main characters couldn't have been better voice-casted (if that's a word). Overall I'm just thoroughly pleased with this film. I don't know how to describe everything else without giving anything away, but all I can say is this should be a must watch for everyone this year. It'll be on AppleTV+ later this year I believe so check it out if you can.",

            "review_title": "WOLFWALKERS is 2D animation at its best. One of the best films of the year.",
            "content": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always been a tremendous fan of animation. If there's one comment I deeply despise is the \"animated films are for children\". This preconceived notion is extremely dated, and honestly, quite childish. I don't even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world, and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by. The whole \"you watch cartoons, you're a baby\" bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decades-old. However, I still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation can't have the same emotional impact than live-action, especially when a major studio like Pixar is known for making the most grown-up of adults cry like an infant.In addition to this, some viewers think that the latter studio owned by Disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when they've been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people. One of my favorite animated films of all-time is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stop-motion animation work from Laika, the studio that also created Missing Link and Coraline. Cartoon Saloon is emerging as an awards-contender studio, by releasing movies such as Song of the Sea, The Breadwinner, and now Wolfwalkers. The main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation: the \"old\" 2D animation that 90s kids like me grew up with.That's precisely where I'm starting this review. Wolfwalkers' 2D animation proves once again that this style will never become \"dated\" or \"less than\" the current 3D design. Don't be mistaken, I love both styles! I'm not part of the whole 2D vs 3D discourse simply because I firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations. 2D animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists, but it's more limited than 3D when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world. However, the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3D animated flick visually feels and looks the same.So, there's no good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse when it comes to animation. I can offer dozens of examples of exceptional, gorgeous-looking, utterly superb animated flicks from both styles, as well as awful, corporate-like films that I try my hardest to forget (looking at you, The Emoji Movie). Fortunately, Wolfwalkers belongs to the first group. Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect. Will Collins' screenplay isn't particularly new or innovative though. It follows a somewhat generic, predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away.However, it's a formula that, if executed properly, still delivers a rich, passionate, captivating narrative, which will always please both children and adults. Just from the premise, it's pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as \"don't judge people by their cover\" or \"our wants can steal someone else's needs\", and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations. Obviously, having in mind one of these \"societies\" is a pack of wolves, there's also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting, leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction. All of these themes are handled brilliantly, and it never feels preachy.It doesn't matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when I feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as I did. Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker, as Robyn Goodfellowe and Mebh \u00d3g MacT\u00edre respectively, display phenomenal voice work, which is then elevated by the stunning, expressive, award-worthy animation. Sean Bean is also terrific as Bill Goodfellowe, Robyn's father, who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging, understanding, and accepting an entirely different culture and its people (in this case, animals). Every character is incredibly well-written as are all dialogues, surrounded by a Celtic-inspired atmosphere, myths, and obviously, music.Bruno Coulais and folk group K\u00edla developed the movie's original score, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020, including one of my favorite original songs (\"Running with the Wolves\") in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year. \"Favorite\" is definitely the right one-word description of how I feel about Wolfwalkers. It's one of those films I can't really point out a single flaw. Massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2D world. Their work is often unappreciated and underrated (besides being underpaid), so I want to offer Cartoon Saloon my biggest thank you, and keep making excellent cinema.I have no doubts: Wolfwalkers is, by far and so far, the best animated feature-film I've seen all year. I know the big gun from Pixar is coming up (Soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart's beautifully heartwarming Celtic-inspired tale. Cartoon Saloon continues to prove that 2D animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. Despite Will Collins's generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. Outstanding voice work from Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. However, it's Bruno Coulais and K\u00edla's original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. One of my favorite films of the year, I'd be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn't end on my Top10. Watch it with your family. It's worth it.Rating: A",

            "content": "This film was by far the best of this Celtic Irish trilogy and I truly hope that the pandemic and lack of box office numbers doesn't hurt it too badly. If you have not seen this film, go watch it. Get a free month of apple TV or something in order to support this film and its studio. They deserve it. If you Like pixar's films like UP, Soul, WALL-E, or Inside-Out, then you will love this film.\nThe pacing is slow but easily builds into a fantastic climax. The acting and emotion behind the writing is absolutely stellar and I found myself laughing and tearing up many times during the watch. The animation is just so expressive and what you'd want to see if you thought of traditional animation at its best that 3D just can't match. The music is perfectly placed and evokes the best of the emotions.\nI'm giving it a perfect because if it got what it deserves, it would be an acclaimed masterpiece akin to Disney's renaissance films. Unfortunately with the Apple pay wall and the pandemic keeping people out of theaters I don't know if it will. I really hope this studio continues to do great things like this in the future",

            "content": "After viewing the interesting Josep (2020-also reviewed) I decided to look at the other two feature film titles in the Manchester Animation Festival line-up. Having really enjoyed Song of the Sea (2014-also reviewed) I was excited to see a stream of the latest film by the studio taking place,with a question and answer interview with the makers afterwards,leading to me walking with the wolves.View on the film:Revealing during the in-depth Q&A after the screening that they had started working on the film seven years ago, the level of care co-writers/(with Jericca Cleland and Will Collins) co-directors Tomm Moore & Ross Stewart placed into the production,leads to a magical creation.Mentioning in the Q & A that Robyn was a boy in early drafts of the script, the change to Robyn being a girl by the writers, allows for intense drama from Robyn having to break through the barricades placed in front of her by the ruthless Lord Protector and her dad Bill,along with a emphasis on the fairy/folk tale aspect,of little red Robyn going deep into the mysterious woodland filled with wolves.Pointing out in the Q & A that they originally openly named the baddie Oliver Cromwell, the writers alteration to him being the \"Lord Protector\" (with English flags prominent in the background of shots) gives the villain a towering folk lore/ fairy tale menacing presence,who shoves away any who disagree,and confronts Robyn as a huge obstacle she must overcome to save the last wolves.Going to Ireland to kill the animal of the former Stark family symbol, Sean Bean gives a excellent turn as Bill,whose voice weighs heavy on daughter Robyn's pleas for him to help save the wolves, but is unable to shake a sense of duty towards the snarling Lord Protector.Walking into the wild woods to the lush chimes of Bruno Coulais's score and the whispering vocals of Folk group Kila, directors Moore and Stewart meet the wolves with mesmerising, shimmering pastel colour giving the hand-drawn animation the texture of having come straight from the pages of a old fairy/folk tale book.Detailing in the Q & A the inspection they got from 17th century wood carvings, the directors carve a eye-catching rustic, rough-edge stylised appearance, which gives Lord Protector pointed tough edges,as Robyn walks with the wolves.",

I enjoyed it maybe slightly less than I hoped I would be it was still really good.The art style is really gorgeous, it reminds me of like a children's story book which works so well with this story because it seems like it is an old Irish fairytale.I think the story is cute too, the dialogue not so much but it doesn't hinder it too much.The worst part is the voice acting and sound mixing. They are both off. The talking is too quiet at times so you struggle to hear what is going on because there are booming sound effects or a score for it to compete with. The line reading isn't great either, not for all but for some. I actually thing the person voicing Mebh is fantastic.It is definitely worth a watch especially if you already have apple +",

            "review_title": "Wolfwalkers",
            "content": "Wolfwalkers is a stunningly beautiful animation. With its striking art style and touching story, it's also a wonderfully good movie. The fact that I hesitated to watch it honestly makes me a little upset. It positively surprised me in pretty much every way possible.Films made in the style of Wolfwalkers are mostly unknown to me. When I first saw screenshots of the film, the art style did turn me off a little bit. And although I heard nothing but good things about it, I still felt unsure about how much I would like the way the film looks. Alas, I had no reason to worry. While it did take me a moment to get used to it and stop thinking about it, as soon as I fell into the story, I started to appreciate the striking style. And while it's striking, it's also tremendously beautiful. Especially the scenes in the forest, where a big part of the movie takes place, are simply stunning.The story, which introduces us to Robyn, a girl who dreams of becoming a wolfhunter, like his dad, is full of moments of conflict and beauty. Robyn, who ends up being bitten by a wolf, soon learns that some fairytales might be more real than others. And when she finds new friends, the dream of being a hunter quickly fades away, as she must defend them from a life-threatening threat. While the story might not be filled with twists and turns and is for the most part easily predictable, it's also beautiful and emotional. Indeed, it's the kind of story that works better when it can be predicted. Being able to focus on what the movie had to say, and how it said it, was much more impactful than worrying about what was going to happen next. It's also a surprisingly deep story, with nearly all characters facing dilemmas and having to fight against preconceived ideas.In many ways, I think that Wolfwalkers has been the most surprising film of 2020, at least for me. Going in, I had no idea what to expect, and in all honesty, my own preconceived ideas might've caused me to doubt its greatness. To say that I was positively surprised, would be an enormous understatement. The film captured my attention with its stunning visuals and kept it with a beautiful and heartfelt story. Wolfwalkers is, without a doubt, the best animated film of the year.",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nIf you love all-things-Irish, Renaissance festivals, as well as Studio Ghibli, this Apple Original film looks and feels like a lovely combination of all of those things. Add the voice of Sean Bean. Yes, please! This magical animation is from the Academy Award-nominated makers of The Secret of Kells AND Song of the Sea and based on Irish folklore. It was directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, becoming the first animated feature to be nominated for \"Best International Feature\" at the Gotham Awards. The film is dedicated to Mark Stewart, who passed away this year. Cartoon Saloon continues to pump out beautiful animation films that are pretty close to visual masterpieces.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis is a perfect family-friendly film that all ages can enjoy.\nWolves attack people. People attack wolves.\nYou might need to talk to young children about magic and imagination.THEMES:\nFriendship\nCourage\nTolerance\nHumans vs. nature\nFamily\nFemale empowerment\nThe creators of the film explained that colonialism was the real villain in the story in that it separated protagonists from nature.THINGS I LIKED:\nThe concept art is absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. It's refreshing to see two-dimensional and under-appreciated hand-drawn animation. The colors and geometric shapes are extremely enchanting, making each frame a piece of art to be studied. One of my sons is a 3D animation artist at Blizzard and he has taught me to really appreciate the mastery of hand-drawn animation.\nYou really get a sense of Ireland in the 1600s\nYou can almost feel how damp the green forest is in animation.\nVisually, the movie also illustrates the cage women of that day might have felt they were in. There are lots of angles and big black lines that represent society's rules that trapped Robyn, the young heroin in the story.\nHonor Kneafsey voices the enthusiastic Robyn Goodfellowe and does a fantastic job.Eva Whittaker lends her spunky voice to Mdbh Og MacTire.\nThe humor is both visual and spoken.\nThe British and Irish accents of the characters are super cute.\nIf you love the artistry in this film, you might also want to check out:\nThe story features the stark contrast between the magic of nature and that of the Lord Protector's rigid religious fervor. The film's creators explained that the type of Puritan religion that Lord Cromwell brought to Christianity emphasized man over nature, instead of a balance between the two: domination vs. submission. Whenever the story spotlights what's happening in the forest, the colors are light and green; to show the duality of thinking at the time, the city scenes feature grey tones in the color palette.\nClever framing devices.\nThe film knows when to be silent to let the audience bask in the beauty.\nI loved the scene that shows Mebh Og practically melting on Robyn's lap while she gets her hair brushed by her new human friend. So sweet.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe father shows warmth to his daughter but he never listens to her.\nI hate it when religious people in movies are shown as truly terrible people.INTERESTING LINES:\n\"Work is prayer, girl.\" - Head Housekeeper (Nora Twomey)\n\"I prayed the whole Bible.\" - Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey)\n\"We must do what we're told.\" - Bill (Sean Bean) \"Why? - Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) \"I'm afraid.\" - Bill (Sean Bean)You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website.",

            "content": "Well I'm long overdue for another review, however there wasn't any animated films for me to talk to because of well.., you know what, except for this..., this is one of my most highly anticipated films of this year!, this is the latest film from Cartoon Saloon and it's directed by Tomm Moore who did Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea and produced Breadwinner all of which I really liked with Song of the Sea being my personal favourite, so I was beyond excited to hear this was coming out this year, i didn't even know it was coming out until I found out it was coming to Apple TV, I remember there was a concept trailer for it and it looked really cool, because as we know Cartoon Saloon's films are based on Irish Folklore or something like that, it's coming to Apple TV in two months, however it was actually out in my local cinema, I heard so many amazing things about this film, it was played at film festivals and it was almost like one of the most talked about films of this year, so of course I would jump to the chance of seeing it!, so I saw it yesterday pre Lockdown (second time) in a sort of empty screwing and...., wow!, this might be my favourite film of the year, I'm not even joking, so let's talk about it.In 1650, a hunter named Bill Goodfellowe (Sean Bean) and his daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) move from England to this small Irish town in need of hunting some wolves, however Bill is just needed while his daughter stays in the village so she is safe from them, however she wants to help his father kill the wolves, so she sneaks out of the town and happens to come across a wolfwalker named Mebh (Eva Whittaker), who can transform into a Wolf when she is a sleep, Robyn then quickly grows fond of her and they both start a bond, as friends, however as the Lord Protector (Simon McBurney) is trying to get rid of all wolves to protect his town, so Robyn has to convince his father that Wolfwalkers are real and must do what she can to save her friend and the wolves, first off I love the idea of the folklore of Wolves and how someone who is bitten by one can transform into a Wolf, it's quite a unique idea and the storytelling is at it's finest, it tells the story in a unique and wonderful way using visuals to tell it stories along with strong emotion and action that define the characters and the world around them, it's also balances out sweet charming humour with real and powerful emotion and by the third act it really drives the emotion home, it's also really creative in how Wolfwalkers work, there are so many enchanting and fun scenes where characters are running free as Wolves, it's really beautiful and just lovely, granted it can be rather predictable, however it's actually not too cliched, you just want to see how it ends and the film really does pay off and does have a very satisfying ending, it's also quite grim and dark also, there are scenes where characters get shot by arrows via crossbow and the impact and the scenery really ramps up the dark factor in making it real and shocking, it's also a very mature animated film which is kind of rare since nowadays it's toilet and reference humour, but this time the humour is very playful and quite charming and it feels nature then forced, so the storytelling, the directing and the nature feel to it really makes the film feel more genuine and real despite being animated and having fantasy elements to it, it's perfect storytelling mixed with nice humour and strong emotion, especially Robyn and Mebh's friendship, the story feels like a strong pack.The animation is just unbelievable, I knew this company was capable of making stunning 2D animated films, but this takes it to a whole new level, this is unlike anything I have ever seen, first off It's great to see 2D animation on the big screen, it's very cool and such a huge experience for me especially since we mainly have 3D and stop-motion animation, with that said this is some of the most original and unique 2D animation I have seen in a very long time, I love the way this films looks, the characters are all nicely design with unique facial expressions, shapes and movements, the backgrounds are atmospherically gorgeous with smooth shading and outlines, I also love the way the forest and the town is structured, it's like a painting or a puzzle it's really outstanding, however my favourite aspect of the animation is the Wolfwalker part, the wolves are wonderfully designed especially Mebh and Robyn, there is sense (no pun intended) of you can tell it's them by their eye colour and even their fur colour kind of represents who they are, there are scenes where we would see the world from a Wolfwalker's point of view, where we would see lots of outlines of trees and animals but a lot of them are in all sorts of different vibrant colours, it's really something to behold, we may have seen 2D animation in many beautiful and unique ways, but the animation here unleashed it's full potential.The characters are loveable and well defined, they are all very believable and just a joy to watch!, Robyn is quite a endearing main character, she is adventurous, curious, cheeky and really sweet, I really enjoyed her and especially when you can really sympathise with her, at times when the film gets emotion you really do feel sorry for her since she is trying to convince Bill that Wolfwalkers exist, speaking of which, Bill is probably one of the best animated dads out there, he is really charming, caring and a very relatable dad also, his relationship with Robyn is both lovely and heartbreaking, Mebh is also a really endearing and great character, her friendship with Robyn is quite cute and heartwarming, she is full of energy but also has a emotional side to her, when both Robyn and Mebh turn into wolves it's really enchanting and very cute to see them both run free in the woods, there are other characters like the bullies, the soldiers, the one who saw Mebh and her mother turn into a Wolfwalker and even the wolves themselves play a supporting role, although the wolves play a big part in the film, the rest are just stereotypes but they do make sense and do play a small key role in what they are supposed to be even if it's not major, however the villain of the film is the Lord Professor, he's the one who wants to kill all the wolves in the name of the lord, while not a strong villain, he is rather understandable as to why he wants to get rid of them, he's not really that much of a big bad, just a leader trying to protect his town from beasts and threats, as for the voice acting, it's.... really fantastic, they are play their parts rather naturally and put in so much emotion which is very good in my book, Sean Bean voices Bill and he is great as always so no complaints there, Honor Kneafsey as Robyn is brilliant, she really sounds like she was really enjoying voicing and you can tell she is put in so much emotion in her performance, same can be said with Eva Whittaker as Mebh, she really puts in lots of energy and enthusiasm as well, Simon McBurney is pretty good, in fact everyone does a fantastic job with their voice performances even if they don't play a big role, the characters really have that feel of genuineness and realism, along with playful humour, heart and understandable motives, along with phenomenal voice acting, the characters are really pawesome!..., I had to.On a side note, the music used in this film really captures that Irish feel and sound to it, the score is genuinely wonderful, it's composed by the amazing Bruno Coulais and he really outdid himself here, it's one score I really want to listen to when the soundtrack comes out, along with very fitting songs including the very popular \"Running with the Wolves\" song by Aurora which is a really good song by the way!What else can I say that hasn't been said already?, this film is.... just unbelievable, it's unlike anything I have ever seen, from the huge responses it's getting from critics and audiences along with some great ratings!..., I am comfortable to say that this film is a masterpiece!, Wolfwalkers is not only my favourite film from Cartoon Saloon, but it might be the best animated film and film in general of this year!, it has an amazingly well told story with a creative concept, it's really grim and dark, it has good heart and sweet humour, along with epic action and a intense third act, animation that is mindbogglingly gorgeous and stylish, characters who are mature and well written, along with terrific voice acting and lovely music!, it's just fantastic, if you are a fan of the studio, go check it out if you can, as for everyone else, I do highly recommend it, please try and see before it leaves cinemas, it's out for a limited time or wait until it's on Apple TV, it's a must see for all ages know I'll be watching it again, this studio has impressed me before but now..., this is their magnum opus, I hope they continue to make more films like this, because not many people see them which is a shame really but I'm glad I saw this one as soon as I can, as rubbish as the year was, at least we got something incredible to hopefully finish off the year (Until Soul comes out that is).This film one hundred percent deserves a 10/10!",

            "content": "On the plus side: It's much better than previous Saloon films. Visually it still opts for the distinct illustrative style they are known for, but the pacing and storytelling is more dynamic this time around. It's faster, punchier, more aggressive than Song of the Sea and the animation in the wolf running sequences is spell-binding. The emotional moments resonate well without feeling too mawkish and the invigorating score by Kila is a joy. There are problems though.The plot of the hero befriending the noble savage and teaming up to defeat invading forces has certainly been visited many times before (Dances With Wolves, Ferngully, Pocahontas, Princess Mononoke, Avatar) and Wolfwalkers doesn't really do anything new with it.\nThe heroine, Robyn, daughter of a British trap hunter tasked with wiping out wolves from a surrounding forest in Kilkenny, wants desperately to escape the shackles of domestic life. While exploring the forest, she runs into Mebh, a wild untamed wolfwalker who can magically commune with wolves, and discovers the freedom, magic and beauty therein. Robyn must try to convince her father to disobey his orders and save Mebh and the forest from destruction. From that synopsis alone, it's easy to imagine how those story arcs play out, if you've seen the other films I mentioned. At times sequences look and feel like they've been lifted directly from these sources and dropped into a different art style. Clich\u00e9 messages about embracing the animal within abound.Characters are depicted as one-dimensional stereotypes, particularly the invading Brits and the main villain, Lord Protector, a bland copy of Disney's Governor Ratcliff and Judge Frollo, who tries to tame this pagan-Celtic world one bible quote at a time. Princess Mononoke managed to be more ambiguous as to where the good and bad lies across the opposing factions, which made for a more engaging film, in my view. Wolfwalkers, however, seems to be aimed at a much younger audience and is thus played very straight.\nThe Irish peasants are all represented as feeble-minded bog-dwellers, which I found surprising coming from an Irish studio. It seemed like they wanted to play up the Paddywhackery for laughs, but I found all the \"ahh to be sure\" gags more eye-roll worthy than funny, if I'm honest.Another nitpicky issue for me was the voice acting. It was disappointingly flat and amateurish in a few places and lacked real drama. I'm not sure if all the actors were recorded together or separately, but their voices sometimes didn't sound like they were in the moment or really reacting to one another.Gripes aside, this was an entertaining watch and easily the best animated feature to come out of Ireland in a long time.",

Her father Bill, voiced by Sean Bean, is tasked with trying to root out the wolves in the forest surrounding the town. Robyn hopes to be a skilled hunter like her father, imitating him with her own cross bow and pet falcon Merlin.This film takes place during a time of war and occupation, Robyn's father working under the tyrannical Lord Protector Cromwell, voiced by Simon McBurney. The Lord Proctor is trying to quell other Irish rebellions and keep the populace subdued. This puts pressure on Bill to quickly take care of the wolf problem, or face dire consequences.Soon Robyn comes into contact with the infamous wolfwalkers, lead by another girl Mebh. Robyn learns that the wolfwalkers are not as bad as she has been led to believe and has to come to terms with this conflict between wanting to be like her hunter father, and protecting the humanity of the wolves and wolfwalker.Cartoon Saloon's style of hand drawn animation is some of the most beautiful I've seen. Every frame has intricate, meticulous details that make their films a unique visual delight to behold. This film has numerous cinematic shots and sequences that push the boundaries of what can be done in the medium.Overall this is an excellent film, on par with their other brilliant feature length animated films The Breadwinner and Song of the Sea. I would strongly recommend anyone give this film a watch.9/10.",

            "content": "I'll just start by saying Song of the Sea was a flash of brilliance. So maybe it's unfair to compare this movie to it. If you are expecting similar quality you may be disappointed. The story follows the same tired trope that so many, many, many movies seem to be unable to avoid when it comes to introducing mythical creatures. Mythical creature exists. A human (or small group of humans) discovers it. The whole world is against the creature and it's up to this person to save this creature from being destroyed by the world (E.T., Pete's Dragon, Water Horse, Super 8, Earth to Echo, Bumblebee, Home, just to name a few). Truthfully I feel this story, even if it wasn't overused, does a disservice to the creatures being introduced. We are so focused on how these creatures don't mix with humans that we can't simply be drawn into the whimsy and fantasy of a mythology. And unfortunately there is precious little to learn about this mythology. The Wolfwalkers are basically werewolves who can heal people and control wolves. That's it. We know that the main Wolfwalker Mebh lives with her mother and a pack of wolves in the forest, but we never find out anything about where the Wolfwalkers come from or what they do besides running around with wolves in the forest and healing the occasional person or creature that gets hurt. But enough about the Wolfwalkers. Let's talk about the rest of the characters. Robin, our heroine, is the stereotypical tomboy stuck in the wrong time period who just wants to hunt wolves with her father instead of scrubbing floors and dusting walls all day. In further stereotypical fashion her father doesn't understand her and frequently refuses to listen to her. They live in a town ruled by the lord protector who is basically the Claude Frollo for wolves. Why does he hate wolves so much? A question for another movie. He also protects his city with gates containing holes large enough for wolves to fit through but that's also another question for another movie. Without going into great details about the plot, overall I was underwhelmed with the cast and how they were developed throughout the film. The plot was almost entirely predictable. The animation itself was decent. Again, maybe not fair to compare it to Song of the Sea, but it wasn't in my opinion, nearly as striking or interesting. Probably my favorite aspect of the film was the score. It was beautiful and I will go back and listen to it again. Overall, a passably entertaining film but not one I will likely bother to watch another time.",

            "review_title": "Elegant Epic based on Irish Fairy Tales",
            "content": "Acclaimed Irish studio Cartoon Saloon has been one of the most revolutionary animation houses across the globe. Not only have their films grown in critical and audience favorability, but the artistic achievements they've utilized through Irish folklore and complex fantasy tales (besides The Breadwinner) are worthy of rivaling the competition. So it's no surprise that their most recent effort Wolfwalkers, directed by studio co-founder Tom Moore and Secret of Kells art director Ross Stewart, has been getting rave responses since its promotion on Apple TV. And having finally seen it, I can safely say that the praise is thoroughly deserved.Set in mid 17th century Ireland, a young girl named Robyn Goodfellowe lives in the secluded town of Kilkenney with her father, who hunts the town's enemy of wolves. Upon confronting a mysterious creature in the wolfpack named Mebh, Robyn sets out to protect the pack from the antagonistic general, Oliver Cromwell. From a premise like that, one would expect somewhat of an environmental themed flick, but Wolfwalkers has so much more to offer than just its message of preserving nature instead of harming it for one's own development. As the film is a character driven piece dissecting the mythos of wolfwalkers, who are mainly fantasy-esque versions of people in the nighttime who have been bitten by wolves, the strongest element of the film is the obstacle Robyn faces in trying to save Mebh and the wolfpack despite the severely strict orders Cromwell elicates on the Kilkenney natives, let alone her father. In many ways, the film shows the positive and negative aspects about trying to protect one species yet also having to preserve your original human form.Beyond the complex storyline, the tone of the movie is a good balance of light hearted childlike whimsy and foreboding dark stakes. The scenes showcasing Robyn around the townspeople, among Mebh and her wolf pack, are appropriately charming and fun to watch, as if we're experiencing what it was once like to be as wild and free as a child. But then, whenever there are serious consequences Robyn has to face from Cromwell or her father, the film can go from mildly heartbreaking to intensely devastating. Any guessing of what could happen to Robyn, Mebh or even her father is completely unpredictable, and the film always knows how to keep the suspense rising so that the audience can feel up to the edge of their seats. If there's only one slight criticism to give the film, and even then it's more of a question than a complaint, it's that the ending is concise but also a little too short. While it does wrap the film up very well, it might have been a little more satisfying to see a slightly longer conclusion to the Goodfellowe's epic tale. But then again, less is more, so all's well that ends well.Out of all the films Cartoon Saloon has produced, this one might be their most stylized and technologically advanced one to date. In addition to the characters having ancient Galic designs to make them look more visually distinctive from real humans, their movements are precisely smooth and crisp while still keeping their general acting as clear as possible. Beyond that, the backgrounds are gorgeously detailed with so much emphasis on the cultural reference in old Irish tales, and the effects work is breathtaking, especially when it comes to the wolf running sequences. It's even great when the film uses its minimal yet strong color palettes and layouts to let a specific shot speak for itself. Also, not only does the voice acting feel so real and authentic to both the time period and the character's emotions, but the music score by Bruno Coulais and Kila adds in to the quaint albeit dynamic atmosphere of the feature. You almost never get the same type of cultural and artistic experience out of movies like this, so it's amazing when filmmakers allow audiences to indulge in their worlds as much as they can.So in short, Wolfwalkers is an elegant fairy tale of a feature with many complex philosophies, engaging characters, breathtaking visuals and music and stellar acting to go along with it. If you're yet to check out this marvelous gem of a film, by all means do so whenever you can. In a day and age where streaming services are slowly but surely releasing unique content that you don't get from the mainstream anymore, films like I Lost my Body, If Anything Happens I Love You and Wolfwalkers are prime examples as how the art of animated filmmaking are just as strong as it's always been, if not more.",

Seriously, I do not know where to begin. The only thing I will say though is that this is no doubt the greatest animated film of 2020! When you get the chance to watch this on Apple TV+, look and process every shot that is shown in this film. The reason why is because every shot that was shown is like artwork in a museum. The design/backgrounds of the old town of Kilkenny, Ireland are very structured. All of the motions flow very smoothly. My favorite shots in the film have got to be wolf POV shots. The way how the staff animated the wolves' senses to help explain the audience of what makes a wolf a special creature, makes the watching experience a lot more interesting. Speaking of wolves, I love everything related to them in this film! Their designs, emotions, and the harmonic howls! You name it, I live for it! So to wrap things off, almost everything about this film is absolute perfection. The voice acting, story, characters, theming, music, editing/pacing, and finally the animation. The only thing that I would say the film needed more of was character interaction between Robyn and Mebh before the big conflict.

The plot is straightforward and while Kells was an odd stew of Christianity and paganism, WolfWalkers has a clearly pagan vs. Christianity theme that makes more sense.The first half of the movie is cute but unexceptional, reasonably pretty but not stunning, outside of the fantastic, every flowing wolfpack and a wolf-girl's wild hair.

After the amazing opening, the pace and story lacks for a good portion of the movie, losing the magic it held at the beginning in favour of some annoying characters chasing each other.\nWhilst we are on the subject, the characters.\nThe characters, or one in particular, are a major set back from making this movie from good to great. Mebh was the root of this I think. Her enthusiastic attitude gets old real fast, already having been used to death before. Whereas the opening portrayed her as being silent, she's very sassy and loud mouthed - I would've much preferred a silent Mebh, as this adds an element of mystery and fantasy. It just ruined it for me.\nThe other characters are okay, Robin's dad was the most likeable, Robin not so much but I could see why they chose that. The villain was good, keeping a mysterious, intimidating feel keeping me engaged with scenes he was in.\nOverall, a mediocre movie that has lots of potential and sometimes reaches that potential, but often it is sadly too little too late. The Breadwinner and Song of the Sea were far better.\nHowever, if you like fantasy revolving around animals, and are a fan of animation, it's worth the watch. I am a fan of animation and was in awe at lots of the backgrounds and long shots. Like I said, by far the best part of the movie.\nSo yeah. Mediocre. At time of writing it stands at 8.3, which I think is far too high (but only 257 have reviewed)",

            "content": "Wolfwalkers is the newest film to the astonishingly creative team of Cartoon Saloon, and they have surely reminisced my love for the style of hand drawn animation storytelling with this film.We are introduced to the main character Robyn, a girl who wishes to be just like her father Bill as a hunter, but her father fears for her safety and prefers she remains a normal status as a scullery maid. However, wanting to help her father with hunting down wolves that have been disturbing the peace of the town, Robyn decides to follow him into the woods, only to discover the entirety of the wolf pack and discover a little girl among them known as Mebh.The two befriend, and Mebh reveals to Robyn her identity as a Wolfwalker, a mystical being who has the ability to transform their soul into a wolf while their body stays behind asleep. Along the way Mebh accidentally bites Robyn which inevitably turns her into a wolfwalker herself, and all the while the townsfolk and lord protector Oliver begin to grow hastier by the day with the presence of the wolf pack close to their village.First off, the animation all throughout this movie was spectacular. I loved how the different colors, lining, and textures all symbolize the themes and emotions this movie makes you feel scene by scene. It also delves greatly into the idea of \"see what I see\" at times by showing us amazingly drawn first perspectives of what a wolf can see, hear, and even feel. There are even moments of supernatural elements being present that I thought had a great combination with its surroundings when released such as the levitated vines to lead the way, or the stone carvings show us an entire story in itself.Robyn and Mebh were so much fun to watch together, and even after just a couple days of them interacting with one another, you could already see a strong friendship vibe between the two. The chemistry between them also made the story very unique, as you've got Robyn a townie and a hunter, and Mebh the feral wolfwalker who takes Robyn on a journey of self-discovery within the vast world of nature.I also found Moll and Bill's roles in this story to be an interesting mix of complication, because both of them believe what they're doing is right for their daughters, but when really their lack of freedom allowance for their children is only causing them to rebel further. A character like Bill is a great example of this because he may think he knows what he's doing is for the betterment of his work and Robyn, but his flaw is the continuous refusal to understand the other side's beliefs and predicaments. As for Oliver, his belief in keeping order and the safety of the citizens for the town is understandable, but what makes him a great villain for this movie is his representation of the belief that nature mustn't co-exist with civilization.The music choices of smooth tones and wicked showdowns also brought a great atmosphere to the world since when you see Mebh and Robyn running around together as wolves, the joyful and strong music brought within these scenes allowed me to believe in things like Robyn and her acceptance to becoming a wolfwalker. You could even say each character had their own style of music every time they were shown, especially for Oliver due to his strong presence of dominance which brought a rough and low tone to better represent his status and what the viewer should think of him.Overall this was an amazing otherworldly tale of friendship, acceptance, change, and fighting your beliefs for what is right. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to see a good sense of another being's view of the world, as well as anyone who loves a good and mesmerizing fashion of hand drawn storytelling at its finest.",

The sumptuous care in its construction & an ethereal simplicity in its narration is further elevated by its awe-inspiring narration & expertly scripted characters, thus allowing the picture to deliver the goods on all fronts.The animation is breathtaking to say the least, employing the studio's patented ornamental designs, symmetrical sketches & childlike imperfections which help evoke the desired warmth, wonder, intimacy & innocence in each n every frame. Camerawork & lighting is first-rate, Editing allows the plot to flow like a breeze, and the elegant & resonant music casts its own spell that makes the experience even more alluring & fulfilling.Overall, Wolfwalkers effortlessly blends history, folklore & contemporary themes into a visually striking & emotionally stirring fable that wondrously demonstrates our depleting relationship with nature and our ability to help restore the same, in addition to serving as an arresting coming-of-age story. A magical & mesmerising fantasy-adventure for viewers of all ages, Cartoon Saloon's latest is their best film to date and one of the finest films of the year. Don't miss it.",

Ideas of independence, growing up, parenting, duty, destiny, freedom, an the magic of nature all so well balanced and portrayed. Visually it's stunning. WolfWakers employs an art style that feels like such a breath of fresh air compared to the often cookie cutter animations we see these days. It even feels like it has an edge over the oft lauded Pixar just based on it's sheer originality.Honestly, I'm so glad this got a nomination because I don't know that I would've ever watched it otherwise and I would have been missing out. This is a wonderful movie for adults and children alike and 100% deserves to be checked out by people.

            "content": "The latest from Cartoon Saloon (The Secret of Kells, The Breadwinner, et al), Wolfwalkers is such a magical surprise and so completely in its own world that you surely won't mind its occasional Disney-Pixar similarities - even if the things that come to mind involve bits of folklore and myth that predate both Disney's films and the fairy tales they were based on. Nevertheless, it is the animation you deserve in the month that gave us Bobbleheads.Wolfwalkers is a hand-drawn Irish film, with story and mythology that may recall Pixar's Brave (which did a far worse job at being its own thing), and animation that occasionally looks flat and almost unfinished. However, this is not a bad thing.The movie looks like Fantasy sketches, old watercolor paintings, and sometimes even petroglyphs brought to life; the obviously penciled lines and still-visible sketching circles simply function as a flex (on top of ultimately creating a unique yet aptly old-fashioned art style), reminding us of the painstaking process and imagination behind the film. These details are akin to the thumbprints we sometimes see on claymation characters. The thematic shifts in color, lighting, framing, and \"squiggliness\" also help it stand out.Additional magic is supplied on the soundtrack; Irish singer K\u00edla gives Bruno Couilas' score that extra Gaelic touch, and there is also an original tune by Aurora, the Nordic singer whose angelic vocals appeared in Frozen 2. There's even a tinge of A Song of Ice and Fire, but this one makes a warg-like connection to nature seem decidedly more pleasant.We join Robyn (Honor Kneafsey), an English girl in an Irish village, yearning for a more exciting life. Her father Goodfellowe (Sean Bean) helps defend the village from wolves, said by some farmers to be under the spell of \"wolfwalkers\" - wild humans who can unleash their spirit animals if need be. The ruthless Lord Protector (Simon McBurney) dismisses the idea as Pagan superstition, but free-spirited Robyn encounters Mebh \u00d3g MacT\u00edre (Eva Whittaker), a feral but quick-witted wolfwalker who gives Princess Merida's hair a run for its money.The friendship between the two children is the heart of the film; Robyn finally finds belonging, eventually learning to \"see\" with all her senses the way wolfwalkers do, and Mebh gradually warms up to \"townies\". The voice acting is remarkably good, proving that child performers can, in the right circumstances, be some of the best actors we have. The imaginations of children can go a long way, and many would jump at the idea of getting to communicate with the beasts of the Celtic wild, or pretend that they do. Sure enough, these actors seem to be having a blast.What makes Wolfwalkers extra important, especially if the COVID situation allows it to technically be one of the most popular animated movies of the year, is that it proves it isn't over for 2D animation. With major releases on hold (unless even more studios start to realize the perks of streaming), more and more viewers will be forced to look in new, less obvious places, to possibly find films that they love in ways they didn't know films could be loved. Cartoon Saloon might just be the place.And indeed, much like last year's Klaus, this one feels very much like a journey back to the sort of films Disney would no longer agree to make (a reminder that becomes outright depressing when you learn that Kirk Wise worked on the aforementioned Bobbleheads film). It doesn't visually resemble any Disney movie - or any other animated film that I can recall - in the way that Klaus looked like something from the era of Treasure Planet and The Emperor's New Groove, but it carries a certain magic we could all use.",

The animation is one of them. It's simplistic but it still looks incredible. Every character, every building, every tree is different and unique from the next and the way they frame these shots is great. The animation style makes these environments look rich and beautiful. The performances are great too. Each cast meme we did a great job portraying their characters especially Sean Bean and these portrayals made the emotional beats hit much harder and this is all due to the great character development and writing. Every main character has a purpose and an arc they go through like the father realizing that just because something may look dangerous on the outside doesn't mean they are dangerous on the inside. The story here is simplistic and that's what I think holds this film from a 9/10 or a 10/10. Elements of the story feel a little basic but that's okay because it's not geared towards adults. This was an incredible animated movie and I'm thankful that I got to check it out early. Please watch this when it comes out later this month.

            "content": "Of course \"Wolfwalkers\" lost the race for the Animated Feature Oscar; it's the better movie. The award winner, \"Soul\" is dualistic spirituality focus-grouped into non-offensiveness--the product of a mere foot soldier (Pixar) within the enclosed medieval and fairytale-inspired land (Disney) where any mythology deemed too dangerous is hoped to be kept hidden in the forest outside their walls. Oh, sure, they'll send a hunter outside once in a while, cut down some of the trees for in house and maybe even threaten to raze the entire forest down, but the overriding religion is to keep the market of townies safe within their cage of managed doctrine. Making a movie about the afterlife and ignoring millennia of religious history doesn't matter to them in the same way that traditional animation is irrelevant to their 3D-computerized eye. The townies may be forgiven, then, when they choose their cage over the threat of a pagan mythos that engages in a battle between that doctrine and magic, where character duality has meaning, and the animation is inspired by the past--not merely adopting, say, Cubism devoid of its original context just because it has a pleasant appearance. That's fluff; this is not.\"Wolfwalkers\" looks and sounds better, too--at least if one isn't looking to see the same CGI passed off as animation over and over again and isn't impressed that after four decades Pixar realized that African Americans are part of their market, too, and so put in a jazz score (OK, the score is good, I admit)--plus the supposed humor of a white woman's voice in a black man's body. None of that's even about race, or anything really besides a corporatist and a cafeterian religious soup of generalities on the meaning of life. There very well is a point, however, to the half-human, half-wolf eponymous wolfwalkers here: aesthetic, environmental, historical, national and spiritual. Cromwellian English civilizing in the form of a religious war and ecological destruction on the Irish folklore and landscape. No mere two different-looking worlds, this is a land where the two sides not only look different, one gray and the other lustrous; they literally see the same world differently. It's also one where the overall aesthetic of traditional animation takes its cue from a deeper past such as of woodcut painting and Celtic calligraphy. Even the alternating frame of the images matter. This cannot be produced in a cage; it requires a wild freedom.",

At no point did I feel bored, the movie was very emotional and engaging to me. I loved the soundtrack behind it.

Agreed in the times where COVID-19 has taken over, movies are not being promoted well but I personally believe if they stuck with Amazon Prime or Netflix it would hit a huge audience early!I am rooting for this movie to have a cult fanbase. I don't want such a beautiful animated fantasy to remain underrated. A must watch for every age as it even has some mature themes.",

            "content": "WolfWalkers features one of the best hand drawn animations in recent years(if not all time). It is on par with Studio Ghibli films and I'm also glad that its story is also great. The voiceover in this film is very well especially Honor Kneafsey(Robyn) whose accent I adored. The film is very similar to Princess Mononoke, it is kind of a homage to it but it was also able to find something original. In the first 30 minutes(setup portion) I thought that the film was overhyped because while its animation was gorgeous, its story felt mediocre(a girl suppressed) It is not bad or anything, it's just that we had seen it so many times before. When Robyn and Mebh start spending time together, the film shined. I loved everything about their relationship, their chemistry was just amazing. I could just watch them being together, talking and running for 2 hours straight. The symbolism to old history is also very well done for the adult audiences but it doesn't mean this movie is not for children. It is entertaining and has a simple message as well but the way they integrated a deeper message(intended for adults) to the film surprised me. They nailed it. The ending felt kind of more childish(so that it can get a PG rating) compared to Princess Mononoke which was more raw(I know that movie wasn't intended for children, but thematically about nature vs. Humankind it goes way deeper). I still liked the ending though because I believe that was the best thing they could do to still keep it a children-friendly movie. The film also does a very good job at creating the perfect pacing which is especially hard for family-friendly animations. Overall WolfWalkers is a fantastic movie made for both children and adults and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great experience.",

            "content": "The animation and visual style is amazing and if I was just rating on that alone it'd give it a 10 but movies are not just beautiful images and the story/acting/dialog is just super cliche and stiled. It was geniously hard to make it to the end some parts are so poorly written. It's hard to really write down why it doesn't work but something, some soul of good dialog and storytelling is missing.SpoilersExamples* Robin saves Mebh mom and instead of greeting her with a natural \"Oh my gawd! Thank you for saving my mom\" we instead get bad writing of Mebh being angry.* Robin releases the mom and rides on her back (dad sees this). Robin and mom get back to Mebh and they all hug. Then dad shoots the mom with an arrow. WHAT? There's no reason at that point for him to be scared. Oh, right, bad writing.* Toward the end when the father starts the leave the pack, why? Bad writing that's why. There's zero reason for him to even think to leave. His daughter's right in front of him and he's got nowhere else to go given he's a wolf.* When the Lord Protector it going to show he can tame a wolf.... What part doesn't the mother get? She understands language. She could easily have shown a tame wolf. We're given no indication that that would have led to a bad outcome. In other words it could have lead to wolves and people living in peace and harmony. We can claim that's all just a sad mis-understanding but I'd argue better writing wouldn't have made that so ambiguous.* When the Lord Protector is in the jaws of the father he commits suicide. Why? So Dad can be guilt free for not killing someone? It robbed us of righteous retribution and gave us nothing in return. The glow in the bite seemed to indicate the Lord Protector would now also turn into a Wolfwalker which would have been an interesting twist. It would also have been better writing if the Lord Protector sensed himself turning into one but declared he couldn't live that way. Instead, for no reason whatsoever, he commits suicide. In fact he says a prayer \"Into your arms my lord I commend my soul\" but suicide is damnation so again, it makes no sense. Bad writing.I'm too lazy to go back through and track down out all the other similar situations but there were tons.Also the dialog is stilted, for example there's a point when Mebh and Robin have become friends, they make a joke and laugh but the voice acting is bad so it sounds fake instead of genuine. That's just one of many spots where it wasn't working, where maybe they needed more practice or maybe they needed a different voice director.",

            "content": "IN BRIEF: A beautifully hand-drawn animated wonder that deals with serious subjects and never panders to its audience.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Cartoon Saloon, an up-and coming studio in Ireland, has created a beautiful piece of art called Wolfwalkers, a cautionary tale about two young girl fighting against a harsh adult world. Set in the mid-1600's, cities are expanding into the forest regions and have upset the ecological cycle. Wolves are attacking its residents and law has been declared against their pack. Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) starts out her self-enlightening journey as a huntress with a crossbow, akin to her hunter father (Sean Bean). Along the way, she befriends Mebh (Eva Whittaker), a shape-shifting feral wolf-child, and their friendship begins to convert her thinking.Skillfully directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart (The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea), Wolfwalkers is a visual treat. The third chapter of their trilogy completes their thematic set about historical Irish fore lore, although each film stands alone on its own merits. In this latest installment, the characters are drawn with angular lines and heavy contours, set against stylized flat backgrounds of geometric medieval buildings that look like woodblock prints, or lush watercolored enchanted forests that swirl with vivid spontaneous hues that truly do enchant. The contrast is never jarring and compliments the characters and actions. The ever-changing color palette of oranges versus blues, cold grey blues and hints of amber, rustic reds against purple tints is stunning. There is so much creativity and innovation in their filmmaker's artistic choices.Some minor flaws do exist in all of the film's glory: The plot does meander and one can easily guess the outcome. Screenwriter Wil Collins does allow some scenes to go on a wee too long, my laddie, and overstates its ecological and political messaging about colonialism, authority, and religion in his storytelling. But that's a lot to cover in any movie, be it live-action or animated. Voiceover work is good, although the sometimes heavy Irish accents also are a minor inconvenience if not an authentic addition to the story. (Still the character of Mebh could have been tempered as she tends to annoy rather than endear.)Yet, both adults and children will be thoroughly captivated by this film. The end result is a gorgeously rendered example of painstakingly hand-drawn animation, a rarity these days in the field of computer animated wizardry, Also the film's Celtic score by Bruno Coulais and Kila provides the perfect atmosphere. There is a lovely fantasy interlude complete with a rousing tune called Running with the Wolves that is quite memorable in its perfect blending of both sound and imagery. The use of split screen techniques to convey contrasting views of events works quite effectively too.The issue of fear of change and intolerance is at the core of this film, but, fortunately, the artisans involved in the making of Wolfwalkers are a fearless and imaginative lot. Kudos to them...and us moviegoers for the opportunity to experience their joy! (GRADE: B+)",

            "content": "With an engaging core story (based on the aftermath of the Irish civil war), characters worth rooting for, and brilliant visuals, Wolfwalkers proves to be one of the most satisfying (animated) film experiences of the year. If you thought only Disney, Pixar, Laika, or Studio Ghibli could set such high standards for animated films, Cartoon Saloon is here to solidify its presence with a fascinating fourth entry. The story is narrated in the simplest way possible, supplemented by stunning hand-drawn imagery and compelling voice-overs. A young Irish girl (voiced by Honor Kneafsey) befriends a WolfWalker, eventually turns into one, and then sides with the wolfpack in an attempt to save them from a colonial overlord and his henchmen. From a storyline standpoint, that's more than sufficient. But Wolfwalkers is SO MUCH MORE!Sean Bean voices the little girl's father, torn between wanting a good life for his daughter and following the orders of the Lord Protector, the villainous Oliver Cromwell (Simon McBurney, effective). At times, the plot gets a bit formulaic, but Wolfwalkers manages to evoke genuinely strong emotions out of its viewers. Even if the plot doesn't move you entirely, the visuals certainly will. The way the town and the forest have been envisioned, stylized, and designed is nothing short of outstanding (the 'wolf-vision' bits are magical!). The perfection here lies in its broad brushstrokes and woodcuts, something that pure CGI often lacks.Directed by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Tomm More (who previously received Oscar nods for The Secret of Kells and Song of The Sea) with ample support from art director Ross Stewart, Wolfwalkers brings back the old-school feels of flipping pages in a timeless fable. It's for kids, it's for adults, it's for EVERYONE! Thematically, Wolfwalkers tackles the subjects of opposition-free authority, friendship, family, and to a large extent, ecology. Where it stands out lies in the fact that it does so, in a beautifully profound fashion.",

The casting choices matched their characters.Music was good, wouldn't say they were memorable but they fit the tone very well.The story was ''meh''. Not terrible, but nothing of real value either. Character development was non-existent - the plot took too long to get going, specific conversations repeated several times without anything different about them and the themes (e.g. Christianity vs. Celtic Mythology) was watered down to a ''Christian Man bad, misinformed and dumb - Celtic people good'' argument. it's a shame, because a lot could've been done with it.That's not to say its bad - the pace was good. The place in time it takes part in (directly after the English Civil War), and how the Irish/English relations were, were done properly. The characters are a product of that time, and that was very well done. The Celtic symbolism was excellent and superbly detailed, it's just a shame they put in 0 effort for the Christian side of the conflict and their justifications except ''well, God wants it this way I guess''. It's also a shame there was 0 tension, since nothing dramatic actually happened where you might think \"I hope character X will make it.\"I guess that's the core problem; the story didn't dare to do anything with its plot, characters, themes and lore. Robyn didn't have to go hunting for rabbits or deer and kill them for food and have inner conflict about it. The mother didn't die. Ned Stark survived. (Sean Bean surviving, that's a new one for me). That daring is something movies like Princess Mononoke did, and that is such movies are stronger.All in all, good movie, nothing legendary like the Lion King or Pinnochio, but I would let my child watch this.",

The film does mirror some of Princess Mononoke's storyline (humans leading wolves), but Miyazaki's characters have much more depth and complexity.This fable is very dark and violent (it's not a young kid's movie) - and the resolution is generally predictable - but it does look great and is ultimately uplifting.

Here the metaphors are more heavy handed, with the ultimate goal being more about gaining freedom than evolving as a person, but you get the beautiful animation, the celtic folklore, the nice Irish music and the hero's journey.I noticed other people comparing Tomm Moore's work with Miyazaki's and I concur that he kind of goes the same way: stories with a lot of national or traditional motifs, young children as heroes in very natural or magical environments going through a transformative journey that also tells things about us as people.

            "content": "Wolfwalkers is perhaps one of my favorite animated films of all time. It isn't produced by Hayao Miyazaki or Pete Docter. The film is produced by an Irish company called Cartoon Saloon. It is the embodiment of the little guy and what they can achieve. The company in my opinion might be making its way into the pantheon of modern animation studios with even such a limited catalog of work. I would definitely see anything they made going forward..The company has previously been nominated for three oscars. The first time was for Secret of Kells which was released in 2009. It lost the Oscar to Pete Docter's Up, which gave Disney one victory over Cartoon Saloon. Pete Docter is about to win another Oscar for Soul. Despite the cultural outrage from some progressive film voices, this film will lose despite being a strong contender. The second major film they got nominated for was Song of the Sea which was released in 2014. The film lost the Oscar to the animated Disney and Marvel superhero film Big Hero Six. The put them down zero to two. The third defeat came when The Breadwinner lost to the Mexican tale, Coco. As you can see Disney has a stranglehold over this category. That being said this film outshines Soul and any other animated feature that was released this year.The film plays out like an eco fable, finding itself grounded in deep celtic roots. It becomes a story of man's hatred of nature and the specific target of wolves. It is in this struggle between man and wolf that a girl comes of age and finds herself growing as a person. In addition to the coming of age the film sees the girls father grow himself. He is a loving father voiced by Sean Bean. This is perhaps the best vocal performance of the year behind Jamie Foxx as Joe Gardner in Soul. He brings pain to the role. Capturing the pain of raising a daughter without her mother in a beautifully profound way.I really love how good films can be when they succeed in capturing the essence of Shakespeare without diving into the dated nature of his work. This film is a platonic version of Romeo and Juliet which plays like that only with female children finding friendship instead of love. It wants us to find joy in watching these two children find something deeper in themselves through eachother.It is beautifully animated with the scenes of wolve hearing being portrayed like a sort of echo location, the colors changing to reflect how the wolves see without their actual vision. The transfer of imagery is also marvelous as the wolves blend together in moments to show the nature of a pack.Up until this point I believe Studio Ghibli had the monopoly on capturing the beauty of 2D drawn animation in a world where CGI animation is what sells. The film never feels jarring its visuals because it reflects the art of drawing in a way that drawing is expected to look. The more I saw of the animation the more I wondered why the industry doesn't focus on going back to that style. It truly is wonderful.I will say this. We as a society have been conditioned to grasp firmly to nostalgia and things we feel familiar with. A lot of people out there might see this as some pretentious foreign property that doesn't view film as a medium of entertainment and instead wants to preach some deep message that people shouldn't care about. Like all good animation this rings false as it is a kids film that is made with adults in mind. You as a 40 year old will love it as much as your 10 year old. Or if you are a student who still dabbles in animation you will also love it, I believe.The soundtrack and score also add a lot to the film. My favorite moment of cinema in 2020 is a nocturnal set piece that is set to the beautiful Running with the Wolves by Aurora. It was during that moment that I knew this was going to be my favorite film of the year. I would like to add the film never feels like something that Apple would make and a lot of streaming captures the direct to TV feel of streaming.Also the final climax is as well done and intense as anything done in animation. It feels like something that classic era Disney did down to the final stand-off between man and beast. I'd even say that as animation the flow was done so well that you actually believed an animated movie could have high stakes. The flames in the scene provoke fear and anxiety, the isolation of a family from each other as they are desperate to see each other survive.The film really is my favorite of the year and if you can find it somewhere else other than Appletv+ I would suggest downloading or watching it. Seldom has a work from someone other than The House of Mouse felt so pivotal and important for the medium of animation.I would give it a 5/5.",

            "content": "The third in Tomm Moore's Irish Folklore series (SECRET OF KELLS, SONG OF THE SEA), is also the most elaborate, both in its art and its story. Loosely based on an old myth, Wolves of Ossory, Moore and his co-writers have created a complicated fable about an English girl (Robyn; voiced by Honor Kneafsey) and her father (Bill; Sean Bean) who live in an Irish village beset by wolves. An even more dangerous foe in the form of the tribal leader, the Lord Protector (Simon McBurney), rules with an iron fist and wants to exterminate the wild beasts.According to the screenplay, there exists among humans some who have the ability to turn into a wolf at night while they sleep (full moon or not!). Robyn becomes one of these Wolfwalkers herself which allows her to join their pack every evening. As fate would have it, her father has been tasked by the Lord Protector to be the head wolf-hunter.The animation here (a combination of hand-drawn and limited computer assistance) is deceptively simple, but yields some beautiful animation with a unique look of its own. All three movies in the Irish folk tales trilogy follow the same general pattern visually, but there has been notable progress culminating in this current production. WOLFWALKERS is entertaining, even when its story is a bit too convoluted (and overlong). Robyn's adventures among the wolves in the forest are a delight and there's a style and grace that is sometime lacking in slicker fully computer animated features. All three in the series have now been nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar.",

The subtexts beside the subject matter.\nThe main theme is what I mentioned earlier. But other than that, if you can read between the lines, you'll notice how subtly the film points out racism and also how effortlessly it showcases feminism.\n5. The ironies. A girl is asked to stay away from forest and wolves by her father and those same wolves are asked to stay away from humans and hunters by a wolfwalker.\nA father wants her girl to not go out and speak up because he doesn't want her \"caged\" by the administration and for that, he puts her in another cage; doesn't let her get out and forces her to stay in.\n6. The visuals. I was literally mesmerized on seeing the beautiful forests and waterfall and even the town is shown so beautifully with so much detailing.\n7. The thrills. Many a times I found myself whispering \"Oh, no\" , \"please, no\" throughout the film.\n8. The message. Like the above mentioned films, the message here is so important. The world is as much of other species as it ours.This film is clearly a labour of love and you should definitively check it out. If you are a sucker for animated films, no chance you should miss it and if you don't like them much, try watching this one and maybe you'll start liking them.P.S. : This is a fantasy film so please don't be skeptic about the things that'll happen.

As expected, the animation was beyond gorgeous, possibly the best 2D animation I've ever seen, coupled with effective music and dynamic directing (not to mention the genius experimentation with aspect ratio), but the stereotyped characters made it hard to emotionally connect with their arcs. The dialogue was lackluster, interpersonal conflict overly simplified, and therefore repetitive and frustrating, and the anti-Christian themes diminished what otherwise would have been a heartwarming reunion of a finale, however clich\u00e9. It felt segregational, the happy, free-spirited family finally liberated from the clutches of fanatical, close-minded Christians with little coherent motivation. All in all, despite subscribing to stereotypes under the guise of portraying the opposite, this was a beautiful film. One hour and forty-three minutes of raw, earthy, enchanting eye candy.

The highly crafted visual style reminiscing of children's book flows extremely well with a heart-warming story that resonates deep within and takes the viewer back to a time in Ireland where authorities still ruled with an iron fist, fixated on getting rid of such majestic creatures of the forest as wolves are.The legend of the Wolfwalkers comes alive in such an awe-inspiring manner, thanks to the impeccable efforts from the folks at Cartoon Saloon whose animated style has become a trademark of theirs, contrasting harshly with the nowadays standard 3D animated releases out there. Not only does its distinct illustrative style come off as a standout element, but the story that it accompanies is absolutely enchanting, much so that one cannot help but to feel immersed in the world inhabited by Robin, Mebh and her pack of wolves, wrapped up in an intriguing tale of Irish folklore and fantastic fables.Wolfwalkers is definitely one of the best animated films in recent times, and proof of the mesmerizing growth of animation studio Cartoon Saloon, with a consistent output of high quality features for over a decade now.

It's a terrific animated movie, produced in Ireland, with great story telling and an interesting visual style.Robin (Honor Kneafsey) and her father Bill (Sean Bean) have arrived in Kilkenny in 1650. Bill is a hunter and has been charged by the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell (Simon McBurney) with killing the Wolves in the surrounding woods that are being felled for expansion of the town. Robin is eager to help, but a series of circumstances lead to her being alone in the woods, where she meets Mebh (Eva Whittaker) a girl of similar age who can transform into a wolf and who leads the pack.It really is a wonderful film to look at. The animation style is at times brilliantly abstract whilst astonishingly detailed at others. The sharp lines of the characters stand out nicely against watercolour-esque backgrounds - it is truly beautiful. It's a decent story too. It's definitely a children's film, the plot is pretty basic and there are clear lines between good and evil of the film even as peoples motivations turn, but it's sincerely a children's film, there are no winking nods or visual gags to try and placate a family that might be seeing the film together. It's a very earnest story, and it's not difficult to draw parallels between the townsfolk expanding into the forest and the English army's occupation of Ireland.Vocal performances are really good too. The two young girls are excellent. Sean Bean puts quite a lot into his performance (admittedly stoic man from South Yorkshire ought to come rather easily by now). The world building foley work and the score are excellent too. If you want any criticism, maybe it might have been made clearer that the fate of Oliver Cromwell isn't entirely accurate, but that really is nitpicking.Even if we hadn't had the year in film that 2020 was \"Wolfwalkers\" has to be the front runner for the animated film Oscar.",

I since then have seen all of Cartoon Saloon's films, and up until watching WolfWalkers just now I felt that Song of the Sea was overall their strongest, yet Wolfwalkers may now co-hold that title...WolfWalkers is a beautiful film in every sense of the word. It is of course (like its predecessors) artistically captivating, and adds new animation techniques and striking art direction that made me go \"wooaahh\" multiple times, and have to pause the film and look at it all properly many times. It has callbacks to Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea both with the choice of animation as well as story beats and themes. It also reminded me other animated films such as Pocahontas (especially with the main villain), and Princess Mononoke. Speaking of which, the studio Cartoon Saloon now feels like an Irish Studio Ghibli in some ways, what with its very distinct animation and story styles, as well as its poignant expression of Irish folklore and mythology. It is very clear how much love, attention to detail, and passion for their craft that everyone involved has, and yet again they have produced a masterpiece that I consider to be one of the best animated films I've seen, and I've seen a lot!My only tiny gripe with the film is that it felt like it ended too quickly, after a very long (but great) build up. However maybe that's just my own projection, as afterall the overall message of the film remains to be very potent indeed.I hope this movie will help with the push towards re-wilding and bringing back wolf populations, but respecting them this time rather than treating them with contempt as we did before.Wolfwalkers is a wonderful film for all ages, and made me cry multiple times throughout.

Wolfwalkers (2020) continues this \"rough\" visual style but perhaps has the strongest story of all three films. That's not to say its predecessors don't have interesting stories, it's more that Wolfwalkers builds upon the foundations established by these previous entries of this loose trilogy.As is the case with these films, Wolfwalkers follows a young girl (Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey)) who encounters the fantasy of the world adjacent to her own. Both The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea andShapeshifting wolves and disappearing forests are more complex than she first realizes. Many stories based on ancient lore are meant to teach lessons to children, and this movie is no different. Granted, there are quite a few cliches in how the plot progresses, being quite predictable at times. Still, the story is engaging enough to warrant a viewing.This movie first came to my attention when I saw it tied to advertisements for Apple TV+. As this is yet another streaming service on top of the ones already well established (and with significantly more content than Apple TV+ has), I was disappointed that such a marvelous, Oscar-nominated film like Wolfwalkers was basically trapped behind a paywall. I don't know if this movie will ever be released on Blu-ray, but for right now I'd suggest dipping your toe into Apple TV+ with a free trial just to watch this one piece of content.Perhaps the best entry in the \"Irish Folklore Trilogy,\" I give Wolfwalkers 4.5 stars out of 5.",

The characters in the movie were pretty good. The main girl who came to Ireland felt like she was trapped in the town, and felt free when she was in the forest. This was portrayed as difference in color tone between the town and the forest. The town looked monotonous and gray, while the forest was filled with bright and lively color. I also liked the movie showing the people in town as fearful and dangerous by drawing their teeth in a nasty way. The main story reminded me a bit of Princess Mononoke as both had a character that met a wild character who could communicate with wolves. However, the story here was still different enough to enjoy.

The town's expansion is halted when a pack of wolfs terrorize the settlers resulting in Robyn. Father pursuing them. One day Robyn meets a girl among the wolves named Mebh who's a Wolfwalker. A Druid essentially with her mother lives among them, and channels magic to become Wolves in their sleep. The two of them develop a friendship with one another and everything seems good. Until One night Robyn finds herself turned into a wolf and becomes a Wolfwalker herself. All while the lord protector puts the squeeze on the region to drive the wolves out permanently. A lot of the time animation usually has a message that people primarily kids can take away from it. So Wolfwalkers isn't exactly the first to go with that original concept, it still manages to take its story and deliver not only a colorful film but also show the darker side of such elements. The themes of freedom and oppression are present throughout the movie. Right off the back, introduce how Robyn's father says how they're not exactly welcome here being English In Ireland and how Robyn is scoffed at it by the locals for being who she is. Combine that with the very Strict old totalitarian laws they have to abide by themselves orchestrated by the Lord protector of this town who's a fanatic. He makes a good villain he's basically like Frollo mixed with Radcliffe from Pocahontas. It's more for those reasons I felt that the chemistry between her and Mebh is even greater. Mebh is more easy-going she's not constrained by any rules and could just do as she, pleases. I also really liked Sean Bean as the father you see his kinda character in other animation features such as how to train your Dragon or brave strong tough guy he's not a bad guy but he just worries and cares for a kid. Even though right off the back he doesn't side with the girl with his daughter you know he's not a bad guy or you got understand his actions. The art itself is remarkably impressive given a very unique style to it. It gives the movie a more of a fantasy feel as to how the backgrounds are drawn in vivid colors. It looks like a child's folktale book brought to life, with the Celtic theme, I music is really good. Some of the creative angles used for certain perspectives give off these very trippy magic picture shots almost. As well as the great use of colors and lights to symbolize more somber lighthearted tones to the more dark and serious tones with such colors as red and blue.",

Yes if the story had new ways of storytelling, I would accept it but there were not any new things. ( people think an specific group is bad, though it is not.). I don't mean it was bad, even in some moments it becomes touching and it makes a relation between characters and the audience.Other things like voice acting, directing, etc... were goodAnd the last word. I enjoy the animation but the story could be something new and original.",

And oh god, is it Irish. It's so Irish that, being English, if I wanted to review this fairly, I had to fight back decades of colonialist instinct thanks to Boris trying his damnedest to bring it back.As you might guess from my opening statement, my biggest issue with this is that occasionally, it can feel a bit \"been there, done that\". I for one would be stunned if Princess Mononoke wasn't a pretty big inspiration for this, but the film also plays it maybe a little bit too safe for my liking in general. It feels like it's slightly pushing the label of \"kids' film\" at points, and I think it would have been cool to see it take that just a little bit further.But everything else...well, let's start with the obvious. The animation is just *chef's kiss* gorgeous, and the fact that this studio is one of the last holdouts seemingly dedicated to 2D animation in a time where even Ghibli is giving CGI some flirtatious looks is enough to make me want to sail over to Ireland right now and bring them a pot of gold. The line work, the backgrounds, the character design, the matte paintings, the style in general, the fact that it made first person wolf running scenes leagues above Bram Stoker's Dracula, everything about this film is ravishing to the eyes.The performances are great, even the 12 and 8 year olds that play the two leads...actually, scratch that, especially the 12 and 8 year olds that play the two leads. They bring so much heart and charm to these characters that it's honestly hard to imagine them any other way. Sean Bean is the best he's been probably since Game Of Thrones, and Simon McBurney (that's one hell of a fitting name) just has such a punchable voice. It's great for this role.The story, while it can be a little derivative, has really good and meaningful choices throughout it, that I can't really explain without spoiling, it's directed amazingly well, playing with different animation styles, aspect ratios, and in general there's just some well thought out shots, and oh man the soundtrack. I always thought the original version of Running With The Wolves sounded way too overproduced, and I'm glad someone apparently agreed with me, because the simpler, more folky version of it here is beautiful.And whether I would have preferred this to win over Soul? Well...I'm not sure which one I prefer at this moment, but...come on, Pixar have won enough times by now. That's all I'm saying.",

And The fact that this animation breaks this rule is also inspiring, showing that rough is beautiful. This also works on a subconscious level, as the theme of the film is embracing the \"wild\" and living in harmony with nature which is relevant to the film as the creative the wild process of animation conveys the harmony of creative process within. I'm glad to see a film that defies the clean up process in this way and does so well.\nBeyond the roughing of the characters, the background and environments, and the portrayal of them, is also unique, ignoring the traditionally accepted angles of line of action, this film has an almost Gustav klimnt feel. Shapes of houses and the castle ground almost have a classical art feel.The story, character arch, and plot plays out like a typical Disney film, and the colours of the scenes feel like water colour at times. Not sure what else I can say about this film but a far as 2d animation goes, it will likely be used as reference material for many new animators, And may even inspire people to try animation, as it really makes rough sketches pop and look beautiful.",

            "content": "We couldn't wait to get the latest film from Cartoon Saloon, an Irish studio which still uses (basically) hand-drawn animation, after I heard about it through the academy award nomination. WolfWalkers oddly took a very long time to be released on blu ray in the USA, and when it finally was, it was only available through a package with other films from the same studio. But in our book, Cartoon Saloon is so good--right up there with Studio Ghibli, and, yes, Disney/Pixar--that I got the package anyway, even if it meant duplicates in our collection. Despite the academy award consideration, it's not quite as good as its predecessors The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea, or the Breadwinner. Still excellent, however, and notable for its very specific and detailed historical fiction, which seems rare in children's animation or literature. Baked into the portrayal of the Cromwellian occupation of Ireland is the fantasy plot of WolfWalkers--Irish lycanthropes who release their wolf-spirit during sleep--and the daughter of an English general who befriends them, gets bitten, and turns into one herself. The allusions to Ghibli's Princess Mononoke are plentiful, but well considered, and creatively blended with Irish folklore; in this case it's the English occupiers who are destroying and de-enchanting the forest-the Irish primeval wood-for the sake of pre-industrialization. In short: worth the hype, even if the hype should have come sooner for Cartoon Saloon.",

Even the \"good\" Disney and Pixar films start to grate on you after a while simply because, for all their exquisite production values, they really are all hitting the same emotional \"make them cry\" notes. There is very much a Disney/Pixar narrative blueprint, much like there is a Marvel (MCU) narrative blueprint for its shows/movies. You can change individual narrative components and storylines, but ultimately you have to follow the overall quality-tested and approved narrative blueprint if you want to make a movie for Disney/Pixar.Wolfwalkers is such a breath of fresh air coming out of Europe. It looks and feels so different than what you are conditioned to after watching Toy Story, Moana, and Frozen for the 100th time each. In a vacuum, the plot reads as a bit derivative, and perhaps it is. But the way the story is told and depicted feels so different. You would know, right off the bat, that this is made by someone other than Pixar/Disney, even if you did not know that prior. The beautiful hand-crafted animation is the first giveaway. When was the last time we saw any animated movie, by anyone, that looks as good as this? The way people talk and act is the next thing I noticed. It is hard to put into words but it is just different than what we are conditioned to. There is no \"deconstruction\" of kids' movie tropes here. The protagonist is a strong young woman, but she is organically strong. She is not strong in the caricatured 2021 sense of \"strong young woman who recites feminist political lines and hates men\" that we see even in kids' movies today. Wolfwalkers is not a front for any political themes at all. There are no \"mansplaining\" references here. Wolfwalkers is just a great kids movie that your kids can watch and take inspiration from.Give this movie a watch. You will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "Look, I'm not saying Pixar is bad. They've consistently given us the some of the best animated films over the years, and while the Oscars seems to have a fascination with them most of their wins are well deserved.That is, until Cars 2.After Cars 2, they've been reduced to making agreeable sequels of their most classic titles, much to the disappointment of those waiting for the next Ratatouille. Sure, there was Inside Out too, but that's one good movie in a sea of mediocrity. Disney Animation has somewhat picked up the mantle, but even their best films are but a minor copy of better Pixar films.Wolfwalkers is what the world of animation needed, and for this reason it is even more saddening to accept that it will most likely fade into obscurity quickly. Cartoon Saloon delivers another 2D masterpiece that is neither anime or Pixar. Unlike Song of the Sea, the plot is simple and follow a conventional storytelling method. It works for what it is, but isn't particularly compelling nor is it the driving force of this film.The strength of the film lies in its incredible visuals, and when something has such an obvious strength, the rest just has to avoid being a detriment. It knowingly pulls its punches with the plot, knowing that a more complicated plot will take attention away from from its main strength and appeal. This approach to priority is similar to other visually powerful productions such as Kubo and the Two Strings and the Wallace and Gromit series.Do not for one moment think that this is just a film with pretty backgrounds. The fine craft of this masterpiece truly shines in motion and shadow. Everything is exaggerated, fluid and incredibly detailed. The background, lighting and shadows are all effectively manipulated to control the scene and create direction, motion and focus, something only possible in the world of traditional animation (and even then so rarely done).We tend to give little recognition to those that deserve it, and instead choose the easy path with obvious choices. Big Hero 6 won the Best Animated Feature with The Tale of Princess Kaguya and Song of the Sea in competition, despite being a merely average animated film. While Wolfwalkers is currently nominated for the Best Animated Feature, it seems unlikely that it will win over Soul.Of course, an award isn't everything. Whether it gains widespread acclaim or fades into obscurity, the best we can do individually is be glad that we were able to experience this film. Do yourself a favor and watch Wolfwalkers.",

            "review_title": "Wolfwalkers - Odyssey of the Senses By Maria Elena Gutierrez",
            "content": "In Wolfwalkers, a young English girl called Robyn Goodfellowe escapes Kilkenny, the Irish town to which she has been brought by her father, in order to explore the wonders of the surrounding forest. In doing so, she turns her back on the world of human beings and opens herself to the world of wolves.At this fundamental level, Wolfwalkers can be seen as a story of the conflict between civilization and nature. To this end, directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart employ two distinct visual styles. The town of Kilkenny is rendered in flat geometric shapes and dark colors. It is oppressive, solid like a block. Thematically this represents the English Puritanical religious views of 1650, and the embodiment of this is the Lord Protector. When he first shows up, the frame is almost devoid of color: his suit and headgear are black and white, with only a splash of red in the emblem on his flag, which symbolizes the violence and killing of the wolves.In contrast, the world of the forest is an enchanted paradise. It looks like a three-dimensional watercolor painting - it's fluid and loose, filled with energy and life. When we see the wolves running through the trees, they move like liquid. All of this tells us that nature is the space of creativity, the space of liberation. Indeed, Mebh openly tells Robyn: \"Come and be free in the forest. Come and play.\"\nWhile the design of the town draws on woodcut illustrations from the period, the forest owes a clear debt to the highly decorative manuscripts produced by Irish and British monks between 700-1,000 AD, known as \"insular illumination\" and perhaps best represented by the wonderful Book of Kells. This artistic tradition used sophisticated interlacing and zoomorphic decoration to represent the complexity of nature, its deep interconnectedness, and its organic wholeness. In a luscious visual vegetation, images grow one into the other while animals lurk enigmatically in the background. Not surprisingly, this form of art is an ideal match for a story where nature plays a central role. Sometimes, the visual complexity and the dynamism of images in Wolfwalkers is so exuberant that we have the impression of entering a new visual world resembling that of the Viennese Secession, best exemplified by the work of Gustav Klimt.Having passed from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest, Robyn meets Mebh, a girl about her age who is the embodiment of the natural world. This contrast between town and countryside is echoed in the design of these two protagonists. Look at Mebh, and you will see that the shape of her hair resembles a leaf; her face is round like a heart. But Robyn, who desperately wants to be a hunter, has a face shaped like an arrow; in certain sequences her cape takes the shape of an arrow, too.The world of nature has yet another aspect, because it is also a space of magic and ritual. We first see evidence of this in the inscriptions on the walls of the cave where Mebh resides with her mother and the wolves. These markings immediately transport us back to a time when human beings first felt the need to represent sacred beings through drawing. In this way the cave represents our relationship to the divine world and reminds us that, in order to forge the future, we must first explore the past.Venturing deeper into the cave, we discover Mebh's mother represented in a way that evokes ideas of a Mother Earth Goddess. This returns us to the sacred moment when humans and animals lived in symbiosis, and again we see this story recounted on the walls of the cave. As we absorb the ancient narrative, we realise we are in the presence of the divine.Even the shape of the cave is suggestive and full of meaning, resembling as it does female anatomy. In this and many other ways, the movie is a celebration of woman.For example, Robyn is an archetype of the woman standing against the oppressive authority of men, just like Antigone, stood against her uncle Creon in order to honor paganism and the oral laws of the gods. There are clear echoes of Antigone's story in Wolfwalkers, where the townspeople are told repeatedly that terrible things will to happen if they cut down the trees. At one point, the woodcutter explains to Robyn's father that Saint Patrick made a pact with the pagan god. As for the Wolfwalkers themselves- they are the magical gods, the divinities who have existed in the forest since primordial times, since before history began.Wolfwalkers is also a celebration of the senses. When Robyn passes from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest - and in particular when she transforms into a wolf - Mebh tells her not to rely on her eyes. Instead, Robyn must learn to use her other senses - her sense of smell, or the feel of the earth beneath her paws. Mebh is there to guide her - and also us, the audience - into this sensory world.In addition, beyond even the power of the senses, Mebh possesses the healing power of magic. Yet she cannot cure her mother alone. In order to do that she needs help. She needs the pack, the community, the collective. The power of the family. Even this heroine, this girl with superhero powers, cannot succeed alone. The ultimate message of Wolfwalkers, therefore, stands in defiance of individualism. If we as human beings are going to heal nature, we need each other.Dr. Maria Elena Gutierrez is the CEO and executive director of VIEW Conference, Italy's premiere annual digital media conference.

            "content": "Wolfwalkers is a story about a British hunter family investigating the Irish lands for wolves, but more importantly, its about finding happiness while being in a cage. The way it chronicles its protagonist Robyn trying to handle her own independence from her overprotective father is amazing, and it shows respect to both sides instead of painting things on the side of one person. Wolfwalkers, and Cartoon Saloon films in general, capture some sort of spirit that you look for in Disney, but it isn't quite there. Every little step and scene means something, and the stakes climb higher and higher. Combine all this with amazing animation and angelic music. My favorite character was Mebh due to the rawness of her emotion and how she never stopped fighting for Moll, even in a town full of people wanting to execute them both. The scene where she screamed for her mother was tearjerking.Now, spoiler time. Remember what I said earlier about Bill, Robyn's father? I think what was important about the film showing his side with respect was that, in a lot if ways, Bill was becoming Cromwell, even though his intentions were to keep Robyn safe. If it wasn't for him realizing his ways earlier, he would have become no different from the man who wanted to kill his daughter for who she was. Bill thought he was an ally of Cromwell, but at the end of the day he was someone who Cromwell saw as just as disposable as the rest of the wolves. What stopped him from going down that path was doing what broke him down the most, and letting Robyn go. He wanted her to be happy, and the only way for that was to let her be herself, and she could only be herself if she was free. The movie repeatedly brought up the theme of freedom contrasted with safety, and in the end, they all earned both together. An underrated film, it deserves more recognition and revive a new genre of children's movies and 2D animation.",

Low and behold this was the film that I was waiting for.When watching this film I looked at what separated this from its contemporary's, And one of the most outstanding feature of this movie is its style. You would think 2D animated movies would often use its genre as an excuse for a more creative presentation, and when it comes to most movies that is not the case. \"Wolfwalkers\" on the other hand utilizes its style to the best of its ability's. in someway this movie often feels like a story being told to a child while we're looking into that childs imagination. The foreground is much more detailed and specific than the background, as if in a childs mind that is how it would look.The story was also very \"tale\" like but it had a much more mature and descriptive world. It was so refreshing to watch a film that deeply cares about its worldbuilding. The voice acting to its originality, this was an improvement from the breadwinner on all fronts This is the best animated movie I have seen in a while (let alone this year), and I hope this movie gets its recognition it deserves.

The father character feels very standard, the main character feels very standard and the supporting character also feels very standard. Even the animal sidekick character feels very standard. Don't get me wrong: they ARE enjoyable, but nothing you haven't seen before - I enjoyed the dynamic Robyn and M\u00e9bh had. However, when Robyn let her down not once but twice by not appearing when she had compromised... well it was odd to see M\u00e9bh still wanting to be near her when she wasn't EVER given the context as to why Robyn hadn't appeared in the first place. I also wish we knew what drove the MacT\u00edre to be cursed into becoming Wolfwalkers and how they adapted to that transition. It is never explained in the movie, we don't even know if they were always like that.The soundtrack slaps and I wish there was a full version of the song Robyn sings while playing hunter at the beginnig.There is this part of the climax that is a bit of a downer because you know things will work out at the end and it seems to be so overly dramatic for no reason - but whatever, there is another part of the climax that I really enjoyed when the father character finally decides to do what's right and not what he's being told to do and THE STAKES MAN.

Alot of Irish actors used, you would know the voices instantly. Brings you back to learning about Irish folklore in school but also brings in true history about Ireland being taken over by the English so also educational. Little bit of comedy too which brings in the Irish way of going on. Definitely would recommend for Children and Adults alike. Would be a good one for movie day in school as its only 1hour 30 mins long. Music in it also lends itself to mixing old Irish with modern tendencies. Great all round.",

But this was a deeply predictable, ultra-simplistic story stretched over 1.75 tedious hours. The message: wolves are good and beautiful and perfect, people are bad and uniformly unpleasant, except for those destined to become wolves. How very enlightening. Hardest of all, though, was the fact that in this whole feature-length film, NO ONE EVER SPEAKS OR THINKS ABOUT ANYTHING, EVER, BUT WOLVES. It's enough to make a five-year-old roll their eyes. The dialogue: \"Wolf wolf wolf wolfity wolfity wolf, kill wolf, must save wolf, did save wolf, gonna run with wolf, did you see that wolf? I'm a wolf! Wooooooolf!\"",

            "content": "This is one of the best animated stories I have ever seen in my life. Better than Song Of The Sea and its predecessor.The animation is gorgeous and rich; especially the striking red colors used to convey drama. Yet it remains inventive and flexible; an artistic treat to watch. There is minimalism where it is needed and flare where it is required. The music and voice acting falls in step with the art; creating something special.The main characters express an endearing humanity; that gives the show something most vapid cash cows cannot achieve; sympathy with the characters.While the plot and story are not overly complicated, this is because the movie is mainly meant for children. The story still manages to impress even adults with its general message of; courage, revolutionary action, selflessness, and love.Spoiler. The story centres around a young girl named Robin and her father; a hunter called Goodfellow. The two are newly arrived outsiders who live in a constricting town ruled by a Lord Protector; who is basically a petty dictator. Under English rule, the Irish people are forced to work for their dictator and fell a nearby forest; even Children are forced into labor by an unrelenting, mechanical government.Goodfellow is charged with hunting down the wolves in the neighbouring woods. Parts of the story are a metaphor for any minority group being oppressed; which is what Mave and here mother (who are wolfwalkers-people capable of turning into wolves when they sleep) are. Mave and her mother live in the woods which are being invaded and threatened by the town. Mave wants to leave but cannot because her mother is asleep and her mother's wolf counterpart has not returned. Mave and Robin become friends after Mave heals her hawk Merlin.The plot takes a fun twist when Robin is accidentally bitten by Mave and becomes a wolfwalker herself. Which symbolises becoming one of the minority/oppressed groups. Robin is suddenly forced to deal with the hate,violence and superstition that is felt towards wolves. An irony, because earlier in the movie she herself oppressed wolves; seeing them only as vicious beasts to be hunted down.Robin promises to help Mave find her mother, but is forced by her society and its leader into conformity and obedience. Mave's mother who has actually been captured by the Lord Protector is placed in a physical and metaphorical cage. Upon her execution, she is freed by Robin who decides to break free of her own cage; freeing herself of her towns conformity and rigid rule.Riding the giant wolf who is actually Maves mother; the two make a dramatic escape from the town. Maves mother is reunited with her daughter; but is shot by Robins father; Goodfellow. Robin turns into a wolf; choosing to go with Mave and the wolves into the forest to help Maves injured mother.An epic battle takes place in which Goodfellow throws off his own chains of conformity; choosing to turn into a wolf to save his daughter. The Lord Protector is defeated; Goodfellow redeems himself and all four survive and become a single family-like a wolf pack.In conclusion; this animated movie is one of a kind, and is well worth the watch. The story, metaphors and messages are much deeper than most neigh sayers, and haters think.Don't miss this one!",

            "content": "I am actually love how the animation goes something more useful to during the making of the animated movie, voicing, origin and more in Kilkenny, Ireland. The main difference between the previous Cartoon Saloon films and the current film right now was the animation drawing which makes beautiful that I expected to avoid some lacked 2D art where it makes the ratings average or a little bit one. I watched this movie couple of times now: seeing friendship between the two female leading characters, the main character has become a wolfwalker by getting bited a wolf, the enemies of townies except Robyn and usually her father because of getting bited by Mebh's mother as a wolf.As of December 11, 2020, this animated movie looking like they overpowered the Disney/Pixar's \"Soul\" which released on Christmas for the best animated movie of the year, but for Oscar both animated movies was still going to decide which one is the best design in animation in able to win that category.As of today, Cartoon Saloon has yet to earned an Oscar but Wolfwalkers could be the perfect film and enough one to get the award in the Major awards ceremony in history. Even though when Soul takes the other awards other than the Film Critics Association Awards, then we'll assume that Wolfwalkers is still the best animated film in the year, 2020.Well done there, Ireland and United Kingdom + US origin! We are loving that animated movie so much and for the future, we will never forget that something is very familiar anyways.",

            "content": "A touching animation with an engaging story and a deeper meaning.Even as a person who doesn't tear up easily, this animation pulled at my deepest heart strings through the sheer creativity and passion put into this story.Buckets of creativity and work can be easily seen in each frame of this movie. And the animation style of Cartoon Saloon can be seen to have advanced and improved from their previous titles (which are also amazing). I felt the need to pause each frame as each one felt like a masterpiece. So much expression and emotion illustrated into face of each character. And yet they manage to make each picture flow into each other so magically, its jaw dropping.The story has some engaging twists and turns to it, gripping even seasoned film watchers. The characters are each beautifully designed. And through the expressive animation and talented voice acting of these young girls who played the protagonists, very little character development is needed for the audience to be quickly enveloped in their journey.The story, although initially about humans take over of nature, friendship and how a man can become blinded by ambition based on fear, the story hold metaphors for a deeper meaning about English occupationism in Ireland. I won't elaborate on this too much, but basically, Meabh and the forest represents pagan Celtic Ireland and Robyn and the town represent protestant occupying England. The forest does not welcome and acts hostile towards the town, and the town occupy's and cuts down the forest. And although the two forces push at each other to retreat, the more innocent sides to them, Meabh and Robyn find themselves to be not so different from each other and form a close friend ship. And especially in some of the ending scenes, their friendship really seems to represent how the newer generations of Irish and English can put their ancestors hatred for one another aside, and form peace, friendships and co-existence with their neighbours. And this powerful moral is beautifully expressed in the story i find. This is in my interpretive opinion of the movie anyways.Though the movie left me fulfilled, what was really heart breaking at the end was to see how little exposure the movie made and how little the movie made at the box office. This was due to the movie unfortunately coming out during Covid in 2020. It must have been heart breaking to see these talented animators work years, putting eye-watering amounts of work, time, money, creativity and passion into this fantastic work, just for it to be ruined by something that was completely out of their control. I really hope this masterpiece of animation gets picked up by a big steaming platform, not only so these talented individuals get what they deserve, but so more people can be exposed to this gem.Empathy aside, I am a critical guy, and this movie got a ten due to how I could not find any critique about it and how emotionally evoking and how extraordinarily visually stunning it was. Please give this movie a watch, especially if you are British or Irish this could particularly resonate with you.",

But while I do love this movie, there is a few things that leave it lacking the finishing of this type of art. In many scenes you can see the tracing lines for the characters. This makes the animation feel unfinished and was distracting for me. Also in one scene the mouth movements didn't match up with the spoken words. Lastly, a few scenes lack depth, making it seem as there's no distance in between the characters and surroundings. Other than these few things, WolfWalkers is worth the watch.
