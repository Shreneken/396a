The film was more then I expected. Because it is a beautiful eulogy of freedom and fine portrait of teaching - the help for Sebastian from music teacher is just moving - , friendship, escape from fears / doubts/ routine, middle age crisis, pure forms of freedom . And, sure, a film about fall. I saw it as teacher , not as cinema critic, I loved the crazyness and realism, humor and dark slices, the moral and the splendid job of Mikkelsen.",

            "content": "After giving the most emotional and heartbreaking Oscar speech of the recent awards, Thomas Vinterberg's International Feature winner is now in UK cinemas. \"Druk\" (Danish for \"Binge Drinking\") is in the Danish language with subtitles: but don't let that put you off.Positives:\nMads Mikkelsen delivers a stunning performance. He really delivers the goods. He was nominated for a BAFTA for the role but missed out on the Oscar nomination. This feels unjust. I would have personally swapped out Steven Yeun for this performance by Mads.Thomas Vinterberg was justly nominated for Best Director at both the BAFTAs and the Oscars. The movie never lacks momentum from beginning to end. I was thoroughly entertained.It's quite unusual to see a 'buddy movie' concerning a group of men that's not a cop film. My wife described it as a '\"chick-flick for blokes\". I guess you need to go to \"The Hangover\" films to find an equivalent. (That of course also centres around alcohol. Are we really that shallow?!)Negatives:\nUp until a \"church scene\", I thought the story was well-structured and coherent. But I'm not quite sure what message the finale of the movie was trying to send. Yes, it's fun and full of energy. And Mikkelsen's dancing is both bizarre and entertaining. But given all that's gone before, is it a \"what the hell, life is for living and alcohol is part of that\" statement? I was unsure.Summary Thoughts on \"Another Round\": The movie is dedicated to \"Ada\" - Vinterberg's daughter, who was supposed to be acting in the film but tragically died in a car crash just four days into shooting. (Hence his emotional Oscar acceptance). The fact he managed to finish the movie at all is amazing. But the fact it's so good is a great memorial to her.It's billed as a \"comedy drama\" but, although there are comic moments, it leans heavily on the \"drama\". The Scandinavians in general tend to drink as much, if not more, than the British do. So this is a reminder of both the benefits and risks of the evil drink.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or the Tiktok channel onemannsmovies.

            "content": "An intoxicating celebration of life and a sobering examination of midlife crisis that illuminates the inebriating delights & euphoric pleasures of alcohol influence with heart & humour without ever shying from the havoc it can cause when consumed in excess, Another Round (Druk) blends the elements of comedy, drama & tragedy into a vibrant, effervescent & invigorating mix, and is brilliantly spearheaded by a stellar showcase from the ever-reliable Mads Mikkelsen.Co-written & directed by Thomas Vinterberg, the film reunites him with Mikkelsen after their memorable stint with The Hunt and the result is another instant classic. Vinterberg takes a naturalistic & humanistic approach to bring his story to life and offers a fascinating take on the role of alcohol in Danish culture (or any culture for that matter). The plot concerns four friends who test out an alcohol experiment to enliven their banal professional & personal lives, and it is compelling throughout.But none of it would be as gripping if the bonding between the characters wasn't convincing enough and their individual arcs weren't fleshed out. Everyone plays a valuable role in the story yet the one who makes the experience truly worthwhile & rewarding is Mads Mikkelsen whose performance here ranks amongst his finest. We strongly relate to his character, are fully invested in his journey, and the magic he conjures in the last segment is destined to leave an indelible impression on the viewers, leaving them all high & in a state of pure bliss.Overall, Another Round is beautifully anchored by Vinterberg's sensible direction & Mikkelsen's masterful rendition, and is one of the most engrossing, arresting & life-affirming films of the year. Equal parts funny, touching & heartbreaking, this Danish dramedy has enough vigour & potency to leave most viewers enraptured with its infectious spell & fleeting vibe, and the dazzling quality of the last scene not only serves as a fitting end to a joyful ride but also affirms the film's position as one of the strongest entries of 2020. Truly worth your time & money, Another Round comes highly recommended.",

            "content": "Martin is a jaded history teacher. His relationship with his wife and family has also reached a point of staleness and his whole life seems to be one big bore. Similarly, his three best friends, teachers at the same school, have also reached a flat period in their lives. When one of them reads a theory that says that having a moderate degree of alcohol in your system at all times is a way to loosen up, they give it a go (for research purposes, of course!). It seems to work and they start upping the alcohol level. But what's the limit and what are the consequences?Great, interesting drama. Written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg who gave us such exceptional films as Festen / The Celebration (1998), Submarino (2010) and Jagten / The Hunt (2012) the plot is quite original and challenging. Covering a topic like excessive alcohol consumption and alcoholism and (on the surface) making it seem like a good thing is quite novel and sure to be confrontational and controversial, making for an intriguing journey.Ultimately it has to more nuanced than simply being a pro-alcohol drama, otherwise it would be pretty dull and predictable (think of The Hangover without the comedy, i.e. The Hangover II & III). It is more faceted than that, and some interesting twists and themes do develop, but saying anything more would give away the plot.Great performance by Mads Mikkelsen (but that's a given) and good supporting cast.Druk / Another Round deservedly won Best International Feature Film at the 2021 Oscars and Vinterberg got a nomination for Best Director.",

It's not a pro- or anti-alcohol movie; it simply shows the role that alcohol plays; the naturalistic cinematography adds to the tipsy feeling.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Language Film (Denmark), its director, Thomas Vinterberg was also nominated for Best Director. Mr. Vinterberg also directed the excellent 2012 film, THE HUNTING, and this time out, he collaborates yet again with his co-writer and lead actor from that film: Tobias Lindholm and Mads Mikkelsen, respectively.Mikkelsen (already one of the few must-watch actors) stars as Martin, a married man, father of two, and history teacher. His long-time friends include Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a PE coach; Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) a Psychology instructor; and Peter (Lars Ranthe), the music teacher. The buddies are chatting over dinner as they celebrate Nikolaj's 40th birthday, and they come to realize they are each floating through life - in a mid-life crisis of sorts, neither happy nor sad. It's at this point where Norwegian Psychiatrist Finn Skarderud's hypothesis is discussed. They agree to test Skarderud's theory by maintaining a .05% Blood Alcohol Content (BAC), even while teaching.Almost immediately, the men each feel mentally sharper, more engaged, and awakened to their lives. Martin re-connects with his wife, Anika (Maria Bonnevie), and becomes a history teacher that inspires students ... quite a change from the complaints he had been receiving. The accomplishments of Hemingway and Churchill are discussed, as if alcoholics need role models. And then, to push a good thing even farther, the men decide if .05% works, why not take it to .10%? Well that's what the men do, and of course, the results aren't so great - ranging from upsetting to tragic.Is it possible to re-discover a life that's being wasted in self-pity or a state of numbness? Can alcohol jolt one back to life after the loss of youth and the reality of adult responsibility? Mid-life crisis has been addressed in many films, and alcohol is often part of the story ... think SIDEWAYS (2004). We learn here that the Danish culture involves heavy drinking, and in Denmark, there is an extraordinarily high rate of teenage drinking.The film is well acted, and Mikkelsen is terrific. Vinterberg dedicated the film to his daughter Ida, who was scheduled to appear in the film before dying in a car crash. He strategically includes Kierkegaard's quote about life being lived forwards, but only understood backwards, and that truly is the crux of what the men are experiencing. The final scene is extraordinary and unexpected, as Mikkelsen wows with an interpretative and energetic dance to \"What a Life\" by Scarlet Pleasure. What a life, indeed. And perhaps there is hope after all.Available on HULU.",

            "review_title": "not only about drinking",
            "content": "There are two different films in 'Another Round' (the Danish title is 'Druk' which Google translates as 'Excessive Drink'), Thomas Vinterberg's 2020 film. One is about alcohol, its positive and negative effects, and how drinking is an integral part of the social life and culture of the community and perhaps of an entire people. The other is about a midlife crisis of four high school teachers who have each, in their own ways, come to a standstill in their personal and professional lives. Can alcohol be a solution? Up to what blood alcohol level? Can the morning after hangover be avoided?\nThe heroes of the film are four teachers from a Danish provincial town. Drinking seems to be part of the local culture and daily life, in a country where high school students drink countless beers at social events and where the scandals caused by them when under influence are regarded with indulgence as youth outbursts. Even teachers do not avoid the liquors, and even philosophers seem to propose a blood alcohol level of 0.05% as normal. The four teachers begin a 'psychological test' of living and exercising their teaching profession in conditions of permanent alcoholism. The results seem very positive for a while. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), the history teacher we will be following most closely, regains the class's attention and inspires students' interest in the subject he is teaching. Even his private life seems to return to a better forgotten path lost due to routine. The music teacher urges the students in the choir to listen to each other and to put their soul into the music they sing. The sports teacher motivates his football team and turns the spectacled boy intimidated by his colleagues into a scorer. Finally, the psychology teacher finds ways to help the terrified student facing final exams. Problems arise as the experiment progresses, alcohol doses increase, and inevitably, the negative effects of alcohol occur, including the tough waking up in the mornings after nights of excessive drinking. But are these changes just because of alcohol or at all because of alcohol? Maybe drinking is just a pretext to overcome the inherent crises of the professional routine, family, or life in general?\nThe script has sensitivity and subtlety and avoids the pitfalls of extremes. 'Another Round' is neither a plea in favour nor a moralising story against alcohol consumption, although I can guess that Danish viewers in particular have an opportunity to reflect on the role and place of drinking in their society. The study of characters is underlined by the extremely nuanced acting interpretation, especially of course the one of Mads Mikkelsen who adds another special role to his career and collaborations with Thomas Vinterberg. I was also impressed by the cinematic technique imagined by the director and cinematographer. The camera, fixed at the beginning, acquires mobility as the story progresses (along with the increase in alcohol levels) to become chaotic in times of crisis and later broaden the perspective and change the brightness towards the end. The confrontation of each of the heroes with the experiment is different and the outcome is not happy for everyone. Social drama and psychological study, a subtle and ostentatious story about middle age and school, teachers and students, 'Another Round' ends with an unexpected tone of optimism. Highly recommended - one of the most beautiful movies of this very special season.",

            "content": "\"Druk\" or \"Another Round\" is a Danish movie that premiered back in 2020 and now finally reached theaters here as well. And overall it was worth the wait I'd say. But first things first: The film is pretty much entirely in the Danish language and runs for slightly under two hours in the version I saw. The writer and director is Thomas Vinterberg and he made this film around the age of 50 and the man has been among Denmark's best filmmakers for quite some time now and this one here could very well propel him into the top spot. There has been a lot of quality from this little North European country in terms of movies lately, more than my country Germany can only dream of. This was one of the most lauded films this awards season. The movie was intended to be shown at Cannes first, but the pandemic got in the way. Otherwise, it would have been a huge contender there too. In any case, the film continues with its success greatly with all kinds of awards bodies, for example with a pretty much clean sweep at the European Film Awards and after Minari was not considered eligible for the foreign language category at the Oscars, there was pretty much zero doubt that this one takes the prize. Otherwise, it might have been a closer contest. Speaking of the Oscars, director Vinterberg himself was nominated here for his work behind the camera and that came as a bit of a surprise for sure. I would not call him undeserving, but I am also not sure if I think he was really deserving of that honor. Anyway, with Vinterberg there was a special story this awards season that is linked to death as well, namely when he lost one of his children under tragic circumstances. Not something that inspired this film though if I remember correctly. But still my sympathies to him.As for the cast, Danish movie fans will certainly know more cast members here than the average movie-goer, but that is perfectly fine. Everybody will of course recognize Mads Mikkelsen. He is the man you see on the poster with the bottle in his hand and he is also a star internationally, no matter if we are looking at Casino Royale, Hannibal or (soon) Fantastic Beasts. I like him quite a lot, so happy about his successes with this film here. He carried the movie nicely from beginning to end, is in most scenes and elevates an already pretty good screenplay. He does so much, even if he has little to work with. The best example for me was the scene in which he finds out about the idea of maintaining a certain blood alcohol level in order to feel better. The subtle moments there with him at the table were as good as the more obvious moments when he is the one to talk about everything that goes wrong in his life. Even his friends apparently do not take him seriously anymore, see him as some kind of victim as one of them talked to the others about something linked to his class and how the students were unhappy with his teaching and Mikkelsen's character apparently told him not to. Told him to keep it as a secret. Yet, as he finds out, he also does not act outraged. He just lets it all happen, does not stand up for himself. Another example would be the scene with all the students and parents present in which he also does not really defend himself. I mean one of the students left class while he was teaching because he was \"not up for it anymore\" or something. You see who's to blame here. Anyway, I did not want to jump this deep into the story yet, but let me also mention Thomas Bo Larsen, an actor that Vinterberg has worked with for decades now. Saw the film Festen a while ago and the two collaborated there as well. TBL's character and performance were also among the more notable aspects from this film for me and actually long before his character gained tragic relevance. He, just like the actors playing the other two friends from the quartet, was nominated for a Danish Film Award (Bodil), but managed to come short on the win in a Godfather scenario (vs. Joel Grey). Oh yeah, and for equality reasons, the actress playing the protagonist's wife was also nominated.This is a film that is really bittersweet at times. You may feel uncomfortable watching at times and feel a bit caught when you have scenes that seem initially kinda funny like how the men hide their alcohol, but in retrospective, if you know what happens later on and watch the film again, then you will perhaps not laugh anymore. Take Thomas Bo Larsen's character (the man reminds me a bit of Mickey Rourke somehow) and how he hides his alcohol in a water bottle while teaching physical education. This was also a good example already of how he was forced to lie when a boy wanted to drink something from his bottle. Or when the headmaster or who she is suspects the children of being responsible for the alcohol abuse and we know it's these four fully-grown men in fact. That was also kinda funny. Or when Mikkelsen's character runs against the wall because he had twice the intended amount of alcohol in his blood. What was definitely not funny anymore was Thomas Bo Larsen's character entering the room heavily drunk and visible for everybody. That reminded me of a statement from earlier from one of the protagonists' kids it was I think that sounded like something like how everybody knows that he is drinking. I kept wondering about that too. Could they hide it this well? Did really nobody say something or just did not want to say something. I mean people must have smelled it. And it is also debatable how the idea of giving a student alcohol before he takes an important oral exam is justifiable, even if it helped him pass. Which he would not have otherwise. Or at least not with the desired grade. Admittedly that scene felt a bit odd, like the question was really not so difficult that he could not have answered it correctly when sober.Other than such a scene here and there, this film had nice attention to detail. I think Vinterberg did especially well with parallels and how they were actually very tragic. Take the moment when we find out about one very young character peeing himself in bed and later on we have his father do the exact same thing because he was drunk. All self-control was gone. A second exemple I remember is the little boy I mentioned earlier with the water bottle and how he holds Thomas Bo Larsen's character's hand on one occasion. Later on, he is one of those holding the coffin that contains the corpse of his former football teacher. Really a tragic turn of events. The parallel I mentioned first also resulted in the man's wife/partner leaving him because she could not take it any longer. So romance relationships also play a major issue here. This also applies to Mikkelsen's character. His wife also leaves him. Maybe only temporary as we find out with these short messages towards the end, but still. We also see how he gets violent on one occasion. This is also not a matter of keeping it all secret, even if the men do, but we find out on several occasions that they are not really successful. One female character asks on one occasion in a mildly funny tone something like if they are drinking again. That felt pretty fitting. It's an inconvenient subject. On the one hand a basis for fun and feeling better, maybe even feeling something again at all as we see when he deals with his class with the alcohol in his blood for the first time there, on the other hand, something that can literally destroy everything. But nonetheless we also find out about the positive sides. The protagonist's wife also appreciates her man for the first time in years. They have great sex even. I still struggled with the way they presented her unfaithfulness here as if it is something that was justified in any way. Maybe I am not up-to-date anymore, but I think that you should always leave your partner before cheating on him.That is pretty much it. There are a handful of moments, especially in the first half, where the film almost feels fully as a comedy, but in retrospective it is not, even if it says so here on imdb. I mean it's still kinda funny how they do not get the fresh fish at the supermarket and, fully drunk then, joke about catching it from the water, even try to do so. Catch a crab and want to use it as bait for the fish afterwards. In any case, this is a film that will probably only really make you laugh on first watch. It gets a lot darker quickly. The shot you see on the poster is from the very end. It looks like fun. He is partying together with his students who now adore him (especially after the interesting \"who would you elect\" discussion), but the truth is that the ending could not be any more depressing. He fully gave in to his alcoholism now, could have lost his only shot at getting back together with his wife and when he jumps into the water, the water that should haunt him, fill him with grief because of what it did to his friend, he forgot about all of it in his drug-induced ecstasy. A shot that will stay in your mind for sure. This is when the closing credits roll in. The song (\"What a Life\" by Scarlet Pleasure) played during this scene I really liked a lot. Fit the moment nicely as well. You can also hear it at the start with the youth partying again to an extent that has you wonder if it still feels right, especially the synchronous vomiting. Another pretty memorable parallel. I think this is one of the defining films on alcohol(ism) in the 21st century by now, even if I must say the gigantic awards attention feels a bit exaggerated. This review is by the way coming from somebody who experienced severe abuse of alcohol in his closest family too, even if it happened decades ago. I give it a thumbs-up and there was never any doubt for me if I could. A good film overall with great moments here and there. Just no excellence. Go check it out. October 2021: Upon rewatch, I decided to add another two stars as I liked it even more this time and I think this deserves to be included among the best films of 2020.",

            "content": "I went to watch this movie, hoping it wouldn't be either moralizing or celebrating of Danish drinking-culture - and fortunately it delivered!\nWell I don't believe it was fortune or luck, but rather a deeply thought through film from Vinterberg. Before I went to watch it I saw a couple of interviews with the director to get a grasp of his vision. He emphasized that the quote at the beginning was in many ways the key to understand the film itself.\n\"What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream's content\" - Kierkegaard\nThus it is not so much about drinking, but rather it tackles the reason for all the drinking. It is about the longing for youth - a state of hope, love and vitality. We long to live life to its fullest, but we seem unable to embody that in our own lives, so we succumb to cheap methods, such as drinking. Notice how throughout the movie there is an underlying sense of depression and misery, especially in the character Martin. He attempts to fix his whole life through drinking, and it initially works, but he is unable to control it. It is not untill the last moments, where his whole life is in ruins, and his alienated wife finally admits that she still misses him that hope shines on him. Only then can he dance!\nIt shows us how hope, love and vitality isn't found at the bottom of a bottle, it is found in our most meaningful relationships and our endeavors to hold on to them! It isn't the beer that enables him in the end, it is that text from Anika.\nThus we see that drinking can be a wonderful thing as well, as long as it isn't the very thing that keeps us going in itself (Tommy's demise!). It is love and courage and daring to fail and to fall that should be our driving force, and sometimes that one drink can be the little nudge we need to embody these ideals (the student at the exam - about Kierkegaard!!), but it shouldn't be at the center of our motivation in life.",

Which is absolutely not true, and a misunderstanding. Maybe these persons comes from a society with less alcohol consumption, and see this as an unrealistic way of inciting a society to drink more.\nThe movie is in my opinion more likely criticizing the alcohol culture in Denmark, as it perfectly portrays the danish alcohol culture and how absurd it is, which makes what is actually a drama genre movie to become somewhat of a comedy, because it is so realistic, and the realism is just hilarious thought-provoking.",

            "content": "Most films that deal with the demon drink have been po-faced manifestos on the dangers of alcohol and there are very few films that celebrate drunkeness and those that do usually do so for comic effect. Thomas Vinterberg's \"Another Round\" is something of a rare exception. It's a film about drinking to excess that's indeed both funny and tragic in equal measure as it explores the theory that we all seem to have a blood alcohol level that is 0.05% too low and that we should drink enough, during daylight hours at least, to raise it to that level, where 'psychologically' we should all be at our best.The protagonists are four Danish school teachers at the same school who decide to test this hypothesis with mostly disasterous results; like all good drinkers they either forget when to stop or simply choose not to. But Vinterberg's film isn't so much about the alcohol as it is about four sad men whose lives have stagnated and who find that drinking actually makes them happy in ways that sobriety never could. It doesn't hold back on the dangers but neither is it an outright condemnation. Ultimately this is a character study with alcohol a supporting player, albeit a major one.It's also superbly acted and in particular by Thomas Bo Larsen as the sports teacher who really doesn't know when to stop and by Mads Mikkelsen, in what might be a career-best performance, as the history teacher caught in a failing marriage and it's Mikkelsen who delivers the film's coup-de-theatre, performing a remarkable dance sequence at the climax that could just earn him an Oscar nomination. \"Festen\" not withstanding, this might also be Vinterberg's best film to date and, as predicted, if does win the Best International Film Oscar it will, indeed, be a worthy winner.",

Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Sk\u00e5rderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives. For someone like me who wishes to moderate but can't and wants a binary judgement, this rubs me the wrong way.",

I can't claim to have been standing in line to get to watch \"Druk\" when it was out in the cinema, nor am I overly much of a fan of director Thomas Vinterberg in general. But \"Druk\" definitely turned out to be an entertaining movie.Not only does the movie have solid and powerful acting performances by the lead actors Mads Mikkelsen, Lars Ranthe, Magnus Millang and Thomas Bo Larsen, but it also had a very enjoyable and entertaining storyline, which turned out to be a rather accurate depiction of the Danish mentality towards alcohol in general. Sure, director Thomas Vinterberg managed to sneak in some sarcasm and jabs at the fairly laidback attitude towards alcohol, but it was done very nicely.And the characters in the movie were ones that you easily could identify with and relate to, so that definitely added a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie.The storyline in \"Druk\" turned out to be much better than I had initially thought it to be, and on that account alone - for the storyline - I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch this 2020 movie, even if you are not able to understand the Danish language - subtitles exist for a reason!My rating of \"Druk\" settles on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",

Teaching better then ever and finally reconnecting with family. Then you wind up bloodied on your neighbors doorstep with little idea how you got there or why you're there. Much like Vinterbergs 2012 feature The Hunt, Another Round stars Mads Mikkelsen. Unlike that movie, he isn't at the heart of a town wide witch hunt for crimes he didn't commit. Instead, Mads is an average history teacher living an average life.That is, until his life turns on a dime. He is a depressed, vaccant shell of a man. Unable to connect with his family and even further distant from his students, Mads seems to be drifting lazily through life. After a short 10 minutes, he and his friends decide it's time to change their boring lives. They begin trying to maintain a consistent, albeit low, blood alcohol level in an attempt to spice things up. Suddenly life is better. Mads is outgoing, energetic, and has no trouble with people.You can probably imagine, this falls apart rather quickly. As is such with alcohol, the more you rely on it, the more you need it to function. A hobby turns to a habit, then a habit into an addiction which spirals out of control. Such is life. The moment you let your guard down it punches you in the gut just to see of you're paying attention. Another Round perfectly captures this idea.However, I'm not to high on this. I think it does a good job saying what it desires and is genuinely quite entertaining. It bounces off the walls with energy while oozing a carefree attitude that was infectious. The problem is, it's pretty on the nose. There's large exposition sections that relay information to the audience in less then subtle ways. These characters are monitoring themselves through an \"essay\" on the effects they feel over time. Which gives the film room to explain itself. The problem with this is that it goes nowhere. As do many little things here and there.It seems each character is given a distict role to play in the film and it rarely pivots from those ideas. Making this incredibly predictable from the ground up. If you have a thought of where this is going based on the premise, you're probably right. Which is unfortunate because the payoff of the film feels largely unrewarding. A stark difference between The Hunt's absolutely traumatizing 3rd act.I'd still say check this out though. If you have twelve bucks and two hours to sit down at home, pull the trigger on this. It's quite entertaining, delivers a solid message, and props up some pretty great performances. Unfortunately, If you're looking for something to knock you flat with a powerful message or a satisfactory conclusion this doesn't have it. It builds to the exact place you might think and hits the nail on the head even though the nail is already embedded into it's place.",

This was one of my most anticipated films of 2020 and it certainly delivered.Another Round follows four friends, who are all teachers, that test out a theory that will make their lives better by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood.With Another Round, Thomas Vinterberg has proved once again how talented of a director he is. This is vastly different from The Hunt. That film was depressing all the way through whereas this film plays out more like a comedy. Here, Vinterberg tackles the drinking culture in Denmark and in general and I loved the way he approached it. The sequence of events stayed believable without going overboard. It sets up the characters well in the beginning as we get an understanding of how mundane their life is in contrast to the scenes that take place after they start drinking. This film could have easily taken the route of showing us all the negative aspects of alcohol but Vinterberg strikes a balance in conveying both sides of the spectrum. He shows us all the fun and happiness that can be had with drinking whilst also bringing to light the problems it can create if it starts to get excessive.Some scenes where the four main characters get extremely drunk are really funny and the actors do an exceptional job. I loved Mads Mikkelsen in The Hunt but this might be my favourite performance from him. There is so much emotional range with his character that he expresses beautifully especially during the ending where he steals the show. It's one of the best performances of 2020. Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe are also amazing and perform excellently when they're drunk. I loved the camaraderie these four actors had on screen. They all felt believable as friends and their characters which elevated the fun in the drinking scenes and the emotion during the more heartfelt scenes. Maria Bonnevie was also really good as Mikkelsen's wife in the film.Another Round is predictable but at the same time I really enjoyed it despite that.

Thus, they decide to experiment by keeping the balance and drinking ever day to increase the blood alcohol to this level. Their teaching methods become unconventional, but at the same time the students find them more relatable, and ultimately funny. This improves their quality of lives as individuals, and boosts their self-esteem.However, their experiment is not without consequence, as they soon realize when they start pushing the boundaries. 'Another Round' is a perfect illustration of drunk people - what they do and how they act and react to different situations. I thoroughly enjoyed the natural acting from a very good cast. Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Bo Larsen both starred in the excellent 2012 film 'The Hunt', and in a way this almost felt like a prequel to that film due to them once again playing friends, and Mikkelsen again starring as a teacher.

The idea is Vinterberg's primary concern, the characters are obviously a distant second. There's not enough background material for me to care for any of the characters.Also, Vinterberg takes a lot of shortcuts to get his points across instead of actually narrating. Here's what I mean:1. The carelessness of the students in the beginning of the movie is deeply exaggerated.2. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) asks his wife if he's become boring. I cringed when I heard him ask that. Come on, Vinterberg: Show, don't tell. We're supposed to see (!) that he's boring, not that he's literally asking her.3. Exaggerated focus on close-up's to show how amazed the students are by Martin, once he's had something to drink. Vinterberg is persuading us, he's not just showing the action.Overall, the film suffers from a lack of depth. Here's what I mean:1. The \"real life\" montage of drunk politicians is extremely misplaced and takes the focus off the narrative. And this is the case in point: Vinterberg is not as interested in the characters as he is in the idea.2. The alleged friendship between the four men is never established. We never get an idea of what they talk to each other about besides their \"mission\". Vinterberg just shows them laughing and then adds sentimental music for emotional effect. This is lazy writing.3. Martin's \"change\" already occurs 18 minutes into the movie (where the four of them sit at the table). His character is not yet established at this point.In conclusion: The movie definitely has its share of memorable and well-directed scenes, but overall it lacks depth and a reason for us to care for any of these characters.",

Basically, teachers Martin (BAFTA nominated Mads Mikkelsen), Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), Peter (Lars Ranthe) and Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) are colleagues and friends at a high school in Copenhagen. All four struggle with unmotivated students and feel that their lives have become boring and uneventful. At a dinner celebrating Nikolaj's 40th birthday, the group discuss a theory by psychiatrist Finn Sk\u00e5rderud, that having a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.05 makes you more creative and relaxed. While the group dismisses the theory, Martin, who is depressed due to his marriage failing, is inspired and starts to drink at work. The rest of the group\neventually decides to join him, noting their experiences as an experiment to test Sk\u00e5rderud's theory. They agree to a set of rules: their BAC should never be below 0.05 and that they should not drink after 8:00pm. Within a short period of time, Martin, Tommy, Peter and Nikolaj find both their work and private lives more enjoyable. Martin particularly is delighted that he is finally managing to reconnect with his wife and children. The group find this positivity a reason to agree to take the experiment further, and the four increase the daily BAC limit to 0.10. Continuing to find their lives improved, the group decides to attempt binge drinking to observe how their bodies and minds respond. They all have a fun night, but after coming home drunk, both Martin and Nikolaj are confronted by their families. Martin's family express their worries that he is becoming an alcoholic, saying that he has been noticeably drunk for weeks. Martin and his wife Anika (Marie Bonnevie) have a heated argument, during which she admits to infidelity, and Martin leaves her. The group soon experience the negative consequences of the experiment and abandon it. Months later, all the members of the group have stopped drinking during the day except for Tommy, who has become an alcoholic. On day at work whilst drunk, Tommy boards his boat with his dog, he sails out on the ocean and dies in an accident. Following Tommy's funeral, the three remaining friends go out to dinner and are reluctant to drink the alcohol which is served. While dining, Martin receives a message from his wife who tells him that she is willing to give their marriage another chance. Martin, Peter and Nikolaj join the recently graduated students in celebrating and allow themselves to drink again while the partying takes place at the harbour. Martin, a former jazz ballet dancer, had for some time been urged by colleagues and refused to dance. In high spirits and influenced by the alcohol, Martin dances with the students and guests. His dance becomes increasingly energetic and joyous, and it ends as he leaps into the water, on a freeze frame of him in mid-air. Also starring Susse Wold as Rektor. Mikkelsen and his three co-stars give convincing performances as the drunken chums who find a new lease of life, their lessons whilst tipsy in the classroom and in the outdoors are fun to watch, with clever camerawork to capture the controlled inebriation and emotional moments, and it has both amusing and dramatic scenes that keep things moving nicely, a great comedy-drama. It won the Oscar for Best International Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it Golden Globe was Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language.

So, a little misleading perhaps, but a very well done film that emotionally drains you.I'm convinced Mads Mikkelsen is one of the most talented actors of his generation. Admittedly, I believe this is the first I've watched with him speaking his native tongue. Which only adds to how good he is, because he's been great in everything else where he's not even speaking his first language. No surprise, he is very good in this.The theory of maintaining a .05 BAC is interesting and I believe it does have positive benefits. However, as seen in the film, there is a fine line which can be easily crossed and lead to terrible tragedies. Moderation in everything is best practice I would argue.",

(Source: IMDb)I'm glad that I had the chance to enjoy watching Another Round at home and that's thanks to the Toronto International Film Festival.After his unforgettable performance in \"The Hunt\", Mads Mikkelsen gives us another great performance as he plays Martin in \"Another Round\", if I would choose which one is his best performance, I would choose \"The Hunt\" for sure and that's because of the emotional and deep feelings that character had and Mads Mikkelsen was able to express that perfectly, In \"Another Round\" his character is kind of similar to the one in \"The Hunt\" but the difference is that in \"The Hunt\" his character was battling a difficult time of his life as he gave up on it and doesn't have anything left to lose, he was desperate, but in \"Another Round\" it's kind of the opposite, he is trying to improve his life by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in his blood hoping it'll work, and Mads Mikkelsen was brilliant in that, sometimes by just looking into his eyes, you can feel what's inside of him, grief / happiness / loneliness / sadness and etc...\nThe supporting cast was was brilliant, his other 3 friends were all great in their performances, when they wanted us to laugh we did laugh and when they wanted us to get emotional we did indeed get emotional, perfect casting.For those who don't know both \"The Hunt\" and \"Another Round\" are directed by Thomas Vinterberg and that's why you might notice that the movie is a bit smilier to \"Th Hunt\" with the set design, the characters, and the message of the film, for example, the scene where the 4 friends went to the supermarket when they were drunk kind of reminded me of the one in \"The Hunt\" when he went inside the supermarket and got kicked out, but in my opinion, I prefer \"Another Round\" than \"The Hunt\", I gave \"The Hunt\" a 6.5/10 and I was disappointed by it especially that it has so many good reviews and that's why I was worried of watching \"Another Round\" because I felt like it would be the same but I was wrong.\n\"Another Round\" had so many conversations that were long but they were so fun not like \"The Hunt\", all the conversations were boring and cold, for example in \"Another Round'' the scene that all of them were having dinner and that's when we started to know the story of the movie and where the movie is taking us, the movie started off with happiness and with so much energy but as we were going towards the movie it started to go down little by little and slowly and that's what I loved about it. The movie makes you wonder what will happen at the end and what their lives will be in the end and that's a thing that made me want to watch and enjoy the movie, the film made us happy and sad and happy and sad again all the time.The set design was beautiful, the camera angles were able to capture the beauty of the set design and that's not a new thing to a Thomas Vinterberg film and maybe that might be the main reason why this movie remained me of \"The Hunt\". Martin's apartment, the school, and the dinner table with the amazing designs of the cups and glasses.\nThe custom designs were pretty okay, they were matching the environment very well.Finally, the music was brilliant and a great choice, especially that song at the very end when Martin was dancing around, such a great scene and a nice ending to a nice movie.So glad that I was able to be one of the first people to watch & review \"Another Round\", great movie, and highly recommend it.My rating is: 8/10",

Some reviewers here have found the plot to be boring and predictable. I pity them for not being able to switch off their analytical mind and simply enjoy a really well done movie.Yes, the acting is excellent and the direction and cutting is so to the bone precise. But the thing that makes this movie a gem is that it is 100% true to life! I can say that with confidence because I am Danish middle class myself; I went to college (way back) and I even had two alcoholic teachers (one of whom stepped out in front of a cargotruck during my time there).We have a 20 year old granddaughter, whose afterparty after graduating we attended two years ago ... and we saw first hand the young peoples heavy drinking. It was totally excessive, but this is their life, not ours (- yes, I'm Danish; I know and trust they will find their way). I was moved by these young peoples (most of whom we hadn't met before) kindness, openness and trust towards us, who are 40 years older than them. This generational trait was also shown in the film, in their relation with their teachers. There is a lot of trust and goodness there - which makes me hopeful for the future!And the depiction of the friendship of the four male main characters was spot on: They are best friends, yet they are quite private and holding back about the real pains of their lives. And typically Scandinavian, they need to become a little tipsy before opening up. And when they in the movie do open up a little, you see the warm support of their friends - never overly emotional or verbally drilling into the core of what the pain is about. Just a few words - in the movie: \"Did you ever consider finding someone else?\" The love for each other is there as a subtle undercurrent. This is usually how male, Scandinavian friendship is - unlike female friendships where support in such situations is much more verbally expressive and psychotherapeutic ... and oftentimes also more condemning of the behaviour of their men (justified, they would no doubt argue ;-)And the depiction of how our Scandinavian lifestyle, with all its correctness, good intentions and responsible behaviour, risks sucking out all of lifes spontaneity and juiciness, is also spot on. If you want to get a feeling of what our culture is like, in good and bad, go see this movie!In Druk Thomas Vinterberg - while acknowledging the destructiveness of alcoholism - celebrates the qualities of being a little tipsy. You may or may not agree with this. That doesn't detract from this being what it is: An absolutely brilliant movie!",

Now, renamed amore comforting Another Round for worldwide audience appeal, the film's positive point of view about alcohol consumption seems to simplify this addiction issue to a dangerous degree. The entire premise, that alcohol becomes a real confidence booster, seems so politically incorrect and far-fetched, despite the fine acting on display.Four teachers (Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe) are caught in a mid-life crisis, unhappy with their lives and decide to conduct their own scientific experiment. Following a psychiatric theory that all humans need some alcohol in their systems to become more creative, they let the drinking games begin to loosen up their inhibitions and allow themselves to become better educators. Perimeters to this experiment are set (no drinking after 8 pm like Hemingway and staying within the 0.5 safety range). And voil\u00e9! Once dull and somber instructors, the quartet are suddenly transformed into exciting professionals in the classroom. Of course, no one immediately around senses their inebriation, none of the other unhip teachers or their family members. And, of course, the group slowly bends their own rules and increases their alcoholic ways to disastrous results. Such are the best laid plans.The screenplay by Tobias Lindholm and the director deals with the country-wide drinking problem in Denmark that affects young and old alike. But the storytelling is contrived and confusing. The teachers' motives and actions remain suspect. As they eventually go on their predictable bender with no real consequences, credibility is completely lost. One begins to question the immortality and selfishness of their behaviors and the overall logic of their philosophical study. (One teacher actually advises a student to consume alcohol before and during a test. Another encourages youthful drinking games as a coming-of-age adventure. At that point, this teetotaler wondered when parental uproar or administrative observations would occur. It doesn't. No intervention or job losses. Hard to believe.)Still, the actors are superb, especially Mr. Mikkelsen as Martin. He carry his character's burden internally and erupts with a vengeance when his intake level is fully sated. His final scene is quite memorable and a joyous celebration as his dancing skills are showcased. But just what is the message moviegoers are to take with them? Alcoholism can be fun?Another Round is a cinematic hangover without the humor. The thinking throughout Mr. Vinterberg's well-made film is cloudy and lacking in good judgment. It's a creative buzzkill. (GRADE: C+)",

            "content": "Short summaryVinterberg (so far from his previous film The Hunt) makes a portrait of the midlife crisis of four friends. His idea of a Faustian pact that they make between themselves and with alcohol to overcome it is interesting as I propose and it is beautifully musicalized, very well directed and superbly acted. But the film sadly slides down the slope of the obvious, the conservative message regarding its winners and losers and, worse, demagoguery. It is no accident that he won an Oscar.ReviewFour friends, secondary school teachers in the same school, decide to do an experiment, following the advice of a Norwegian psychiatrist: to start the systematic consumption of alcohol in order to be able to deal with the discomfort caused by their work and family life.Mads Mikkelsen plays a history teacher fed up with teaching, distracted in the classroom and cut off from his wife. His friends are teachers of physical education, music and psychology and with few brushstrokes, we find out about their respective discomforts. One of them proposes to follow the indications of Finn Skarderud, a Norwegian psychiatrist, who supposedly recommends a certain level of alcohol in the blood to improve the relationship with an environment that produces discomfort. In this way, the four friends make a pact and begin to drink alcohol to ensure that daily blood alcohol level.The film shows us the effects that are obtained, in this experiment sustained as a group, but with individual consequences. It is not by chance that the film begins with a ritual in which the students, at the end of high school, carry out a race where it is necessary to drink an enormous amount of alcohol as a requirement to win it. The pact of the four friends has an undeniable adolescent look and needs this kind of scientific legitimation for the acquisition of a habit that ends up challenging that premise. Even an example that Mikkelsen uses in a class incurs a fallacious investment that corresponds to the one that he proposes in the experiment. On the other hand, from the start, they consider the consumption of alcohol as an instrument and not as enjoyment in itself. All this in a society with a satiety fed by its basic needs satisfied and with a very high average intake of alcohol.Another round is of those films in which one wonders, averaging the story and with growing discomfort, what its director is proposing to tell us, what is the message. Because all fiction contains a message, or at least raises questions. And I continue with this bewilderment once I finished watching it and now, despite all the considerations I made in the previous paragraph. Will it be so obvious that you have to drink in moderation or that drinking can never be a method of improvement? And this does not speak well of the film.This kind of portrait that Vinterberg makes (so far from his film The Hunt) of the midlife crisis of four friends and the idea of a Faustian pact that they make between themselves and with alcohol to overcome it is interesting, although it is beautifully set to music. , very well directed and superbly acted, it unfortunately slides down the slope of the obvious, the conservative message regarding its winners and losers and, what is worse, demagoguery.

Mads Mikkelsen comes up with yet another tremendous performance, ably supported by Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe, and Magnus Millang (who play high-school teachers and friends). Their teaching careers and personal lives are going through a lull and when one of them suggests that maintaining a certain % of alcohol in their systems could help revive both, the others quickly buy into the idea.That the story takes place in Denmark, a country with a unique drinking culture, only helps. Alluding to a wacky theory from Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud that the blood-alcohol content in humans is always too low, the quartet begins ingesting alcohol into their systems before their classes. This yields short-term positive changes in themselves and their students. However, the inevitable tragedies associated with drinking soon follow suit. Director Thomas Vinterburg (who co-writes with Tobias Lindholm), however, doesn't push viewers into total darkness. Another Round shows us how drinking could likely wreck lives, careers, and more but done in a controlled fashion, that mild high could do these folks some good.Yet, it isn't a film that goes all the way in what it tries to profess. When the drinking gets cathartic and it starts to affect each of the four guys differently, Thomas Vinterburg rushes to the 'safe storytelling' zone. Even if that's the case, Another Round has one of the most enjoyable climaxes in recent memory, with a drunk Mikkelsen pulling some crazy moves. Mikkelsen's performance is, in fact, what holds the film together especially during its drab middle portions. As a performer, he doesn't hit one false note, adding much-needed emotional heft to the plot. Also, I wouldn't see that scene, where Peter tells a nervous student to down a few shots before his viva voce, anywhere else. Cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen also adds some nice alcohol-induced touches.",

            "content": "Absolutely love foreign language films and have been meaning to see more Scandanavian films for a while now. 'Another Round' was seen for a few major reasons. One was the very positive reviews and that it was seen on the highest of recommendations by one of my sisters, whose film taste is relatively similar to me. Two was my huge admiration for Mads Mikkelsen, always liked him enormously since 'Casino Royale' and he keeps growing with every role he does. The final one was the subject, one that has been an issue for decades and still is now speaking as someone who had a problem with it a couple of years ago.This reviewer is absolutely enthralled to say that 'Another Round' pretty much bowled me over. It is not an easy watch, but considering the subject which is not an easy one that was appropriate. On top of being wonderfully acted and successful as a dramedy in both the comedic and dramatic aspects, 'Another Round' is enormously in its pull no punches treatment of a difficult yet crucial to address subject matter while still being accessible. Despite being incredibly positively reviewed, it is deserving of a lot more praise than it gets and was very under-rewarded at the time.It is difficult to know when to begin with the praise, but it is an incredibly well acted film. With the best performance coming from Mikkelsen, who is beyond mesmerising in a contender for his best performance yet. Subtle yet incredibly powerful, and one that deserved a lot more award attention than it got. Everybody is never less than great, with scintillating chemistry between the quartet of actors undergoing what happens, though not quite on Mikkelsen's level. Thomas Vinterberg's direction is expertly throughout.Furthermore, 'Another Round' is a very well made film, not lavish but the photography is very clever in showing through the roving, probing use of camera techniques how the effects and aftermath of drinking too much affects the person experiencing it. Loved how intimate some of it was too, with a lot of close ups that shows off also how great Mikkelsen is acting with his facial expressions and eye contact, but it is great showing how easy it is to identify with the quartet in question. The music has presence when used but is not overbearing.When it comes to the writing, 'Another Round' is very thought provoking, the comedic elements are genuinely funny without trivialising the subject and the drama is scarily uncompromising in a way that's tense and devastating while making anybody going through similar think long and hard about what excessive alcohol does. Appreciated too that it showed not only what it does to those undergoing what happens but also what it does to the families of them (devastatingly done too) or anybody else involved, too many films that cover difficult, relevant topics don't do this enough or at all.Storytelling-wise, 'Another Round' triumphs. It never felt dull to me, while also hitting hard. The climax is sensational, in ways that are uplifting, moving and inspirational, people talk about Mikkelsen's \"cringe-worthy\" dancing, to me it was somewhat adorable. Appreciated its showing of the alcohol limits and measurements, as that will contribute to people going through this doing something about it, this reviewer thinks, so it was something of an education.Only one scene didn't ring true, which was towards the end with a shot of alcohol being encouraged before an exam. That struck me as unrealistic and also a very bad message for university students (university being a period where some alcoholism has stemmed from), having had an acquaintance who did go through this and the outcome was not the same one shown in the film.Concluding, absolutely excellent film, among the better ones seen in the past year or so, that deserves to be better known. 9/10.",

Why does one need alcohol in mass quantities in order to survive a life which would be simply unbearable without drinking?For me the answer was: Life is pretty much unbearable, with or without consuming alcohol. But if you drink you might have a bit more fun and intensity in the meantime.

I mean, is the story realistic? Quite so. It's quite possible that this could happen. Unfortunately it happens bluntly, with no finesse and seems to damn any drinker to social suicide. Even the positive effects come out of nowhere, only to then be replaced by really negative ones, following the tired formula that nothing good comes for free.In a way, it's an unfunny Trainspotting, where drugs are replaced with alcohol, with remarkably similar effects. It is impossible to not take the film as a critique of the Danish propensity for heavy drinking, which diminishes the great performance of the lead actors a little.Bottom line: a midlife crisis examination of alcoholism with great performances but a formulaically moralistic viewpoint that takes away from the experience.",

What starts out as intoxicating soon becomes dangerous, as their purely scientific trial threatens to devolve into all-out alcoholism. The different men handle their booze in different ways, though they all inevitably fly too close to the sun at one point or another. I've seen some accusations that the film condones substance abuse, but I don't think that's the case. Though it doesn't have an overt anti-alcohol message, it makes sure to show both the good and the bad of its focal fluid and ultimately advocates for moderation above all else. Plus, its teenage characters are supposed to be either seventeen or eighteen and the legal age for buying alcohol in Denmark is sixteen. Though I don't think it's a good idea for children to consume what's, essentially, poison, I think this flick is just honest to the society in which its characters and filmmakers live. Basically, this aspect is more of a societal and cultural issue than one specific to this feature. The film isn't a clear-cut morality tale, rather a relatively realistic examination of human emotion in all its imperfect glory. It depicts happiness, sadness, complacency, resentment, enjoyment and anxiety; it runs the gamut of emotion, both in what it depicts and it what it elicits, to craft an unbiased portrait of its subjects that resonates on a surprisingly deep level. Its bittersweet final scene, which mixes melancholy with jubilation in a bizarrely touching way, is a microcosm of its overall nuance. The movie is a touch slow in its second act, but it's typically an entertaining and engaging experience. Its performances are remarkable, too. It's as often funny as it is heartbreaking. Generally, it feels like a grounded and honest experience that manages to be life-affirming without being close to saccharine. It isn't happy, so to speak, just truthful. Truth can be beautiful. 7/10.",

Another Round is a great story by the way, but only if you look at those attractive elements. Rest, it has the same typical old-school-drama on Life. The use of alcoholism was never done like this and that's where the film interests you and at one moment it begins to look like a path-breaking film only to follow the mainstream theories of personality development and acknowledgement of rediscovering that lost joy in busy lifestyle. Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood. With the solid reference of Psychiatrist Finn Sk\u00e5rderud's theories it looks a magnificent idea and till the intermission point it works very impressively too. However, the second half goes to follow the general theories of life such as family issues like parenthood, relationship blunders, extramarital affair and all, along with the typical boring regretful speeches and bla bla. See, it looks uninteresting as hell. I mean, we have seen the same stuff again and again over the years and more effective too, then why the hell this would be path-breaking story falls into the same gutter? That's the last freaking mistake one could have done and unfortunately it is done here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is worthy enough to grab your attention. Especially, the cinematic brilliance of Vinterberg and fantastic performance of Mads Mikkelsen very well supported by Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe and Magnus Millang. Some scenes in the film are simply amazing while some are typically outdated. Overall, a very good film or better say a very good attempt to do something unusual which lacks the outbreaking theories.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "Taking risks and taking responsibility can be two sides of the same coin but never seem to mesh in Thomas Vinterberg's (\"Far from the Madding Crowd\") comedy-drama Another Round, Denmark's submission for Best Foreign Film at the 2021 Oscars. Written by Tobias Lindholm (\"The Hunt\") and Vinterberg, the premise of the film lies in a dubious theory ascribed to Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud who asserts that the blood-alcohol content of all human beings is always too low, a 0.05% blood-alcohol content deficit. People would be far more engaged and energetic, he argues, if they maintained a level of 0.10%. In other words, the answer to all of life's riddles lies at the bottom of a bottle.Vinterberg is willing to give the theory a test drive, \"We've seen so many movies about how alcohol kills people,\" he says, \"but there's a reason a lot of people drink. It can make you fly.\" One is tempted to recall the old adage that if God wanted people to fly, he would have given them wings. Willing and eager to test this theory, however, are four middle-aged teachers in a public high school whose zest for life has faded like the afternoon sun: History teacher, Martin (a craggy-faced Mads Mikkelsen, \"Arctic\"); PE teacher and soccer coach, Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen, \"The Wave\"); music teacher, Peter (Lars Ranthe, \"Hunting Season\"); and psychology teacher, Nikolaj (Magnus Millang, \"Heavy Load\"), all with seemingly nothing to give their lives true meaning in spite of having advantages that three-quarters of the world's population would beg for.The film begins with a fun drinking game and ends with more drinking fun, but there's a world of pain in between. Vinterberg coaxes excellent performances from his four leading men and we root for them. At the beginning of the experiment which includes drinking while at work during the day, results appear to be 95% effective, though they will soon require a booster shot. Martin, whose history lessons have ranged from dull to comatose, achieves liftoff after a few drinks and engages his students in a fun game of choosing which one of three unnamed people make better role models, the heavy drinkers: Churchill and Hemingway, or the vegetarian, non-drinker Adolf Hitler.For the students in this incongruously small class, Hitler seems to be the obvious choice, one that allows Martin to make the point that the world does not always meet our expectations. Peter inspires his choir to sing from the heart. Tommy instills confidence (and some hitherto unseen soccer skills) in a diminutive youngster known not so endearingly as \"Specs,\" while Nikolaj handles an anxiety-ridden student with tact and understanding, and his dead-on-arrival marriage to Amalie (Helene Reingaard Neumann, \"The Command\") also becomes revived. Each man responds to the experiment in different ways but the warm friendship and camaraderie of the four men remains constant.Eventually, they decide that if a little alcohol can work such wonders, why not try a little more? Layers of sadness soon bubble up and the men are forced to reevaluate how much satisfaction they have been experiencing in their relationships and in their jobs. As the amount of drinking increases, however, so does the downward spiral and the loss of a job by one teacher after he was caught staggering and mumbling in school. At home, Martin virtually ignores his two sons while his wife Anika (Maria Bonnevie, \"Becoming Astrid\") works at night. He asks Anika if she thinks he's a bore, a characterization the viewer has long since concluded in the positive. Her reply that \"you are not the same person that I once knew\" is hardly surprising and the passive and affectless Martin cannot raise enough emotion to tell her that he is leaving, except for a few sudden outbursts of anger on his way out the door. There are more traumas to follow, but overall Vinterberg makes drinking quite an acceptable way to bond and enjoy yourself without the word alcoholism ever coming up.While Another Round examines the tug of war between celebrating life and acting irresponsibly, the film's message is ambiguous. Vinterberg says that he and Lindholm \"deliberately avoided having a message.\" The film he asserts is, \"a survey and exploration not only of alcohol usage but of the uncontrollable. It is just a catalyst for talking about being inspired in life.\" I guess drinking can be a wonderful thing unless it destroys your life and that of those around you. \"You find a lot of AA people in the cinemas who feel they've been betrayed,\" Vinterberg says, \"They've seen how bad it can go, and it's an interesting open end, I guess.\" Do tell.",

            "content": "The Good: I loved Another Round when I first saw it, and honestly, I still love it. It might be my favourite film of 2020, to be honest.This movie is really two stories: one is about a group of friends who want to jazz up their lives and embark a very socially unacceptable experiment. The friendship dynamic is unbelievably realistic and well developed. I felt watching this movie that I knew these men and the film really conveys their history and familiarity with one another. The performances are excellent, especially Madds Mikkelsen, who feels so relatable and human here. I don't know, maybe it's my subjective feeling as a young man hoping I can retain friendships like this or maybe it's just objectively well done, but this aspect of the story really gets me.But, I have to be honest, what Another Round is *really* about is Denmark, alcohol, and the Danish drinking culture. The film is really a thesis statement as to how alcohol - for better or worse - is essential to Danish society. This movie depicts the highest of highs and the lowest of lows and instead of shaking his finger disapprovingly, Vinterberg shrugs. \"It is what it is,\" might as well be the motto of this film. Alcohol isn't going anywhere and to ignore why it's been used by people longer than the wheel or the written word is foolish. Some people may find this offensive - I'm sure we all know the evils alcohol has caused as well - but I found it refreshing (pun intended). We're so used to a particular morality with Hollywood films that I really liked how Another Round is more of a celebration of cracking a few cold ones with your friends more than anything else.The cinematography is also outstanding in this movie. Whatever Danish town this is (and I think it's kept purposefully vague), I felt like it was my home by the end of the movie. The environment is so well defined and characterized here; Another Round is both a very personal story and a story about a people and a place. Some of the scenes with these guys just hanging out are so well done that it makes you want to be there with them. It's just awesome, I'm a sucker for well done party scenes.The Bad: So, upon rewatch, I did notice a couple of problems with the movie. The ending is a little under baked; things just sort of fall into place and it wraps up a bit too conveniently. Not that we necessarily need an explanation why Martin's wife has an about face, but it would have been nice for there to be a scene with them reconnecting.A big thing happens at the end that doesn't elicit the reaction you'd imagine from these characters, and personally, I felt it should have been pushed up and then the final third of the movie could be people coming to terms with it. That's just me though, I'm no Vinterberg.The Ugly: Another Round joins Sideways as one of the all time best movies where alcohol is almost a character. I challenge you to watch this and not crave a cold beer or a satisfying glass of wine. It's honestly really hard. To all those who imbibe, maybe a little too much sometimes: Sk\u00e5l!",

            "content": "Danish \"Druk\", directed deftly by Thomas Vinterberg, is a strongly entertaining commentary on Danish drinking. Mads Mikkelsen shows again why he's Denmark's premier actor with an emotionally complex and strangely painful journey of a man in his \"mid-life\" crisis that endeavors to embrace alcohol. There's something reminiscent of the British \"Full Monty\" here reflected in \"Druk\" - Monty was a lovely movie over 20 years earlier - \"Druk\" has similar story patterns and camaraderie between its characters. While \"Full Monty\" was about economic woes, \"Druk\" goes more beneath the surface and deals with complex emotional problems brought upon by taxing work and family time tug-of-wars. Alcohol seems to strangely save the day to start, although we know where this is leading, as there is always a control issue on the horizon blurring the lines between alcohol dependency and responsible drinkingl There doesn't seem to be an answer, and Vinterberg may not be looking for one. Further it may be an examination into ills, benefits, but indeed pervasiveness. Great drama with well mixed in comedy. 8/10.",

This is one of those movies that when it ends you're like that's it? There's no point, no moral, nothing to write home about. I will never watch this again nor can I recommend it. One thing I would like to comment on is that I was blown away that the TEACHERS told a couple of their students who were struggling with their grades to drink alcohol before their finals. This is High School. The teachers handed them hard liquor they kept on them at school & told them to belt back a few big swigs off it because it would help them do better on their finals & not to worry they wouldn't tell anyone. What kind of example does this set? Is that really good advice? Is that truly a good habit to get into? Relying on alcohol to solve the issues they'll run into throughout the rest of their life? I don't think so.",

STRANGE film), ANOTHER ROUND tells the tale of 4 Danish High School teachers who are stuck in a rut (call it a mid-life crisis) and come up with the idea of being slightly drunk all of the time to elevate their lives.The first half of the film flirts with \"Frat Boy Party\" territory as the 4 friends embark on the quest to see if staying slightly drunk elevates them. The results are quite mixed with moments of joy and triumph mixed in with some cringe-inducing moments. But then Vinterberg mines the \"dark side\" of alcoholism and the film takes a dark - and more interesting turn - only to have another turn at the end that just didn't work for me.Mikkelsen, of course, is quite good in the central role of Martin - the family man in mid-life depression crisis that kicks into \"Frat Boy\" mode when drinking \"just enough\". His character switches back and forth between these 2 modes and Mikkelsen handles these changes like the terrific actor that he is.His 3 friends played by Magnus Millang, Lars Ranthe and Thomas Bo Larson are all equally depressed and switch back and forth right along with Martin. Unfortunately, none of these 3 have the \"it\" factor of Mikkelsen, so are really kept in his shadow - with the possible exception of a few moments by Larson.This is the first film I have seen from Vinterberg, but what I have read about him is that this film pretty much sums up his career. An interesting idea, told fairly well with an ending that doesn't really land. And that's what I thought of this film. I'm glad I saw it, but it will fade after a time, as the ending just didn't provide enough depth to keep ANOTHER ROUND with me for long.Letter Grade: B-6 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",

Martin, is a high school teacher that basically lost any kind of motivation. He does not enjoy his job anymore, he cannot communicate with his family and he feels so distant from his wife. One day he decides to do an experiment with his colleagues: drinking a little bit of alcohol during the day, in order to be more energetic. The first part is basically a comedy: a group of friends finding purpose in life again. There are many funny scenes that made me laugh. Then, the light-hearted tone becomes darker, things get out of hand and in the second part, the film depicts the dramatic consequences of their choices.I think that the director does a really good job exploring which may be some of the causes for alcohol addiction, how this can influence your everyday life and people around you. The script really deepens characters and their friendship; I felt really attached to them. I think that there was not one single scene wasted, everything fit just perfectly. The cast is phenomenal and it is composed by pretty big names of Danish cinema: Mads Mikkelsen and Thomas Larsen are two of the most famous actors in the industry, but they did not shadow Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe, who are as good. Every single actor bringed something to the table, and contributed to tell an emotional story. The very last scene with the song performed by Scarlet Pleasure is one of the most beautiful things that I have watched this year.I absolutely enjoyed \"Another Round\". This movie represents the return of the roots for Mikkelsen, in every sense.

This way you can reduce problems and think more creatively. The four high school teachers know how to teach in an inventive and more relaxed way. As the four drink more and more often, they gradually learn that there is also a negative side to drinking alcohol. They have to determine how far they are willing to go for their experiment, before things get too out of hand.Because the Danish director comes from the country that last year had one of the highest percentages of alcohol use among teenagers in the world, he tries to show with this film what the consequences of alcohol can be. Despite the fact that they try to bring out the consequences of alcohol with this film, they show in a well-balanced way what both the positive and negative sides of the use of alcohol can be. In this way, as a viewer, you get the chance to fill in how you think about alcohol until the end of the film without feeling bad about it.The four leading roles of the film not only come across as colleagues but also as good friends of each other. They continue to support each other during their experiment, but also when one of the four has a personal life.

I'm not super familiar with his other films other than knowing they're critically praised. So this was basically my first Vinterberg film. I gotta say I'm really impressed. Another Round is a fun and dramatic film that goes to places you wouldn't expect. Leading the film, Mads Mikkelsen gives us a great performance. I really enjoyed his character and what he's going through. The same for the other three. They're all doing this experiment for some fun but they have issues to deal with already. The constant drinking is only adding up to it. The most intriguing part was seeing what consequences would arise amidst all the fun. The comedy lands well and I chuckled a few times. But the drama behind it all exceeded my expectations. The last act had me itching to see what would come up next.Thomas Vinterberg is a great director. Just by watching this film, I am really interested in his other works. He has a refreshing sort of approach but reminds us of what we have to deal with by having a little fun, even if it's illegal. The beginning didn't quite hook me in. I thought by that I would just feel like it would just be good rather than the raving reviews. After a while, it really starts to pick up and I didn't want to stop. The portrayal of this growing alcoholism is good. They didn't pose it as a good or bad thing. Rather it's a neutral view of what it's like and how it affects people differently. Each of the characters have a different reaction. I'm glad there's variation and not just them getting flat out drunk the whole time. And the way the film concludes is a great ending. I don't want to spoil but it just really works.

I also find it odd that the title, \"Druk,\" is called \"Another Round\" in English, which has a celebratory ring to it, but literally translates to \"Binge Drinking,\" with its obviously more negative connotations. Appropriately enough, then, \"Druk\" manages a balancing act, wobbly though it may be, between those two interpretations. It's not a maudlin lecture on the dangers of the devil's drink, nor some crapulous Hollywood-type celebration of alcoholism (say, \"Old School\" (2003)). It lies passed out somewhere in between, tipsy in its veering one way or another variously, but ultimately avoiding the fate of more insufferable drunkards.But for naught it would seem, or at least nothing more than another mid-life crisis, male bonding flick--an entire genre I, for one, could do without, although I'm sure I would've enjoyed it more if I were drinking, too.... Anyways, Mads Mikkelsen carries the movie. None of the other characters are remarkable, and one hardly cares about the students for which the drunk teachers oversee their education. The supposed research paper they plan to write of their experience and its flimsy philosophical grounding is a scientifically-slapdash joke to begin with. Personally, though, I have no doubt some could perform better, especially simple tasks easier than driving, such as high-school teaching, while intoxicated. I assume some of my teachers were day drinkers, or at least I doubt they'd be any worse at their jobs had they been, but that's neither here nor there.There's enough here to like, however, to make for a fairly entertaining picture, if hardly life affirming or any other such thing that it's been advertised as. Mikkelsen is a fine actor with a handsome face. There are funny moments. We do eventually get to see Mikkelsen show off those dance moves, and the camera does well to follow along. It's the same for the movie, I suppose, as it's for the marital advice the friends share, about the little things making the difference.One of them that especially stood out to me were the text messages. It seems that cinema still hasn't quite figured out how to visualize texting on screen, let alone depict a human race that's increasingly paralyzed by constant phone staring. Put away the phones, as the lecturer must recite every class. Regardless, this features the best solution to the problem I've yet seen, and the protagonist steps away to check his texts instead of insulting his friends with his distracted glowing face. Text merely appears upon an otherwise black screen. Simple and elegant, and it also reminds me of how silent films handled communication in the first place. Get me \"Druk\" any day over that Emoji-vomit sequence in \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018) and all the movies in between that can't figure out how to integrate text without it being a nuisance. A rare case of drinking and texting being a good idea.",

And if you think that premise is the start to a whimsical, lighthearted adventure, you'd be half right. From celebratory binges with friends to late night tears over beers, \"Another Round\" demonstrates people's relationship with alcohol, in all of its beauty and destruction.Mads Mikkelsen was pitch-perfect as a professor who is unsatisfied with his life, seeking solace in the bottle. Displaying a vulnerability and quiet desperation, it is fun to watch his transformation to a confident teacher, husband, and friend once he partakes in his pick of poison. Mads is always great in dramatic roles, and it's no different here. There is one incredibly intense scene where he confronts his wife over something while they are eating dinner which does a fantastic job of showing Mads desperately trying to hold on and have some semblance of control over his personal life. Is alcohol his savior, imprisoner, or both?Thomas Vinterberg does great work in directing little character moments, showing how different each person's relationship with alcohol is. From a student potentially having a shot or two to relieve anxiety during class to professors who partake to improve their teaching abilities, the movie is ever fascinating, never portraying alcohol as good or bad - it simply exists, and it's up to each individual person how they choose to use it. The most interesting part of the movie for me was seeing how each character's life begins to subtlety improve as their drinking increases - at least at first. They become more confident professors, breathing new life into their classes and enriching their students' educational experiences. But, the party must end at some point, and \"Another Round\" also shows the tragic effects of alcohol abuse as well.\"Another Round\" is an excellent drama that will leave you thinking well after the credits roll. You might relate to the characters and their plight, or you might find them detestable drunks. Regardless, you're sure to have at least a moderately good time with this movie, and if you don't, the performances and drama will surely be enough to hold your interest.",

Well ok then. Glad we got that settled. Seriously, this film is like something you would have seen in the 1940s, when Hollywood decided that it was brave enough to acknowledge things like alcoholism. Wait, this movie WAS made in the 1940s, and it was called \"The Lost Weekend.\"Mads Mikkelsen is a good actor, and he just about pulls off the overwrought material he's given here, but only just about. When the movie isn't wallowing in its \"Reefer Madness\" hysterics about alcohol consumption, it's wallowing instead in the mid-life crises of a bunch of well off white men, and I just. Didn't. Care.This is not the first Danish film to leave me befuddled, and I've actually been to Denmark twice and have close Danish friends. But this is the third Danish film after \"The Hunt\" and \"A Hijacking\" that has left me scratching my head and thinking, \"Huh?\" There are clearly some cultural differences that I simply don't fully understand.Grade: B.",

            "content": "My interest in Druk grew more only after the movie won an academy award for the best international feature. The movie has a pretty simple storyline of four middle aged friends, who happen to work at the same place,\ndecide to carry out an interesting experiment with alcohol, which requires them to drink during work hours.As the narrative progresses, \"Druk\"draws you in with its complexities. Layers of sentiments and human behavior begin to peel away as the four men lose their inhibitions and bringing forth some very raw emotions. Director Thomas Vinterberg gives us a film about living life and he conveys it in equal measures of subtlety, sadness and exhilaration.Cinematography is a mixed bag throughout the movie, it oscillates between some great close ups in the dark to some over-lit bright shots facing the window panes. Screenplay is simple and straightforward, but a bit boring in the middle to support a 117 minute runtime but it pretty much makes it better towards the end. Editing is very raw and bland for my liking but does the job. Production design, costumes and makeup were decent. Music has some good and some bad bits and may not cater to everyone's taste. On the acting front Mads Mikkelson, as the gloomy, listless Martin who goes through many shades of transformation, is simply brilliant. Thomas Bo Larsen, Lars Ranthe and Magnus Millang also pull in good performances.Overall, Director Thomas Vinterberg gets most of the things right in this rather slightly dull affair, which promises a lot in the beginning but goes flat midway. The movie targeted at a 40+ age groups and may not impact to people younger than the mid thirties as much. But As the film draws to its dying moments, In a burst of infectious, joyous energy exuded by Mikkelson in a dance sequence which almost feels exuberant, one realizes that there are no sweeping judgements or any real closure being served here. 6.9 stars out of 10 for running an interesting experiment and celebrating friendship.",

I liked the music, I wasn't too big on the track 'what a life' at first but I've come around to it since, it's not great music but it's groovy enough to get my toes tapping and most importantly it felt liberating.

So, the cast is pretty solid overall.The story tho, I'm a bit conflicted, for most of it I loved the story, and I thought it had gotten the message it was trying to pass, however, after the movie is over, I don't really know.Cause, well, they drink, it sort of helps mainly Martin at first, but, of course he exceeds himself and losses it, as do his friends, they stop, but Tommy isn't able to, and that is clearly what kills him, Martin gets a text from his wife, saying she misses him too, implying Martin has a chance to get his family back... but then they are all drinking and partying like crazy again, in what I assume is still during the day of Tommy's funeral, so... what is the message here? Like, we see the characters go through hell cause of their bad choices, then we root for them, we want them to get better, their friend just died, and here they are getting wasted again? I just find it hard to understand the characters motivation at the end, and it feels a bit like wasted time when at the end of the story, you feel like the characters learned nothing.I had an amicable debate with a friend about the movie afterwards, and well, he strongly defended the story, and the finale for the most part, saying it was actually supposed to be a critic on Danish culture, and the fact that they drink like crazy. And well, fine, ok, I get that, I can see it, and I respect it and like most of the stuff they putted in here as a clear critic. However, still, imo what Martin does at the end, in a lot of ways sorts of denies most of the stuff we thought he had learned throughout the story. And as I said, it feels tough to relate to a character we feel should have learned a lot from the experience he just had, but apparently didn't.Still, I think the movie has a great cinematography, it's pretty well directed and has great performances all throughout, it's definitely worth watching, but the end sort of ruined what I thought would be one of my favorite movies of 2020.",

That's right, booze!Four cranky high school teachers, grinding the second gear of life with no foreseeable excitement ahead, decide to liven up their days with the magic of alcohol under a seemingly scientific experiment excuse.The theorem:\nthe human body's alcohol level is a tad low, and requires some topping up to run at optimum efficiency.The experiment:\nthe subjects drink steadily throughout the working day in an anti-sobriety test, and carefully monitor the results in a very clinical manner, using a computer!The result:\nwell, that would be telling, but chances are most astute viewers will connect the plot dots without much effort.The conclusion:\nwhat sounds like a half-baked script for a slapdash comedy aimed at the immature set, turns out to be quite the serious and thought-provoking film. Also: Mads Mikkelsen stars, which is always welcome.Alcohol over indulgence is a major issue in dark Denmark, and as such this film will pierce many a Scandinavian home with a personal arrow. For those abroad \"Another Round\" will be less of a cautionary tale, and more of a buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy story of supposedly grown men wrestling with their maturity and various mid-life crises. It is not all about the drink, but why they drink. Using harried, jaded, aging teachers in charge of jubilant youth about to kickstart their glorious lives, is an intoxicating stroke of genius.Did I mention that Mads Mikkelson stars?\nExcellent.hipCRANK",

Fantastic movie, I hope it gets the recognition it deserves on the coming award season.",

            "content": "There is surely a singular word I can't quite conjure that captures the feeling of awkwardness that comes from seeing imminent disaster looming in personal circumstances. From the start I felt like a vicarious Cassandra watching 'Another round' - yet deeply uncomfortable as it is at points, this is a rather entrancing movie, more than I expected.I like Mads Mikkelsen, and think he's a fine actor, but I'm not on board with the sense of fandom that has come to surround his career. Despite the accolades this picture has garnered, the basic premise as described on any given website didn't strike me as a feature I'd enjoy - many movies have already been made about drinking, and none have particularly curried my favor. So I find myself ever more surprised that I've enjoyed this one.The varied elements of 'Another round' are familiar, and maybe a bit tired as tropes, but this is a case where the sum is greater than its parts. This is a movie about middle-aged men, teachers struggling in their personal and professional lives and seeking renewed vigor. Deciding to partake in a social experiment, they begin a steady course of alcohol consumption as a means to better themselves.Director Thomas Vinterberg pointedly captures every alcohol-soaked reverie and sullen downturn the picture takes, with a keen eye lets the viewer vividly feel every beat. The cast is more than up to the task, bringing Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm's screenplay to life very believably. I'm particularly pleased, too, with the editing; the intermittent use of title cards to cheekily boost the narrative, or display text messages on a stark black background, is a fine film-making choice. The end result is - dare I say - intoxicating.The outcome of the film for each character isn't especially surprising, nor the ultimate theme that's laid bare by a student during final exams. Yet by the time this last leg of the movie rolls around, we're well on board with the story being told, and enraptured with the performances. The ending is pleasantly heartfelt, emotional without becoming overly sentimental, and a perfect capstone to a feature that works its way under your skin.I began watching with mixed expectations, and they were well exceeded. I need to correct myself, even - I think I can say this movie has made me a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in a way I wasn't before. I don't think I could argue with the decisions of awards judges if I wanted to: 'Another round' is an excellent film and deserves to be seen by a much wider audience.What a life, indeed.",

The movie starts out so promising, we're drawn into the world of these characters who feel they're missing something in life and turn to alcohol as a solution. But as the movie progresses, the story doesn't. I was waiting for it to go somewhere and maybe show that one can find that relaxation and joy within themselves and not need alcohol. Instead it takes a predictable turn without further insight into the conflict within each character. To me it seems they attempted to make a movie about alcohol culture without any insight. Considering the amount of suffering and deaths alcohol causes, it ends up feeling hollow like the message is: \"hey, alcohol can be bad so don't drink too much but look how fun it is to party!\"",

They all work at the same school (it's kind of a high school mixed with a kindergarten) and they seem to have it good. However, it seemed really depressing at first. Then I thought: \"how can you want to be a teacher it seems too hard\", but later towards the end I can understand why you go through the tough times, because it seems like really worthwhile work. You can create really special relationships with the students if you are a good teacher and you can make a big difference.I haven't seen a lot of good movies lately so this one was nice. I've only seen old, outdated and boring junk. Movies like this are why movies are so popular. It is true to life and it makes you feel all sorts of emotions.

Highly recommended, unless you prefer pacier and flashier films, in which case you might find this too deliberate and slow moving.",

Humor, drama, emotion, complexity and those moments that make life so special yet also undeniably frustrating. The rollercoaster ride that brings us both the pure joys yet also the lowest of the lows. This film somehow encapsulates those feelings that makes our entire existence on this godforsaken planet so excruciatingly special. Here's the thing though, I absolutely noticed how Vinterberg uses some familiarity in the narrative progression to ease us into the film as there are definitely elements here that one could find sappy and cliched in any other film- but because Vinterberg refuses to go for coca-cola-sweetness and instead serves up a fine meal of refined tastes, you don't question it, you accept it, with a confident smile you say \"of course, this makes absolute sense in the context of the film\".The editing and cinematography are phenomenal. Let me be clear, if you don't think this film looks good, you don't know what you're talking about. This is supreme filmmaking, top of the game, in how all the formal foundations just boost the entire material up. And the end scene is just the cherry on top.Cinema is alive!",

Recent efforts to raise the minimum age for purchasing alcohol to 18 from 16 have met with resistance, in part because older adults recall their own youthful intoxications so fondly so you would think a film about 4 rather stupid men consuming huge amounts of alcohol in an experiment wouldn't serve Denmark or any other Nation well , it's certainly not a comedy like \" The Hangover \"2008 which I haven't seen out of choice.While the acting is excellent in \"Another Round.\" and I've yet to see the other 4 nominated International Feature films which were \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" (Bosnia and Herzegovina), The Man Who Sold His Skin Tunisia, Collective Romania, and Better Days Hong Kong I really disliked \"Druk\" and the translation is quite accurate it's all about Drinking snd Boozing and it leads nowhere expect and says nothing except to quote a line from the movie from Martin's Mads Mikkelson wife Anika (Maria Bonnevie) \"I don't care how much you drink all Danes drink like madmen \" and that's all this film is about\nfour high school teachers who consume alcohol on a daily basis in an \"experiment \" to see how it affects their social and professional lives.What did they expect would happen ?Of course they go crazy , their students and Principal have an intervention ,their marriages and children are traumatised one dies . (Sorry spoiler but I hope no one sees this film)\nThe reason being from the opening scenes of crazy teenagers drinking and misbehaving in a train to the last scenes of Mads Mickkelsen showing his acrobatic skills in a joyful salute to out of control alcohol abuse.The actor Mads Mikkelsen ends Thomas Vinterberg's film with a wild delight of a drunken dance. He was a professional dancer and can certainly move well but this movie had absolutely nothing to offer me at all and I can't recommend it at all.",

Similarly convincing are Mads Mikkelsen and his co-stars, continually making me forget that these are actors and that there is a screen between us. Mikkelsen is emotionally convincing and has an absolutely glorious dance number near the end of the movie.As a Scandinavian, I can verify that it accurately depicts the drinking culture we have here.

            "content": "Another Round is a protest film. The film protests against prohibitionism. Denmark has a culture of drinking. Traditionally Danes drink when they are celebrating, and they drink to break the ice. Having a beer with a working lunch would not have raised an eyebrow as little a decade or two ago. It isn't uncommon for highschoolers to drink heavily on weekends. A Swedish character in the film says, 'everyone in this country drinks too much.'But Danish drinking is on the decline. Today Danes buy half as much alcohol per person as they did twenty years ago (based on my own calculations from Denmark Statistics). In the last six years I have been at Copenhagen Business School, the university has banned drinking on campus except with special permission, and more or less eliminated Intro Week, a heavy drinking series of ice breaking events which is tradition at Danish universities.The film is about four high school teachers who only go through the motions work, and are unsatisfied with their home lives. When the main character Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) asks his wife if he has become boring, her evasive answer tells him all he needs to know. Early in the film one of the teachers quotes Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skaaderud, that people are born with a bit too little alcohol in their blood. Martin sneaks some vodka into the school the next day, and his teaching goes much better than usual. The friends meet again, and decide to use themselves as test subjects for Skaaderud's theory.It isn't only the characters who are intrigued with the hypothesis that alcohol can improve our lives. Thomas Vinterberg, the director and co-screen writer, is completely on board. The film is a paean to how drinking can make us more fun and more interesting. It makes the teachers more creative and braver. It reduces students' anxiety. It reignites the characters' dying romantic relationships, and strengthens their bonds with friends.There is, of course, another side of alcohol, as the characters find out when they up their doses. Alcohol is associated with crimes of many sorts, from petty crime like vandalism to violent crimes like assault. Drunk driving makes roads less safe. We all know people whose lives have been destroyed by too much drinking. The economist and cultural critic Tyler Cowen has written that it is appalling that we drink such a dangerous substance in front of our children.Another Round does not ignore the negative consequences of alcoholism. Later in the film, alcohol causes some serious consequences for one of the characters. But for the most part alcohol does not create problems for the characters as much as solve them. Heavy drinking is like a coming of age ceremony. Not everyone who goes through it comes out unharmed, but those that do are changed for the better. The thesis of the film, in a word, is that alcohol is good for people, most of the time.The film is worth a view, if for nothing other than the provocative point it makes. It does not hurt that Mads Mikkelsen's performance is spectacular, as we have come to expect. So, do as the rest of the audience in the Danish movie screening I saw did, and watch the film with a beer in hand. Will drinking benefit your experience? Probably.",

It rushly accounted all it's stories thus seemed disconnected and purposeless.The idea of applying Skarderud theory could have been interesting and amusing but the movie failed to deliver cause it was not able to focus on any one of its stories and hastily addressed it's premises. And we don't even see the characters do crazy fun stuff when under the influence except the occasional dancing with a music montage playing in the back. Peter Griffin's drunken gang did more entertaining stuff than em.The 4 main characters didn't even seem like best friends at first but just colleagues since no time was spent to show their closeness.And referencing famous people and writing an essay about your drunken endeavors does not make your drinking less foolish. The study they pretended to be doing to justify their boozing came off as pretentious. Their drunkness also exploded at bullet speed as they rashly kept bumping up the alcohol level they ingest in just a couple of days. They were drinking like reckless teenagers not grown adults working on an experiment.The mindless heedlessness of the students in the beginning of the movie was also very annoying and it being justified by saying ' youth are generally stupid ' was plain stupid.Mads Mikkelsen could have also done better. He just sadly broods or dances around when drunk and no memorable performance was seen from him. His character also begging his cheating wife to return was galling to watch. We don't even know why his friend ended up killing himself cause the his plotline was rashly covered.The movie came off as a cursory and not a thorough discourse of alcohol , family relationships and self harm.

Then Mads' wife comes back to him all of a sudden. It's like those cliched movies where the writers just do whatever they want with any character without any logic. I understand that it's more about how life is and the behavior of people when such things happen, but.. that's exactly what you expect, so I don't get the accolades. I am not sure if people of Denmark expect something else because of their drinking culture though. Nothing makes sense really, many boring moments through out, the only thing that stands apart is the acting, Mads and Thomas as always are amazing.I absolutely loved Vinterberg's previous movies I watched - Hunt and Celebration.

The students and principal aren't particularly endeared to his teaching performance with end of school exams on the horizon for some.Initially the 'experiment' is positive and slightly comedic in that they find their mojos as such. Slightly drunk but not to excess and within control.However as the film progresses the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is notched up bit by bit with tragic consequences. Vinterberg neither glamourises or demonizes alcohol culture and the director shows both sides of the coin cleverly using historic figures such as Winston Churchill and Hitler as examples of historic leaders who were either regular drinkers by their own admission and control yet heroes to many (Churchill) and tea totallers yet historic demons to many (Hitler). There is also a little montage of alcohol in modern day political life from Yeltsin and Clinton to Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel.The tragic consequences shown are the usual symptoms of alcoholism and include career difficulties, physical injuries from falls etc. Relationship issues and breakdowns.Excellent performances from the principal cast not only Mikkelsen in the comedic and tragedy scenes.The ending initially comes across as a bit corny for want of a better word but on reflection the celebratory scenes rather than Danish students and their teachers dancing around a harbour as if it is a musical could be a celebration by Martin or as in the title is he just starting the journey into 'Another Round' just as his life is turning a corner?Rightfully received awards recognition including winning Best International Feature Film at the Academy Awards in 2021.",

Thomas Vinterberg's film is touched with a known personal tragedy but the film is about embracing life and the fact that he was able to continue to (expertly) direct this film is an ode to him and his craft.The script is from Vinterberg and long time collaborator Tobias Lindholm has so many layers and allows each character to share their own experience. Obviously Mads Mikkelsen plays the main character, but a brilliant ensemble of Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Lars Ranthe all shine with their individual moments. Millang in particular makes me laugh a lot not just in his films but in interviews, a very Danish sense of humour which I share.The chemistry between the men is infectious and it is clear that the four are good mates in reality, I found myself laughing more in this film then I expected. I knew it would have funny moments but certain reviews make it out like it is a depressing drama which in my experience was not that case. Be ready for some serious laugh out loud moments.It also helped I had a decent audience, Australian audiences can sometimes be a little worse for wear but I had a great audience (we were all last minute cinema goers before our round 3 of corona virus induced lockdown).Mads Mikkelsen is amazing. We know this. He has been my favourite actor for almost ten years and he can do no wrong. He is heartbreaking, funny, pathetic at times and just contagiously mesmerising. Of course we have to mention the final scene which shows all of his hidden majesty. Like Shaun Parkes in Steve McQueen's 'Mangrove' (Another performance that will wrongfully not get recognised this year), Mikkelsen's face takes up half the screen and Vinterberg and brilliant DOP Sturla Brandth Grovlen allow him to do all the work by simply putting the camera to his noggin.Technically this is a sound film. The aforementioned cinematographer Grovlen is brilliantly loose with his camera and captures everything like a fly on the wall, there is some brilliant use of on screen text and photographic montage and the colour grade was incredibly luxurious.This film is something I believe we all needed (and still need) after what the world is going through at the minute. It is a celebration of friends, culture and life. Something that we should not take for granted.Mads Mikkelsen for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role",

I'm giving the 3 stars SOLELY because of Mikkelsen's dance scene.\nstarting with the very premise of the script, which is to investigate the influence of alcohol on social behavior.\nI'm not going to get into how they \"conduct research\" without any kind of control groups, or even taking into account their individual physiology for alcohol consumption (maybe not all of them have the 0.05% tolerance). I simply cannot understand what was their point.What did they consider as an optimum behavior (that alcohol facilitated)? Mikkelsen gets drunk pretty fast in their first day of trial, but later leads an incredible class compared to his boring lectures. For him, optimum behaviour is not being boring. Almost similarly, but to a much lesser degree, Lars Ranthe's problem (Peter) 'sounded' more tangible. However, again, not enough is told about him to make us sympathize with him.What about for the other two? Does Magnus Milang's character (Nikolaj) tolerate his miserable family life better? Does Thomas Bo Larsen (Tommy) gets better at couching? what are these men trying to achieve?another point is the character built. the subtle way of introducing their lives is ok, but Not for Tommy. what does he die in the end anyways? We don't know enough about his motifs and life \"miseries\" that he is trying to get better at to understand why he \"is game\" when they are trying to reach the oblivion stage.Another point was Mikkelsen's domestic problems. I would have preferred if there was a better arc in their marriage problems and resolution. I simply don't believe it was elaborate enough.All in all, I would say I liked the song and the dance scene much better when I was not aware of how empty this story was.",

Starring Mads Mikkelsen in the lead role, it is one of the most engaging studies of the effects of alcohol on the human body ever put to film.In Copenhagen, Denmark, high school teachers Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), Nikolaj (Magnus Millang), Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), and Peter (Lars Ranthe) are long time friends who each believe that their lives have become uninteresting over the years. At Nikolaj's 40th birthday party, the quartet decide to conduct an experiment where they consume alcohol at work to test a theory that a person with a BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of 0.05% performs with a heightened level of creativity and confidence. As the days go by, each of the four friends discover that things are improving for them significantly and soon agree to take the experiment further by increasing their BAC limit to higher percentages.In pretty much every country where it's legal, drinking alcohol is widely considered to be a normal part of a fun night out where one is able to let loose every once and a while. Coming from Australia, one of the most well-known countries in the world to focus around drinking culture, I can personally attest to this as I myself have attended my fair share of parties where such an occurrence is the norm among young and old. As is usually the case with something this important, there are bound to be several films focusing around the consumption of alcohol that are meant to show how much the characters can handle before doing something they later regret. \"Another Round\" not only follows this formula to such a wonderful degree, but it also works brilliantly as a tragic commentary on middle age affecting one's acceptance in society.On the surface, this film may come across as a mere pastiche about group of friends getting drunk simply so they can function better at work. I think such an assessment is unfair because there is far more to this when examined more closely. Alcohol affects every person differently - some develop more confidence in their social abilities while others turn into a depressed wreck. One thing is for certain though, it changes people into someone they normally aren't when sober. This film cleverly uses each of its four main characters to show the various ways of how alcohol is both benefitting and worsening their lives. As a result of this, the film neither glorifies nor condemns its usage, instead depicting it almost as a tool that requires a particular set of skills to master.Each of these four men feel like that they are in a midlife slump with a nostalgic longing for the good old days. Take Martin for example, who is a history teacher whose students don't even respect him anymore due to how bland his teaching methods have become as a result of growing older. One student even stands up and leaves his class out of sheer boredom, not caring one bit if he gets into trouble. When Martin starts drinking before entering the classroom, he transforms into an entirely new person. Before you know it, he is engaging his class in jovial lectures on historical leaders and bringing out the best traits of his students. Like spinach to Popeye the sailor, alcohol eventually serves as a dependable means of acquiring the necessary strength for Martin to accomplish otherwise difficult tasks.But it isn't all good news for him. Eventually, Martin's overdependence on the liquid courage distances him from his family, putting a strain on his marriage. Martin's wife Anika finds it hard to comprehend that the man she married is now more concerned with looking good in front of his students than her. Despite assuring her that he is currently the best person he has ever been, Martin soon realises he has achieved this goal through selfish means. At this point, the film addresses Martin's deeply rooted insecurity - he is fearful that growing old has impeded his chances at success to fit in with the younger generation. These feelings of self-doubt are common among the middle-aged population, so it certainly isn't difficult to believe that many others out there must feel the same way as poor Martin.Director Thomas Vinterberg does a flawless job intertwining each of the four characters' stories with one another, bringing a solid consistency to the overall plot. Although Martin is clearly the main protagonist, his three friends are shown to have just as many interesting traits and quirks worth exploring as well. Due to the nature of their drinking experiment, the four often meet up to see where they are and how things are playing out for them. As previously mentioned, the alcohol affects each of them differently so it's fun to see the results of their lengthy investigation. In doing so, there's a nice balance between genuine drama and tongue-in-cheek comedy that makes a film like this seem so much more sincere than other alcohol-related features of this type.As Martin, Mads Mikkelsen gives one of the best performances of his career. This character could easily have been just another generic man facing a midlife crisis but Mikkelsen brings such a likeable, charming, and often humorous tone to the way he plays him that I eagerly anticipated everything he was about to do next. He never feels like a caricature of a typical drunken dad, instead he's a tragic individual who wants to improve his life as quickly as possible. The three other actors, Magnus Millang, Thomas Bo Larsen, and Lars Ranthe, were also great in their respective roles as Martin's friends. They too have their own obstacles they need to overcome but their differing worldviews prevent this from being a smooth journey.In this day and age where films tend to sensationalise alcohol consumption, it feels like a breath of fresh air to finally watch one that actually provides a more neutral perspective on everything. Though it is true that alcohol has been the cause of many issues in people's lives, it has also led to the creation of several amazing things as well. Renowned author Ernest Hemingway claimed to have written some of his best work while under the influence, but in stark contrast, millions of lives are lost worldwide each year due to excessive drunkenness. The key here is moderation, like the use of an important musical instrument in the composition of a symphony. To quote the immortal words of Homer Simpson: \"To alcohol! The cause of - and solution to - all of life's problems!\"I rate it a solid 9/10.",

            "content": "\"So, when you run around totally wasted, throwing up in bushes and alleys, don't feel alone, because you're in great company.\" Martin (Mads Mikkelsen)Another Round is a Danish drama rightfully awarded the \"International Feature\" Oscar while the director, Thomas Vinterberg, was nominated for director. Although mid-life crisis has been amply treated in films around the world (think Wild Hogs and Sideways for starters), this one goes deeper than most exploring the chaos of four teachers experimenting with alcohol to spice up their lives.The acting is superb-Mikkelsen should have been nominated. The analysis of the crisis is better than any lecture.Using Norwegian psychologist Finn Skarderund's work about the need for human blood alcohol to maintain a 0.5% level, Martin tries it and finds he's a better teacher when he's drunk. His three buddies follow, with degrees of success that impel them to reach higher levels. Only the most dimwitted audience wouldn't see the disruption to personal and professional lives that will ensue.However, the film keeps it even between the obvious domination of drinking and the needs it reflects, especially for domestic lives that are immediately affected by the excess. Actually, nothing dramatic erupts during the first two thirds of the film, just a slow deterioration of each one's ability to control his environment. Family life for Martin is almost from the beginning vulnerable to his change, and not for the better.Nor does Another Round take it easy in the end by showing them mature and sober. In fact, it's hard to decide, even after a tragedy touches them, that they will lead sober lives after the graduation of their students. The fact that these middle-aged teachers need to revive their lives is ample proof that they need intervention, but alcohol is not the candidate.\"The world is never as you expect.\" Martin.",

Even though the film is a little bit of an ensemble cast, he is undoubtedly the star of the film. He has the most screen time and his acting is light-years beyond the rest of the cast. We know him as the very quiet and under-stated man he plays in most of his films, and that is what he starts the movie as, but then when he is required to become more out-going as the film goes along is when we see his acting chops come to the front.The movie does give a reasonably balanced opinion on the subject matter. It starts out only really showing the positives, which I found to be quite a dangerous notion. However towards the end it makes a point of showing the negatives that would ultimately come from such a thing. I'm not entirely sure what this film is going to inspire people to do however. It really could go either way depending on the person.The film has some nice character touches, like the way one of them interacts with a glasses-wearing child. I wish the movie had more of this sort of thing going in it to help us like the characters a little more. This was a film I liked, without ever loving. I enjoyed it while watching it, but it will be gone from my mind by this time next week.",

This was obviously not going to work out and was just plain silly - turning all four into uninteresting idiots for me.The only interesting aspect left of the movie after that point was to see whether they learned something from their \"experiment\" and maybe some message to the audience regarding alcohol consumption. Not so! The movie ends ***spoler alert ** with the wife wanting to get back to the husband (why did she want to get back to the drunkard??), and instead of appreciating his good fortune and taking a final farewell to alcohol the movie ends with the main character getting drunk yet again and dancing around drunkenly and happy.There is no message here. No deeper meaning. Just four miserable idiots looking for an easy answer to improve their lives. They don't find it through drinking, one of their friends drinks himself to death, their lives only got worse and STILL they end up drinking and partying at the end.If anything, this movie is a tribute to alcohol and might even send a message that alcohol is a good thing.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because I love Mikkelsens acting.",

            "content": "Once upon a time, a Norwegian psychiatrist posed a theory that people are born with the blood alcohol content 0.05% too low. Four 40 year old highschool teachers decide to test that theory - in the name of science- by maintaining a state of perpetual tipsiness while they are working and going about their lives. Needless to say, it turned out into one hell of a movie!The experiment was a smashing success. Our heroes enjoy every minute of this study by stashing bottles everywhere, finally connecting with their students and galavanting around the town without a care in the world. The film itself becomes brighter and more colorful as we watch Mads and his palls get into all sorts of situations. Before watching, I knew that a film about alcohol consumption is meant to have a number of moral lessons and before long, those lessons are presented in a most heartbreaking way.Thomas Vinterberg and Mads Mikkelsen deliver yet another thought provoking and moving film that will stay with me for a long time. Each character hopes that the experiment will help with their particular life problem and while it does help to an extent, the price ends up being too high. The way it progresses from innocent joy and warmth to somber reality is reflected in both the cinematography and terrific acting.Whether you consume alcohol or not, this is a film that you need to watch. Another Round masterfully manages to have an absolute blast while teaching an important lesson without ever being \"in your face\" about it's messages. Alcohol is a big part of society regardless of country, social strata or age and the film shows that it is personal responsibility to determine how much of it is truly enough. What deserves a special mention is how this story is wrapped up in one of most enjoyable endings of 2020.movies.shmovies on Instagram for more great movies",

Perhaps 'dram-com' is the most apt category available for the convenience of the nextflix algorithm, but this really isn't that-neither is it a tragedy only, or a drama. It is irreverent.\nPerhaps it's important that I preface by saying I'm a 25 y.o. American, which might give you a rough idea of my cinematic purview. I've seen few foreign films which have stuck with me, among them Babette's Feast and, to a lesser degree, Oslo, August 31st. This is more alike the latter (albeit not so morbidly depressing). To avoid spoilers and still make a point I'd like to make, I think it's noble of the director to steer clear of chauvinism, despite that the more negative professional reviews such as that from The Guardian insist to focus on what they deem a 'pro-alcohol' message. If the director has any predilection he's trying to share, it's that life is worth enjoying, even if that means taking the forbidden sip or two. There's no patronizing here-just an honest character study, the four-man cast cornering four primary and different character traits, at least one of which nearly all of us will share.\nTo get back to the comedy thing, it is a joyful and funny movie (albeit equally dark and poignant). But it doesn't demand laughter or tears. The subtle grace with which Druk progresses unconcernedly has that distinctive European feel, and it is a refreshing respite from the formulaic stories we are used to being told. (The underlying story itself here is simple, predictable and cliche, but that doesn't matter-life itself is as much, yet as a richly lived day, though predictable in its broad turns, shimmers with many uncontrived moments of triumph and novelty, so does this movie progress-generally as expected, yet in a strangely inverted, paradoxically novel way.)\nMads is brilliant.

To test this theory, they try to live a tipsy life .Apart from the funny concept, the movie is void of surprises. The men are depicted as ordinary with ordinary problems. They are in their forties, they are either missing the life before children or regretting never having them, they don't pay suffient attention to their romantic relationships, they are uinspiring teachers at a high school where all the kids would rather stare at their screens... And their resort to escape this reality is alcohol.Their situation surely might be relatable, but it's also incredibly cliche. The dramatic curve is also entirely predictable.They drink alcohol and suddenly turn into sublime teachers who are saluted by cheering teenagers. They pay attention to their partners. Everything is swell.The drink more alcohol, and things turn even better, but the movie hints that we might be approaching hybris.They drink even more alcohol and their situation turn misrable. Who would have been able to predict that?The movie suffers from this predictability throughout. To give another example: In a scene, one of the characters (I can't remember the name, apart from Mads Mikkelsens excellent performance, the characters are rather - yes - ordinary) exclaims: \"I wish I had children, no one will remember me as i grow old.\" In the very next scene, the character meets a distressed high school student and they develop a memorable relationship. What a ride!I could keep on listing several similiar examples, but that would spoil the movie.I guess the movie is daring in that it celebrates alcohol and alcohol culture in a Danish society that frown upon teenagers' (hefty) alcohol consumption. If you are one to get provoked by a celebration of drugs and the proposition that drugs (such as alcohol) might be a helpful aid in living a more inspired life, then this movie might shock you and/or give you a few new ideas.Since that thought does not provoke me in any particular way, I was left unfrazzled.It's a weird take on a feel good movie. There's alot of warmth but not a whole lot of depth.If you feel like watching a feel good comedy with a novel concept about a stereotypical group of male friends that realise that alcoholism in fact does not fix their existential problems, knock yourself out.

It's true wherever there is alcohol, there's fun, as well as a tragedy which turns out to be the case here. I have nothing against the actors, they are all briliant in their individual escapisms. However, what doesn't work for me is the hypothesis around which the film revolves. Yes, alcohol is fun yet it is also addictive. Alcohol consumption in huge amounts for functioning adults is bound to lead to some sort of disaster sooner or later which turns out the be the case here as well. I was expecting some sort of revelation rather than a cliche from the film, which is what made me disappointed with it. All in all, you may have fun watching it, however, don't expect too much from it. Oh, and don't forget to have your booze within reach!",

Mads obviously carries the film as the lead, Martin, but the other actors were really great too\n2) The emotional moments of the film really worked for me, for example I really cared about how Martin and Anika's relationship was going to turn out\n3) I was surprised by how much the film actually stuck to the theme of the drinking being a psychological experiment, there are frequent call backs to the leads writing their research down\n4) Seeing Martin finally dance at the end was euphoric; the whole film people are trying to get him to dance and he says no, but then at the end he finally lets loose and I found it so fantastic\n5) The film is very heartfelt in a very realistic way, the relationship with Tommy and Specs was so down to earth which made it hit homeNEGATIVES:1) I definitely felt the film was too long, there was about 20 minutes that felt like they were bagging the run time\n2) The switching of the gears with the experiment felt quite rushed to me. It really doesn't take long for the four of them to agree to do the experiment, then once they do it really doesn't take long for the four of them to agree to up the stakes multiple times\n3) There was a couple of times where it was difficult to tell how much time had passed between one scene and the next, sometimes it felt like long periods of time had passed but it was difficult to tell; the film could've done a better job at illustrating when long periods of time had passed between scenes.",

Miscarriage of good taste that it was cancelled, clearly a victim of America's dumb-it-down culture that has zero patience for anything cerebral, but I digress. For many moons I've said that Mads is our finest living actor...though, admittedly, I sometimes vacillate between him, Mahershala Ali and Sam Rockwell. For just as many moons I've been laughed at and sarcastically, sometimes sincerely asked \"who?\" Well now I feel vindicated, just like a drunk in a midnight choir, caught between flying and drowning. Especial kudos to Vinterberg, for whom this film I'm sure provided a modicum of release from operatic grief. The flick, as a whole, is far more efficacious than any AA meeting and much braver in its shares. A luminous intoxicant that somehow manages to be immediately sobering in its very own visceral way.

            "content": "Who's to say being born with a blood alcohol level of less than .05 is too low? Wouldn't the normal situation be that one is born with no alcohol in one's blood? Unless of course, the mother is an alcoholic giving birth; that would make some sense. The outlandish concept intrigued me enough to look up the name of the scientist mentioned in the story. Finn Sk\u00e5rderud is a real person, a Norwegian psychiatrist and psychotherapist who's also an internationally acknowledged expert on eating disorders. The theory on which the film is based is not only untested, it's not even a real theory. It comes from a misinterpreted preface written by Sk\u00e5rderud to a book first published in 1880, 'on the psychological effects of wine'.With that said, the story focuses on four adult friends who decide to take the matter of achieving an .05 blood alcohol level seriously, to see what it does for their personal relationships and professional creativity. When early results appear promising, the group makes the fatal mistake of assuming that if a little bit is good, then more must be better. This results in the characters falling down drunk and making a mess of their lives to the point of harming themselves, and in the case of soccer coach Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), falling off a boat and drowning during an alcoholic stupor. (Whether his dog was recovered safely was never resolved).There's also a questionable scene in which one of the men named Peter (Lars Ranthe) suggests that one of his students take a shot or two prior to taking an oral exam to calm his nerves. It works for that student for the sake of the story, but I have to wonder how bad a message that might send to an aspiring undergrad. Seems to me there's enough alcoholism in the general population without encouraging it in the name of education.With some serio-comic moments, the film does explore the often horrific side effects of uncontrolled drinking and how that can ruin relationships and a promising future. If I were in a flippant mood I'd say to keep a drink handy while watching, but the tone of the picture is just a bit too serious to take lightly. A montage of real life politicians under the influence is shown at one point, suggesting that some of their world influencing decisions might have been poured straight out of a bottle.",

These colleagues and friends initially view the concept as a curiosity, but as soon as one of them (Mads Mikkelsen in an explosive performance) actually experiments with the idea, his enthusiasm becomes infectious. From that point on, their curiosity evolves into an obsession and their lives and those around them are affected accordingly.I dare say this film conveys its complicated message and portrayal of human weakness with such realism that it's almost like a documentary. It's highly unlikely that an American film on the same subject would have been this powerful or this real. Do you still smell the alcohol?This is hardly a brand new topic for a film to cover, but this one does it so well, that it makes the whole subject matter seem devastatingly fresh and incredibly real. The best compliment that I can pay is that the characters are true to life in their behavior, in their gradual collapse of discipline and in the impact they have on their families and students. You cannot look away. You can only wonder how it will all end. The film subtly shifts between anguish and exuberance with stunning skill. This is first-rate filmmaking.

Then it all got out of hand and that is when the comedy slid into tragedy.I was expecting it to be a kind of didactic tale, a warning if you will, but it wasn't and the ending was a waste that, considering the circumstances of the ending, seems rather odd and out of place.Not the best of Mads movies, sorry to say.

            "content": "'Another Round' is one of those films where my lasting impression is one tainted by a sense of what could have been. Let me state clearly for the record, the film is by no means a failure, with a lot to like: As you would expect, Mads Mikkelsen is sublime (particular praise must be given for his work in the film's first half, with such subtle physical touches used to great effect. These evolve into an impressive and wildly different physical display later on), the central premise is innovative yet involving, the supporting cast solid, the score oh so memorable and there are some real moments of humour and novelty, as well as some poignant, important questions raised.But. But, but, but. A Best International Feature Oscar. An acclaimed director. One of the world's best leading actors. I really expected this to hit harder and to lead to a more incisive finale. 'The Hunt' still sticks in my mind months after viewing it, and whilst it's a notably different affair, I can't help but notice how Vinterberg really crystallises the lasting tension, pain and emotion perfectly in its closing scenes, whilst Another Round's ending feels diffuse by comparison.Sebastian was clearly a vehicle for the film's central through line, the Kierkegaardian notion that 'you must accept yourself as fallible in order to love others and life', however the scene in which this is delivered felt like somewhat of a cop out. If this was truly a powerfully observable, lived reality for the characters, we wouldn't have needed this signpost moment. It's clear that Vinterberg is aiming for a structure which illustrates the idea 'everything is the same, but everything is different', with the return to the restaurant, the implied reunion of Martin and Anika, and the bookend scenes involving the students' unbridled, drunken celebrations, however instead of striking that note it feels rather as if the central characters, and indeed the film, haven't truly confronted their problematic realities and made a definitive choice, statement or realisation. It feels rather as if Tommy's death just facilitates a tail off into a return to life as before, which is obviously not the intended feel.I really, really wanted to feel differently about this, to revel in Mikkelsen's fantastic final moments, and to emphatically feel that dual sense of pathos and joy of acceptance which I know Vinterberg was aiming to invoke. But 'The Hunt' it is not. The promise does not fully materialise, and, to my mind at least, we don't emerge into a sobering reality but rather are left with a hazy, hungover like state in which we have some muddled sense of what should have been, but are left wondering exactly where things went awry.",

The direction is competent and the movie is constructed around an interesting and creative premise: that the human body is made to tolerate a higher level of alcohol than naturally present.Yet the movie kinda falls short in the third act. It takes you to high places and then to really low points, but then it does not know how to resolve it. The plot lays out a number of thread and ideas, but it does not conclude them satisfyingly. It botches the resolution or abandons most of them to end in a soft happy end that is somewhat disappointing. When you learn that it is based on a short the director made years ago, it makes sense. It does feel like they streched a neat tidy idea without an end in sight. You could shave a half hour of the movie and not lose anything.The first half is great though. From the beginning, you discover that it is a movie about Martin's middle-life crisis disguised as a social drama on the effects of alcohol. It is cleverly written, the performances are excellent, and you rapidly engage in the social dynamics of this merry group of friends. The first half documents the rise, and obviously, you're expecting the fall. But, it never really comes, and that is where the movie gets frustrating. There are glimpses for instance that Martin had something darker in him from the start and that this alcoholic binge is just a fa\u00e7ade that will be his downfall. But, there a never real adverse effects to the characters actions and we never get there. Drinking in the day time has mostly positive effects.Even when they increase the dosage they don't really suffer the consequences. The sequence where they get poop faced is not nearly as transgressive or humiliating enough. One guy gets yelled at by his ever-nagging wife, and Martin wakes up on his neighbour's lawn. It needed a scene of a real low point like one them wakes up at the hospital or they forget to turn off the stove and burn the house down. It needed to go full Trailer Park Boys Jim Lahey.In the second half, the story that was about a man's middle-life crisis turns into high-school drama. It is not necessarily bad, but it comes out of nowhere and is not nearly as riveting. The characters face low-points that ultimately are rather painlessly resolved and feels hollow. There is something of a disconnect with the beginning of the movie that felt more loaded and subversive. The character that was the least developed and had the less to lose abruptly dies without a real reason leading to it. Everyone rekindles with his or her wives and children; it is a missed opportunity for genuine catharsis.I feel that it would have benefited of following a more generic structure where Martin's tendencies lead him to self-destruct. That's what the narrative needed, a man who immolates himself through an addiction. I liked it, but I wanted to love it.",

            "content": "I enjoyed Thomas Vintenberg's \"Another Round\".Why? Maybe because I'm an introverted guy drowining his introverted sorrow in pints of beer, wine, vodka... but not whisky. Or maybe because I'm a teacher and I can relate to being confronted to a class whose deadly silence is a severe blow to my pride. Or maybe because I'm kind of a simp when it comes to women, whether the first or the second. Or maybe because I already used alcohol to fuel some positive energy... and that it worked. Anyway I was the perfect candidate to enjoy it and I enjoyed it so much that I'm willing to do an experiment (I did one for \"Festen\", check the review).Since the film is about four men and teachers (with their own issues and marital troubles): history teacher Martin (Mads Mikkelsen), P. E. teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), philo Nikolaj (Magnus Millang) and Music Peter (Lars Ranthe) decide to prove a theory that implies a man's alcool level at 0,5g maintains or improves his social skills and creativity, that state between drunkenness and soberness. I'm willing to do a similar test and advance in that review after several drinks. This is not an endorsement of drinking, no more or less than the film but let's do it for fun. See you later.Well, here we are, two small beers, I guess I'm there at 0,5g. How does that affect my writing I don't know. I just want to take an opportunity to say that I could really relate to the scenes that depicted every single stage of inebriation by Vintenberg. From the way, you start stumbling and looking for the right word, or just talking loudly and smiling to the way you start loosen up. There's a real portrayal of alcohol effect that takes me back to the first time I drunk, drank, whatever, when my cousin asked me to approach a girl and I was shy, it took one bottle of Malibu pineapple and the magic operated, placebo, maybe. Anyway, I could relate to the character of Mark, he's lost his appeal with his wife and girls and one glass of wine is enough to bring back the worst and anaesthetize it. Alcohol becomes the remedy to the very thoughts it catalyses, strange but true.Having said that, I dream to be a filmmaker and one of the film I dreamed of making since 12 years involve a long sequence of guys drinking and dancing and a climactic catastrophe dancing that is almost like Madds at the end. And so for the record, I want to make it clear, if I ever make such a film, please don't accuse me to make a rip-off. I swear I had it in mind years and years before. Let's hope this will serve a purpose.Where was I? Just had two and half glasses of wine. I guess I'm in a stage where my mind floats in total lucidity, and I already feel silly about the former paragraph... how about just making a film without caring about any accusation of plagiarism. What Vintenberg did was more than offer a platform of expression to average guys who want to be heard in a world where it's about the pleas of youngsters or women, I suspected Vintenberg was a fan of \"The Deeer Hunter\" when I saw \"The Hunt\": you know, male-bonding etc. , the drunk scenes especially when they want to literally go the distance is just like the bar scene pushed to eleven... men behaving like a children, he wife wants a fresh fish, how about fishing it... I like the way Vintenberg use the process of handheld camera to exteriorize the drunken effect like Harvey Keitel's \"Rubber Sandwich\" scene in \"Mean Streets\".The directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated is both subjective and objective, it shows the state of mind, shows the way they look at their own entourage, whether kids laughing at their jokes or women telling them to calm down and it shows a certain reality about couples, exams, needs for existence and that found a perfect loophole with alcohol. Does the film advocate the drinking? Well given the most extreme scenario and the fact that a man wets his own bed and Marcus ends up laying on the ground, I doubt so... but what Vintenberg does is acknowledge that there's a reason for existence (remember what Homer Simpson said?) and he doesn't back up in the controversial scene where a teacher advices a student to drink before answering, it can help... I'll be back...Now, I guess I got to the limit, my head is heavier and I'm tired. Maybe that' what consumption is about, there's an aftershock, something to bite you back that is called reality... Vintenberg draws the line between reality as it seems and the the virtual universe we fabricate to improve or please ourselves.... I was perplex about the ending, why cut the focus from the experience and leave us with the aftermath of the first booze orgy... maybe Vintenberg settles a personal record with destiny (check the trivia) and out of honesty decided to show that alcohol is a life-and-death issue whether physical or \"social\" death. Still the same...However the ending that seems to embrace the energy boost of alcohol within the students and their intergenerational communion with teachers suggests a social cement, a rite of passage, as wicked as it is, it exists and that one should handle it with responsibility. It's interesting that if Marcus could get his wife to notice him with alcohol, her comeback is due to one moment where he chose to be sober... and maybe there's a certain sternness, a strength in that sate that can take you further in life... and watching the quality of the directing, I was sure there was no alcohol involved during the filming.Think about it before calling the film an ode to alcohol? Off to bed now...",

            "content": "I can enjoy realism, fantasy, fable and even fairytale, but each of those genres implies a contract with the audience who agree to suspend judgement in exchange for having the film deliver in ways that it otherwise couldn't. Another Round veers between those genres and I found myself alternately suffering lack of imagination in the name of verisimilitude and lack of plausibility in the name of a jimmy-rigged premise. Many crucial developments happen off camera, things the viewer \"doesn't need to see,\" but I never discerned what made many of the things we do to see necessary to see (except perhaps that they were simply easier to stage and film). Chekhov said \"One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep.\" Watching the first hour of this film you know \"this can't end well,\" and if that promise isn't completely broken, it's delivered in bad faith - a disaster that serves as a pretense for a celebration.I'm not a reviewer who needs a film to agree with me about the issues, I don't need to like any of the characters, I don't need to see the wicked punished, etc. But I don't like feeling manipulated, and I tend not to like story telling that uses people (here Tommy particularly, but also Anika) as props.",

            "content": "I can't remember too many other high profile foreign films from 2020 off the top of my head, but Another Round surely has to be a contender for at least the Best Foreign Film Oscar. Nominations for the screenplay and Mads Mikkelsen's performance would also be well-deserved.Another Round takes an entertaining and unbiased look at the effects of alcohol: the good, the bad, and the messy, as well as the variety of ways different people can react to similar quantities of the world's favourite legal drug. It tackles this without feeling preachy as well, which was appreciated. It's not as harrowing as other films that deal with more illegal substances and their effects, but there are a few genuinely emotional moments that hit pretty hard in the story's second half.The more serious moments are balanced well with a good amount of comedy, as the film is pretty funny at times. The wide range of emotions and tones help highlight just how well-written and balanced the screenplay is, and how skilled its lead actors are (especially, as mentioned before, Mads Mikkelsen, who steals the show here and honestly can do no wrong as an actor, as far as I'm concerned).It starts a little slow, but picks up nicely 20 minutes or so in, and feels extremely well-paced from there until the end. Perhaps a couple of events within the narrative happen slightly too fast, and the film's visuals - while good - don't make quite the same impression as the writing or acting, barring a few striking images in the film's final third.Overall, I really liked this one, and I'm giving it one of those 4/5 ratings that's actually very close to a 4.5/5. I think we need more straightforward, unpretentious, quite accessible foreign films like this (and something like last year's Parasite) to increase the popularity of world cinema, and help convince non-believers that not every film in a language other than English is obscure or \"weird\" or overly artsy.I mean, the more arthouse stuff can be engaging in its own way, but hopefully you know what I mean- movies like this one could get people more invested in films made beyond their borders, and in the overall scheme of things, that can't be anything but good for film industries worldwide.",

In no way, I'm asserting my adverse opinion that the film is bad. Matter of fact, It's pretty darn good. But there are certain things that require pressing consideration!Whereas the story proceeds to unveil whatever damage caused by immoderate liquor consumption; it also ratifies the yearlong tradition in Denmark adjacent to the same matter. In all fairness; for an outlander like me, it is clearly hard to comprehend. Anyway, I get the feeling that somewhere in its transitions the underlying value of the key message slowly faded away.Although it sheds light on multiple crucial perspectives such as life, family, friendship; yet it all appears to be incomplete for some odd reason. On the other hand, there are certain sequences volubly brandishing an absolute brilliance and there's no denying its infallible quality of being subtle and evocative; all at once.Needless to say, other than its trivial shortcomings in the narrative; elsewhere, this has been quite a show worth beholding! Mainly apropos of the striking Cinematography; which quite frankly has exceeded all my expectations. And so did the poignant Score in the back.Finally coming down to the heart & soul of this whole endeavor i.e. The Performances. Long story short, the entire cast did an amazing job!

Inspired by psychiatrist Finn Skarderud's controversial theory that humans should have a 0.05% alcohol level for peak performance, Vinterberg and co-writer Tobias Lindholm concocted this wry tale of four teachers stuck in personal and career ruts. Our main protagonist is Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) a history teacher who along with three friends at the school decide to take up Skarderud's challenge and conduct a formal experiment testing the theory by drinking all day while teaching class.The experiment begins positively enough, with the quartet finding a new gear. They seem happier, their job performance improves. But, soon, 0.05% isn't enough and marriages and relationships are roiled, beds are soiled and their jobs are endangered. As a morality tale, ANOTHER ROUND has some rather murky messaging. The seriousness of alcoholism in Denmark is only lightly touched upon. The original title - DRUK - can roughly be translated as \"boozing\" which is more spot on than the American title which makes it sound like a Hallmark cable movie. There is also some awkward plotting that blunts the dramatic flow. What makes the movie work is Mikkelsen and the cast. There is a genuine camaraderie with the four without falling into forced sentimentality. Maria Bonnevie playing Martin's wife, Anika, brings a genuine sincerity to her role that plays off nicely with Mikkelsen's mood swings.A bittersweet graduation scene carries an emotional resonance that has built throughout. Martin is said to have been a free-form jazz dancer in his youth, but the character refuses to dance in the movie even when his friends are prancing about drunkenly. Mikkelsen (who himself had a dance background) finally lets go in a cathartic boogie that frees Martin's spirit - and that of the viewer. It isn't a dance of unbounded joy, but of deep, well earned cleansing. It calls for Another Round - but, in moderation. Of course. Skol.",

Quite simple at its core, with exceptional performances and well written characters to follow. As you'd expect the central performance from Mads Mikkelsen is particularly magnetic. All of the humour and all of the emotional beats landed successfully.The direction from Thomas Vinterberg was beautiful. Simple but so effective.A top, top film.",

From my point of view music and camera work are not striking, the music and the camera work are very good, but there isn't any special way of the camera work and the music doesn't brings memorability. The movie is very controversial and tough to watch, cause of the enormous consume of alcohol.

Is it going to promote a positive attitude towards drinking, focusing on the joys one an experience when getting drunk with friends? Or, is it going to illustrate the negative side effects of alcoholism? The answer? Both. And despite the balance and the necessary gravity of the theme that is explored here, the film maintains a very relaxed, fun, and lighthearted character. And it does all of this is a concise manner, which is reflected in the film's runtime (just under two hours). To top it all off, for me, the most beautiful thing about this film is that I know I can recommend it to practically everyone. That is how lighthearted and balanced this film is. It is not a film for admirers of a specific genre or anything. It is just a solid, fun, and entertaining film for everyone (except kids maybe).",

Inspired by director Thomas Vinterberg's daughter Ida, who was also due to star until she passed away just as filming began. He'd be forgiven in shelving the whole idea, but instead tweaked it and dedicated it to her. I really want to love this. Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) is a teacher, a bored one. As are his fellow teachers. It goes a bit beyond boredom for Martin though, he's called out by his students and their parents for not being engaged enough. He's in crisis, \"lacking joy\", until one of his colleagues shares a theory about unlocking the minds full potential... with alcohol. To be honest I'm going to call it here. It's not alcohol that helps Martin, it's his friends. They're solid. They care. Sure they're daft, but there's real compassion amongst them. It also helps that they collectively decide to test the alcohol theory. The theory being that the body is slightly alcohol deficient and that by topping it up a little and maintaining it, you'll be happier, more confident, productive, maybe even enlightened. What could possibly go wrong? Mikkelsen is very easy to watch. They all are really, but he's the focus and he holds it brilliantly. Martin blazes the path as the experiment becomes more... ambitious. I think there's a lot of Martin's out there. It's not really a story about alcohol, but of being lost. Lives loosing their sense of purpose. Denmark apparently has a drinking culture, especially amongst the youth. Surely no more than England, but who knows. I don't and it's not important, but the school kids respond to the more flamboyant teaching styles. It's uplifting stuff. An infectious energy permeates the screen. Especially when the needle drops on Cissy Strut in a gorgeous Scandinavian apartment and the dancing begins. Martin has a darkness in him though. He knows his limits, but with the others somewhat carelessly pushing on in the name of science. He finds the line blurring. They all do. It's raw and honest, with some very difficult themes, but Vinterberg navigates them all well. I'm not sure it's a film I can really love, but I do like it, a lot.",

And naturally it shows that it is the wrong solution to the wrong problem and that it serves to disguise other real problems.Four middle-aged men feel that they have lost the spark of youth and believe that they can recover it by maintaining an adequate dose of alcohol. Sounds stupid? Well obviously it is and they are. And they forget Kierkeegard's quote that youth is a dream, they forget that euphoria is not the natural state of man.The film is an absolutely obvious and superficial analysis of what the crisis of the 40s is. Its sense of comedy is to show obvious scenes that everyone knows and expects, to play the hackneyed.Both the euphoria of the first half of the film and the catastrophe of the second half move in the territory of what has already been seen many times. This time it is intended to justify itself by presenting a supposedly subversive message... but not so much. It is what we see in so many independent films.The most surprising thing at a purely plot level, in addition to the tricky premise of 0.5% alcohol, is how 4 adults can think that someone is going to read their report on how 4 drunk adults behave.And it does not fill the 2 hours. The characters are uninteresting, although the performances are brilliant. All the supposed value is the analysis of the situation, and this is so simplistic and obvious that it does not hold our interest.",

I usually can't take the characters seriously and the way they express themselves in are typically extremely awkward, stiff and sometimes borderlines embarrassing. From that you can probably guess that a good danish movie to me is typical a dime in a dozen. Looking at my rating for the movie you will know that this is one of them. I absolutely loved this film. Most of all It's a fun time for everyone of the appropriate age, while still reaching deeper depths in its themes like life and alcoholism.The concept of your keeping a constant blood alcohol level of 0.5 precent with the benefits of having more confidence or being more open to meeting new people is something we all could need, and would make everyday tasks and life more fun. That said most of us know that being intoxicated at all times isn't the best idea, even if the benefits might seem better than the cons at first glance. It's so simplistic, in a good way, that it almost comes as a surprise to me having never seen a movie tackle alcohol in this manner.The writers, the cinematography and the actors all did an amazing job on this movie, which truly brought it to life. It has some much energy and the actors all have such great chemistry. The cinematography is beautiful and as the movie progresses you see the environment and lighting reflect Martin's, Mads Mikkelsen's, mental state evolve and dissolve.With an amazing cast, great music and a good sense of direction and plot, this is easily recommendable to a lot of people, and a movie that will be remembered in the danish movie industry for many years. It's monumental for us Danes that Thomas Vinterberg won the Oscar for best international feature film, and congrats to him for making an amazing movie.9/10.",

Alcohol pretends to be your friend to make you feel good and confident, it loosens you up and shows your inner fears, thoughts, your hidden demons and not everyone is strong enough to cope with being on the loose all the time. In general Another round speaks loudly of all those things and would be relevant for everyone who knows drinking problems not by hearsay (which is like half of earth's population), to all of the others it would be just another movie with its moral shouting loudly since the beginning and its general idea spoiled in its poster already. That's why I intentionally named this review after D.W. Griffith's infamous 1909 short feature because of how similar they both are in concept. Overall this is a good movie with some nice soundtrack, fine dramatic performances (although a bit too strained for me), some proper thoughts to think about and a smooth aftertaste.",

Its an interesting mix as I wouldn't call it a light drama with comedic highlights like a typical dramedy, it is rather a tragedy with some funny or lets say soft elements. The screenplay is fantastic and very original. I loved Mads Mikkelsen who really deserves all the praise he can get. His performance works on so many different facettes and it is hard to read him - far from every stereotype possible and that is were the magic of Mikkelsen's performance lies in. On paper it is already an ordinary character but he was able to make it truly human - like your ordinary teacher/ father kind of guy. Thomas Bo Larasen is always good and its no difference here.

I could talk to girls, I could say all that stupid stuff that I thought would make people laugh but never had the confidence to say before, and most of all, I felt happy.It's not like I wasn't before, but I wasn't exactly the most outgoing person, and that was something I badly wanted to be by the time I went to university. Knowing that, you can probably see how I could have all too easily gotten out of hand like the characters in this film do, but thankfully I managed to control myself just before I started drinking alone.I'm sure when parties and clubs can happen again, I'll be getting royally drunk, but I'm glad that I know my limits and when the appropriate times to drink are.All this stupid storytiming is to say that this film is relatable as hell, because man does it nail that feeling of not having a care in the world when you're just that perfect amount of drunk, and it probably nails how easy it is to slip into addiction as well.I'll say that the ending may have been a bit too cheerful considering what happens in the scene prior, and that some more interesting shot composition certainly wouldn't have hurt, but the performances are all brilliant, the direction from Thomas Vinterberg is amazing, the characters are likable, and for how much of a tonal disaster this easily could have been, it pulls it off so well.So if anything I said just now resonates with you, please watch this, cause sometimes, being honest doesn't mean you have to be miserable about it.",

This seems to bring benefits: Mads Mikkelsen, who is depressed (problem with his wife, problem with his job as a history teacher), is reinvigorated and regains his appetite for teaching. It also has positive effects on three of his colleagues.Then the doses increase, first a gram for Mads Mikkelsen. His colleagues too. Of course things have to stop, because the educational community realizes it (and it is frowned upon), but one of the three continues and ends up dying from it (suicide or accident, the film is not explicit, but it does not matter). By the way, curiosity, the only character who dies is the one who is single, who has no wife, and just a dog. The female characters are poorly developed and rather caricatural (the housewife with her three small children, the adulterous woman).The film thus goes from a documentary phase (the young people go on drinking courses and get drunk to the point of vomiting), to comedy drama and then drama.Mads Mikkelsen is very good. Nice performance.The film ends on the sequence of the beginning where the young graduates are going to get drunk to vomit. The professors celebrating with them, confirming somehow their theory that an individual who has permanently 0.5 grams in the blood is the optimum state.Is this a subversive movie?",

The teachers led by Martin ( Mads Mikkelson) do find increased energy in their work and the happy students also experience this change in their teachers. However alcohol is addictive as they soon find out and their drunken demeanor puts their professional and private life in a downward spiral. Martin's marriage is in jeopardy and nearing divorce.

The list of talents from Mads just keeps on going.2. The Danes are apparently heavy into their drinking culture, and there is no age limit for drinking alcohol (age 16 to purchase but anyone can drink at any time), and drinking in public is encouraged.3. \"Another Round\" features a lot of laughing, celebratory scenes but those scenes don't feel cheerful to the audience. The movie is good at making the viewer feel uneasy and aware that there is an undercurrent of looming tragedy disguised by all the partying and camaraderie.4. The privileged and comfortable midlife crisis theme is unoriginal, but the presentation here is different from anything I have seen in movies.5.

The drinking culture is also strongly present in Mexico. I find more interesting the portrait that Vinterbeg does between young people and middle age: why the young ones seem to be happy drinking, while the old ones seem to use the alcohol as a cope mechanism? I think that as we grow up, our problems do too. And frequently, we failed to face does difficulties. We feel anguish and a constant fear of failing not only ourselves, but the others around us -like the family. Somehow, every year that pass by our responsabilities and problems get bigger.

Dig deeper people, this fantastic film is much more of a warning to casual drinkers about just how slippery the slippery slope into acoholism really is. And just like how our four primary protagonists joke at the thought of themselves being alcoholics, we too can be caught up in the cloud of denial that these characters ultimately become shrouded in.Whilst at his own birthday celebration, Magnus Millang's psychology teacher, Nikolaj, casually slips into conversation with his three teaching collegues about a study done which proposed that humans naturally have lower-than-desired alcohol blood levels. The group seem uninterested, sip their wine and swiftly move onto a new topic. Mads Mikkelsen's character however, History teacher Martin, opens up to the group about his internal struggles- which he identifies are linked to his lack of motivation to teach when compared to his younger days.Soon enough, the group find themselves undertaking a research project which involves drinking the equivalent of 1-2 glasses of wine before a school day and subsequently recording the effects, which begin positive. We see where this is going, yet, I remained glued to the big screen as I was fascinated about the excuses that the teachers would conjure in order to raise the amount of alcohol they would consume.I'm convinced that this film will speak to many drinkers, casual or heavy, reminding them how fragile they are. They walk the line of alcoholism everytime they drink. And after the struggle of a year that many have faced, that line may be finer for some more than others. Screen this movie everywhere you can- it contains a needed message whilst being delightfully wrapped up in a sweet, feel-good container which is fulled to the brim with dark humor.No, it doesn't compare to Mads' 2013 project with the same director, The Hunt, but it does offer a two-in-one.

It is set in Denmark and English is not its natural language, so if you cannot get on board with subtitles, I would not bother with this movie (and shame on you for not trying it in its natural language).Some reviewers claim this movie glorifies alcoholism and I do not know how to retort them other than to say that it is a ridiculous assertion and that this movie actually does the opposite. The \"pro-alcoholism\" critique of Another Round reminds me of when Joker (2019) came out and people said it glamorized people wanting to live the Joker's violent lifestyle. No one who actually watched Joker would want to live that man's life, and no one who watches Another Round is going to come away wanting to become an alcoholic.Another Round is about a group of teachers going through a series of mid-life crises who turn to alcohol to spice up their lives, at least at first. What makes Another Round great is simply the main cast and the fact that they all fit together well. The actors balance together a mix of drama, comedy, and tender moments, and it feels like Another Round is really all three of those elements together at once. It feels like real life, to that extent. We find humor in the drama of our daily lives, and vice versa.Mads Mikkelsen was born to play this role. I also appreciated that the movie did not follow the standardized, modern path that so many movies take nowadays of simply devolving downward into an \"everybody suffers\" ending. This movie could have gone that way where everybody goes overboard on alcohol and everyone loses everything that matters to them, but that is not what happens. Instead, we are treated to a very different type of ending, which I would simply suggest you watch to appreciate.",

The struggles to meet family matters and maintain civil friendships is encountered by all of the on-screen protagonists. Alcohol is used as a device to trigger these problems and see the good and bad its effects can have in everyday life. Significantly, the 'drinking' experiment takes place among 4 teachers, working of course in a place of drive and prosperity where children should be educated on the bad rather than the good of alcohol, however, Vinterberg ensures that the teaching flaws are explicitly presented in order to overrule any suggestions of academic gain.High quality performances are reflected even through subtitles and the articulation of the writing is interpreted even more clearly, the cast are evidently cohesive and understand their roles of assignment to make the film seem real for both comedic and dramatic affect. Music plays a key role in negotiating a somber and melancholic tone to switch so quickly into a party atmosphere as the spectacle moves from darkness to light.For a movie originally titled 'Druk' in its native country, translating to 'binge-drinking' it is certainly a watch to take the edge off - masterful.",

Better late than never, though, and thus am I glad, I got to watch it on the big screen in time.The movie perfectly balances the risk of alcohol glorification with the equally great risk of a lifted finger on this subject. At no point during the move did I feel either scolded nor encouraged to drink. Simply put, the movie merely presents the theme in a neutral manner, leaving it up to the viewers to make up their own mind about it. The latter being one of many reasons for the +15 rating in Denmark. It is a film for adults, plain and simple, so no further elaboration is needed on this note.Continuing, this of course means that there is no direct message of the film. The message is based on each and every viewer, who in turn is based on their own culture and relation to the inherent subject.Needless to say, but nonetheless necessary to bring up in this case, is the extremely incredible performance by all actors in the movie, including minor and micro characters.Obviously, Mads Mikkelsen (and \"obviously\" doesn't do this guy much justice here) is yet again able to stun and completely paralyze his audience with another luxuriously captivating performance, and... (Ohhh! Almost gave away the best part there. You will have to see the movie for yourself).Structurally, I occasionally got Tarantino vibes, though not as crazy and farfetched in a fictional realm as is often the case with his movies. \"Druk\" has a unique ability to stay grounded in such a comparison, keeping the pace of the film slow, steady and blurred, reflecting both the euphoria of being drunk and the different stages of alcoholism. (You will know what I mean when you see it).Frankly, the only flaw of the movie might be the missing (or hidden, or at least not easy to find) second plot point. I wasn't able to notice it, which resulted in a bit stretched sequence from about 70% of the movie until 85% through. Even if the previous parts of the movie did an excellent job until this point, in that exact range of its timeline not a lot of new information is introduced, and the movie therefore loses its pace and entertainment a little, which really is a shame, because it absolutely delivers on all other counts.All in all, if we take the heavy, dark and a bit clich\u00e9d theme and the structural stretch aside, the movie's Oscar is certainly still justified, because all the other film technical elements are in their right place, while daring to escape the \"box\" a little as well, keeping the movie original, fresh and conceptually interesting. So, to sum up: All the criteria for an Oscar winner are fulfilled here.",

The slightly wobbly camera work is indicative of the high calibre of craft demonstrated. Mads Mikkelsen's performance ranks among his finest. He, along with his friends, attempts to fix his life with alcohol. Which works initially but can't be controlled. Up until the final moments where his entire life is in a shambles, when he gets the message - that hope shines. Only then he can dance. The last sequence leaves an indelible impact.The director Thomas Vinterberg lost out on the Oscar to the maker of Nomadland. Wow!",

Instead, there us real weight and unpredictability to this movie, which makes it a delight.Anyone who has seen a Vinterberg movie knows he has a real gift for getting phenomenal performances and this one is no different. There is raw humanity all across this movie and it's really about passion and finding the way to reignite yourself long after life has become droll.The way the four pals in this story do that is completely dangerous and selfish but the film avoids turning into a morality tale and doesn't for a moment preach ideals to its audience. This is where it diverts from what an American studio handling the same material would've done.As for that ending dance scene, it's totally out of left field but also a complete delight.

The characters were amazingly well-designed, and I guess it should be ordinary if anyone from their middle age can be related to some feelings and situations from the movie.It's definitely a drama but with a touch of intelligent comedy. There are some parts in which you can have a good laugh.Considering that some teenagers can watch this movie, I have just one (not so positive) note to make. There is one part where it seems that if you drink alcohol, you'll get successful. Probably that part wasn't necessary.But overall, I loved the movie. I was attached from the beginning till the end. I found it very interesting and catchy.",

Four middle aged friends who all work together; three of them teachers, and one a coach, decide to experiment with alcohol in their professional life as a means of increasing productivity in what they all perceive to be a boring life in some way or another. And from this point on, each decision made in this movie plays out exactly as you would imagine... but then that's what it is about. To me, the sober viewer, it is as clear as day, the implications and the effects the next round is bound to have... but not to the men who are already involved. It's almost as if a sense of safety and precaution is what you sacrifice first, and it was shown with much excellence on screen.Major credit to lead actor Mads Mikkelsen who channeled life through the screen. His evolving personality in this movie was portrayed so convincingly with passion and flow, and for that, he deserves every bit of praise.

It is also solid, with a number of messages about Danish alcoholism, and maintains a nuanced view of alcohol. When the film is at its best, it is powerful and relaxed at the same time, a bit like the feeling of alcohol - when it's at its best, and before the headache hits, and it all falls .. for some.Thomas Winterberg experienced a tragedy during the filming when his daughter died. His daughter was part of the inspiration for the film in the first place, which is why it is also fair that the film has gone so well.Is the movie too overhyped .. no - but it's not the best movie in the world. It is solid, and together with the Riders of Justice, Zentropa has created a solid 2020 for themselves.Edit 2/1-23\nThe third act falls a bit out of place. Gets a little too wasted, like their heavy alcohol consumption. Well, still don't quite understand why it was so heavily hyped, but it's a solid film.",

He can dance, he can act like Hannibal Lecter, he can bleed out of his eyes, and he can even be in video games.Druk is not quite the warning of alcohol abuse and dependency that Days of Wine and Roses was. It meanders through various tones and moods, begging the question: \"What is Danish for 'melodramedy'?\" Also, there must be a word in Danish for schadenfreude. Too much fun can be swell, but of course the high-school teachers will take their buzz-worthy experiment of maintaining 0.05% BAC too far, going from quarter-cocked to half-cocked and ultimately totally corked.The movie only suffers from an inability to suspend disbelief. It is hard to believe four teachers would engage seriously in such an experiment, risking their jobs and family lives. There is no finger-wagging or tsk-tsking. We must decide for ourselves whether we should drink more or less, resulting in a simple moral ambiguity instead of some stern moral lesson.Drinking booze can be fun, sometimes it can be dangerous, sometimes it creates a feedback loop of anxiety and depression. Is it possible to understand joy without sadness? Is it possible to be a responsible drinker, or should everything be done in moderation, including moderation?",

            "content": "Director Thomas Vinterberg cannot be praised enough for this film. After four days of shooting, his daughter Ida was killed in a car accident. After a week of mourning, the Dane was back on the set. The idea for the film was also inspired by his daughter. It tells how four middle-aged schoolteachers go through their midlife crisis based on a theory of the Norwegian psychiatrist Finn Skarderud, who says that a blood alcohol level of 0.05 makes people go through life more relaxed and free.Each of the four main characters gets their own storyline and lets us share in their suffering in life. Once the actually optimistic psychology teacher Nikolaj, played by Magnus Milland, who has to deal with bed-wetting children at home. Then the hapless choir director Peter (Lars Ranthe), who sees himself as an expiry model and cannot find love. Sports teacher Tommy (Thomas Bo Larsen), a coach who is actually loving towards his kids but lacks any motivation. And finally Mads Mikkelsen's character Martin. He accepts being a bore and goes through life virtually invisible, which has an impact on his marriage to Anika (Maria Bonnevie). The plot is told almost exclusively from Martin's perspective. Mikkelsen thereby appropriates pretty much all the facets a person can have. At first he is desperate, then through regular alcohol consumption he suddenly becomes lively and cheerful, before his emotional world is a constant up and down at the end. Mikkelsen disappears into his role and plays this character with a great deal of subtlety and sometimes impulsiveness. Not only Mikkelsen is fantastic, his three co-protagonists also act at a high level. This is especially noticeable in the scenes in which the four of them discuss their project, explore new spheres and go out together. In the individual moments, Mikkelsen stands out because Martin takes up the most screentime.Another Round is a funny film for the most part, although the dramatic moments predominate, especially towards the end. Only then do you really become aware of its seriousness and it takes you with it. Actually, many elements correspond to a classic tragicomedy. Vinterberg manages to lay out the film in such a way that this is not always obvious and you stick to one genre in every scene. It may be mainly about the (worrying) drinking culture among adults and young people in Denmark, but Another Round is also an appeal to life in general. Yes, alcohol can awaken undiscovered free spirits in people, but equally it can literally destroy relationships and lives. Vinterberg covers all these aspects brilliantly. Most of the film runs without any musical accompaniment. But when it does, the classical music adapts to the action. The same goes for the camera work and shots: When the characters are in crisis, the film drags. When they're on the edge, it thrills with outstanding pacing. Yes, Another Round may be tedious in places, but this \"weakness\" is made up for by the explosive finale at the latest, which may be the best of the entire year.",

However, with it, comes addiction, destruction and annihilation. Each character suffers in a different way because control is unmanageable.

Why doesn't he ever talk to his kids? What made him loose faith in himself? We basically don't know anything about Tommy except that he teaches soccer? Nikolaj has marital issues too and he's just an exhausted father, i guess? And the last guy? Did we ever even see his house? It felt like a super long trailer for another film in which they actually address who all these characters are. I don't actually think you need a dialogue heavy film to make the audience invest in your characters, but you can't show snippets of a handful of guys getting wasted continuously and expect me to remember their names.",

The special relation of the alcohol culture in Denmark with this movie caused both comedic as dramatic moments in the story. Vinterberg succeeded very well in lifting this movie to a melancholic vision on midlife crisis instead of a simple but dull comedy. Hearing the emotions in the theater and my own experience, many people both laughed and shed some tears during the 2 hour long duration. This is the best movie of Vinterberg in years.The movie in general and especially the fantastic end scene gave me a great feeling while exiting the cinema.

R O U N D (2020)A simple, small, petite film by Thomas Vinterberg is a must watch film!Especially for anyone with a mind and thoughts.Its a film about humans and their sadness and how it can or cannot affect their lives. Essentially a film about a bunch of men experimenting with themselves as a group with continuous inebriation to see how it can perhaps bring some joy or improvement in their lives.The results of this intake of alcohol at regular levels are different for each of them. The 2nd half of the film is pretty much about that. And it is done BEAUTIFULLY!You can see and feel how the characters feel after they have all been introduced in the beginning of the film.The magic of the film is not about some beautiful, technicality or something but it is the simplicity with which it is shot and how the narrative is progressed. The emphasis is all on the characters and their quiet, beautiful Danish environments. There are few really good and joyful sequences in this otherwise slow burner of a film but it is the climax that you leave with in the end.The central character played Mads Mikkelsen is left 'open-minded-ended' in the end and it leads you to believe a variety of emotions on his behalf.My rating: 9/10 *********\nA must watch film!!!!",

But number one is Mads Mikkelsen, oh my god, what a man, he is perfect in every role, the most charismatic actor from the last decade. He is the star of every movie he is in and stole every second. He takes everything to the next level. I would give him every award in the world, so I hope it goes well for him in the upcoming awards season. Also, the soundtrack is superb.

            "content": "The closest translation from the Danish title would probably be \"binge drinking\". And with that in mind it's a movie that questions the Danish drinking culture in general, as a quote in the movie goes: \"What is it with this country and drinking?\"But addressing alcohol culture is not the only theme in the movie: It is generally speaking about living life to its fullest. There is a bit of tragic backstory closely related to this, with Vinterberg's daughter dying shortly before the movie's making. And as this movie is dedicated to her, it does a justified job of giving the audience a bit of nudge to reflect on their lives.The camera and editing were fantastic and especially the (drunk-)acting was flawless and felt realistic.As a fellow European I was familiar with the drinking games and occasions shown here and found it very relatable to my country. But to international audiences this may seem exaggerated, which it is not. Alcohol is a major part in social life and especially in one's youth: the legal drinking age is at 16-18 in Europe.While I think the Best International Feature Film Oscar is deserved, I'll have to rate this movie a bit lower than Vinterberg's outstanding masterpiece \"The Hunt\" nonetheless. I have mainly two points of criticism.The premise is of course not very realistic. Four middle-aged highschool teachers would not agree to start teaching with a slight buzz and later up the game even more, all as a social experiment. I think this is where audiences could get the impression they are about to watch a comedy - which it is not. In fact there are only a couple of laughs being had in the movie.Yet, there is enough motivation to some of the characters that I am willing to suspend my disbelief. Actually the setting at a school job is a brilliant choice, since these aging teachers are confronted with youth sitting in front of them every day. And you really get that they would suddenly think \"Damn, how did we get here?\"*SPOILERS*And my second criticism comes to the predictability. It was foreseeable that their actions would backfire for the second act after everything seemed to be rosy for a while. Despite assuming where this was going the movie still surprised me with a couple of gut punches. Again, not a comedy.And despite how bad things got, I enjoyed that the movie did not just stick with the preachy message \"See? This is what alcohol does!\" It rather showed us a spectrum of how different people can get affected differently.First, I was not sure if I liked the fast tonal shift in the end. Bute the more I think about the ending the more I like it. Because the funeral of their friend could be the final wake up call to the other characters. To get their shit together and quit for good. Instead, we see that even a funeral (of an alcoholic) is yet another occasion to raise our glasses for a toast. It serves as a mirror for our society.Overall, \"Another Round\" is not an excuse for drinking nor a lecture advising against drinking but rather an inspiration to live your life with a certain easygoingness. And alcohol as a catalyst can not solve all of our problems.",

            "content": "Another Round is a 2020 Danish drama from director Thomas Vinterberg. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larson, Magnus Milang, and Lars Ranthe. The film follows these 4 as a friend group of high school teachers that set off on an experiment to test a theory that humans naturally have a Blood Alcohol Content that's 0.5% too low. Oh you Danish people. I found this film extremely entertaining.And it WAS so entertaining from the get go. The opening scene of Another Round drew me right in from the start and the camera work was a big part of that.I have a pretty low tolerance for egregious shallow depth of field in film. It just comes off like a cheap trick to me for some reason. This film did it right. Another Round used focus like any part of a film should be used - as a thematic tool. It's a fairly simple connection - moving in and out of focus depending on how coherent your character is - but the cinematographer for this film did it with restraint and artfulness to the point that u was swooning over it by the 2nd act.That said, the time it took to get to that 2nd act felt like nothing. This film flew by, even at two hours long. The plot is just such a fascinating concept that I lost track of time right along with the characters.Another Round is a cautionary tale that knowingly qualifies itself. I think people will interpret it differently depending on their background, but that's my interpretation of the ending.A cautionary tale without being a lifetime film, a celebration of alcohol without a blind eye to the morning after, and an unclear message that allows you to draw your own conclusions. I loved Another Round.8/10.",

The actors are great and you get a genuine feel of their friendship even though the emotional interactions are understated as we would probably expect in Norway.Basically a group of teacher friends experiment to see if alcohol will improve their performance and possibly their lives. It perfectly illustrates both the benefits and problems of alcohol and fundamentally, I guess, illustrates why we humans have such a love/hate relationship with it. The setting is interesting, and the story weaves the sincere care they have for their students within it with beautiful small subplots.The final scene is also touching, beautiful and touches a part of your heart in a way few films do: the innocent joy of life and acceptance of both the good and bad things that come with it.It's not a comedy. It's a sincere film that draws you in and makes you feel for the characters. I wanted another film just like it afterwards. Anyway, not for those looking for laughs/action/crazyness but is for those that want a small insight into Norwegian culture, how middle aged people feel about their lives, and how alcohol touches us in both good and bad ways. The lead is fantastic. I'd say this was definitely one of the best 2 or 3 films of the year.",

This also reminds me of many other movies I've seen in the past whereby another group of adults decided to go ahead with some kind of plan (govern by rules) in order to combat other kind of issue/issues.This is very, very clich\u00e9. Very clich\u00e9.The only good thing is Mikkelsen's acting; however, even he struggles to stay convincing because of the ludicrous movie's premise.I don't even want to go into the Scandinavian drinking habits that are supposedly tackled in the movie because that's just another utterly, unnecessary clich\u00e9.Poor movie.",

Second, I didn't like some the main characters. Martin and Nikolaj were just terrible partners, and Martin's attitude sucked throughout. He's depressing to be around and makes no effort, then gets angry when he finds out his wife is having an affair after he's spent the last month intoxicated and being a complete mess.

The heroes themselves seem very human: to the extent that they behave quite annoyingly at times, especially when you expect them to act firmly and decisively, whereas they drown in their alcoholic passiveness instead.As a huge bonus to the four friends' drunk adventures the film skillfully portrays details of Danish school life and some cultural aspects of Danish lifestyle overall. When talking about Scandinavia there are always images of natural beauties springing to mind, and the work proves it right: the sea, forests and accurate greenery here and there - all fits into the narrative well.As a result, the film turns up to be a wonderful tragic comedy giving its spectators not only reasons to laugh and feel ashamed of its drunk characters' behavior every now and then but also experience sadness and tranquility when watching the dramas of their lives unfolding against the background of heady Scandinavian nature.",

The film follows four high school teachers who embark on an experiment to test the effects of drinking alcohol on their daily lives.The film is expertly crafted, with strong performances from its talented cast, particularly Mads Mikkelsen in the lead role. The cinematography is beautiful, capturing the lush landscapes of Denmark, and the score is haunting and perfectly complements the film's tone.But it's the themes explored in \"Another Round\" that truly make it stand out. The film delves into questions about happiness, relationships, and the meaning of life, and does so in a way that is both poignant and entertaining. The film is both funny and heart-wrenching, and will leave you with much to think about long after the credits have rolled.Overall, \"Another Round\" is a film that is not to be missed, and is a testament to the power of cinema to move, inspire, and challenge us.",

We watched this movie expecting some laughs, and there is none. There are some smiles, sure, but if you ever had a friend or family member with alcohol problems, then this story will be too close to home and way too real to consider laughing at. I would venture to say that watch it with caution, because the high quality of acting, and the scenarios presented therein, can become painfully personal.Overall, I just came to share that this is NOT a comedy. Whoever labeled it so, should go out more, get some fresh air, and maybe watch some movies that are not Danish. :P It is a stone cold drama with some funnier (but still very real) moments.",

These techniques, and, otherwise, methods or practises, constitute a certain form of liberation, which must not be mistaken with liberty, or, even more, with freedom. Vintemberg emphasizes the difficutly and perplexity of freedomness, while he captures the anti-social rawness of unprocessed liberation.More specifically, the experiment conducted by the company of our middle-aged men is an attempt to reactivate social and working abilities, also abilities conserning marriage and fathering. Through an antithesis scheme, Vintemberg stresses that freedom may constitute a state of being, only if it is deeply bonded with other spheres of life. Druk develops on the significance of (i) marriage and fathering (ii) efficiency at work and (iii) a cycle of friends and collegues, as for in order to show that the wounded self/individuality can remend, as long as practises of the self are framed and, therefore, difended by these three, beyond individuality, dimensions of being.Druk is about forgotten capabilities, slowly destructed, and the dangerous possibility of re-inventing them.Reinvention is presented as a procedure that can easily lead to failure if it is to be a lonely one. That is what is extracted from Tomi's tragic end, in constrast to Martin's different conclusion.Vinteberg calls as to reflect, alongside with himself, on contemporary means of freedom and the terrifying powers/factors that run against it.",

There are top tier films about alcoholism or addiction problems in general like, The Shining, Requiem For A Dream, Trainspotting, or 21 Grams, where we can see addiction is the villain. Another Round frames alcohol as a protagonist. It is vulnerable with its initial reputation but we just fall for it when we see it becoming a friend of lonely sad people, helping them become a fun version of themselves. Vinterberg makes sure that this contrast remains visible along the story with honest consequences, keeping this drama ride steady in an original plot away from naivety or cliches.The cinematography, production design and costumes are elegant. The editing is just brilliant. Great casting, and there were many touching moments with different characters, but with much focus on \"Martin\" played by Mads Mikkelsen. If Mikkelsen were to be replaced by any other actor the film would still be good but with him being there he makes the film superb.Vinterberg makes great use of Mads natural talent as an actor and a performer from the beginning to the very last scene when they pull one of the greatest performances of all time.",

One minute Mads' wife is saying she has missed him, next minute she is alluding to have slept with someone else and leaves him. One character descends into alcoholism, while the others recover. Its all very quick. One of the other reviewers says that Mads' wife offers to take him back, prompting a fun dance routine. Sorry, the subtitles i saw werent as explicit as that. The dance routine was fun though and on the whole, the film was good. I just felt that there must be a longer Director's cut out there.",

Whereas Thomas Vinterberg wished for a celebration of life, he achieved a glorification of alcohol.SPOILERS AHEAD\nThis is what the movie literally tells us: Drink alcohol to be at the top of your game professionally and in your personal life, and alcohol will even make you succeed at exams. Only a gross overconsumption of alcohol or alcoholism may be detrimental. May only though, as the best politicians and artists were alcoholics, and those who do not drink are Nazis... The woman subjected to alcohol fuelled domestic violence will take a glass of white wine when facing the abuser, before running back to him. Being sick from excessive alcohol consumption or running drunk into traffic is fun and harmless, and the final still image of the movie tells us that alcohol sets us free.Clearly the movie does not have the ambition to curb heavy drinking among Danish youth. It rather resemble the movie of a high-functioning alcoholic who would absolve himself of all guilt and even try to convince you that alcohol will make you a better person, and will make the society better too. The same movie could have been made with meth or heroin, which leaves little room for those of us who have chosen to remain true to themselves.",

            "content": "The film Druk, directed by the prolific Thomas Vinterberg, is formed because there is a theory that man is born with a lack of alcohol in his blood. This theory says that humans are born with an alcohol blood level that is 0.05% too low. The film follows Martin, a high school teacher, through a midlife crisis. He has problems with his wife and children at home and struggles with engaging his students in his lessons. Therefore, he and a few colleagues conducted a research paper about the consequences of raising your alcohol blood level and keeping it at the supposed sufficient level throughout the day. At first, the results start positive as they all become more engaged in teaching and become more open to ideas and activities. Then, they all begin to loosen up and see changes in their daily activities. After a while, some begin to feel the impacts of being constantly drunk and end up losing complete control. The film is out to comment on the danish drinking culture, which is becoming more and more out of control with binge drinking a regular part of life. For example, the film starts with an annual Danish tradition of a lake run consisting of teams of high school students who run around a lake while consuming an entire crate of beer, and vomiting can get two minutes deducted off your time. A report noted that 37% of Danes had \"major regular alcohol usage\", double the European average. With all this, Vinterberg wanted to bring this issue to light and to express that everything should be done in moderation, which can be seen as without drinking Martin and his colleagues went through life without any joy, while with too much alcohol they could not only lose loved ones but also to some extent themselves.",

Essentially, the point of the film seems to be that there is a golden section to the method of living; live life too tentatively and your inhibition will deny you the potential fruits, live too excessively and your recklessness will erode the elements of life you love the most. All of this is entwined with the unbreakable bonds of true friendship and the bliss of the heart that knows its true love has not abandoned it. Humour, pain, love, laughter, sorrow. Another Round is an utter triumph of acting, directing, storytelling, and the encapsulation of the human condition. All I can say to everyone involved in its creation is... Skol!!",

The premise is interesting enough, so as a psychology major in college I decided I'd give it a try just because of the premise, and as a film geek I'd give it a try as a Mads fan, but I wasn't expecting it to be as great as it was. The tried and worn tropes of a beat down high school teacher needing to inspire his kids, a group of grown men feeling like their lives are past, and a man slowly on the way out of his marriage are all present but in this case it isn't a bad thing. It's not a bad thing not just because they're done \"well\" or \"correctly\", but because the writers and director understood what was behind those tropes and had something to share with them. They were a part of a bigger message than just making a movie that will make money, and that's something that can be rare today. And on top of the plot lines being purposeful and meaningful they were handled incredibly well I'm terms of coherence and cohesion. They don't baby you and explain everything, but it all fits together and loose ends aren't stuck straggling behind at the end trying to play catch up. An incredible message about MINOR SPOILER (if you don't want the themes to be spoiled) not just and drinking itself, but our capacity to fall as people and the meaning that gives to our lives.

Another round is about the longing for youth, and looking for genuine emotion and connection in life. The movie encapsulates the reason we need to fail, and fail again, until something changes. Do we all succeed? Of course not, ie their friend that died. And of course drinking shouldn't be the motivation in life, but in their experiment they found new life within the moments when they were sober, in the moments when they felt most alive. It's only in the last moments where martin feels most down, and that his last attempt to save his marriage succeeded, allowing him to freely dance for the first time in years, not needing the alcohol to feel that way, but because he now feels fully alive and himself, it's time for another round.

            "content": "As a tribute to the premise of this film. I am reviewing this movie drunk. I have drunk one cup of gin and 3 cups of whiskey, hopefully thats around the 0.5% blood alcohol level that's significant to the point of this film. This film, like many of other Vinterberg's films, is drenched with realism and emotions as he effectively presents a family drama with the comedic premise of a group of goons drinking to the point of 0.5% BAC (blood alcohol content) to see if it betters their \"social and professional performance\". This film has the most visually appealing cinematography in Vinterberg's filmography (considering that I have only seen the Celebration and the Hunt HAHAHHAH). Everything you love about Vinterberg is present here, the realistic acting, the constant handheld yet effective shot composition present, the awkwardness and the unsettling mood that permeates the concepts that Vinterberg explores. In my interpretation, this film is exploring whether it is good/right to have a form of escapism for one's reality in order to improve one's life as a whole. The commentary on alcoholism is just superficial. This movie is examining inherently flawed characters that have made long-lived mistakes in their lives that have made them miserable, and they are striving for a solution to change it, and questionably rationalize it with the scientific foundation of Skaaderud's theory when it can be easily seen as an excuse to drink alcohol to evade life's challenges and relish an out-of-world sensation only possible with the elusive effects of booze.While at times the presentation of its message and thematic concern may seem obvious or pandering, it effectively showcases rich characterization from the likes of Mads Mikkelsen and others like Thomas Bo Larsen & Magnus Milang. It also alludes to and showcases everyday conflicts that resonates with pretty much everyone: the sense of inadequateness and the loss of interaction in long term relationships. It may not be as subtle as his other masterpieces, but to me it is a delectable addition to his repertoire. I strongly recommend this to the fans of his work. And if you are not one, you should watch this and then watch the Hunt, so that you would realize what a BEAST this Danish filmmaker is in his own right.In my drunken stupor, I shall now end my review. Hopefully this review is enough to intrigue you. If not, I shall make another review while sober to attract more attention MUAHAHAHA.",

Yes, he indeed showcased an introverted yet natural portrayal of a middle-class school teacher who is struggling to get out of his banality and to get back to his youthly cheerfulness. He is not alone in this endeavor; he is accompanied by three of his close friends. The scenes reminded me of the picturesque cityscape portrayed in Manchester by the Sea which is also set in a coastal fishing area. The film was presenting the slices of lives picturized as if the cinematographer has been literally spying on their lives. The warm tone of the film helps us to immerse ourselves into the deeper shelves of human emotions and dwell on them for a few moments. This also corroborated by tight close-up shots detailing every frown and even an eye wink adding up to the emotional vocabulary. The banal theme is given a fresh touchup with impeccable detailing of the personal and professional lives of four friends. Even though the entire storyline is revolving around these alcohol consumption experiments and their fatal outcomes, it holds on to another set of midlife crises like loneliness and the burden of responsibilities.

Everyone has a hope now, Nikolaj's life with his wife is getting better and he is not wetting the bed anymore :'D Peter started dating and was so emotional seeing the love of his students, Martin is supposedly back with anika and has a chance to get things right.Mads Mikkelsen with a stunning performance and a beautiful dancing scene at the end, I also can't neglect his fellow teachers in the movie, they were all amazing and I enjoyed every scene of them together.",

            "content": "Mid Life Crisis, we all deal with it in our own ways, American Beauty, Kevin Spacey buys a red car and works at a burger place to affix his youth, John Travolta and co decide to ride to the pacific coast on their bikes to renew their life with connotation and exploration in Wild Hogs and much like Edgar Wrights, At Worlds End, the film in question here uses alcohol has a principal promoter to get some lost characters to revamp, remember and recharge their much needed mundane lives with a spark of meaning.Thomas Vinterberg, Danish director makes his most personal film yet, a film that suffered tragedy in the first week of production that in no doubt flickered the energy seen in this movie from the vision and panache depicted and at the centre of it, a career high performance from fellow Dane, Mads Mikkelsen who conveys the everyday man's image to precision and the in depth emotions within, expressively shown in every part of his acting that comes to a theatrical release at the end of the movie.For a Danish audience, this is the all-star cast, the major league players are all on show here, for an American, or western audience we are very invested from the reputation of their past collaboration of the hunt back in 2012, a stunning success that has certainly raised bars and expectations for this film originally titled Druk, which is Danish for Bender a film that certainly peaked awareness from its subject matter, a film that we know has the potential to deliver no matter what the plot may be because of the team behind it.Another Round, has it is called In America tells the story of The banal reality of four high school teachers in Denmark who finds a cause to rediscover the presence of their live again instead of languishing about what could of or might or been in the past. After dinner one evening, the four friends talk about a theory through sociable conversation slash banter about humans that can perform better with a small amount of alcohol frequently present in their system.Giving themselves the unjustified reasons to do this like how famous drunks performed better like Churchill and Hemingway and With absolutely nothing to lose and with the shock of smiling and being present and comfortable with the lives again, they take on this theory together and decide to stay low level drunk all day whilst observing and recording the results: at first with some optimistic paybacks but then eventually soon starts to spiral into a learning curve about life, purpose and reason.The heart of this movie is the characters that have to go through some sort of obstacle to actually re-discover that what they had was enough and suitable for them. The normal construction of emotions is if you are at a limbo stage in life, aka a midlife crisis, a psychologist tells people that you are naturally looking for a spike, a spike you know will shoot up, like buying a car or riding to the coast on a bike, then drastically and slowly go down below what your limbo state was and at that low point, you then start to regret and realise that your life wasn't that bad at that limbo state, meaning quit simply that your normal routine life is actually everything you need and want it to be if you allow yourself to be in the present.It is a worthwhile message that this film is cleverly trying to make people realise, a message that isn't articulated in American Beauty or Wild Hogs, where they simply focus on the spike but not the repercussions of the quick decent from this initial spike.The idea of finding purpose again in life is an important arc of a story done in many films, but what Vinterberg is exposing here is the literally movie interpretation of what bugs bunny does to trick the Tune Squad in Space Jam by giving them, the special stuff drink, and making them perform a lot better, tapping into that unfilled potential, unlocking it and then later realising that the special stuff was the just water, it was also part of their DNA to do it, and it just needed a scapegoat, if you will, to release and even change the way your mindset works. Obviously, with four people doing this, we have different experiences, different mind-sets has the film goes along. Completely fascinated and convinced that this theory works, they decide to up the dose of alcohol level and in this is where the lessons and mistakes are happening, where the spike starts to gradual come down.The tone is exceptional, it finds a nuance place between hilarious and melancholic, ever-changing our opinions of this experiment has the movie goes. What starts to be one thing, deviants to something completely unexpected and thus creates this enigmatic story to follow where we don't know what's around the next corner because this journey, rightfully so, is out of control, in the hands of the over-indulgence of alcohol and the newly sparked victims of this experiment.It's high concept, its daring and the darkness is well placed in a movie that is at the same time, amusing.The ending of the movie is in no doubt shining the ever-needed light into a film that could be hidden by western audiences because of the unknown interest in Nordic films. The last scene, proving very meme worthy and high impact is a trailer on its own to promote the movie, the dance of life, the realisation of how precious and quick life can be and how important it is to be in the presence.Mads Mikkelsen an ex-dancer, beautiful orchestrates a physical message of a man finally discovering something after 40 year, the beauty of life of when you are in the present. He defines his character has something who has missed the train for life and has been on the platform waiting ever since, a beautiful visual metaphor for his circumstance at the beginning of the movie, one where unfortunately a lot of people can relate to and this is the market that Vinterberg chooses to explore very inversely than other commercial movies following similar story arcs.He does this again with the social impact of how a lie can spiral out of control with his past film with Mikkelsen in The Hunt and once again conveys another messaging on life escalating and the social impact of everyday things effecting your life. Vinterberg is clinical, a master of this trade and a soon to be household name, if he isn't already to the general broad audience which will put his names up there with Christopher Nolan and Denis Villneueve.A mid life crisis is simply an escape, just like films are but what makes Another Round seductively intriguing is the on the noes story of similarities an audience can easily relate to and completely understand the emotions the actors are performing which makes it not an escape but simply a realisation, a wake up call that life, of course is precious and being in the present is in fact the answer to any midlife crisis, a spike that will never go down but simply remain constant just like time, just like life and the sooner you are realise that, the happier you will be.",

These men have undeniable chemistry on set; their friendship is one you want to be a part of.Long after watching Druk for the first time, I learned that the Director, Thomas Vinterberg's daughter, Ida, died four days into shooting this movie. She was supposed to be in the film. The movie is actually dedicated to her. Vinterberg overcame what is one of the biggest tragedies you could experience as a father and delivered an awe-inspiring tribute to his daughter.

A group of friends who follow some obscure theory and start drinking to improve their daily lives. The obvious downfalls happen both in career and home lives. Not knowing the culture, the drinking of the students did seem a bit much. The exams process and graduation activities again were all foreign to me and didn't fully understand. Dancing, okay- not sure yet what I think in total. Not bad, not great for the American audience.",

There are some chuckle worthy parts and some heartwarming parts.The movie sheds light on the midlife crisis of 4 teachers whose life have become stale. They decide to see whether maintaining a \"healthy\" alcoholic buzz throughout the day will enhance their professional and personal lives.Without spoiling it, it goes as you would expect it to. But that isn't the point. It's the journey they go on, the struggles they face, the highs and the lows. It's the bond the characters share and how they lift each other up and are there for one another. It's the journey, not the destination.This movie was absolutely worth watching. A heartwarming film that sucks you in and takes you through a range of emotions.",

            "content": "A great film centred around the role that alcohol plays in society. I was initially surprised when I read reviews describing the film as pro-alcohol. I personally thought the opposite.There were many thought-provoking moments in the film and I found myself reflecting on my own beliefs around alcohol consumption and habit formation, as well the responsibility that teachers carry. Take for instance, the scene when Lars Ranthe's character \"Peter\" was consoling the student, \"Sebastian\". Peter encourages Sebastian to drink alcohol to calm his nerves and help him pass his exam. Yes, he might have helped him pass the test, but he also taught Sebastian to avoid facing his problems and rely on alcohol as a crutch when faced with a challenging situation. Sebastian will unconsciously associate the good feeling he gets after passing the exam with the act of drinking the alcohol, forming a habit. Why do the hard work and face your issues head on when you can just take a drink? This led me to question the role of a teacher. Is teaching only about getting good grades for your students? Or is teaching really about leading your students to recognise their own strength and power and showing them how to deal with problems in a healthy way?",
