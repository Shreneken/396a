{"rating": 0.0, "release_date": "2022-12-21", "num_reviews": 505, "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "summary": "N/A", "Yeah, it's that good.": "I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.", "Darker, Better and Brings my childhood back": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the \"Shrek\" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. \"The Last Wish\" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original \"Puss in Boots.\" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, \"The Last Wish\" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.", "It was just right.": "SCORE: 9.5/10Puss in Boots has returned! I absolutely love movies that stick to what they are good at and don't try to overextend story lines that aren't very good. Every part of the story had its place and I didn't feel like they spent too much time on one specific part, with the exception of the main story of all the characters chasing after the Last Wish. Doug still holds the place for cutest animated dog in a movie, but Perrito was definitely giving him a run for his money. He was so pure and cute, and his dialogue was always perfectly timed. The scene with the bleeps when he gets kidnapped by Goldi and the Three Bears was hilarious and him putting his head on Puss' chest, acting as his therapy dog, was one of the cutest things I've ever seen.Death was one of the coolest animated villains I've seen. The animation style was perfect for the action scenes and his appearances were always epic. The Ethical Bug bit was also very funny and the humor in general was great. The ending was awesome, with the rest of the crew teaming up to take down Jack Horner and realizing they already all they could ever wish for. Goldi had her family and Puss had his one life worth living. Gotta love the Gingy and Pinocchio cameos, as well as them sailing off to Far Far Away to \"catch up with some friends\". This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It was such a fun adventure and I really liked all the characters that were introduced along the way! It was just right.", "Aged like fine wine.": "Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship.", "My pick for Best Picture 2022": "The last \"Puss In Boots\" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the \"Shrek\" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****", "A Darker DreamWorks": "Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first \"Puss in Boots\" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in \"The Bad Guys\"), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in \"Shrek 2\" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place.", "A return to form indeed.": "I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio.", "Dreamworks best movie besides Shrek and How to Train your Dragon!": "I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception.", "Not only fun, but heartfelt too.": "This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as \"just an animated film\".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD.", "Finally!! A genuinely good animated kids movie!!": "Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5.", "HOW IS THIS MOVIE THIS GOOD?!!!!": "I genuinely cannot believe I'm saying this, but this is one of the best movies of the year, so far, it's neck to neck with The Menu for me.Incredible on every front.The animation is incredible. I'm beyond thrilled that Dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.The characters, EVERY SINGLE ONE, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core.", "unexpectedly GOOD for adults and kids": "FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!", "I got what I wished for; no magic required.": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde est\u00e1 la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!", "A shockingly audacious film wrapped inside a seemingly familiar package": "Alright I know what you're thinking after seeing the score of this review. \"Sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?\"Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.", "No Courage Without Fear...": "Poor old Puss has used up eight of his nine lives, now he's a shadow of the cat, that used to thrive, he's residing in a home, no more to dance, to fight, to roam, all the things he so enjoyed, he's now deprived. But Goldilocks, and her three bears, need the cat's claws, to get a map, that's clasped in Jack, Horner's big paws, that will lead them to a star, on a journey wide and far, and a wish that gives them everything and more.And thus follows an enchanting adventure of discovery and realisation, of avarice and excess, of friendship and family and love. Great animation, perfectly delivered dialogue and a universal message relatable to all.", "A Fun and Visually Appealing Adventure": "A delightful animated film that offers fast-paced humor, elaborate visuals, and strong voice acting from a talented cast. Antonio Banderas once again brings charm and depth to the titular character, and Harvey Guillen steals the show as the sweet and enthusiastic Perrito. The dynamic between Puss, Perrito, and Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault) is engaging and adds substance to what could have been a purely playful endeavor. The film's anime-influenced action sequences are visually striking, and the use of dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves helps to smoothly transition between scenes. Overall, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a fun and visually appealing adventure that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages.", "Haven't seen an animated movie like this in years": "Wow ! Dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and I think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .Without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .Appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.Highly recommended and worth every penny \ud83d\udc4c", "A Wish Can Come True! Solid Start To DreamWorks Redemption": "LIKES:Pacing\n-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans\n-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly\n-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel\n-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want\n-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation\n-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:\n-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes\n-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent\n-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times\n-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart\n-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness\n-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable\n-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists\n-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all\n-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered\n-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times\n-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete\n--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT\nI must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things.", "The best animated film of the past 5 years": "This film is extremely entertaining, hilarious, but also intriguing and can be genuinely intense. It has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by John Mulaney's character). The characters are all very well developed and fleshed out (everyone has backstories for example), many of them get satisfying archs. On the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. It has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie its own, and it doesn't feel like a rip-off of spider verse to me at all. There's a ton of detail and symbolism to analyze with this film as well, especially in the battle scenes between Puss and the Wolf, which have a ton of interesting details and moves (as far as a cat vs a wolf goes).I always complain about finales in animated movies being underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is AWESOME)This movie is great for kids and adults. It's just that good.", "Outstandingly good": "It is beyond crazy how good this movie was. The character development was so very well-done, Puss experiencing fear for the first time, and his fear of mortality was so palpable, well, reasoned and relatable.Death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, I totally understood why Puss was so afraid of him.The side characters were all likeable. The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.They also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major Pirates Of The Carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come. I would be happy if they made another installment.", "The best movie in the entire SHREK franchise!": "You heard me! My wife and I just got back from the theater, and absolutely LOVED this movie, even more than any of the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots!This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!", "Superb sequel": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a sequel that wasn't asked for but that just makes it's surprisingly high quality all the better, a sequel that far exceeds the enjoyable original with a mature story about rejecting the fear of death and accepting that life is special because of its mortality.You can tell that Antonio Banderas loves playing this character a lot and it absolutely comes across in his voice acting. He never sounds like he's phoning it in once and still has all the charisma and energy of the character after all these years.Salma Hayek also has just as much energy and charm this time around and has a very natural chemistry with Banderas. Harvey Guillen could've easily become annoying with his endless optimism but that never happens and he's just so lovable and pure.Wagner Moura is note perfect with an all time great animated villain whose threatening voice acting matches his characters visual look so well and is able to bring new life to a film that's already so alive whenever he's on screen.Joel Crawford's direction is amazing, the action sequences are so inventive and fun to watch and the lower frame rate makes them even better. The animation itself is absolutely gorgeous, so much better than what came before with a vibrancy that stuns from beginning to end as an oil painting come to life.", "LOVE IT!": "After losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, Puss in Boots is down to his last life. An encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. After escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name Puss in Boots and begins life as an adopted cat. He learns about the Dark Forest where someone can make a wish on the Wishing Star. With this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.A little late to review this movie, but I still caught it in theaters. I knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. At first, I was wondering why DreamWorks is creating another Puss in Boots movie. It feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. As someone who has not watched the original Puss in Boots, I do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe Puss' relationship with Kitty Softpaws. With that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animated films. First of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. The movie has probably the best animation from a CGI film I have ever seen. Not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. There are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of Puss staring in the eyes of Death. These shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. Every shot in this movie looks awesome. The animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. This movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. The set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. The opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, I knew I was in for a ride. The soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for Puss in Boots.Fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. This movie pushes its PG rating. There is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. The story is about how Puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. If he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. This is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. With that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. This movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the Wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. It never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. I love the snarky dialogue, Perrito gets one scene with Goldilocks and the Three Bears that steals the show comedy wise. This movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.In addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. Puss is at his best. He is the same awesome and adorable character from Shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. He starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that Death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. His friends Kitty Softpaws and especially Perrito are great characters too. Perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. He is also surprisingly aware of emotions. There is one scene with him and Puss that warmed my heart.As for the antagonists, the Wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. He has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out Puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. He is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. Kids might have nightmares because of him. Goldilocks and the Three Bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. Then there is the gluttonous scumbag Jack Horner. This is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. They make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and I love it. We need more outright terrible people in new animated films. He is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.Every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. It helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with Antonio Banderas as Puss, Salma Hayek as Kitty, Harvey Gull\u00e9n as Perrito, John Mulaney as Jack Horner and especially Wagner Moura as the Wolf. Moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation I have seen in a while. Each person brings their character to life in this movie. I can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. That is how you know that you have a great cast.There is not a dull moment in this movie. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animation and more. I did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when I saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, I knew this movie was going to be a ride. I did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. I really hope it wins best animated feature at the Academy Awards this year. DreamWorks deserves this one. Check it out as soon as you can.", "The best Animated Movie of 2022!": "This movie was a blast!!Saw it in the theatre the day it came out and I LOVED IT!Even if there was a change in animation (Which the one in the 2011 one had more detail), this one still had the spark to a good plotThe audacity between the Wolf and Puss throughout the movie gave it the \"Thriller\" theme somewhat but it was amazing, I am a horror fan and loved that, anytime I see two red glowing dots, I think of the WolfAmazing story, plot, characters, animation, everything, same how I felt with the 2011 version, the 2011 version was the first movie I saw in the movie theatre (I was 4 years old) and it has been my favorite Dreamworks movie ever since, but now this and the 2011 Puss In Boots is tied for my favoritesThis is by far the best movie made in 2022! Amazing job to the Dreamworks team for making such an amazing movie!", "Watch out, Disney": "I can't believe how much I loved this movie, the animation, the script, the characters, the story, even the music, everything about this film is Oscar worthy. Yes, it's really that good. It's hard to believe this is a sequel to a spin-off from a franchise that already had so many movies, this film blows all of them out of the water. Yes, this movie is better than Shrek, just do yourself a favor and watch the film in theaters while it lasts, you will not regret seeing this style of animation on the big screen. My only complaint is John Mulaney was sort of distracting as a voice, I couldn't focus on the character because of the voice.", "It's better than original": "Puss In Boots The Last Wish improves considerably on its predecessor, with spectacular animation and a plot worthy of the franchise.The animation looks incredible in the action and chase sequences, the effort put into the film is noticeable, the same applies to the soundtrack that perfectly accompanies every moment of the movie. Antonio Banderas performs a good performance giving emotional and funny moments.I am glad that Dreamworks have rescued this project and have given it a facelift for this time, providing an entertaining movie for both children and adults.I love this movie and I can't wait for the moment to see it again.", "Actually a fantastic movie!": "After experiencing it on the big screen, I can say without a doubt that this movie crushes any and all other movies released this year, with the exception of the bad guys of course. This movie showed me that there is still hope in animation and DreamWorks in general, it's an experience waiting to happen, don't miss out! For you will definitely want to see this movie, the characters, the animation, the art style, and of course the story was truly remarkable! Even most of the jokes are good. Please if you are still considering it, watch this movie! It's a must watch, you and your friends will enjoy it.", "A rousing animated gem.": "It may seem like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish pointless ridiculous film on the surface ..... but there is a lot to like about this animated DreamWorks film; the movie delivers on several levels making it worth your time seeking out . I am praising the overall aesthetic. The animation is more advanced, the movie looked like it was a fairy tale painting. Takes advantage of modern CG technologies lovingly paired with more traditional 2D techniques. In the opening, the film uses more hand-drawn techniques like your yesteryear cartoons . And as it progresses the technique harnessed new advancements in CG technology to reintroduce this fairy tale world in new and refreshing way.....It is quite the spectacle to witness and in 3D to boot !!! Not the Same Old CG. In the animation, they actually took off motion blur so that it frames stutters . I have actually never seen animation technique like this before ! Really made this fantastical hybrid.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Mashed up a Spaghetti Western with a fairy tale, so you get those beautiful Western compositions and staging opportunities, but then you get these fantastical locations born out of your imagination.Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives.And the movie is all brought to life with a cast full of Oscar nominated and winner actors; It makes all the sense in the world when you've got an entire universe populated by iconic fairy tale characters like Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo), the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and even Puss himself (Antonio Banderas).This is a \"must-see\" for all. There are so many takeaways. This movie kept me wanting more. It was great to see all the fairy tale characters in play wanting something they already possessed, needing to appreciate the moment--learning to be mindful of what we already have around us everyday. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation with a poignant, surprisingly mature story . 8/10.", "Gave Me A Great Experience": "Animation movies usually are comedic and does not treat itself seriously. However, this move surprised me. It gave the characters a story and took it to the next level. Puss and Boots has used up 8 of his 9 lives. The Wolf who looks like death is truly a terrifying character that made Puss and Boots really scared of Death. I love everything in this movie. Goldilocks is looking for a family, Kitty Softpaws looking for true love, Perro is looking for friends, and Jack Horner is looking for power.The animation style is very well done and looks absolutely stunning. I love this movie and I would watch it again and again. What a great way to end 2022.", "The legendary Puss in Boots": "I have seen good movies in the year of 2022, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) is by far the best animated movie of 2022 and is my favorite movie from that year. Also, it is the best movie in the Shrek franchise.The voice cast is great; Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was great, Salma Hayek was great, and Harvey Guill\u00e9n as Perrito was great because they are good characters, and they are funny. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, Olivia Colman as Mama Bear, Ray Winstone as Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo as Baby Bear were funny, and they were also good characters.There is this wolf villain in the movie that is legit creepy, was such a cool character. He does certain things that makes him a great villain for Puss in Boots to go against, and he is voiced by Wagner Moura who has a great voice for this character.The animation is beautiful in this movie; it has amazing action scenes, pretty scenery, and imaginable locations that look great in this animation style. The movie is also creative in how it uses fairytale locations and items from those stories, which is what makes another villain character voiced by John Mulaney funny to watch.The movie has a simple plot but does it in a creative way with great characters, and some little references to Shrek. What I especially loved was how Puss in Boots starts laughing in the face of danger, but because he is on his last life, he starts getting scared and starts thinking about what he has done with his earlier lives and how spent them.I had a fun time with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022); it has fantastic animation, it was funny, it has great characters, it has great emotional moments, and there are great action scenes. I highly recommend checking this movie out because you will have gun with it, and I am excited to see this movie again when I get the chance.", "decent...": "Is a large understatement when reviewing ''puss in boots 2'', because this was a marvel of animation techniques, a pepperspray full of rainbowlike colours from start to end, and a story that accelerate from a dim start of reminisence into a progressive eroticlike cataclysm of sound and vivid visioned story that engulfed most of the tom and jerry language spheres children fairytail caracters in its well filled bossom of fanatic fantastic fantasia of animation. Include the voice acts, the musical score and the insanely well done job made by the colourasation crew, this will stimulate your medula oblongata into a feverish climax that youll dwell over for a long time.The gibberish grumpy old man saw this 3 times on our last family night after x-mas holiday season, with my wife and each of my adult children, and the jury said...perfect... bravissimo, maybe a dacapo in 20 years, just to forget the caracters again as the years fade by.", "Puss in Boots: into the Shrekverse": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sixth entry in the Shrek franchise and a sequel to the spinoff film from over a decade ago. All the writings on the wall screamed cash grab and milking a franchise. Yet somehow this movie ended up being an absolute blast to watch!The animation is stylistic, vibrant and gorgeous with animation that is inspired by the Spiderverse movies. Every frame is whacky and creative! The story is also wonderfully done despite the short runtime. It gives a very poignant and meaningful message to the audience. What surprised me the most though was the action scenes! Dreamwork didn't need to go that hard but wow those action scenes are choreographed so well!I don't like milking a franchise for over 20 years but this film gives me slight hope that the next entry might be worth watching.", "One darn good entertainer!": "This has caused quite a stir in recent days, and it's it safe to say that it eventually caught my interest. Speaking for myself, I knew nothing about Puss because I had never seen a single movie in the 'Shrek' lineup, which sparked my curiosity even more.To prep for this allegedly wonderful sequel, I had to finish the first film first, which I did. I saw the first Puss in Boots movie this morning, but to my utter disappointment, it did not meet my expectations, and uncertainty worked its way in. I was worried about whether the sequel would live up to the hype.And I am pleased to report that it did. 'The Last Wish' may not be among the best films I have ever seen, but it is an interesting and enjoyable watch for sure.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the blend of two distinct animation art styles makes for an interesting cinematic experience, the score, too, sprinkled its fair share of magic, and on top of that, the characters are more fleshed out, unlike the last time, and the inclusion of 'Perrito' and 'Death' brought radical changes to the narrative, their mere presence made this more exciting.", "I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat": "CS Lewis once said a children's story that only appeals to children is not a good children's film in the least. I can think of plenty of crummy kids' movies that illustrate the point, but I'd rather bring up a positive example-- PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH.I cannot believe I am saying this about a Shrek spinoff, but this movie really is that good. It works on so many levels: as a high-speed comedy, all the jokes land, but as a story about mortality and the meaning of life, this film is oddly compelling and mature. The plot literally involves Puss running from the personification of death, hoping to cling to his life. In between the funny scenes, I was actually moved by the existential crisis of this cartoon cat. That's no small feat.This is truly a movie kids and adults can cherish.", "A fantastic movie": "Stunning animation, heartfelt story, beautiful music and most importantly, there was true passion. You can really tell someone wanted to make this movie.The fun moments were heartwarming, the scary moments were truly suspenseful and the action was incredibly fluid.There are some negatives, mainly regarding the villians, but they are very minor compared to the overwhelming positives.The main message of the movie is as beautiful as the animation, you have one life, don't spend it doing frivolous things, find people you can love and trust, embrace them with all you got, because death comes for us all one day and you don't want to face it alone.Just watch this movie.", "Puts most recent movies, not just animated movies, to shame.": "In an age when movie and TV franchises seem to aim just to be divisive and disappointing (I'm looking at you, Disney), I don't think anyone was expecting much from Puss In Boots: The Last Wish - certainly not I.After the first 5 minutes, I knew this was something special.Firstly, the art style is phenomenal - taking ideas from Arkane and Enter The Spiderverse, every frame looks like it could be a painting (which is intentional and very hard to pull off), and the action/cinematography is top fluid but bombastic. The 2D elements make it appear hand-animated at times, which adds to the magical feel, and makes it feel like it belongs with the animated greats of last century.The music is incredible, with tunes that will stick in your head for weeks, and the fight choreography syncing with the beat makes most of the movie feel like a 1.5 hour long trailer (which is obviously a good thing).The dialogue is incredibly written, along with the story as a whole. Not a line is wasted - this is the most efficient storytelling I think I've ever seen. In a 'short' movie, characters are introduced and fleshed out in such a way that they will stick with you, and you can't wait to see them again. The cast do a great job of selling them too. Goldi and the bears come out with brilliant British-isms, and as another reviewer said, the script grapples with very deep themes without taking itself too seriously.And then there's the wolf. This character is why the movie is a solid 10 for me. His style, his voice, his motivation, just his whole deal, is the reason this is now in my top 5 movies of all time (no, I'm serious).At a time when Disney seem set on watering down their movies such that they have no plot, no antagonists, no stakes, no soul - Dreamworks have taken on the mantle.It made me laugh, and it made me well up - even on rewatching. Partly because it has some touching moments, but also because it reminds me of better, simpler days, when people new right from wrong, when love and romance were valued. You might think I'm overselling it, but Hollywood is where the fight for our values is playing out.There are those that say that Hollywood is done - I know I did. But Dreamworks have provided a glimmer of hope in the most excellent way.", "A visual delight. A script that could have given more.": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a film whose animation is excellent, full of colorful and detailed scenes, but its script becomes tired in some scenes and even predictable, although its positive message on issues of personal relationships stands out. The characters are fun, highlighting Goldilocks and the three bears. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek manage to entertain by lending their voices to the protagonists. Puss in Boots is a fun character but his story lacks more irreverence like in \"Shrek\". The soundtrack perfectly recreates the essence of a fairy tale. \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a visual delight with a passable script that could have been better.", "Outstanding for All Ages. Relatable Characters and Predicaments": "Well-written. Well-paced. Laughed out loud a dozen times. Laughed more quietly fewer times. We enjoyed how the writers wove other fairy tale characters into the movie. Never a dull moment.Our group of nine were ages 5 through 60, and we all enjoyed this. As for \"relatable predicaments\", no, we're not down to our last life and searching for a wish start while being chased by Goldilocks, 3 bears, and Jack Horner, but the underlying themes of 'there's no place like home', 'trust/betrayal dilemma', and 'family and love are what you make of them', are things that we all encounter. This movie handled them well. No innuendo or vulgarity, and none required.", "A Strange Comparison(with Breaking Bad) and Then Some": "In the Shrek movies, Puss in Boots was a very likable character. I think it is safe to assume that most of the people who love Shrek (specifically Shrek 2) also enjoy seeing Puss in Boots. It is enjoyable to watch him, doesn't interfere much with the themes of movies but has funny scenes and great action. As I was thinking of these things, I realized something. He is just like Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. Saul Goodman is a great character in Breaking Bad. He is great in scenes he is in and is so fun to watch but he isn't much of a character. Then Better Call Saul came and Saul Goodman (Jimmy Mcgill) became as complex as (if not more) Walter. First Puss in Boots movie wasn't like that for Puss. It was more of the same in Shrek movies. This movie delivers the character Puss in Boots desperately needed and then some. His arc in this movie is amazing and in a perfect world, the script of this movie would get an Adapted Screenplay nomination at the Oscars this year (considering the fact that the competition in the Adapted Screenplay category is nonexistent).Death is an amazing villain. Having shorter screen time than most characters makes him an even better character. Again another comparison to Better Call Saul, Death is like Lalo Salamanca. Lalo also doesn't have a big screen time in the six seasons of the show, but he is easily one of the most memorable characters. Death is always there, back in the audience's mind, and just when you forget that he exists, he returns. His whistle, his charisma... Brilliant!Puss and Kitty's storyline and conflict are very complex when you remember that this is an animated movie mostly targeted at kids. The themes of legacy, the meaning of life, and the fear of attachment are very refreshing to see in an animated movie again. The addition of Perrito creates a great contrast between him and Puss and I would even go further to say that it can even spark some philosophical discussions about which way to live is better for you. Legacy or living a life where you are comfortable with your family.I loved the additions of the three bears and Goldilocks. Their storyline was also fairly interesting to see progress but its pacing could have been better, which makes them the weakest links of the film which is a d**n good weak link if you ask me. The character of Jack Horner. He has very funny moments and is very interesting to see a villain who is truly deeply villainous with no point of return in an animated movie. The conscience bug thing was also interesting to see unfold.The animation and action scenes are superb. Especially the ones with Death. Death is so good that I can't believe it. There are many jokes that land, songs that are fun and most importantly the movie structurally works. It just works. With this many characters, with this many plotlines, with this many detours, you might think that it is impossible to tie this in a great package. But they do. When this movie is at its worst, it is decent but when it is at its best it is one of the best-animated movies, ever.Where did this movie come from? I would have wanted to be a kid when I first watched this movie. I would have been scared but I would have loved it. Then I would have watched it again, sometime. And then again. It would have created nostalgia and at my age today when I would have looked back I would have said, \"it is not the best-animated movie ever, but it is my favorite animated movie ever.\" because it would have been. What more can I say?", "MOVIE OF THE YEAR": "This movie is quite literally the best movie i have seen all year. The animation is beautifully stunning. It is the best animations since spiderman into the spider verse. The use of color was fantastic and the fight scenes were dynamic and interesting while being original too.The character development was beautiful, the main villain was terrifying. I quite literally got chills every time the villain appeared on screen.I went into this movie expecting a stupid children's movie that me and my brother could make fun of but I left having seen a movie that I will never forget.I have seen it in theaters twice already. I will never stop recommending this movie.", "Amazing": "This movie is something else is much better than expected. The characters are good and the story is simple. Everything about this movie is just right. I got the chills every time death came, he is just so well written. Everything felt dark and sort of muffled. There are all lot of emotional parts in there too like how goldilocks realized that she didn't need the wish. But that she had everything she wanted all along. Also jack horner who is just such a funny evil character that just murders all of his people and doesn't care even a bit. All in all its just a really really good movie and I would recommend it to everyone! So go and watch it!", "The best DreamWorks movie since Dragons.": "\"Like Kung fu Panda (2)\" this film is gorgeous and has phenomenal fight choreography. The animation is colorful and each character has a specific movement.There aren't any* characters I dislike in this movie. The writing has a the same cynical and irreverent style of the first 2 Shrek's but it has an almost Disney like genuineness. The characters in this movie don't trust each other, but even they all* have hearts.I think the movie has 4 acts and the time between act 1 and 2 are a little slow, but overall it has fantastic pacing.Other than \"Into Spider-verse\" and \"The Lego Movie\", there isn't a better family movie in the last decade. In the last 2 decades I think I prefer \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and a handful of Pixar's best I can't think of.", "Wasn't expecting such a good movie": "I'm a 37 year old male with no kids and I loved this movie. I've never seen any other puss in boots movie (never thought I would either) but the reviews of this movie intrigued me enough to check it out.If you like \"How to train your dragon\" you'll enjoy this too. It's a fun, engaging and enjoyable feel good movie with a great message. Loved all the characters from popular fairy tales being the cast in this film. It was funny, engaging, light and serious enough to make a grown man come here and write this review.Good movie. Never thought I'd watch this as an adult let alone be reviewing it.", "\"I'll get you, my p-r-e-t-t-i-e-s, and your . . . \"": "\" . . . Little dog, too\" Big Jack H-o-r-n-e-r quotes the Wicked Witch of the West from THE WIZARD OF OZ. Just as in that 1900's feature film, the team of spotlit characters in PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH learn that they do NOT need Ruby Red Slippers or a witch's magic spells to find their rightful home and family. As with the quartet of Dorothy Gale, the Scare-Raven, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion, the title character, along with Kitty and the tag-along sock mutt, learn that they've had the key to contentment within easy reach all along. For a sequel, this story seems very fresh and imaginative, providing a new spin on several classic storybook creatures in a very provocative and entertaining manner.", "A must Watch.": "I am a loss for words, what an astonishing dreamworks film 2nd behind How to train your dragon. Such an amazing plot, I love all the fairytale essence of the film. Animation is comparable to a freshly baked cookie your grandma made on a sunny day, I love how we got a bigger picture from the 2011 puss and boots. Immersing into their minds and fears. The art style is so unique, this is a step up of the decade for dreamworks. All these years I thought dreamworks would never go back to a fairytale plot that is fun and exciting for children and adults. Amazing humor compared to modern kids films. I small bit of Shrek's profanity back in the early 2000s is used again, plot was no where near childish but just right. The so called \"villian\" wasn't predictable whats so ever, it was a twist so amazing. Character designs are so pretty to look at, goldi and the 3 bears is just what makes the film even better.", "A cute family friendly adventure!": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a fun adventure in the \"Shrek\" universe! I gotta admit I have not seen the original film, and don't cherish the \"Shrek\" films as much as many do... so I went into this with mild expectations. And honestly, I had a good time; it was cute! Do I think it was as good as many other reviewers have suggested? No. But it was enjoyable, lighthearted fun that is perfect for families with kids! The voice cast was awesome, especially John Mulaney and Florence Pugh as the villains, Jack Horner and Goldilocks respectively. And of course Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots is iconic as ever!The animation here was gorgeous too, honestly it was one of my favourite parts. I love that major studio animated movies are finally starting to take more risks with their animation style, moving away from the typical 3D CGI realism. You gotta respect \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" for starting this trend and showing that different styles can work! I loved that this had a more watercolor, storybook illustration look to it, it really worked for the story and was employed in such creative ways! I would love to see the \"Shrek\" movies take this on, but alas they seem to have established their own look. This movie just looked so cool, so distinct in its own style, it really felt like I was watching a story in a fairy tale world.Now, of course I have to admit I didn't love this movie. Something about it felt off to me, I couldn't seem to see where the acclaim was coming from. Sure, it was fun, it was cute, and I enjoyed myself while watching, but I never felt like I truly connected with the film. The opening scene felt a little jumbled to me, rapidly going from a musical sequence, to comedy for kids, to an action scene and I wished it would've let me settle into the story a bit first. I get this is a movie primarily for kids, but with most animation they tend to make parts enjoyable for the parents and older audiences as well. I don't really feel that here - they tried with the themes and the deeper storyline - but it never actually worked in my eyes. Everything felt very kid-focused, which isn't a bad thing, it just meant I wasn't the core audience and so it makes sense why I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I have to say, the kids in my theatre seemed to be having a blast! I'm sure this is a great movie for families with children, it just wasn't as good as I was told it would be.I think the movie tried to do a bit of what Pixar is known for, the whole \"trying to be deep\" thing. The movie involves Puss in Boots coming to terms with death, and it seemed to be somewhat shallow, it never truly dove into this aspect of the story. Instead, the storyline is very linear and somewhat dull where it is just about the characters traveling to their destination and the villains sometimes catching up and then combat ensuing. And the physical goal literally being the spiritual goal just makes the inevitable plot point of \"maybe I don't need the thing I wanted all long and it's the friends I made along the way that count\" seem all the more predictable. Even Puss' relationship with the side characters is unchallenging. Although he is deeply flawed, his companions never seem to care about that and forgive him all the time. The chemistry of the characters was just nowhere as endearing as in \"Shrek\". Still the adventure was quite fun, I just didn't think the themes clicked as it felt like they were trying to be deep in a way that is not as organic and surprising as a film like Pixar's \"Up\", \"Finding Nemo\" or even DreamWorks' \"How to Train Your Dragon\".Perhaps I am being too harsh, I feel like this review is sounding more negative than anything. I really did have fun with it, and overall would give it a thumbs up, it's an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half. The animation was really cool, the voice cast was great, and man I loved the little nods to the \"Shrek\" movies even if I was never a huge fan of those. If nothing else, this movie did make me really hopeful for another \"Shrek\" film. I do enjoy this fairy tale world and the creative animation they used to tell the story!", "An experience that you will never regret": "This movie didn't need to go so far but it did. The writing, animation, designs, environments and music are all superb. You can tell the team behind this put in their purest amount of effort into every nook and cranny of this film.Even in the Shrek universe this film builds and adds more immersion and depth to it, creating a new appreciation to the past movies and makes you reflect on them in an even deeper and brighter way.By the end of the movie you will learn to appreciate your life in a whole new way and be thankful you watched this.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an astonishing family friendly film to be rewatched in future living rooms for decades to come.", "The Last Meow": "I loved the villain, so much so that I think my 8 year old self would have been freaked out by the scenes he appears in.An amazing animated film, it has some nostalgic and fun references for those of us who saw the first part as kids. Puss in Boots is a character that is impossible not to love, who attracts us with his witticisms and his great adventures. Although this time we see him in a facet full of anxiety and despair, I personally managed to feel sadness and empathy for him, which shows the great direction of the film.The scenes I loved the most are the ones in which the villain appears, the action scenes are very good and the great animation stands out. A movie worth watching and I look forward to a third installment.", "DreamWorks Animation is rising back up": "I'm sure a majority of the people who heard about this film had little to no intention in actually seeing it, much less expecting it to actually be really good. The first Puss in Boots film was decent but it far from struck me as one of DreamWorks' best. Seeing the studio go all in on a sequel that nobody asked for was a ballsy move, but fortunately they absolutely got it right.Puss in Boots The Last Wish is an unexpectedly fantastic film that not only tells a great story, but it takes risks by diving into topics of death and mortality, something that you wouldn't expect from an animated kids' film. Not only that, but much of the humor was very risky, with the cursing jokes being the ones that made my eyes open widest. It wasn't a bad thing to me, it just really caught me off-guard. I always like it when animated films take risks without making it seem like they're trying to hard to be edgy. This film doesn't do the unnecessary. It's a fantastic adventure with a great story, great humor, great characters, and beautiful animation. Go see this film while you still can. It deserves your money.", "A animated family masterpiece!": "I'm shocked this didn't win best animated feature at the golden globes, Pinocchio won that category which is spectacular too but Puss in Boots:The Last Wish is even better in my opinion every single scene is wildly entertaining and well made! This movie is hilarious through the bulk of it, action packed, heartwarming, spiritual, heroic, a little dark with the death character among the other villains only certain people will notice the adult aspects yet sill perfect for children and so much fun. I wonder why it took more than a decade to release a sequel to the original Puss in Boots, I'm glad both have been nominated very worthy all around.", "OUTSTANDING VISUALS AND WELL TOLD STORY! A MAGICAL STORY": "No need to say, the visuals of this film are outstanding! When you're too fed up with the boring same old 3D animated movies, this is a movie will bring you a fresh air! A mix of 3D and 2D painterly style really bring the fairy tales look to the film!The story is emotional yet hilarious! Not only the Puss in Boots got his story developed and redemption arc, the antagonists also have their story told too! And on top of that, all of their stories are emotional and told beautifully.Bonus point, their fighting scenes are much much more believable than other films at the theaters these days too. They don't just magically kill the bad guy while being inferior to them, they fight with wit and STYLE.Dreamworks really did it again with this movie! Can't wait to see what they can bring to the table next time!", "Nuanced narrative and characterizations of side characters and especially the protagonist and antagonist. Entertaining, well choreographed, and fantastic cinematography": "I really love Puss' characterization and development in this movie. He is a fearless and brave individual and he found identity in that. But in most ways, he took it for granted. He lived a life where his 9 lives were disposable, where there was no true value in them, until his final one.So, when the doctor confronted him on the reality of the situation, he hated it. Mocked it even. He's the fearless Puss in boots after all. What would his life be if he wasn't living in danger? But only when confronted by a bounty hunter coming after his life, and being completely overwhelmed in battle, where he truly realizes the reality and value of his 1 singular life.And this part of the movie gave me literal chills. The animation and visual team did an amazing job showing Puss' despair, with his hair standing up as it slowly reaches to his face, and how he was willing to go through a toilet to save himself. The lengths he was willing to take to live is so reflective of what humans would do to live, sometimes even doing morally evil things too.He wasn't fearless, he was full of fear. He wasn't Puss in Boots, he was a scaredy cat.Puss has a traumatic experience from that throughout the entire movie, with the wolf's signature whistle being a huge trigger for him, and it's such a menacing way of introducing him into the scene too.Speaking of the wolf, he's such a menacing and terrifying antagonist. His presence and character design are great, but what makes him so scary is his visual portrayal mixed with the voice acting. The movie wasn't afraid to not cater to kids and to not be limited by that. Which is a problem I have with some films, where mature themes aren't done to the fullest potential due to limitations. The way he effortlessly dodges Puss' attacks and instills fear into him is so memorable and impactful.Puss being haunted by the fear of death is something we need to take into consideration too in our lives. People love to live in the present, but also don't see the biggest problem of death right in front of us. We rather not think about it because it's such a scary reality. So, when life hits us, we're like Puss facing the reality of death for the first time. We're vulnerable and afraid. And not everyone tells people about how they're feeling. Some people keep it to themselves, which is what Puss did throughout the movie till he shows vulnerability and expresses his fears to Perro the dog.Even the most powerful people will still succumb to the fear of death when reality hits them.Goldilocks and the 3 bears were also amazing characters, where she was seeking for the wishing star because she doesn't have an ordinary family. By \"just right\", she wanted and craved for a human family. She used her foster family as steppingstones to reach her goal of replacing them, which is so tragic because she faces an issue of envy. When a person is clouded with envy, they aren't grateful for what they have, and would do what they can to obtain what they don't have.I also love the build up to the eventual reveal of her wish. Her appreciating the simpler times with the bears in their house was so heart-warming. It's the small things that often go unappreciated, like how she would hold this fairy tale book as a child wherever she would go, sleeping on comfy bed, drinking soup with her foster family, and so on. Sometimes, you just have to stop and take a look around you. You have a house to live that house's memories. You have food and water. You have transport to go to different places. You have photos with your families and friends that you can reminisce. You can even go beyond that and just admire the complexities of the world. How trees give you shade when it's a sunny day, or how the sky has a pleasing and calming colour, and even animals and how unique they all are.There are a lot more aspects that I really love about this movie but I'll stop right here. I definitely recommend watching it. Not only is it narratively nuanced, but the pacing of the movie is also good. Cinematography and choreography of the fights are so well done too, which is one benefit of the movie being 2.5D.", "The multilayer film that was always meant to be (the first one can be forgotten now)": "Let's start by saying that this movie is the sequel to a spin-off. Originality, there is no. But make no mistake, this review will be the polar opposite of the previous one, and it's all because this movie has vast improvements in every aspect. Fasten your seatbelts, we're going to the land of comparisons!The general aesthetic has been completely revamped and changed to separate itself from the saga that was born. Other than the characters (and something in the end), there's nothing here that comes close to Shrek or the first Puss in Boots movie. What there are are layers and layers of colorful landscapes, anime movements, well-grounded humor, absurd humor, children's humor and even for each character there is a lesson behind it, don't forget that after all, this is a fairy tale.The really great thing about this film is that it's a multi-layered work, which makes it suitable for all audiences. However, the most salvageable is the lesson that remains for the film industry itself: It doesn't matter to wait more than ten years to make a sequel, as long as it's well done. Let's forget about the hamburger factory. This should always be so.Separate point, did you notice the movie references? There are many, but my favorites are two: one of James Cameron's movies and another one of the most popular movie of just last year.Get ready because this will be the new animation style from now on.", "Spectacular movie": "This move is really good , i went in with too low expectations , but seriously the art , the colors & the story is the perfect mix.I added this movie to my favs list\nDefinitely worth watching on the big screenVery rich in emotions & meaning - & the jokes is really well put & in placeThe storyline. & directors efforts is really reflecting in this movie & it s best in this series hands down in all aspects compared to the other movies.I wish to see more of this series now after all these years they really did a good job reviving it & bringing it back to lifeCouldn't ask for a better movie.", "I usually never give out 10's....": "However, this movie is truly perfect.Not only is this the better of the Puss In Boots films but it's honestly one of the best animated films that I've ever seen. The movie has incredible voice acting, hilarious moments, tremendous action sequences and beautiful animation. If you're a fan of the unique art style of \"Into the Spider-verse\", you'll truly appreciate the style that this film throws out at times.It also has so much heart. This movie pulls on the heart-strings as much as any animated film could possibly do.Also, Wagner Moura's character is done so well that you'll leave the film with a lasting impression of him.If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, please watch it. For me, this film came completely out of nowhere and it honestly shocked me how well it was done.Great stuff!", "Creative, Good Morals, No Hidden Agendas": "Great movie that is very Well written, cute, and creative. Good message and moral about friendship and trustworthiness. No hidden agendas or political messages, just a cute movie! My kids young and old loved it and the adults were laughing too.My kids are 8, 10, and 12, and then a few adults were there and we all thought it was hilarious and well written. The story line came together well and pulled together different movie classic stories like Pinocchio, Goldilocks and the three bears, Shrek, Cinderella, etc. We really appreciate the clean humor, innocence in this kids movie, lack of political or \"woke\" ideology, and how well this was written.", "The storyline for this picture is very smart with more depth than you may anticipate": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) is a movie my daughter and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Puss in Boots who dies and is informed he is on the last of his nine lives. He decides to retire from being Puss in Boots until he hears the story of a Last Wish that can be granted to a person who finds the Wishing Star. He decides to come out of retirement to find the star but he isn't the only one looking for it; and meanwhile, death himself is chasing him down. He will need to rely on some old friends and a new one if he hopes to succeed.This movie is directed by Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and contains the voices of Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro), Salma Hayek (Desperado), Florence Pugh (The Falling), John Mulaney (Big Mouth) and Olivia Colman (Hot Fuzz).The storyline for this picture is very smart with more depth than you may anticipate. The animation is tremendous and the action and fight scenes are fun. The opening sequence with the troll, the battle with the wolf in the bar and the final fight were excellent. The map scene was cool too. The voices are perfectly selected and it was great seeing Hayek's return. The dialogue is very well written and contains more depth, emotion, comedy and lessons than I anticipated going in. The little dog was an awesome new character and Harvey Guill\u00e9n (The Internship) was a perfect choice as its voice. The ending was a perfect way to close each storyline and sub plot.Overall, this is a very well done movie that is fun for the entire family. I would score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.", "Had no right to be this good!": "Great character development and such a well told story. I thought it would be just a casual fun movie but it was a well thought out story of dealing with your past mistakes while facing your mortality. The hero's were strong, relatable, and vulnerable while never subverting who they were.Each of the character has a personality, contribution and place in the story that makes sense. None of them are forced in for a quota or seem out of place. All the moves have a purpose and the writers deserve all the praises for this.Great growth and shows that Hollywood can still put together a good movie when they want to. Really beat my expectations.", "Amazing writing.": "It's rare to watch an animated film that actually has a story relatable to both adults and children, and Puss in Boots The Last Wish does just that. For starters, all the voice-overs were outstanding, and all of the characters had something to offer than just their presence in the story. The characters and the story itself had moments of joy, laughter and tears. The humor was particularly relatable and funny, again, for both adults and children. The pacing was spot on and the 102 minute runtime just flew by. This is one of the better animations I've seen in a while, and I love how the ending lead up to the next sequel to Shrek. A must watch for everyone.", "Better than the first. Best animated movie of 2022.": "Puss in Boots: Last Wish was an incredible display of high quality storytelling and masterful script writing. Besides some small critiques of the animation style and some crude humor, the film was near perfect.The storytelling was unique to the franchise and seemed genuinely inspired. The script reflects this. Without giving too much away, Puss learns valuable lessons, and the film itself contains a good overall moral message.The film can seem a bit dark at times with lots of comedic but somewhat frightening deaths, however some jokes are spread throughout to lighten the tone.Personally, I felt the antagonistim was one of the most well written of all time. Very reminiscent of the Oscar winning character of Anton Chigurh from No Country for Old Men.The animation was intentionally low frame rate in action scenes, however I found it worked much better in the final scenes where the frame rate was the full 24 (not 12). Some might find the film anticlimactic in a few ways, but overall, most would find the movie well worth their time and money.9/10 stars!", "Maybe the best animated movie i've ever seen.": "Puss and Boots succeeds in every way. The only thing that isn't amazing in this movie is the ending, which is still good. This movie has deep character development and has some very emotional moments that makes the movie not just enjoyable for kids, but also enjoyable as an adult. The animation style in this movie is amazing. I love the style and cartoony look of the film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to any kids under 6 though due to the emotional moments as well as the villain in the movie which could be scary for little kids. But if you are old enough that the villain won't scare you, the villain is amazing and really makes the movie that much better. Anyway you have to see this movie.", "This is Actually Very Dark, Gloomy and Intense for a Family Movie": "This funny, charming and adorable, yet often quite dark, gloomy and intense Puss in Boots adventure isn't your typical cash-grabbing kids' movie. It's been over a decade since the first Puss in Boots movie, which was a spin-off in the Shrek franchise featuring the loveable ginger cat in tiny boots wielding a mini sword. But this is unashamedly the best they've done since the first and second Shrek movies.When Puss in Boots learns that he's already burnt through eight of his nine lives, he embarks on an epic quest to find the mythical wishing star to restore his lives. Get it? Because cats have nine lives? Anyway, it's a pretty simple storyline that doesn't sound, and isn't really too complicated. However, this movie isn't getting all the praise for its animation techniques, vocal performances and all of that, although it definitely deserves major credit for the cast's brilliant work and the gorgeous 3D animation style that likes to pick some moments to do in a clever, witty 2D.Forgivably, you can never expect a family comedy in theatres that isn't guaranteed to have its extended moments of silly humour, but these very occasional scenes don't overtake the heavy themes this movie wants to consider, which is actually life and death. There are three parties of antagonists, some who are more villainy than the others, but there's fairy tale characters Goldilocks, the three bears and Jack Horner, and similar to the party this movie features as the protagonists, they all have meaning, struggles and thoughtful backstories to them. But it's the main villain who appears as a whistling wolf who provides the sense of dread. And when you take into consideration villain construction, appearances and overall sense of menace, he's one of the best antagonists of the year.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.", "live one life to the fullest": "Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado made an extremely pleasant movie Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots missing the point of having this life and miserable because he exhausted all his other 8 lives is forced to spend time with Kitty Softpaws ( really enjoyed Salma Hayek's voice) and happy to have friends and be called anything Perro (Harvey Guillen's voice). Puss in Boots used to be the Favorite Fearless Hero and has to go through life's journey learning the realities of life. Perro is a dog \" without a name\" whose\nhappiness in having friends and affection are contagious and it takes a while for Kitty Softpaws and Puss in Boots to realize that Perro is very likeable.Florence Pugh's voice as angry, loud, selfish Goldilocks is perfect. Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear are adorable and try hard to put Goldilocks in her place.Script is excellent. 1hr40min of fun . Don't ask for more. Excellent editing.", "Wishful (thinking)": "No pun intended - the movie had quite the buzz surrounding it. And I am certain it is quite the hot contender when it comes to the animated Oscar this year. And rightfully/deservedly so - I thought I would not be able to watch it in cinemas, but I finally got around to it. And it is because people are still going to watch it. Not in Avatar 2 numbers ... but still more than enough.That all being said, I do need to rewatch the first Shrek movie me thinks ... I don't think I was fair in my rating .. or I got even more leniant when it comes to ratings as time goes .. flies by. The movie starts off with Puss in ful action ... being a Captain Jack Sparrow ... well a Cat-ain Jack Sparrow that is. Sorry for the pun, but it was right there ... I had to.Puss is quite full of himself ... which may be his ultimate downfall ... unless he can change. And you know ... not laugh in the face of death. There are quite a few interesting and neat messages here. But also things that I am surprised to see in a kids movie ... like a cut on our \"favorite\" feline ... with a drop of blood .. did not know they were allowed to do that. I am not condemning the movie btw - just saying how surprised I am ... still great movie, very well told.", "SPECTACULAR": "I was not expecting much from this film but I had heard much praise of it and so I went to the theatre and watched this film with an open mind.First off..WOW!!! The animation and character design is gorgeous and the characters are captivating. I really like the new style for Puss in Boots in this film. The action scenes are incredible and put you on the edge of your seat. I could talk about the characters designs and art direction for this film all day if I could. Some characters in the film are a bit annoying though, but in the end your grudge against them seem to vanish when they all resolve the big conflict. Also LOVE the humor in this movie. Great for kids, teenagers and adults alike!", "Surprisingly Spectacular": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a movie I decided to see with friends just to go out and do something, however almost immediately after the start of the movie my friends and I were all enthralled and entertained. PiB:TLW not only worked as a comedic movie for all ages, but also provided the viewer with an engrossing plot to follow. My friends and I found ourselves glued to the screen at many points. It is definitely a highlight movie within the Shrek Universe and possibly one of the better animated movies to be released in recent years (close to Into The SpiderVerse). If you have the opportunity to check out Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, then I think you should take it!", "Completely Original Sequel": "Besides the presence of Kitty, I could've been convinced that there was no Puss in Boots 1. The sequel is closer to standalone than direct. And more than just being different story-wise, Puss in Boots is not even close to the same movie as the first one. For starters, the animation is really creative. It takes a page out of Spider-Verse to look intentionally choppy at times by messing with the frame rate to give it a comic-like feel. To aid this, the art in this movie is incredible. Some things are more abstract than realistic, there are beautiful colors that contrast, and there's tons of creative scenery. It almost feels like the creative team made beautiful paintings and tried to build a movie out of it rather than make a movie and then fill in the scenery, which works really well here. Next, the movie is way darker. It's plenty funny like all DreamWorks movies, but whereas the original was entirely fun, this one was very dark. The wolf villain, in particular, was one of the scariest villains of the year. The dark aesthetic, the voice acting, the uncanny whistle and soundtrack, and the camerawork all created fear perfectly. He was probably my favorite part. Also like all DreamWorks movies, it's sweet and heartwarming. The only downside of this movie is that, besides the animation, nothing blows me away. It's not as funny as The Bad Guys, as heartwarming as How to Train Your Dragon, or as action-packed as Kung Fu Panda. Everything about it is good but not great. But the brilliant animation gets an otherwise decent movie to become nearly perfect.", "Tiw pickles and booties": "Today I watched a shrek sequel and it was very goodYeah, this movie was a complete shocker to me as I really didn't expect anything from it going in. But uh yeah this movie really does have everything going for it, it's funny, it has a lot of really intense action, there's actual stakes which doesn't feel like the case in most kids movies, and it has a really charming unique personality to it.If there's anything that I didn't like from the movie, it would really have to be the mixing in the opening of the movie. It felt like Pickles wasn't properly mixed into the scene, and I really could not hear half of the words he was saying, thankfully this only really went on through the first maybe 10-15 minutes of the film, basically when the opening stops. Besides that you can make an argument that there are clich\u00e9 and predictable elements to this film. There was one instance when i noticed Pickles literally change sizes between scenes and then it never happened again, it was during a fight scene near the beginning where he got tossed around.However, though its story structure is predictable, this is reductive a bit. It's a three act structure with a typical ending you'd see in 1000 movies till this point, but the way that the movie goes to reach this point feels like it's own unique true journey. Every character reaches their logical end in such a satisfying fashion, it's easy to overlook that. The story basically perfectly led to the ending and didn't really leave me feeling like I could ask for more in that regard from a modern day shrek sequel.This film genuinely feels like characters are in real danger. It feels like every character, no matter how small or big, has a distinct personality and look to them, and they can absolutely die. That feels really good in a movie to feel like there's a real challenge to overcome, something this movie does excellently. The villains feel like real villains and are actually pretty menacing, showing a real threat within the story to the main characters. Also I cannot tell you how nice it is to have a comic relief character be pivotal to the story and not annoying. Seriously it's so common and annoying(I'll never forgive you treasure planet \ud83d\ude22)The film looks absolutely gorgeous. It's like a pastel paradise of colors. The animation is smooth when it needs to be and stylistically choppy during intense pivotal points. All of the characters look fantastic and stylistically distinct from the other cgi art styles I've seen in the past. Each character is immediately recognizable as their own. I want to pet the dog.The action scenes are so dang well executed. It doesn't feel to abnormally fluid and I feel this to be assisted by the intentionally choppy animation style during these scenes. They also use comic book style action lines to emphasize certain movements and to drag your eyes to what they want you to focus on. The bad guys did something LIKE this basically but I feel that this movie really improves upon that style.Overall, I could spend a long time talking about how awesome and surprising this movie was for me. It was genuinely great, and probably my favorite shrek movie. Isn't that a funny thing to say, your favorite shrek movie is a puss n boots sequel. Please watch this movie it's very good. It's tremendously funny too btw.High 8/10.", "A predictable, yet immensely entertaining adventure": "I've been hearing a lot of good things about this movie all month long. Before I knew it, I was really anticipating this movie. And I have to say that it has mostly met my expectations. This is a damn good movie.This movie reminds me of an old fashioned animated adventure. With different characters competing to complete a quest, almost like a treasure hunt. And it's really really entertaining. The soundtrack is so good. The animation is gorgeous. It was something similar to hand drawn animation during the action sequences and that surprisingly made it really cool. The direction is also really cool, especially how they portrayed Puss's character and the Villain's.I won't deny that the story, and the messages are pretty much predictable. But this is one of those movies that even if you know, what's going to happen, it's still very exciting when it happens. My theatre had such an unenthusiastic crowd this time because trust me, there are some crowd-cheering sequences towards the end.Now let's talk about the characters, which I think is the core of this movie. Puss is a likeable character, if you've seen the 1st movie you'd already know that. But this time we see some different sides of him and actually saw his vulnerable version. That made him a great protagonist worth rooting for. The side characters and the side-villains are really entertaining as well, and I loved the direction they took with some of them. They don't overdo a certain type of humour and spread out all these different types of characters throughout the movie, which was clever.And now THE VILLAIN. Easily one of the coolest villains I've seen in a while. Whenever, he even made an appearance, I got goosebumps. And the animation and direction is just amazing with his scenes.I also really liked how deep they took Puss's character arc, looking back at how he has lived up till now and what it actually means to be brave. And the villain actually played an integral part in that.In the end, this is a great movie, and I'd recommend watching this in theatre, and with an open mind.(You don't really need to watch the first part. They introduce the previous characters well and the first part isn't really that good either)", "Watchable but not great": "The first Puss & Boots was good, but this movie was just \"okay\" and nothing more.Puss is on his last of 9 lives and journeys to a fallin star to wish for more lives.The animation is subpar compared to the first movie, and the dialog is very bland when compared to the first movie as well.Some jokes land but most of them don't. I'm not sure where all these high ratings are coming from? They must have budgeted for the purchasing of bot votes.The last third of the movie seemed way to scary for most kids. I'm surprised it got a pg rating. The ending was very dark and scary for most young viewers.Anyways, this movie is watchable, but just barely. I will never watch it again, and if I knew what I know now, I would not have bothered watching it.", "This had no reason to be this good": "Puss in boots finally comes out 11 years after we we last saw the lovable el gato's adventure and let's just say that (Puss in Boots:The Last Wish) is everything that we wanted in the sequel for the legend himself. The animation is out of this world, with the film prioritizing a similar style like \"Spider-Man:Into the Spider-Verse(2018) and The Bad Guys (2022). The story is a great improvement from the first film with puss given a huge amount of character development that allows conflict to subside with his personality that remains after the first film while allowing every character to tackle serious/darker topics that doesn't conflict with it's comedic tone. The film even carry's over a hilarious amount of comedy that is familiar from the first shrek film.", "This was life changing": "I don't think I will ever be the same man ever again. When I purchased this movie I was expecting it to just be a few poorly animated scenes, but no. I felt every single character and what they were going through. This movie is an absolute masterpiece, whoever wrote this is a genius. When I was done watching this movie I had tears streaming down my cheeks, not only that but I also farted. I never thought I would ever cry because of what a fictional orange cat with a cape is going through. The ending especially got me. Not only was this an emotional rollercoaster but the comedy in this movie is amazing during the start, but later on it fades in to be more serious, but in the most perfect way possible. I don't think I have ever seen a movie this perfect in my entire life. This is definitely my favorite movie I have ever watched. I would definitely recommend. I wish I could give everyone who worked on this movie my life savings. I will never be the same again after watching this move, mainly because I farted really hard at the end.", "Really good follow up to Puss In Boots": "Puss in Boots the last wish is a 2022 sequel to the 2011 film Puss in Boots and features the voice of Antonio Banderas,Salma Hayek,John Mulvany and Florence Pugh.11 years after the first events Puss(Banderas) learns that his life is coming to an end. So he teams up with a dog that thinks its a cat and Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) to find the land of wishes. But will Goldi(Pugh) and her adopted parents the bears beat them to the land of wishes or will John Harper(Mulvany) beat them to it instead?.Overall this was a good follow up. The animation this time is done like Spiderman Into the Spidey Verse and it was really good. Antonio Banderas was fantastic as Puss as his been voicing this charcther since 2004(almost 20 years now) in Shrek 2.", "Absolutely loved this movie.": "We rented it early access on prime and watched it 3 times in 48 hours. I couldn't believe how good it was. The storyline was incredible, the \"bad guy\" was so intense, he had me on edge. The humor was great and I literally LOL'd at a few of the super random dry humor thrown in. All around awesome. And the best part was it wasn't filled with propoganda! I felt comfortable letting my kids watch it, since the moral was so positive and desperately needed in this effed up world. We will be buying it!P. S. I was worried the animation style would be difficult to watch, but it really helped set the mood for the story.", "A phenomenal movie watch it.": "A phenomenal and fun action movie with soul. This movie tells a relatively basic story but manages to make it phenomenal, despite being a kids movie as a 16 year old I found one of the villains extremely tense and almost scary to see. I obviously know nothing bad can happen but because of how they show the villain he manages to make you worry about puss in boots. There are also 2 other factions of villains who are extremely funny to watch and also have a really satisfying and relatively well told character arc. Finally the film also handles its 3 protagonists and makes them all have very well told backstory's that cause a tension between characters and good chemistry at the same time. The comedy is also pretty funny not as good as the shrek films but still very well done. There are some scenes in this film that will resonate with adults in a very meaningful way and kids can learn a huge amount from this film as it teaches them how important life is. 10/10 movie highly recommend especially for kids.", "Good!": "I noticed that the animation and art style would change during the film, and it took some getting used to. At first, I thought it was my eyes playing tricks but it was just the effects. The character designs were good and I like how they put their spin on the fairytales and nursery rhymes. I loved the wolf's design the most, he was such a good character and I looked forward to seeing him whenever he showed up.The storyline, however, was okay but it felt a bit meh. I wasn't fully invested in it. The character development was nice and steady throughout the film too. Also, the action scenes looked pretty cool.", "More Dark and Mature in Themes Compared to the 2011 Original": "Puss in Boots proved itself to be the most impressionable installment in the Shrek film series. After what I've seen in the 2011 spin-off prequel, its follow-up The Last Wish really runs deep in to a more complex story with mature themes thrown into the mix. Like it still has its humor, charm, and lighthearted moments as before, but one thing that sets it off differently is the themes of mortality playing an integral part in Puss' life and the story.Well over a decade later after his last adventure (and shortly after the events of Shrek Forever After), Puss always proved to be the charmer, showboater, and all-around feline with his fancy boots, hat, and sword who thinks he can do no wrong even scoffing at the face of danger and death with all of his skills. However, upon learning that he is mortal after losing eight of his nine lives in the past and up until recently, Puss begins to question if he is truly worthy as the legend and he will need the fabled Wishing Star to set him straight.Antonio Banderas reprises his role with yet another great performance as well as the return of Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws. Marking their sixth movie together, they balance each other out well with both wittiness and passion. Their latest companion Perrito (played by What We Do in the Shadow's star Harvey Guillen) is good for wisecracks and his enthusiastic sense of humor. Much different from Zach Galifinakis' Humpty Dumpty in the 2011 film. The animation style is rather unique and was implemented here as it was with Academy Award-winning film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. It's different from the photorealistic themes used before, but how it's used in the fight sequences gives off a storybook, painting-like feel and I admire that design.Now what had me thinking really carefully was the white wolf stalking Puss. For him to be revealed as Death itself and the thought about mortality being so prominent in Puss' life, it became rather meaningful during the duel between them. And that dagger he wielded to outsmart Death is a form of symbolism. Puss knew he can't escape death, but with all these fears and uncertainties plaguing his one life left, he overcame it with the one thing that never came to mind: Love.I actually heard a few audience members in my local auditorium quietly weeping over Puss' predicament and melancholy demeanor. I now see why awards season acknowledges this DreamWorks animated film. Left me intrigued and fascinated over what lies ahead next for him and his companions.", "I Don't See the Hype": "This movie was alright. The animation is the highlight, even though the style they use is just ripped off from a much better movie: 'Spider-Man Into the Spiderverse'. I haven't seen the first 'Puss In Boots', but I would put this one beneath all the 'Shrek' movies, and 'Shrek' 3 and 4 aren't very good.The story is fast-paced, but the way it unfolds is very bland and uninspired. The attempted humor missed 95% of the time because it's lazyily written and geared solely towards 5-year-olds. If you're an adult, you're not going to find much to enjoy in regards to the story or comedy.It was nice seeing Antonio Banderas have fun with the voice acting. All the new characters introduced and their motives were all pretty bad and just seemed thrown into the movie for no real reason since they held no weight or attachment to the 'Shrek' universe. My niece and nephew enjoyed it at least.6.1/10.", "A whimsical charming movie": "For me this movie is in between a 7 and a 8 but I gave it a 8 because I want to see it do well. This movie was surprisingly good considering the first was ok and released about a decade ago but they somehow naturally built upon that movie and made this.The way Puss tackles his mortality was was really, especially with the death character (my absolute favorite character in the movie, along with Jiminy cricket). The way they portrayed death was just excellent from the voice, to the design, to his fight scenes with those sickles. With the intro fight it really does set the tone for the rest of the movie with him having Puss on the run.Along with Puss the other characters are also great. Every character has a well defined insecurity (idk if that's the right word) minus the dog but he's seems to be happy to care so whatever. Then the other main villain is just so fun with all his fairy tale weapons everything is just creative and well written.", "Good stuff": "Puss has lost 8 of his 9 lives and is terrified of the Wolf/Death taking the last one, so he runs away. He ends up in the home of a cat lady while searching for a map to guide him to a fallen star, which will grant him a wish (to get his lives back). Also looking for the map are Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Big Jack Horner, a small dog disguised as a cat, and Puss' old love Kitty Softpaws.This was enormously entertaining. The story was fairy story familiar, but with enough wrinkles to keep you interested, and the fun reversal of seeing Puss very far from his confident self. The sight gags are non-stop and the voice talent is great. And there is a huge amount of heart here, and the payoff is nicely delivered.This well worth a watch.", "Amazing Film": "Truly an amazing experience, I though it can't be as good as people said, it was better!It is a visually stunning and action-packed animated film that tells the origin story of the beloved character from the \"Shrek\" franchise. The movie features outstanding voice acting by Antonio Banderas as the titular character, who brings the charming and charismatic feline to life. The film's animation is top-notch, with vibrant and detailed environments, and smooth and fluid character movements. The story is engaging and full of twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Overall, it is a fantastic movie that is sure to entertain both children and adults alike. It is a true cinematic experience that should not be missed.", "New level": "Unbelievably cool movie. I was expecting fun and stupid kids movie, and it appeared that is one of the best movies IMAO. Super wise. Clever scenario. The effects are on another level. Most of all, it gives an extremely important perspective and will help kids to become better than us facing life and hardship, having a good example.I have never seen an enemy to become ally in such a way....or that our biggest enemy is our fear. After all it appeared that Puss didn't want 9 new lives or anything - he wanted to live in the way he is...to be himself. After facing his fears and becoming better version of himself, he became worthy to keep his live. The concept about the businessman presents an very big problem in our society - it is awful and strange but it is just like that! It is even worse it the way I have seen it. Gold girl find out that we must be happy with what we have. And so on. Nice!", "Highly recommended family movie! All characters are unique and interesting!": "Today I saw Puss in Boots latest movie, \"The Last Wish\". It's fast-paced and packed with action and humor right from the start. I was able to enjoy the best 100 minutes.Puss in Boots is a fearless hero. He is a reliable cat who lives with friendship and dreams. Anyone who loves cats should definitely watch this movie! Every character in this movie is unique and interesting, and the soundtrack selection is so good.This is one of the best animated movies of 2022. Animated movies usually have a few boring scenes, but in this movie the story progresses so fast that the viewer doesn't get bored.Puss in Boots has many other movies, but I understand that \"The Last Wish\" is highly rated. I plan to watch this movie again this year. Recommended as a family movie for the whole family to watch.", "Animation Award! ALL STAR CAST OF VOICES-Winks to Old Movie Characters": "Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) has carelessly lost 8 lives & must redeem himself. Hunted by a wolf bounty hunter, that intends to put down the self-righteous legend, but, a Wishing Star has fallen in the dark forest and whoever finds it is granted their desire. Puss sets out on an adventure to restore his former glory as a hero, but unfortunately for him, he's not the only one with his paws set on swiping that wish.Directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado (The Croods: A New Age) with a story by Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch) and Tom Wheeler (Puss in Boots) and a screenplay by Paul Fisher (The Lego Ninjago Movie) and Tommy Swerdlow, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" animation style is CGI brilliance from the realistic style of previous Puss in Boots films with slo-mo & accelerated frame rates.Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Perrito (Harvey Guillen), and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) are in a spaghetti western-like race to get the Wishing Star. . Puss is accompanied by a female femme-fatale named Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Their complicated past generates constant conflict. When Puss \"temporarily\" retires as a hero, he meets an abandoned tiny chihuahua therapy dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) who is now convinced they are best friends, is happy about everything, and doesn't want to wish for anything. Sooo cute!!Hilarious criminal masterminds Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman) & Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) are also pursued by magic-obsessed Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who join the race. Kudos to inclusion of \"Jiminy Cricket character with Jimmy Stewart voice. Brilliant!Perrito also gets bleeped for his heavier use of vulgarity. One of his more memorable sequences is when a long line of bleeps covers up his insults about the three bears. Lots of moral absolutions & commutations & relationship bonding. Absolutely LOVED IT!", "Just like the before times": "Thank you DreamWorks and Universal. Thank you for a movie that's just about the story. This movie was reminiscent of the before times. There's no extra noise or agendas to explain to an eleven year old. Just good wholesome entertainment for any type of family or any individual. I had forgotten about this series and was so happy to see it back to life and even happier there is more to come. Puss n boots final wish is the epitome of what family entertainment is supposed to be. Good story, great message, fun characters and excellent casting. My hope is other studios take note of the success of this movie and follow suit.", "Absolute banger": "What a wonderful movie, this new 2D-3D animation style is quite the eye candy.Loved the humor, these people pull stuff that really sets it apart from other animation studios, for some reason I thought there would be a lot of singing but thankfully that's not the case.They manage to cram quite a few different stories and characters and intertwine and develop them beautifully in the short 100 minutes.Never felt boring or dragged, the dub (I watched it in Spanish) is spectacular, today I found out Antonio Banderas voices the puss in English, Spanish and Italian, what an absolute gigachad.I was almost brought to tears a couple times too, a must watch if you're into Dreamworks stuff.", "The best movie ever": "I was so shocked when I saw this. The first ten times I watched this I passed out from shock. Words can not describe the greatness of this movie. It's like watching a billion dollars come from the sky and into my arms. There was so much action that there are less action verbs than action scenes in this movie. The comedy was so funny I cracked three ribs from watching this movie. I had a concussion and three veins pop from my head. I had to go to the E. R twenty two times. The villain in this movie was so well done he gave me the heebee jeebees and I pee'd my pants from how scary he was. There is no experience like puss in boots.", "Heartwarming, Charming and funny": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a heartwarming, delightful and charming animated movie that is sure to stands out amongst modern-day animated movies (like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse) and even better. With its gorgeous animation, smart and funny storytelling, and great voice acting (specially Antonio Banderas), this animation is sure to please viewers of any age. In addition to its charming story, it also contains some great lessons, making it an enjoyable and educational experience. So if you're looking for a movie to entertain the whole family, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great choice!", "Entertainer is back ...": "RATED 8/10\nLanguage: English\nSource: Nil\nRECOMMENDEDI thoroughly enjoyed this one from the beginning to end. The best part is that it is likeable for both adult and kids. It has some good dialogs and interesting messages.It starts with rollercoaster sequences for first 20 minutes and then subtle when get into the story. The last twenty minutes it came back to the full throttle. Totally one enjoyable ride which makes you to forgot everything else.The dog is the real good addition to this franchise. I liked his timing reactions and try to be a puss. This is very good entertainer to watch with whole family for the weekend.", "So much fun": "I had a blast with this one, and I wasn't expecting much. All of the characters have fleshed out backstories and feel necessary to the plot. Puss has understandable motives and a great arc in the story, and there are lots of great action sequences that keep your attention and move the story along at a good pace. Surprisingly, it also is emotional at points, and you genuinely feel for the characters and what they learn (I won't spoil anything). Voice acting was great all around and no one really took me out of the movie. Good sense of humour and the animation is beautiful as well. I don't really have much to say that is negative about this movie, so give this one a try and you will likely be glad you did.", "Movie Was Great!": "I saw this movie for the second time, this time with my mom, sister, Ashlyn, and Alan. It was such a fun movie and actually left me sitting back with the my heart racing. It left me with a burning sensation, of wanting to do something with my life. Overall everyone really liked the movie rating it either a 9 or a 10. It was hilarious and had such a great message. I feel like I watch a lot of movies that mold and shape my life, and this is definitely one of them. I felt great watching this movie and can't wait to see what I do this next upcoming year. Thank you to the makers of puss in boots you guys did a great job I will definitely be thinking of this movie a lot :)I watched it again with Thomas and Chaseton, we had a great time and wouldn't stop laughing when he did the thumb thing lmaoMovie count: x2.", "Blew me away!": "I had almost no interest in seeing this movie. Before my first viewing I was certain that the film was going to be another Dream Works cash grab from an old franchise. Boy was I wrong!!!This film was incredible. It is funny, witty, exciting, beautiful, and at times terrifying!! That is right, terrifying! There were some very well executed villain choices that push the limits of what you would find in a traditional kids movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat the whole film waiting for the antagonist to appear... when he did I was genuinely scared. I wish Hollywood would make villains (and movies) like this more often.Did not see this coming... I strongly advise that everyone go and watch this movie. Dream Works, and the rest of Hollywood, need to be reminded that you can make a great film that appeals to kids and adults. THIS FILM IS PROOF OF THAT.", "Good Family Film": "I saw Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, starring the voices of Antonio Banderas-Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, Desperado; Salma Hayek-Eternals, Desperado; Florence Pugh-Black Widow, Midsommar and Wagner Moura-The Gray Man, Narcos_tv.This is a good family film for the fans of the adventurous pussy cat from the Shrek movies. It's produced by the Dreamworks Animation studios and it's the first of their releases that uses their new logo; it contains characters from other Dreamworks movies. Antonio is still voicing Puss in Boots, who has used up 8 of his 9 lives and is going on a mission to find a magical wish to restore them. Salma voices Kitty, a previous acquaintance of Antonio's that is also in search of the magical wish for her own reasons. Florence voices a bounty hunter called Goldilocks-and yes, she has 3 bears as partners-that is also on the hunt for the wish. During the search for the wish, Wagner plays Death-disguised as the big bad wolf-in pursuit of Antonio to get his last life. The film has subtle hints of the famous Italian classic film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly with different people-or animals in this case-searching for a treasure and they all meet at the end to fight it out. The animation is a little different from what you normally see from Dreamworks but it was enjoyable.It's rated PG for action, violence, rude humor and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.I liked it and think it would be a good one for older kids-some of the younger ones might be scared in parts-and would be a good one to stream.", "A phenomenal return to a beloved character": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fantastic return to the Shrek franchise. The film's animation is undeniably excellent in both style and character design, every shot proving accentuated with such immense detail and color. This particularly applies to the well-edited, thrilling action. Beyond this, there is a good utilization of sound and a catchy soundtrack. What truly makes this sequel special, however, is its screenplay and how the cast brings such to life. The titular role's story naturally progresses from past films and by this picture's end, he experiences a genuine, satisfactory arc. Banderas again voices the character with such wonderful charisma, to which the rest of the cast is extremely complimentary. This especially aids in the humor's success, highlighted by the voices of Mulaney and Guill\u00e9n. Hayek and Pugh are also great in their roles. All considered, however, the screenplay excels as a result of its dedication to these and other supporting characters. There is near perfect writing for every role, leaving the audience emotionally fulfilled on all fronts. So many themes are thereafter brilliantly developed. As for flaws, the picture's first act slows down to introduce characters after a fast-paced introductory sequence, before again picking up the pace it maintains for the rest of its runtime. A couple of these roles take adjusting to, as well, although turn out to be gems of the movie by its close. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is undoubtedly a fantastic film, even to the extent where a fifth Shrek sounds exciting to the most skeptical of fans.", "Unreal animation": "Super bad animation... Twelve years ago the animation looked like real animation.... what's this??? The character designing seem thirty years old but just faster than how it was back then... Couldn't connect at all with the script and creation.... It's a similar disaster like \"adventures of buck wild\" they ruined an interesting character back then, they are ruining another now... It happens when u employ impassionate people and make them work under poor direction... But it's not the worst disaster so go ahead and give it a shot.... Maybe you'll find something interesting that I missed.... Let me know in your review.", "One of the best movies by Dreamworks!!": "This movie is so fantastic. I'm a huge fan of the first movie, but this movie is stellar. I knew the animation was going to impress me, but based on the trailers, I felt unsure about certain aspects of the movie. However, as many reviewers say, the trailer does not do this movie justice! From the characters, especially Perrito and the Wolf, each and every character is so fleshed out. It set itself up like The Amazing Spider-man 2 but it did so well on the villain execution, which most would think is impossible. There were also emotional elements of this movie, such as fear and anxiety, that are so well portrayed by this movie which has not graced the big screen in a while! Overall, I am very much in love with this movie and I am glad that Dreamworks is back!!", "Absolute masterpiece": "Oh my goodness gracious, where do I even begin to describe the sheer magnificence that is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish? This movie is an absolute tour de force, a purr-fectly enchanting tale that will leave you feline good!First of all, let's talk about the incredible animation. The attention to detail is simply stunning, from the way Puss's fur ripples in the wind to the intricate designs on the boots he wears. Every scene is a feast for the eyes, and the vibrant colors and gorgeous landscapes will transport you to a world of pure fantasy.And the characters! Don't even get me started on the characters. Puss in Boots himself is an absolute delight, with his sassy attitude and razor-sharp wit. But the supporting cast is equally fantastic, with memorable performances from every single member of the cast. Whether you're rooting for the heroes or hissing at the villains, you'll be completely invested in every single character's journey.But what really sets Puss in Boots: The Last Wish apart is its heart. This movie is a genuine love letter to the power of friendship, and it will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside long after the credits roll. The themes of loyalty, forgiveness, and redemption are expertly woven throughout the story, and the emotional payoff is nothing short of breathtaking.In conclusion, if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and feel like a kid again, look no further than Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. This film is a triumph of animation, storytelling, and pure, unadulterated joy, and it deserves to be hailed as an instant classic. Don't walk, run to the nearest theater to see it!", "existential crisis of an animated character": "Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) dies. It turns out that it's his eighth death and he only has one more life. He has an existential crisis and retires from his adventures. He is told about a Wishing Star and sets off to restore his lives.Puss in Boots is a fun character in the wider Shrek universe. It's over a decade since his first stand-alone movie. Ignoring dangers is what make him fun. There is a charming cluelessness to the character. I've never considered the why and how of it all. I certainly didn't consider giving him existential dread as the catalyst for his next movie. This maintains the fun and vibrant energy of Puss in Boots while giving his character some real depth.", "Was really surprised how much I enjoyed this movie": "I took my daughter to the movies to watch this one fully prepared to have to mentally grind through an hour and a half of a kids movie I wasn't interested in.The animation was very different it flipped between cartoon style, think Spider verse and regular CGI. We saw it in 3d which added to the awesome.The story not only turned out to be funny but highly entertaining for me and my 8yr old. The voice acting was fantastic all around. The only thing I think I would change if I could would to maybe focus on one villian. There were 2 in this which made it feel like neither got enough screen time.I am a bit shocked to say it but this was the best movie I have seen in the theatre in years. Would recommend this to anyone young or old.", "Spin-off so good, it will knock your boots off.": "It is as good as you have been told. You will love every part of it. It has everything a film needs to be. Animation is a stepping stone for any director, it gives the way how to shoot the film. Wonderful choreography, good shots, nice story and 9 lives of a cat. Some shots were so beautifully created - poetry. Loved the first half more with wonderful cinematic effects with death and puss retiring to a cathome. The side stories are stepping stones to this film. Very rarely does a film have a good bunch of characters. Lovely everything about this. The redemption happens, but for some it is too late. Death does come for us all. Are we ready for meeting the death. Loved it. Highly recommend it to everyone.", "La leyenda jam\u00e1s morir\u00e1!": "\"Puss in Boots: the Last Wish\" definitely didn't have the right to be this good. This is, by far, my favourite animated film of 2022! I like the first film. It's completely independent from the Shrek movies, Antonio Banderas is a charismatic protagonist and Humpty Dumpty is a great anti-anti-hero. That film wasn't perfect, it had some issues, and these issues are fixed here, and the positive stuff are almost squared.This is the true epic that our little Gato deserved. The first film has too little expedition and action, it was a lot more focused on universe and character building, so, despite disagreeing, I can understand some people's disappointment. But now, we are in a sequel, and being a sequel for an origin story, there is a lot more creative freedom. The amazing animation style says it all!The adventure is bigger, more brutal, more romantic, and taken more seriously, though more comically. The only forced moment here was made to be forced. From the previous film, Puss (Antonio Banderas) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) are the only reminiscent ones, and they're even better than they were in 2011. The new supporting cast is more numerous and does an extraordinary job.Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n) is one of the best comic DreamWorks has ever made, Florence Pugh's voice fitted Goldilocks perfectly, she and the three bears make a dangerous quartet, and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) represents well the unstoppable hunger for power, and there's a famous character interacting with him that's hilarious.But the real showman here is my fellow countryman, Wagner Moura. The Big Bad Wolf is S tier villain. His presence is threatening, his whistle is chilling, and he has the best villain introduction I saw in a movie since \"Inglorious Basterds\". The best camera placing of 2022 is not in a live action. Curiously, the two best DreamWorks characters of the last year were wolves. Wagner and Sam Rockwell rocked!The story is original, but far from being unpredictable. However, like a lot of universally acclaimed Pixar movies (which some of them are deservelly acclaimed), it's not what story is being told, but how it's being told. Basic but complex, small but huge, ordinary but legendary! Esta es una aventura digna para el Gato con Botas.", "Puss will keep living his 9 lives": "The best dreamworks movie in cinema history. When I saw the first puss in boots movie 11 years ago with my dad we absolutely loved. The story taking place after shrek forever after was perfect for dreamworks . Puss has lived a very different life than shrek and donkey including Fiona . His friend and brother Humpty Dumpty was tried to take his revenge against puss I knew they're was still a good cat in him . Soft paws I say she was so awesome. She was no different then the other dreamworks female characters I remembered from my childhood. But I say she was one fluffy cat . The fairytale characters were more exciting than ever before. They had more expressions and had more storytelling then the books I was read when I was little . But I say shrek and puss in boots have a better happily ever after stories more .I can't wait for shrek 5 this year .", "Puss in Boots": "Here is my review of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. I am genuinely blown away by how much I loved it. I will start off by mentioning how good the animation is. Holy cow it is superb and just beautiful to look at. The animation also accompanies the fantastic action to make it all the better. I watched it in Spanish so it didn't have the all of the same voice actors, besides Banderas and probably Salma Hayek, but everyone did an excellent job, especially from the main two I just mentioned. The fact that Puss in Boots only has one life left gives the story a lot more emotion than I was anticipating. This also gives way for themes about death, enjoying life while it lasts, making the most of it, and accepting your fate. The wolf is shown to be a frightening and threatening presence that for once makes Puss afraid, he not only gave Puss chills but gave me chills every single time he was on screen. The moments where we see Puss fearing death are arguably the most effective and emotional. All in all, this is easily my favorite animated movie of the year and maybe the biggest surprise of the year as well.", "Box office performance is criminal. One of the best 2022 movies.": "What is to say that hasn't already been praised about this movie?The two villains are incredible, especially the \"side villain\". It's refreshing to have a straight main villain. No lame tragic or misunderstood villains like in Disney (even lack of villains). Just a classic villain.The B plot with Goldilocks and her bear family was great. I suspect it was to make the movie feel more \"full\", otherwise it would've felt a little empty with just Jack Horner versus Puss.Puss's side characters were great. I thought the dog was going to be an annoying ADHD character but he's got depth.90% of the jokes land. The pacing is brisk. Didn't realize it was almost 2 hours because it was so engaging. The driving theme of the story is excellent and well handled and not too in your face.Please don't let this gem miss you.", "Not even the talent of Antonio Banderas could save this one.": "The cover art or movie poster of the animated movie lured me into watching. I know by heart the story of Puss In Boots because as a child I was fortunate to have an illustrated book of that immortal tale by Charles Perrault. Indeed I should credit the great man for making my childhood a colorful one with his classic fairy tales.Back to this horrendous C. G. I. Adaptation. Yes it is horrendously bad. It is so bad that people who have read the fairy tale, gasp. I understand the necessity to create something new to ensnare people into watching but to ruin what someone has created and taking the life out of it doesn't appeal to me.Verdict: Antonio Banderas(Assassins, The 13th Warrior) voice acts Puss in Boots. His co-star Salma Hayek(Desperado, Everly) plays Kitty Softpaws. The plot concern's Puss being killed by bell shortly after\nsubduing an earthen giant. Waking up, he is informed by a doctor that he only has one life after burning through his past eight and suggests he immediately retire from adventuring. Well Puss doesn't and the rest of the movie concerns comical events as he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star so that he can restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping new enemies.I've seen too many good animated flicks to go deep into analyzing this one. In short seasoned movie fans won't find this one amusing. I enjoyed Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank more than this one.", "The best film of the year?": "I mean, it is possibly the best film of the year along with Everything Everywhere All at Once.First things first, the story highly reminded me of the first Shrek movie: a protagonist living his life unaware of what is missing, later on having to find meaning of his life with an animal sidekick and love of his life. Practically, that is the plot of Shrek as well as of this film's.But I really, really enjoyed watching it. I did not get bored, I was hooked. John Mulaney was a nice surprise as I did not read about the casting before I watched it, he really entertains as usual.Do I even have to talk about the main cast?! Banderas and Hayek are great. The bears are also great. The only so-much-so negative thing is Pugh's performance. It was like out of place for some reason.Even though you can see the ending just reading the title, it really entertains.The best animation of the year definitely, though. Cliffhanger at the end I hope pays off very very soon as I really would love to see a reunion.", "Let's talk": "Well, I'm not a kid anymore, so I'm not often going to animated movies, well, I had opportunity to go to this one. I was a huge fan of Shrek, when I was a child and obviously I would to go see new part of it just for nostalgia. I really liked this movie idea about a cat and it's(or him) last life left on this world. It made this little fella to thing about everything before doing, he started appreciated his life and the opportunity he has. Ending of this movie was bad, everyone became friend and lived happy ever after. That's all? Well, that didn't fulfil me. If we wouldn't talk about the ending, the main problem is effects. If we compare Shrek, that was created about 20years ago, it has same effects or even better than this movie. That's just unforgivable.", "bland and lame": "The essence of the previous ones and \"Shreck\" is not present, the scathing wink to the adult audience with adult and politically incorrect jokes, which greatly amused the parents and adult spectadors in general.It is too politically correct and becomes bland with no guts.Technically well done, it has an interesting plot that can please both adults and children, but it lacks the \"spice\", that \"forbidden\" humor present in the previous scripts.It's lame, a reflex of today's times, with this Hollywood tendency to avoid hurting sensibilities and producing an increasing number of uninteresting movies. How I miss the 80's!I believe it is cyclical and when the ties get loose again, it will fall to the other extreme. It's happened before. While we wait leting out a huge yawn and succumbing to nostalgia.Reasonable but not very interesting, I only recommend it to hardcore fans.", "One of the best animated movies I've ever seen.": "I had VERY high expectations with this movie, mainly because of the reviews I've been reading and let me tell you. This movie is so perfect in every way.10/10 I wouldn't change anything about it. The characters are perfect, the storyline, the humour and of cause the animation might be the very best I've ever seen.I plan to watch this once more whilst its still in theatres, I honestly cannot put into words how good this movie was. Hats off to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece. I go to the theatres a LOT and I wouldn't be surprised if this is the best movie that I see this year in theatres.GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!", "Many lessons about life for all ages": "I loved this movie and so did my autistic friend I watched it with at the cinema. My friend gave it 5 out of 6 stars withdrawing one star because \"cats are not supposed to talk!\"\nI loved the villains in the movie. The wolf was scary enough for my autistic friend to start talking out loud that this wolf is \"not nice!\" The baker villain is also scary as well as comical and absurd. The girl and the bears also have important lessons for us, the viewers. Of course, the movie is totally brilliant technically and the music is wonderful and enhances the story which is solid and void of politics and idiology. The story wants to give us important lessons about life and entertain with action, drama and comedy at the same time.", "Heartwarming and emotional movie you should watch": "I have been watching animations movies since I was a little kid. I have watched sad ones, happy ones, all kinds of animations. This movie in particular is so heartwarming, I couldn't hold back my tears in the end.I got shivers everytime Wolf appeared.The redemption of Puss in Boots is just wonderfully well made. You can clearly see Puss improving himself and he didn't lose his personality. He is not out of the character.This movie made me laugh and cry, but for the right reason. You should give a chance to this movie and open up your heart. Believe me, you won't regret a thing. In the end, you will want to watch it over and over again.", "I wish for more The Last Wishes": "I never expected an animated movie to top my end of year list, much less a sequel to a spin-off to a franchise that hasn't been relevant in 20 years. Coming out of nowhere, seemingly as a much delayed afterthought, the latest Puss in Boots is anything but. Boasting gorgeous animation reminiscent of Into the Spider-Verse but never feeling like a visual rip-off, The Last Wish constantly fires on all cylinders for young audiences and adults alike. The movie's imaginative style that is bound to become a new dazzling showcase for high-end TV screens meshes well with its kinetic set pieces, the funny scenes are actually hilarious and rarely miss a beat, and the recurrent themes of mortality, friendship and identity are as astute as any big, \"mature\" movie you will have seen this year. Couple that with a memorable cast of both returning and new characters and an actually terrifying villain for a change, and you have a genre entry that is shockingly great given its questionable pedigree. Puss in Boots might be down to his last life here, but the franchise is definitely not on its last paws.", "Watch out Disney and Pixar": "One of the greatest movies ever made I've seen a lot of new animated films, particularly those from Disney and Pixar, and this one maintained their level of excellence while never wasting my time. I enjoyed the film; it reminded me of old, good Pixar movies and cartoons, and it had a good storyline that I enjoyed, so I enjoyed this film. But it's not that I dislike other new animated films; this one reminds me of the charming old cartoons that are difficult to find nowadays, and the film also starts off well. It's been a while since we've seen a Puss in Boots film, and this one, like the others, is fantastic.", "It's good story and delightful to watch puss": "Story is well written and progresses well. Every scene taken nicely with good elements. No unnecessary absurdness even though its animated. My first time watching Puss even though been seeing posters and hearing about for like past 10 years. Good cast for pull and good animation bringing the character lively and captivating. Must watch. Watched in 2d but 3d might be good too for those wanting in 3d. Its that kind of movie that is good to watch in theatres. Kid friendly too. Liked it much better compared to many animated series that are overly complicated. Those who have pets either cats or dogs especially will connect with this more, on a separate level.", "(LOUD CLICK) NOICE!!!!!!": "I really don't have to say much about how AMAZING this movie is. Considering every one already has done that for me. The story is great, and the character's are even better. But the Villains OMF!!! They are Good. Like how is a wolf better then the joker for me. A FRICK FRACKING WOLF!!!And all so Jack Horner as a comical relief. I love how over the top he is with his wish, and his \"tragic backstory\" I all so just love how they go into the topic of depression and anxiety. When puss had that panic attack i really felt it because i had one literally three days before watching the movie. Like i almost cried when that happened. I don't have any thing else to say because i just exceeded the amount character's i had to ride.", "This movie has no right to be this good": "Wow, I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie. I took my daughter to see it simply because it was the only film that was appropriate for her age, but it ended up being one of the best children's movies I've ever seen. The animation was stunning, the story was engaging, and the villains were well-developed. However, I should note that there are some scary moments, also some light curse words in the film, so it may not be suitable for very young children. Despite this, the overall message of the movie - to live life to the fullest - is uplifting and inspiring. I highly recommend checking it out.", "A Surprise for Sure": "Being a huge fan of Shrek and Shrek 2, I will always check out anything new this franchise has to offer. Like many others, I was disappointed with Shrek the Third. Shrek Forever After was fine and even though I enjoyed the first Puss in Boots for what it was, my enthusiasm for the franchise has started to fade over the years. For this reason alone, I was very unsure about a Puss in Boots sequel. It's been so long since the first one and I didn't even love that film. Well, colour me incredibly surprised. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is now playing in theatres and available on-demand and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.Following Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) many years after the events of the rest of the franchise, his love of action and adventure has caught up with him. He has used eight of his nine lives and is visited by death. He is told that the next time he dies will be the end. This has him taking a second look at his life. Learning that there may be a chance of restoring his lives by venturing into the Dark Forest, he sets out on a quest to do so. Accompanied by Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n), this is both a hilarious/fun adventure and an emotional tale that really worked for me.They have updated the animation here as well and I thought it looked very unique. I don't think this style would've worked for a Shrek film, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was impressively stylistic. As always, Antonio Banderas was great as the titular hero's voice and it was great to see Salma Hayek return as well. I'm not very familiar with Harvey Guill\u00e9n's work, but his voice work for the character of Perrito had me laughing quite often, so kudos to him for that. The look of this film, the sound design, the story, and every voice actor were all standouts to me. I got a kick out of this film.To wrap this up, I guess my big complaint (even though I really don't want to complain about anything in this film) would be that it's almost too frenetic at times. It has a pace that never lets up, which is great because that never hurts the story, but I would've liked a few more beats to enjoy the dramatic moments. They took the time in the screenplay to write some moving dialogue, especially for a kid's film, but it never felt explored quite enough. I would've also complained about some side characters and what was a seemingly pointless storyline, but I enjoyed how that all played out by the end too. I can't say I loved this film, but it's a great watch at least once. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish gets a recommendation from me.", "Still alive after all these years": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is an American animated movie from 2022, so really new and fresh and this really just came out a few days ago here in Germany, right before Christmas. It says on imdb that the languages are Ukrainian, English and Spanish and English is indeed the one that is used in here most frequently. Spanish also happens here and there, but it is stuff that everybody will understand or just really short inclusions, like the protagonist is called \"gato\" or \"gatito\", which means \"cat\" or \"little cat\" of course. The most memorable mention and also a slightly longer play on words was the famous and friendly \"mi casa es tu casa\" and as a response the not so famous and not so friendly, but witty \"tu casa es mi casa\". It also says there is Ukrainian in here, but it must have been only a sentence or two if this is true. I don't remember. Not sure why though if it is just a politically correct thing nowadays as some kind of statement. These films should not be about politics, not even in a hidden manner, but it's okay now and let's look at the basics. The directors Crawford and Mercado are not new to the industry by any means, but in terms of directing still relatively new. For the former, it is his second full feature film after a Croods movie and for the latter it is even his first full feature film altogether. Nothing unusual though. You see it also with Pixar for example that directors of new movies are people who have deemed themselves worthy on television or short films before that. Same with Dreamworks here. The intro also included some of Dreamworks' animated heroes from the last years, decades even.As for the writers, there is definitely an interesting inclusion: Tommy Swerdlow was an actor on \"Howard the Duck\", \"Spaceballs\" and \"Child's Play\" and a writer for \"Cool Runnings\" in the 90s, but his move to writing animation is not completely new. He also worked on the screenplay for the new Grinch movie not too long ago, so it is only fitting he is also a key writer with this one here that came out right before the holidays, even if it is not Christmas-themed. Another writer is Tom Wheeler and he has more of a history with animation, was also already a factor on the first \"Puss in Boots\" film over a decade ago. And Paul Fisher, like Wheeler, worked on a Lego movie and also on the aforementioned Croods movie and also on a \"Puss in Boots\" television series that came out after the film back then, so there are definite connections within this writing trio here. No surprise their effort here turned out nicely overall. The film runs for 100 minutes approximately and that includes the closing credits already, so it is not a particularly long or short film, somewhere in the middle. I watched the German dub because the original was only shown without subtitles and I don't like that too much. Still not that much to say about the German dub, a few familiar names, but the biggest was maybe Oliver Kalkofe voicing the character that came closest to being the villain in here. The original has of course Oscar nominees Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone can also be mentioned and they are probably the most known names. Really decent cast. There are others that surely have no difficulties in finding a job in the industry these days.I already mentioned there was a \"Puss in Boots\" film more than ten years ago, so took quite some time for this sequel to come out, but then again that movie was also \"only\" a spin-off that includes a character from the \"Shrek\" franchise. One who is deemed worthy of his own movie(s). I kinda agree after seeing this one here a few nights ago. Animation is still on such a high level, even when it comes to original supporting characters getting a sequel to a spin-off. With \"original\" I mean of course that they were at first just supporting characters. Of course, Puss in Boots is not a fully new character, there is this old tale obviously that the character is based on, but this is not a factor at all in this film here, even if the guy with the extravagant hair you see in here could have such a background and stem from this tale. Anyway, I am pretty sure that in here you will find a few faces and characters that have appeared in previous Dreamworks movies already. I cannot say for sure who though. Said emperor fella seems likely and this is definitely also the case with Kitty Softpaws, but her history with the protagonist could also be misleading there. Goldilocks seems familiar too and also the big fat evil guy who seems to have no conscience altogether. It was funny how he did have a conscience in this film, like literally a conscience that was a living creature, but that one had a gigantic challenge there and eventually just moves on. Shrek you do not see here. One character that is really new here is the dog that disguises itself as a cat at the start, so the old lady will also take care of him. This was a bit of a retirement home for old felines you could say and this is where Puss in Boots ends up as well as he had lost eight of his nine lives already and prefers to be on the safe side. Or is rather forced to be more careful. The consequence are a long beard that did not last for long though and resulted in some funny talk with Kitty Softpaws and also a funeral scene in which Puss in Boots buries his adventurous self. This scene they also kept lightly though with how he keeps showing up and talking to make sure that the character (i.e. Himself) gets the speech he deserves because of how much of a hero he had always been.This grave also ends up tricking the semi-bad guys into thinking Puss in Boots was really dead when of course he was not. They even held him in their hands and did not know. I am talking about Goldilocks here of course and her three bears. Those seemed like villains early on too, especially when one bear makes a very aggressive statement to threaten another character, the old cat lady it was I think. First I thought that the bears were really just animals, but then it is shown that they also talk like humans and even get their somewhat emotional story towards the end when they try to convince Goldilocks that they are the family she has always been looking for and that she does not need to make a wish anymore to find a family. In contrast to that, there is no such twist for Jack Horner, the really gross, really big and disgusting bad guy. He only wants the wish to make sure he becomes the mightiest magician on the planet and surely he would not use these powers for anything good. Catastrophe would ensue. Of course, there is no such unhappy ending. But the happy ending is really that everybody realizes they already have what they wish for, which is perhaps not too realistic and a bit too gooey but I take it. This also includes the two cat protagonists then. Puss in Boots wanted his eight lives back for example. The only one who never really cared about the wish was the dog. I mean he had the wish to be allowed to stay with his new family or maybe you can even call them owners if you really see Puss in Boots as a bit of a human character in here, but he only wanted the wish to come true if they like him too and decide to keep him. Very likable and charming character. I would watch another spin-off there that shows us what happened to the dog before this film. Anyway, cats and dogs do get along well here apparently. Calling the protagonist human here may be true with some of his fighting skills and talking etc. But from other perspectives, he is a full-on feline. I think almost all other characters do not understand his talking and exact words and sometimes we are reminded of that when we hear cat sounds coming from him. Cuteness triumphs there for sure.Then there is the element of the cute eyes. We see this on both feline protagonists in this movie. During one occasion. That was enough. It still made for a nice running gag when we realize in the end that cuteness has prevailed and the dog is able to do the same. Good for him as before that he was probably not seen as the cutest animal. But kind and friendly he was from the very start. Aside from that, I also liked some of the music. Heitor Pereira did a great job with the soundtrack here. \"Fearless Hero\" is such a catchy tune and I liked the German version I heard as well, maybe even more than the original. Both will go on my MP3 player for sure. Again no big surprise that there are people with Hispanic names in charge of key components here like Pereira or the aforementioned Januel Mercado. Interesting name. I only knew \"Juan Manuel\" so far. I mean the cat is Hispanic too. Anyway, it would be really cool if Pereira could get an Oscar nomination for his work here too, especially the song I mentioned. I don't think it is too likely though. I think for this Oscar season the film came out too late and probably not too many will remember it in late 2023 or early 2024 then. But we will see, would be a cool surprise. The ending then in a way seemed like it had a touch of closure, but also that new adventures may be ahead. The film's title sounds more like closure, but time-wise I am not sure if this maybe took place before some other movie from the production studio? It is not too important though. I just hope that if there will be a third Puss in Boots film or even another Shrek movie at some point, that it will not be another decade until then. This one here I surely give a positive recommendation and I quite enjoyed the watch. Good animation (should not be taken for granted, not even in 2022), nice attention to detail (like with how the maps looked different in terms of who held them), good comedy, interesting characters... All the way it should be, even if I would still say that it was not a film that totally blew me away or so. But the thumbs-up from my side here was never in doubt. This film is a good watch for young, middle-aged and old people. Give it a chance!", "Wow. Actually Dream Works' best work and a true animated masterpiece!": "Just when you think you really know what to expect and that nothing can surprise you any more, life taeches you lessons.This movie is one such little lesson.I gave up hope on big Hollywood animated studios to make any true great movie any more.And even while Dream Works didn't degrade nearly as bad as Pixar, and Disney's Encanto was really good and actually made me almost tear up at one point, in the end it left that feeling of a perfectly calculated, executed and polished product above all else.But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish leaves the feeling of genuine creative inspiration and love.It radiates brilliance.The noble, positive story delovered through absolutely deligtful animation (which itself is a technically and artistically novel and perfectly welcome combination of the standard high definition rendering with a soft \"cell shaded\" layer on top of it) made me pause and smile, laugh and gaze at the visual experience throughout.The character design and facial animations are sublime, and Jack is by far the most strikingly designed animated villain I've ever seen.All in all, I just want to express my admiration and congratulate to everyone involved in making this gem.", "A VERY GOOD MOVIE TO HAVE FUN": "This is good movie, the fans are definitely enjoys and new audiance are also understand this film. The characters are very well written and the storyarc of the each character is perfectly narrated in a clear and heartwarming manner.The recent sequels are all failing to thier originals because they lack the proper story and they basically extentions of the original movie but this film was written very creatively that you will defintely enjoy. This film got the humour, beatiiful sceneries, heartfelt sentiment , good action sequences and most importantly very well written screenplay.My favorite characters in this whole movie are DEATH and GOLDILOCKS. I am expecting the return of GOLDILOCKS character in upcoming sequels which is voiced beautifully by Florence Pugh, and DEATH was the best character written in the recent years. You dont expect character like DEATH in children animation film but the crew pull it off very effeciently.The screenplay was good that you appreciate every character and easy to understand and with stellar voice cast this film has become must watch and i definitely siggest this movie.", "Disney Take Note!": "It's been a while since I reviewed something on here but since everyone is saying the say things about this particular film, I thought I'd quickly say my thoughts on the film, it was recently released in the UK last Friday and I managed to see on release date and... yeah I'm with everyone else, it's spectacular!The animation is stylised and colourful!, the characters have good depth and are very entertaining while the new characters are highly memorable along with great voice acting!, the humour is back to it's old Shrek and is incredibly funny and makes good meta humour, the themes are quite mature and handled with great emotion and tension, the score by Heitor Pereira is simply his best and the songs are wonderful!, the story is gripping and executed perfectly with fantasy and fun!, it's incredibly epic in the scale and world, also there are some nice cameos and good Disney references and jokes too, always a plus.Yeah, this is the best DreamWorks yet, best Shrek film since Shrek 2, it's perfect for all ages and better than anything Disney and Pixar put out recently with their rather average and forgettable films, this is how you do animation, it's films like this makes me miss just how fresh and new cinema can be and bring to new heights!, it's my favourite film of the year and animated film for that matter, also now being one of my favourite animated films of all time!, go check it when ya can, it's really worth watching on the big screen!, so apparently they are going to make a Shrek 5, in which it doesn't need to exist but if it's anything like Puss in Boots 2, than I am all for it, but especially I want more of this and Bad Guys, and less more of Boss Baby and Trolls (oh wait..), we need more stylised, mature and different animations than just the same cash grab sequels just for money.I'm more than happy to give Puss in Boots: The Last Wish a 10/10.", "Perrito saves the movie": "Upon discovering that he spent his 8 lives and only one remains, Puss gets scared, and flees to a crazy cat lady, where he becomes a house cat. He encounters Perrito... a dog disguised as a cat, who is full of life and hope, and is the main reason why this movie didn't suck in my opinion. I started watching my watch to see when the movie would stop around the 45min mark, and only Perrito made me want to stay. His one liners, while discovering a world that he never actually saw, is kind of cute and sometimes hilarious. Clearly not at the level of a Shrek, but easy enough to watch if you want to unplug your brain.", "A good authorial animation and full of details": "\"Puss in Boots 2\" is a film that has been a huge success, both with critics and with the audience, and the film is good, with great voiceovers, and cartoonish animation that I like a lot, charismatic characters and great subplots, but if If it weren't for the bold addition of the \"Wolf\" which in the feature works as a metaphorical representation of death, a representation that actually works very well, the film would be more of a good common animation, like its predecessor, this style of language adds a plus without taking away the fun and entertainment for the kids, I don't leave the cinema impressed but I liked what I saw, and mainly it entertained me, if you're looking for super animation, deep, well dubbed, fun and with impressive features, go see Guilhermo del Toro's Pinocchio because \"Puss in Boots 2\" is not that movie. Note 7/10.", "Stunning, must watch family movie": "We live in an era in which movies and tv/streaming series constantly bombard us with fake morals, emotional blackmail and empty content that insult both the intelligence and integrity of the viewer.This movie is not one of those. For the first time in years you can sit back and relax watching a fun family movie that doesn't try to force an obvious political agenda on you. And I say obvious, because if this Puss in Boots movie has any political intentions, at least it is oblivious instead of being bad tasteful, without sacrificing the artistic legitimacy of the creators and the entertainment of the spectators like certain films.Instead, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a charming, funny and captivating family movie in every word. From the fantastic and stylish animation (which in moments of action reminds me of anime series) to the numerous healthy jokes that will make children and adults laugh to tears. I reiterate the animation, the film dares to use innovative techniques that at least I have not seen in western animated films, giving the film an exotic, wacky and cool style that fits perfectly with the personality of Puss in Boots.Moreover, something that I really liked is the representation of the cultures that inspired the film. Besides the mandatory fairy tales refferences, the film is itself a fantastic pastiche of Hispanicity, from flamenco pieces to graceful Latino accents and coloquial language, all done with impeccable taste and detail.Finally I will say that the message of the film is beautiful. It could be said that it manages to break certain stereotypes in a convincible way and at the same time promote conservative (and universal) values, something with which everyone can identify.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the best animated movies I've seen in many years, a must see for all fans of animation and good comedy. I hope that the success of this film will inspire other producers to make more movies with heart like this, movies that do not seek to victimize or blame anyone. That's right, I'm talking to you, Disney.", "NOT FOR KIDS OF ANY AGE!": "I honestly feel like many of the 8+ reviews here are fake and that the public hasn't had enough time to co tribute enough to make an impact.THE GOOD: the nice songs at the end during the credits roll, the availability of 3D at the theatre, the innocent dog character and the concept of enjoying our one life, our family and good friends rather than focusing on one \"wish\". Mildly entertaining.THE BAD: storyline was a mishmash. Too many characters and not going into any character or the cause of any actions deeply. You don't really connect to any of the characters.THE UGLY: Too much violence and swear words. Not for kids, neither for adults.", "Absolutely thrilling and visually appealing": "The first puss in boots was a pretty generic spin off from the Shrek series but this movie is a step up in every single way. The animation has a lot of spiderverse vibes but still contains its own interesting visual style that just reels you in. The villains are also SPECTACULAR! The wolf might be one of the scariest and intense Dreamworks villains of all time. Kitty soft paws didn't mean much to me in the first movie but she has a very good arc that makes you enjoy her character a lot more, also puss in boots actually has an interesting arc and he is just such a better protagonist. Also the dog is such a great introduction, not only is he funny but he has a really charming personality that makes you adore him every second he's on screen. In all honesty puss in boots the last wish is the best animated movie of 2022.", "Best family orientated film of 2022 and solid alternative to Avatar 2": "There's been some uneven family & animated films in 2022: Sonic 2 was big screen fun junk food, Lightyear while good missed the mark and dragged, and Rise of Gru was not a good film and was carried by the Minions.Puss N Boots though was a very pleasant surprise. Had some really great characters like Goldilocks and the 3 bears, the little doggie, and of course Puss. Film had some solid animation and decent story that felt a combo of Shrek and Kung Fu PandaUnfortunate that Universal/Dreamsworks didnt time this films release better or market it better. Mid October / early Thanksgiving would had been better.Very good alternative to Avatar 2.", "Best Shrek Sequel Since Shrek 2?": "Came for the reviews, wasn't disappointed. Appealing usage of color, enjoyable reconfiguration of fairy tales, and interesting choice of voice actresses. The action sequences are definitely the highlight of this movie, as all of camera work, animation, and choreography work spotlessly, comparable to some of the best fight scenes from Attack on Titan or Naruto Shippuden. Utilizing reflections of eyes, crystal, and the map, the thematic idea of introspection, especially in the face of death, is also brough up, which unfortunately isn't emphasized enough to be memorable. Much of the narration and pacing in the second act is diluted and essentially ruined by the multiple perspectives and excessive characters. However, the major antagonist, Death, is honestly a compelling figure: menacing, dogged, yet chivalrous.", "Waaay better than i thought it would be": "I went in high as a kite thinking this will be a good time in the movies and my goodness i was wrong. I had a fantastic time! I've never seen an animated villain so cool since Kung fu panda trilogy. This has got to be the best animated villain I've ever seen.The story is way more dark and serious than the trailers would make you believe. And because of that, you actually feel for Puss and the rest of the characters. The pup is again a fantastic match for the cat and something so obvious I'm surprised it wasn't done sooner but glad it was done so well.The secondary villain too was waay smarter than an animated family film usually serves. The action sequences, the animation style, the music, all fantastic! Even the fairy tale references are at par with those from the first Shrek.I really want to watch this film once again!", "Best movie I've seen this year": "So surprised Dreamworks made this movie as amazing as it did, was an enjoyable watch from start to end, with so many good details.The film actually transforms into a meaningful, hilarious, exhilarating, emotional and at times jarringly terrifying piece of animation and to say I was thoroughly entertained would be an understatement.This movie was way better then it had any right being. I hope it tops the box office.Musical notes syncing up with the battle was one of my favorite parts.It's worth a 2ed viewing just for Villain alone. The actor killed it.This is Dreamworks best for a while now.", "I Like The Jokes In The Earlier Entries": "Puss in Boots (voice by Antonio Banderas) gets smashed flat and comes back, but it's his eighth death. Now when Death in the form of a cloaked wolf (Wagner Moura) with scythes starts threatening him with his ninth and final death, he loses his nerve and retreats to the safety of a crazy cat lady's home and dozens of other cats, including a chihuahua dog masquerading as a cat for the food and the company. When Goldilocks and the Three Bears Crime Family (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) come snuffling along for the location of the fallen star with the power to grant any wish, Puss and the chihuahua go in search of it, running into Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayak) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) also on the search.As the .... pause to count 'em .... fifth or so entry in the Shrek series, there are signs of tired, if not quite exhaustion. There are fewer outright fairy-tale jokes -- although the way Kevin McCann voices the 'ethical big' made me laugh -- and a lot more high-speed action sequences, and three sets of morals at the end to set any child who watches this on the path to being a good little boy. Eh. It's entertaining enough in its hyperkinetic visual fashion, but it's clearly past the point where the franchise is breaking new ground or telling new jokes, and has begun to trade on the good will of the earlier entries.", "Surprisingly not just good, but AMAZING": "I very seldom go to see animation, and today I saw Puss in Boots, The Last Wish. Due to a technical error at my AMC, my original desired showtime was no longer an option, so stuck with Puss In Boots. I need to be clear, I had very low expectations. I just feel, with Animation of late you get disappointed more than in awe.There was not a second of film where I lost focus or was thinking what I want to eat or do latter. Puss is told he has one life left and needs to stop being so wild. There is a odd (?) b story with the three bears and Little Jack, played by the talented Mulhaney. Puss is told to go to a cat day care, we meet a dog who talks, and this dog is essentially our \" Donkey.\" We escape the day care, and try to follow our last wish.The supporting characters are pretty hit or miss. The bear storyline really added nothing to me. What was great about this film, this felt like early 2000's Dream Works Animation. Simply superb animation. Now, not having seen Puss one, and gave up with the Shrek franchise on number 3, how does Puss become who he is? How did Puss and Shrek meet? I guess I need to watch Shrek 3, 4 and Puss one then.All in all, I was hooked for the whole story. Great voices and outstanding animation.A+", "Fun, Original and Epic": "I honestly can not recommend this movie enough. It was amazing, pure simple. The animation was brilliant, the style of each character, the beauty of each environment, all while staying true to the original concept first seen in shrek.The story was original, with an absolutely brutal villain and the way each character develops and changes over the course of the movie is expertly done. I truly adored every single character in this movie.The action scenes were epic and there werent too many nor too few. Each one had me hooked.I had some great laughs too. The humour was never too childish nor was it ever insanely adult.The wolf was so perfectly done as well, every scene he was in induced fear and you could really feel the anxiety that puss was feeling.Perfect movie deserves a perfect score.", "Decent.": "In this movie, it's more of a stand alone movie, than it is a sequel. By them making Puss in Boots afraid, and only have one life left made it feel like he was no longer \"Puss in Boots\" he was now just a cat running from death. Him being the fearless cat he is, is what made him Puss in Boots, and it feels like they took that away. As a stand alone movie, it's really good, but as a Puss in Boots sequel, it didn't feel right. This movie felt really anticlimactic. When Puss was fighting Death, it makes your heart race, but for it to just stop, feels as if it give you no time for your heart to slow down. I really feel like it kind of fell flat in some parts. As a movie, good. As a sequel, not right.", "Fantastic adventure": "I really need more of this one, like I couldn't get enough how great this film was. It has meaningful characters, like everyone in here have meaning for reasons, their own stories, not just regular side characters. The artstyle is spot on with that quality too, like Dreamworks nailed it! The plot is great and I've pretty much enjoyed it so far, keep it simple but not lame, well done again. I teared up a lot when i was in the cinema, the skill of storytelling is amazing! They don't make it too long like it lasted forever, they take it easy and with that, it's perfectly just fine. So, I just want to say, thanks Dreamworks for this one, love P. I. B a bunch.", "Genuinely the best DreamWorks Film ever.": "I've never cared for the dreamwork's style all too much, it's always had a strange almost repetitive style and I've always been left wanting more. With all that said, this movie blew my mind, never before has dream-works presented me with a movie both fulfilling and nerve racking.The character of death had such a big complexity to him and in a world where kids movies value simple humour and loose storylines\n, this presented me with genuine story with a complex narrative. Throughout the movie death comes for Puss in Boots, specifically in times where he himself is close to dying, Death gives Puss in Boots genuine fear that encourages him to seek more out of life. Puss in Boots realised that life is fleeting and that he'll have to make the most of what he has, he learns real life lessons that the majority of adults have trouble with and these difficult topics are met with just the right tone and seriousness while keeping it kid-friendly.This is a movie I would happily recommend to anyone regardless of age because it is genuinely a great film in and of itself.", "True Legend": "One of the animated films I have been waiting to watch and yes, it never disappoints me! DreamWorks' one of the best films is back!It is a great film! Puss in Boots is one of my favorite characters! He is really a legend! From the first time I have seen Puss in Boots showed up in Shrek, I have been a fan! Truly a funny, heroic, cute character that everyone would love! Specially, if you are a cat lover!Antonio Banderas (Puss in Boots) really suits the character of Puss in Boots. His manly, sweet, raspy voice made everything so perfectly good for the character.Now, I can't wait and so excited for the next film of Puss in Boots where he will meet again Shrek and Donkey! My other 2 favorite characters of DreamWorks! I just can't wait!!!!", "Cutting Edge": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was one of the biggest surprises of 2022. This was not a movie that anyone was asking for, yet it was incredibly charming and fun. The film merges two animation styles, which are both gorgeous and cutting edge. There are moments of traditional DreamWorks animation and others that are similar to \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\".The characters introduced in this film are reminiscent of those in the first two \"Shrek\" movies. Each character is carefully thought out, and evokes an emotional response, whether that be hope, fascination, or fear. From the confused Goldilocks to the adorable Perrito to the fearsome Lobo, everyone brings something new to the table.There is honestly not a lot to criticize about \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\". The film hit darker notes than previous \"Shrek\" films and there were moments in the theater when kids shrieked. Some of the scenes are a little drawn out, but the story itself is strong.For those with small children, be aware that there is a strong use of \"hell\" and some cleverly censored words throughout the movie. Otherwise, the film is perfectly appropriate (more than some other \"Shrek\" movies) for kids.\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is the best animated film of 2022 and the best \"Shrek\" film since \"Shrek 2\" (not that the competition is very stiff). The animation is stunning, the voice-acting crisp, and the story is interesting for both children and adults. Even if you haven't seen the first \"Puss in Boots\", go and see this movie. You will not be disappointed.Also, the new DreamWorks opening is excellent.Best Character: Perrito\nBest Scene: Reading the map\nBest Quote: \"Maybe one life is enough\" - Perrito.", "Simp for puss in boots": "How could I not love it.the animation is so beautiful and my favorite character doing there thing. Although I didn't expect much going into this film considering that it was a sequel and the original was released quite a bit ago. But I was not only pleasantly surprised but very stunned with both the story itself and the look of it. I honestly loved it. I will admit it is probably not everyone's cup of tea but it definitely was mine. I do think this movie is worth a watch if you are up to it and can be a fantastic family movie or friends movie especially if you all have watched sherk and all that follows. Can't wait to watch it again.", "Gorgeous animation and stellar cast, Puss dances in his boots again": "It's been nearly two decades since the adorable Puss made his screen debut in Shrek 2 and 11 years since his starring debut. In an elaborate action sequence that opens his new animated adventure Puss In Boots : The Last Wish, he is looking to redeem his lives since he is down to his last one.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish mixes stunning animation (with storybook illustration style) with a poignant, surprisingly mature story to deliver an amazing sequel for an adventurer. It is darker in tone but still is funny and compelling by all means. With an excellent cast and style, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale. DreamWorks Animation has done an amazing job, and yes they are renowed to get better with franchise sequels (Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda, not Shrek though)My Rating : 8.5/10.", "They were so close...": "Amazing artwork, beautiful animation with excelent movement, thought provoking and deep themes, great character design, cool worldbuilding, fair stakes and overall a good concept.But then... the goddamn childish jokes and horribly lazy dialogue just killed it for me. I can understand that childrens movies cannot have too much subtext or the children wont understand... but for gods sake you dont have to have so many lame jokes, stupid jokes... you are making kids dumber than they are.Also the pacing was a bit off too. It would have been a cool 8 episode anime, but right now it was too rushed..", "Just Right.": "With the blunt parody of Shrek; the emotional and witty maturity of Shrek 2; Shrek the Third's...; and the darkness and finality of Shrek Forever After. All of the best elements of these movies (except Shrek the Third) are all combined into a spin-off that has no right being *this* fantastic; But is. And that movie is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, one of the best movies I've ever experienced in a long time.When I was a kid, Puss in Boots was my favorite character in the Shrek series. I loved his design, his Spanish accent, and of course, his voice actor, Antonio Banderas. And while I grew older, Puss kinda got thrown into the background and got overshadowed by more complex characters. But the Last Wish rekindled that child-like wonder and revived my love for the character. Not only that, the Last Wish weaves a surprisingly mature and emotional arc around confronting mortality and self-embetterment.The Last Wish goes even further by creating the perfect cast of characters. Perrito, I thought, was going to be an unbearable comedic companion; yet in the end, he became an adorable bastion of emotional support and empathy. Kitty Softpaws, a character carried over from the previous movie, is just as an excellent foil and love interest to Puss, being just as, if not more, a cynical isolationist like Puss. But what steals the show are the factional antagonists. From the sympathetic and surprisingly wholesome Goldilocks and the Three Bears to the hilarious, morbidly immoral Jack Horner who revels in his evil, to the mysterious, dark, and genuinely scary wolf known as \"Lobo,\" all of them are excellent and well-balanced in the story (especially with Lobo, who has a brilliant reveal that I won't spoil).Speaking of which, the story is great. It feels perfectly balanced and well-paced. But I'm honestly shocked by how dark this movie can be, thematically and humor-wise. This film explores the fear of death, insecurity, anxiety, companionship, and it does not hold back against any of these themes. Which for an animated film with a talking cat and supposedly aimed at younger audiences, that is bold.Finally there's the animation. The animation takes a page out of Spiderverse and runs with it to make its own style. The result is a gorgeous, almost painterly experience that feels like it was ripped out of a watercolor fairy tale illustration mixed in with stylized transitions that are pleasing to the eyes and create interesting visual juxtapositions. All the settings have unique color palettes, and areas like the Dark forest is so creative in its presentation.All in all, when it comes to being a cinematic experience The last Wish is a genius experience. If there's anything that I would call this movie: is that it's just right. Not too dark, not too light, just. Right.", "Best film I've seen in Cinema since TopGun M": "What a great surprise, I was expecting the usual cash and grab and seeing this is the sixth installment in the Shrek Universe i thought we could be getting a bit stale but clearly I was wrong. The visuals are stunning, the voice cast was superb and the score was magical. It hasn't created anything new, it's the usual quest mission but when the films gets going it has a great dark tone in it. Death played by a wolf is genuinely haunting and I loved every single scene he was in. Its a different Puss you see here, he's vulnerable and on his last life. There is some great humour for the adults more so than the kids but it's a great spectacle that must be watched on a big screen. I honestly I can't recommend it enough. Superb!", "Best Puss in Boots Movie, Possibly Best Shrek Movie": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" follows Puss in Boots as he is on his last life. As a cat with nine lives, Puss lived a life of fearless adventure with no regrets. But as he is on his last life, suddenly Puss feels fear like he never has before. He then finds a chance to restore his lives from a wishing star.Puss in Boots 2 is better than the first \"Puss in Boots\" (2011) film. It isn't necessary to watch the first film, TV show or any of the Shrek films to enjoy this film. This film has great action, music, animation, characters and humor.One of the things this film does better than most modern animated films is how they use their villains. Puss and company must contend with a few antagonists through the journey. All parties are competent and various levels of funny. One is a sympathetic group, another deliciously over the top, and the final just straight up scary. Through this the film is able to keep up a good pace, always be exciting and entertaining. Like the villains, the hero group is also well done. They have terrific comedic chemistry, between the two jaded adventurers and the naive overly optimistic companion, I could see myself enjoying 3 more films with this crew.As far as negatives go, some of the lessons our heroes learn are a bit predictable, even for little kids, I'm sure they've heard these messages before. And I personally have never been a fan of the \"wish\" as a McGuffin. I always think of 10 better wishes the people could use. There is also one part where I think the film's pacing drags.Where \"Shrek 2\" I walk away talking about all the great jokes. In this film I walk away talking about the great action sequences. The film is funny throughout, but the adventure is the best part. The \"Shrek\" films always seemed to make their stories with a self-aware wink to the camera. \"Puss in Boots 2\" is far more sincere in its story telling and emotional beats. The humor never gets in the way of its more serious moments. It is the type of film where I could see kids laughing and crying when they watch.This is DreamWorks at its very finest. This Last Wish is the stuff Dreams are made of.", "Puss in Reboots": "This latest animated instalment of the legendary Puss in Boots of the much-loved DreamWorks fairytale franchise is a winning concept with so-so execution. It successfully provides viewers with a heartwarming insight into Puss' inner life, with a valuable lesson on mortality to boot.The film's continuity with the Shrek universe feels thin in places, albeit more pronounced in other areas. The presence of *that* unmistakable, signature DreamWorks fairytale theme was largely inconsistent, and often felt as if things were partly stuck in the design phase; undecided on whether the film should present itself as a stop-motion painted comic book, a faithful Shrek-style animated fairytale escapade spinoff, or an ironic case of cat and mouse. Ultimately, what we got was a slightly muddled end product unsure of its exact identity as a film; surefooted, or better, sure-pawed, I'd think not.For example, Shrek's fairytale-scape and storyboard simply felt more deliberate and thought-out by comparison.Where \"The Last Wish\" really starts to fall apart is in its latter stages; Puss and pals traverse a shifting almost-arbitrary landscape which is, on the whole, a bit aimless and wearing especially thin on plotline by this point. It's a lot of filler and not so much killer.The antagonist \"Big\" Jack Horner was brilliant. A nursery rhyme character with an inferiority complex based on being a mere nursery rhyme character. He was assigned almost all of the funny lines, though. Much of which concerned his questionable conscience and his accidental ethics advisor. However, Horner needed more development, with only a fraction of the runtime dedicated to his backstory.Goldilocks and her grizzly bear trio are gratingly shown as a cockney gang, sans the charming guile and slapstick humour of actual cockneys, Goldilocks would surely present more as spoiled brat than streetwise cockney, but each to their own.Whether *two* sets (three if you count the big bad wolf) of villains were necessary is up for debate, but it meant that more screen time had to be funneled into explanatory backstories and character development that could've been better spent elsewhere. Again, almost like a concept stage indecision about which villain makes the cut and instead just settling on juggling both.The lure of a franchise is that it's easier to market a known commodity. Whether this DreamWorks franchise has run the course of its own nine lives is yet to be seen.7.2/10.", "Basically perfect": "Excellent, Jack Horner was easily the best part of the movie, really the true hero of the story, I hope he gets a spin off, because every line he had was hilarious and John Mulaney was incredible. Anyway this movie is basically perfect, the villain is genuinely scary and awesome, Puss in Boots is the best he has ever been here. I loved the animation, soundtrack, fight scenes, humor, literally everything in this movie is spot on. I've watched this 5 times already and will probably end up watching again and again. Dreamworks used to be a company I respected when they made beautiful 2D animation like The Prince of Egypt, in my eyes this is the only movie since Sinbad to meet that level of quality, this movie made me feel like Dreamworks was back. I honestly have always hated CGI animation and I hope that this new art style is used for future Dreamworks films. This is what the first Shrek movie should have been. This doesn't feel derivative of anything that came previously despise using these fairy tale characters, that's how it's done. As a person who usually hates Dreamworks and doesn't like Shrek, I loved Puss in Boots through and through.", "Other half preferred a shaven pussy": "Dreamworks have been delivering colourful, funny and insightful films for decades. Shrek, Dragons, Madagascar, and recently my kids have been enjoying the Puss In Boots series. Even at its darkest, it maintains that feeling of brightness.Yet here, they seem to have missed a beat with the wolf. The anxiety levels of my youngest went up the first time he saw him and got worse through out.The three bears and Goldi were probably better antagonists in this tale of finding what is your one wish, even if I was expecting Daddy Bear to start quoting me odds on reaching the end of the quest.Burrito stole the show, particularly with his potty mouth and heart wrenching back story.It's a much darker Shrek - blink and you'll miss him - story, with some good humour moments, some tear inducing moments and plenty of action scenes.Just glad Puss's beard doesn't last.", "BEST ANIMATED FILM OF 2022": "As expected, Puss in Boots The Last Wish is the most enjoyable movie to watch with great animation, action, characters, plot & humor.This appeals to everyone from kids to eldest as it shows a very deep moral, which is to be grateful for what you have & 1 life is what makes things special.The characters were also great, especially the antagonist who is supposed to represent fear to the protagonist. His entrance would give me cold vibes.The humor was very lightened & will make the whole audience laugh, there are some jokes that a lot of kids won't understand due to censored cursing.The animation & action is a lot better on the big screen, so it's definitely recommended to watch it ASAP.This movie deserves an epic 10/10 & I can't wait to see what dreamwork holds for us in the future.", "Beg for mercy from PUSS! IN BOOTS!": "The concept for this film is simple, puss has run out of his nine lives and can only get them back with the means of a wishing star which is in pretty high demand among the bad guys of the shrek cinematic universe. The competition is Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Little Jack Horner who is not so little anymore along with a certain someone who is behind puss for a very specific reason.The execution of this concept is what makes this film such a treat. The screenplay is straightforward and fast-paced, drags somewhat in the second act but manages itself by the end. The music is perfect for the aesthetic (chef's kiss to be more accurate). The voice acting is muy buena (very good). Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura they're all just fantastic. I was genuinely invested in the characters and not solely on nostalgia. Not that this film does a few callbacks but those aren't some cheap fan-services but something that add a little substance to the greater story.Now, the animation and the cinematography. Ughhhh, it's so freaking beautiful !!! Spiderverse swung in style so puss in boots could land purrfectly on it's feet. There is clearly inspiration for the animation here but instead of some cheap rip-off, it really feels like an artistic choice and comes off as an artist's fairytale come to life here. The movie literally starts with the words \"this is a fairytale...\" and lives up to it! The cinematography too is something to look out for. This film haz better shots than I can spot in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster these days. DreamWorks atleast never fails in that department and always manages to exceed expectations!To be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this film because the shrek cinematic universe has been near-dead for so long, but this film gives me hope. This film gives me something to put my faith in. You'd think that years of development hell would usually mean bad for a film but not for PUSS!... IN BOOTS!Just go and have a good time with this. And if you haven't yet seen the trailer for the film, don't do it. Just go into the film blindly like I did. It will surely give you a few surprises! In my opinion, this is the best film in the Shrek Cinematic Universe since Shrek 2, which isn't saying a lot, but it should since Shrek: Forever After was the only good film after Shrek 2.P. S.: the new DreamWorks intro is so good. I just love it!", "Thank You, Dreamworks.": "In a time when cinema is often failing us, Dreamworks once again pulls through and creates a funny, thought provoking, original story with lovable characters and important themes.This movie's animation is incredible. The humor is bold and the characters are captivating. It holds a world that is so colorful but oftentimes dark because, alongside all the fun...it deals with themes of mortality and of fear.(Who would have thought Puss in Boots himself would show us that one of the most important lessons in life is to look past yourself and cherish what you have to be grateful for).I'm glad that in this day and age, kids (and adults!) have a movie like this to remind them what's important in life. And that they get to see it in a way that is creative, original, and often times surprising.Puss in Boots and The Last Wish is such a refreshing movie that I think anyone, regardless of age, can enjoy.", "REFRAMING ANIMATION": "Puss in boots throws animated movie stereotypes out the window. It's not a kids movie, it's not the Disney/Pixar style, and it's not predictable. This movie wasn't pandering to an audience, it wasn't fan service, and it definitely wasn't a cash grab. It was a celebration of film making in general and it used the animated medium to take it to its fullest potential.It had everything in place.Characters were king. The cast of this movie was varied, compelling and handled phenomenally. There were no throw away characters, no unmotivated storylines, and no one that you didn't care about.Next they had a solid plot. It was relatively simple at base level. However, this basic premise when looked at through the lens of 6 different characters with their storylines intertwined makes for a very interesting film.The style was AMAZING. They took the technical advancements Sony made in Into the Spider-verse and spun them into a beautifully rendered painterly fairy tale world. The colours were bold, the textures were tangible, and it was beautiful.They also switched up frame rate, incorporated anime style freeze frames, had fascinating fight scenes, and interesting character designs.Finally, the message was REAL. Puss in Boots, the small hubris orange cat warrior, felt SO REAL. His fears were relatable, you understood his motives, you felt his emotions, and you saw him change. It was simply good writing. A prime example of character done right.ALSO, there was one of the greatest villains of all time in this movie. But I'll let you discover him for yourself.In conclusion go watch this movie. Please.", "I don't think words can explain the perfection of this masterpiece": "I am a 23 year old man and this 'children's' animated movie has become my favourite film of all time. It is perfect in every aspect, story, characters, pace, dialogue, animation, sound track, all of them 10/10. I can genuinely think of no faults to this film and it is one that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages perfectly balancing light hearted comedy with some deeper themes and important life questions and messages .

This film is incredible, dreamworks have done it again and it's a film that for me really defines why they are my favourite animation studio. The animation is slick switching between styles which during the fight scenes at first can be jarring but I quickly found myself adjusting to them and by the final fight I appreciated it all the more. On his journey Puss encounters an old friend and new foes all of which have a part to play in the films final act. The thing that perhaps stood out most to me is the films main theme that it's okay to be scared of the future however when we put our trust in the people around us and appreciate them it makes life easier. I also loved the films portray of anxiety and how it's okay to be scared no matter how much of a fearless hero you may be.A definite must watch!", "Movie had no right being this good": "There was a lot of hype surrounding this film, so I had a feeling that it was going to be a good movie, but I had no idea that the movie was going to be THIS good. I walked out of the movie theater pleasently surprised. The film has amazing animation, a great pot, but above all the characters really carry this film. Puss in Boots, the side characters, and the villains are amazing in this film. And a special shout out to the voice actors is in order because the voice acting in this film was simply amazing. I would highly recommend watching this film, it's great for people of all ages. Great work dreamworks!", "Quite enjoyable...": "Sitting down to watch the 2022 animated movie \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\", I must say that I was entertained and impressed.I haven't seen any of the \"Puss in Boots\" movie since the first movie, so I weren't really up to speed here, but I figured I would watch this 2022 movie with my son since the opportunity presented itself. And it was quite enjoyable.The storyline, as written by Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler, was quite well-written, and it had many great elements and included different elements from various well-known rhymes, fables, fairytales, etc. So there was a lot of nice things to see on the screen.The voice cast in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was great, and there were some very good talents on the cast list.Visually then \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was impressive. The art style and CGI was really great and looked amazing on the screen. And there were a lot of small details to take in, in each and every scene, which makes the movie well-worth watching more than just a single time.\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a movie for the entire family, as it holds elements of adventure, great storytelling, lovely characters, and much more.If you haven't already seen directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado's 2022 animated movie \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\", then you most certainly should do so, if you get the chance. I was certainly more than entertained.My rating of \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.", "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish": "I can't think for a minute that this would have worked at all, had it not for been for the entertainingly over-the-top voice talents of Antonio Banderas in the title roll. His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters \"Perrito\" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little \"Jack Horner\" and \"Goldilocks\" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival \"Kitty\" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the \"Goldilocks\" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since \"Evita\" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.", "Unfathomably good": "I have rewatched this movie twice already, something I have never done for any movie while still in theatre, and I plan to watch it again. I thought people were overhyping this movie but it is the best cinema I have been witness to in a signifcantly long time. There is nothing to critique, it does everything it wants to do and it does it perfectly. Of special note is the fact that it nails very touchy subjects, and the art style is beautiful. This movie is a great addition to the actually very good Shrek franchise, and an incredibly movie in it's own right. I implore everyone to watch it.10/10 is undervaluing this gem, Puss in my favourite fearless hero.", "A movie that had no reason to be as AMAZING as it is.": "This review is more than anything a PSA to get people to watch this movie. I decided to go see this purely because I heard good things, considering I wasn't the biggest fan of the original as a kid despite loving Shrek. However, not only was this one of if not my favorite theater experiences of the last year, it was so good I already want to see it again.This film is very separate despite being considered a sequel. It stands on its own as one of the most clever and creative animated films of the last few years. Puss is a great protagonist. The lessons he learns throughout the movie are predictable and easy to grasp for kids while also being portrayed in such heartwarming, complex, and interesting ways that make the moments entertaining for an older audience as well. There are also plenty of subtle dark jokes and other crazy moments that adults will love.However, it's not just Puss, this entire cast is amazing. This franchise is great at thinking of new fairy tale characters to add to every film, and the ones chosen here are some of the best. Their classic stories are implemented in a way that makes this plot surprisingly unique and well put together. Kitty Softpaws was a welcome return from the first film and the antagonists are all amazing.I loved the family dynamic of Goldilocks and the bears! Their flashback scene really got me to care for their relationship. Jack Horner was a great vehicle to push the heroes forward and his back and forth with Jiminy Cricket was hysterical. Death was also a great looming threat, being a literal representation of Puss' fears.I also have to specifically shout out Perro. Harvey Guillen does a fantastic job at bringing to life a cute, comedic relief character that is not annoying. His comedic timing is always on point and occasional dark humor that is blended with his adorably oblivious personality worked very well.I would love to see him continue to appear in future Shrek and Puss movies. The movie does not overstay its welcome at all. It's relatively short but incredibly well-paced. At a glance, it may seem overstuffed, but the rapid-fire action format of its very intentional and there's still room left for good character moments.The action is fantastic, being very reminiscent of Spider-Verse in all the right ways. Some of the fight scenes feel pulled out of a Shonen anime. They're all fun and visually impressive.While not relying on them at all, this movie is also filled with great cameos and nods that will make any Shrek fan happy. I can safely say if this new animation style and writing have some influence on Shrek 5, it could become the best Shrek movie.Simply put, this movie is incredibly fun. It is a project where you can feel the passion put into it by the writers, animators, and voice actors. This is truly Dreamworks' answer to Into the Spider-Verse. It is a needed unique twist on an existing big franchise and I don't think I could've been more pleasantly surprised by it. Go watch this movie!", "Anime wannabe": "Alright story, but this spiderman/anime crap shouldn't be fitted into the magical Shrek universe, part of my childhood got hurt with this on 2s laggy animations and oil paintings, comic book effects.I understand the team got inspired by the spiderman into thr universe, but it doesn't fit into the Shrek universe.Most of us who grew up with Shrek loved its hidden gems and adult jokes, especially now that we ourselves are adults.I wish they bring back the writters from the first two shrek movies to write on any related story in this specific universe. Also being back that lady who picked out songs for the Shrek movies, she is amazing at finding great fitting music.Either way it's a bit disappointing for me.", "Nice fun little animated film long live Puss!": "Did not watch the first and original Puss however over the holiday of \"Christmas\" decided to be sentimental and watch for some feel good cheer to see the adventures of a fury male cat as he tries and rules the world.! My parents are cat owners so I felt in the mood to watch this. And the scenes and mood was fun watching Puss travel and be slinky and drink milk also the film's look and cartoon like color make it likable even though it may not be \"Tom and Jerry\" still it's a watch that many adults like me enjoyed. The work and on screen chemistry is good as Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss is well done and the voice of the sexy Selma Hayek as Kitty gets anyone in a cat like mood. Good well done animated watch!", "A completely unexpected gem!": "After so many Disney disasters, i finally watched an amazing animated movie and i regret not watching it on the cinemas! At first, when i saw the trailer i thought it was yet another cash grab like so many others, trying to use a popular character to milk the fans' wallets with minimum effort in storytelling. But i was wrong! The movie had amazing action, great visuals, fun and likeable characters and an adorable merchandise opportunity! Despite a few unnecessary scenes, the movie was enjoyable and it even had some very serious moments that we don't see lately in animated movies. The villain was menacing and helped in the development of the protagonist's character development which ended up being actually really good!

The moral of the story is well.. kind of cliche, but there's so much you can do to reinvent a wheel. The way how they got to it though. Gooood stuff, really.I'm happy to see Dreamworks picking up where Disney has stumbled and fell. No politics. No propagandas. No hidden (hidden as well as hammer to the face) messages. Just lots of fun!Should you wa-YES. Definitely go watch it. I cant wait for whatever they will come up next!", "Cat of Antonio Banderas": "Like many 90's born people, I grew up with the Shrek series. I also loved the character of Puss in Boots. I gradueted school when the first Puss in Boots animation came out, but I was still excited to watch the movie. But it was a disappointment for me. At that time, I thought maybe I've grown up now and this animation doesn't interest me. I was wrong. When the second animated movie came out, I knew I would definitely watch it, but I was not very enthusiastic. I watched it today and I absolutely loved it. After the first bad movie, they did a very good and successful job. First of all, the story is good. Second, they changed the animation technique. Very successful. They tried the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse technique and it was very successful. The voiceovers were very very good and very successful. Music was very good. I really liked this second animated movie. Antonio Banderas was once again amazing.", "Dreamworks is officially back": "I'll get this out of the way first. This movie is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's great. It's creative, it's funny, it's touching, it's scary, it's mature, it's intelligent, it's entertaining for both kids AND adults, it's... A goddamn Puss in Boots The Last Wish. I think we can all agree that this is the last title anyone here can associate with top notch quality. I mean it's a sequel to a spin-off movie from over 10 years ago. A rather mediocre one at that. And yet this movie goes far and beyond ANY expectations and makes itself into probably THE best animated movie of 2022. But then again. This is coming from a studio that made Kung Fu Panda series be known as one of the finest animation series as well.But let's get to the details. First being the animation. It's gorgeous. It's amazing how well this movie looks with it's Spiderverse like animation and further proves how chasing after realizm in animated movies is at this point a fool's errand that kind of misses the point of animated movies. But it's not just a rip-off Spiderverse in looks. Oh no. When that movie looked like a comic book that came to life, this one feels like a Illustrated Fairy Tale book. The paint brush aesthetic looks great, it's colorful and feels alive. It's animated in a fantastic way and I think it's best described in saying that the fight with the Giant from the trailers is NOT the best part of this movie. Oh no. It only gets better from there. 10/10 on visuals.Now to the characters. I love pretty much all of them. Puss in Boots of course takes center stage here and his character is at it's best here in terms of depth and humor. He is cocky bastard at first, but as he loses his next to last life he quickly gets humbled and reminded of his now very apparent mortality and his character goes through great amount of growth. It's very nice to see his character evolve like it does in this movie. Another stand out I say is the Wolf who I can already tell will give several children nightmares. People that made this DO NOT hold back with how scary they make this character. He is by far the best thing in the movie from his fights, the change in mood whenever he appears and the music that accompanies him. He is definitely one of the best villains I saw in an animated movie (but I could argue if it's okay to call him one, but that would mean getting into spoilers). Other characters such as Kitty Softpaws, Goldielocks, Three Bears, Jack Horner and Perrito are all VERY fun as well. Goldie and her family are a very sweet family that go through their own journey in this and could be said they are deutragonists of this movie, I really enjoyed them, their chemistry and their sweet development. Jack Horner though... I say this. He is by far the funniest part in this movie. He is a bastard, plain and simple and he is hilarious because of it and a certain character that is alongside him for a good chunk of the movie. As for Kitty, it's very nice to see her back and her story tied with Puss is very interesting and I like how they do not linger too long on her drama with Puss and resolve it in a more real way that doesn't derail the movie in any way. And then there is Perrito who many probably thought was going to be an annoyance, but he is by far the Heart of this movie and he is involved in probably the most touching scene in the movie. You will know when you see it. All in all characters another 10. It's incredible how there are so many of them and all of them are fun and likeable in their own way.The story itself is very simple. It's a race to get the Last Wish from a fallen star. It's as Fairy Tale-ish as you can get. But the way it's executed, the way each character changes (well most of them at least) on this journey and how imaginative and creative the setups and environments are make it feel fresh and it really leaves an impact on you. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This movie deals with VERY heavy subjects such as death, mortality and appreciating one's life and acceptance of Death. It's a heavy movie in terms of themes, but it's so great to see that with it, it still is a very entertaining movie. With many clever jokes, great pacing, fantastic music (oh my God the music is GREAT in it as well. Heitor Pereira did a A+ job here) and colorful world and characters. It is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and that is something that is so good to see today. And this movie VERY well utilizes it's PG rating. Kids NEED Parental guidance in this movie, it is not a movie you put on to shut them up. You put it on because you want to show them something great, something they can have fun with, be scared of and learn from. And I think a lot of adults can sympathize with struggles characters face in this movie and laugh at the more adult jokes as well. Overall from story standpoint it's also 10/10. It's not a new story or message, but it is told in a way that makes it FEEL new and fresh and it tackles it in a mature way.As for flaws... Ehhhh... Hard for me to find really. To me it's as perfect as animated flick can get. Again PUSS IN BOOTS THE LAST WISH. God is this a weird thing to say. Maybe there are some pacing issues with Goldie's story and her family conflict being resolved quickly during climax and one character is pretty damn 1-dimensional, but I would argue it's to add to the comedy and charm of said character since that one is not meant to be seen as anything more serious. It is not one the same level of greatness as Prince of Egypt obviously, but as far as Shrek movies go or most Dreamworks movies go... or hell, most animated movies go overall it's pretty damn close to the top to me. In Shrek franchise it's on the same level as Shrek 2 to me and it's a high, HIGH praise.I have to say. I always preferred Dreamworks over Pixar. Yes, they do have FAR lower lows than the animation juggernaut, but to me they had higher highs with movies such as Prince of Egypt or Kung Fu Panda movies (and the fact that I can say Kung fu Panda series is one of the best pieces of animation is hilarious) and I found their good movies to be far more rewatchable than Pixar ones. But since then they kind of went down with quality sadly, but recently with The Bad Guys and now this movie I think it's safe to say that they are officially back and maybe better than ever. This movie I think proves how great movies from Dreamworks can be today and I think if they keep on going in this direction we may get more VERY special movies from this studio. And I wish them the best of luck on this road and for this movie to become greater and greater success, maybe even winning an Academy Award (as meaningless as that became as of late).What can I say anymore it's about 9.5 to 10/10 to me. I love it. And I think many people will love it as well. Probably not to the same degree as me, but I think this will make your day and the new year that much better. It's worth your money, it's worth your time, it's worth your attention and by all means it's worth watching more than once.", "I need more": "After The legendary Puss in boots dies. He has to live his last life. But a wishing star comes down to earth he has to make his way to it to get his lives back.This film is great. I'm not a huge shrek fan I've only seen the fist one. But after watching this I want more. The animation is stunning. And the characters are great. Especially Death. I love The character Death is outstanding I want a spin of film or tv- show. And go all out make it Pg-13 or Tv-14. It deserves its Oscar nomination it's not gonna win. The voice acting is great. I would say best dream-works film I've seen. Go watch this. A-", "Fairy Tales unite!": "Having enjoyed 'Puss in Boots' as much as I did, and being a fan of the 'Shrek' franchise, I was looking forward to this sequel.Cats supposedly have nine lives. Puss is down to his last life, and ordered by a doctor to retire. He is sent to Mama Luna to become a \"lap cat\". He befriends a dog named Perrito, who is disguised as a cat in order to get food - or rather, Perrito befriends Puss. Puss is being pursued by a mysterious wolf - a truly creepy character that might even give young kids nightmares. This is one of the most haunting animated characters I've seen. He was in my opinion also the best part about the movie - although, I must admit, everything about this movie was great!Goldilocks and the Three Bears have a new look, and they're not entirely the friendly beings we've come to know and love. They, too, are after Puss - in search of a map that could lead them to the Wishing Star. They want Puss to steal the map from antagonist Jack Horner, so they in turn can steal it from him. Kitty Softpaws from 'Puss in Boots' is back, and she, too, wants the map. And so, Puss, Kitty and Perrito go on a fun-filled, action-packed, thrilling adventure - with Goldilocks, the Three Bears, Jack Horner and the Wolf on their heals!'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish' is an imaginative film with many underlying themes, and also a very dark undertone: Death. I absolutely adored Perrito, who was blissful by simply having friends. The animation is bright and colourful. The film ends with the door wide open for another sequel, and quite honestly I can't wait. Fairy tales unite!", "unbelievably good": "I was in no way expecting a sequel to a (quite honestly) forgettable spin off movie about a Shrek side character to be this good, but yeah, this movie rocks. So much so that this is now my second favorite movie of all time, just barely falling behind Into The Spiderverse. The animation is stunning (especially the amazingly choreographed fight scences), the characters are intriguing and lovable, the subject matter is dark but handled brilliantly, and (most important to me) it's hilarious and there's very few dull moments. I've seen it around 6 times now and would recommend it to legitimately anyone.", "A Visually Stunning Sequel With A Cheerful Life Lesson": "Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (2022) Review -Puss In Boots: The Last Wish serves as a sequel to Chris Miller's spin-off Puss In Boots, which was born out of Shrek's Pandora Box. I haven't been a huge fan of the Shrek franchise except for the first film, and moreover, Miller's spin-off didn't suit me either. But now, after watching Joel Crawford's sequel, I might want to join the fan club of Puss In Boots. Sometimes a sequel exceeds expectations and sets a benchmark, and Puss in Boots 2 has done exactly that. Unlike many other animated sequels, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish comes with the promise of cinematic expansion in many aspects, be it characters, storyline, or visuals.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), who has finally started to fear something, and it's none other than 'death' (a wolf). He starts living a boring and eventless life in a cathouse. As the last hope, he goes on a journey to find the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star. Puss teams up with his old friend (girlfriend) Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and the little dog from the cathouse, Perrito (Harvey Guill\u00e9n), to restore the eight of his nine lives that he lost while escaping fellow outlaws Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who are also trying to reach the star.Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler's story has both brains and heart, while Paul Fisher, as a co-screenwriter, puts a soul into it. Practically, a film is supposed to be imaginative, especially if it's an animated feature flick. Isn't Puss in Boots 2 a perfect example of imagination with a perfect blending of life lessons? Yes, it is. You know, some netizens say that DreamWorks is cracking the Pixar formula in their own style. I guess it's true. An adventure drama with emotions and a beautiful message indicates so. I should give credit to the writers and screenwriters for enhancing the viewing experience with their skills. They say half the battle is won on paper; here is the reason why they say it. There is something for everyone of all age groups, which doesn't happen with every animation film you know.The big voice cast of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Pinault, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Anthony Mendez is sweet with outcomes and different dialects. That's one of the easiest jobs in the world of animation, but it has to be done carefully. Some characters are too sweet here, which is unacceptable, but of course, how can someone hate the positivity? Even if it's too difficult to believe. Nevertheless, there is a message behind it, and it's not that intricate to understand. You are gonna enjoy that process and the results that follow.DreamWorks almost hit a hundred dollar budget for the sequel that was late for its generation of audience, leaving everyone worried about the profits. Well, I must say, they spent where it was due. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the most stunning visual spectacles ever produced by DreamWorks Animation for under $100 million. The action sequences are breathtaking, and the 3D effects are marvelous. Animation doesn't really require 3D viewing unless you have something special to show. Here, you have that something special coming in the first 10 minutes only. Also, the middle and climax portions of the film are visually gorgeous.I wished for a better use of the background score, which remained average. The editing is misjudged in the first half but pretty smooth in the latter half of the film. Joel Crawford is just 5 years old as a director with 3 films in his kitty, and Puss in Boots 2 suddenly takes him to the next level. This is, by far, his best work till date, and I am excited to see how \"far far away\" he goes in the future. As a whole, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a perfect family film for the holiday period; however, Indians have to see it almost a month later. Does it really matter as long as you are spending the money on something that is worth it?RATING - 7/10*", "What the heck": "After the release of the first movie, the bar was set pretty low for the second. I came into the movie expecting some comedic and slightly cringe kids movie that I would enjoy by criticizing it with my mates. I was wrong. Very wrong.Probably a common phrase but I'll say it anyway. It was never meant to hit this hard.With the re-introduction of Puss in this movie, you can already notice the change in animation style. It's almost as if a scene from The Spiderverse was painted in watercolor and pasted into this. Personally, this definitely made action sequences better.Oh and the characters. This movie managed to flesh out 7 different characters (the bear family combined to 1), each with their own individual arcs, and in a way so that you end up rooting for every single character in this movie (arguably excluding the big man). I mainly love Puss's character arc, as we see him from the lowest point in his life and how he overcomes his fears.The concept of death in a kids movie was shocking. It ended up becoming the strongest concept this movie is built upon, and I applaud them for presenting this concept to kids.What are you waiting for?? Go watch it with your kids or your friends or your family, whatever. This is truly an amazing film that should be shared with others too.", "Just right": "If you wanna have an absolute mesmerizing cinematographic experience, then I only have one advice for you: go to your local theater and watch Puss in Boots the last wish.Although there is no such thing as a perfect movie, this one does get really really close to perfection.Firstly, the appearance. The designs and the animation make the movie a real pleasure for the eyes. The colors are vibrants, the texture looks like a painting it's just so beautiful.Secondly, the story.. it's basically a quest, and is pretty simple in a way, which leave more places for the characters to be developed and have their own journeys, both externally and internally. The movie isn't afraid of mature themes, such as the fear of death, the inability of trusting someone or even animal abuse.Thirdly, the characters. They're all are so deep and well-written. Having only one life left, Puss isn't as reckless as he used to be and become less a legend, and more of a real character. Perrito could've been annoying, but he's just adorable. Kitty soft paws is like in the 1st movie, but better. And her relationship with Puss is much better too, coming from resentment to acceptation and maybe even more.Goldilocks and the three bears are basically another groups of heroes, even if in this movie they're antagonists because what they want go against what the hero wants. But they're in no way villains. Just a great, funny and moving family (seriously i cried at some point during one of their scenes).Jack Horner is the perfect incarnation of a villain we love to hate. He's absolutely awful, in a great villainous way. The movie doesn't shy away from his cruelty, it's not trying to give him excuses or a sad back story. Quite the opposite actually. Jack Horner was a spoiled brat who turned into an entitled man with no regards for anyone's life whatsoever.And the Wolf is just so terrifying and charismatic. Although not exactly a villain, he is the biggest threat to Puss in Boots specifically towards the whole movie.I could say much more about what makes this movie so great but I really don't wanna spoiled it. I only have one advice for you, go to your local cinema and WATCH IT.", "This is a masterpiece of a movie": "Yes, puss in boots: the last wish is genuinely an outrageously good movie. Visually stunning, great characters, tense, good progression, funny, witty, great writing, this movie has it all.From the opening scene you can see how gorgeous the visuals are, and when the plot picks up after the opening scene, it's a fun ride from beginning to end. The villains are all good and have their place, all the main heroes work well too. The music is also really good.10/10 movie, one of the best movies I've ever seen. Must watch for anyone who likes animation, and frankly anyone else too. It's that good.", "Is Puss Down To His Last Life?!": "In the film, the doctor says that the titular character has in the coming on down to his very last life. And how he has in the eight lives there, caught a big break.But Puss in Boots in total fashion does not care if he dies and denies it. He later goes to a home for retired cats as an unnamed dog pretending to be a cat comes into his life though Puss does not want to have anything to do with the dog.Selma Hayek's character Kitty comes in as she has a bitter feud with Puss and you will find out why. With others from the fairy tales trying to go to the one destination as Puss wants to restore over on his nine lives. Like in the Three Bears and Goldilocks who is the leader and not a timid young girl. But an action girl.Along with Little Jack Horner among in the trying to get the Last Wish hence the title to the sequel to renew over on their fortunes. In another story, while Puss tries to escape death in form as in the Grim Reaper like in a wolf as Puss seems to be no match for Death there. Or is he?!Stay for the ending there as it is touching.", "Single-handedly restored my faith in Dreamworks and my respect for the Shrek franchise": "The last movie came out when I was a kid. I thought it was really fun, but it didn't strike me as a masterpiece the way other movies of the time did. It just felt like a nice little movie to kill some time.Now that I'm older, I can see that it came out after Shrek the third and Shrek forever after, and it just feels like yet another mediocre (mediogre) movie for children with not as much artistic merit as other Dreamworks titles. It's a fine movie. It's fine.For that reason, I was expecting nothing out of this one. I saw that it was coming out and my attitude was completely \"Meh\".Then, it actually came out, and it started getting good reviews. I was very surprised. What could they have done with this franchise to make so many people suddenly like it again?And then I watched it. Oh boy.It's so far from the previous three movies that it might as well be from an alternate universe.There are so many aspects of the film I could talk about, but for me the main ones are the animation and the story.The animation is top notch. It's clearly inspired by Spiderverse, but it's far form a straight ripoff. It feels vibrant and full of life and it lends itself extremely well to the fast-paced adventure style of the story.Speaking of which, it's amazing how good the story is. At its core it's very simplistic, like all Shrek movies. There's a wishing star somewhere and several different parties are interested in getting to it. That's it.But seeing the motivations of the characters for getting the wish is so fun and interesting.The main one, obviously, is Puss in Boots himself. He's down to the last of his nine lives, so now he wants to use the wish to get his lives back, so he can continue being a reckless, adventurous, fearless hero.His relationship with death, both literally, and metaphorically, makes this one of the most earnest movies in the Dreamworks catalogue.The other characters don't get nearly as much focus, which is the right call. Side-characters in animated movies tend to be annoying, but this one doesn't fall into that trap. All characters feel perfectly balanced, which is a massive feat in a movie that has so many of them.The acting is also amazing. Every character that has screentime in this movie is fun and entertaining to watch, and the main characters are emotionally investing and relatable.Overall, a refreshing restart to Dreamworks' oldest franchise. It single-handedly shattered my expectations and made me feel genuinely excited to see what they do next.", "Missing Shrek": "Shrek was brilliant , it was a classic fairytale story .Puss in boots on his ninth life seems to just plagiarise classic fairytales and mash them up with some great animation but it's missing a decent scriptOpportunities let's make lots of money sang the Pet shop boys and this just seems like a money making exercise . It is of course the movie business and that's what it's really all about but as an audience you feel short changed .Nothing felt original .If you're going to make a spin off try doing one with Eddie murphy as the donkey he was the star of original film - maybe a romance with the dragon ?Sorry just didn't entertain me4/10 Pad. A.", "10 out of 10 stars because there really is nothing that could be improved upon": "One of the best films of the year, one of the best animated films of the last several years, and a welcome and unexpected enthralling return to the world of stories of Dreamworks Far Far Away. Myself, my wife and my teenage daughter actually had the good luck to see this a month ago, right after Thanksgiving, but I forgot to review it. The story is complex, both structurally and philosophically. It brings in some surprising darkness into the Puss in Boots/Shrek film world while keeping it grounded in its imaginative, kid-friendly exploration of fairy tale legends. It never feels redundant to the previous films or a rehash of what the characters did before. It explores real character growth. At the end, I was really excited by the idea of a 5th Shrek film and what this kind of complexity could do for one. I was going to rate this 9 out of 10, but I realized I couldn't think of any way it could be improved upon, so there's no reason why it shouldn't be 10/10. I hope it makes enough money to encourage a new Shrek film.", "I legit can't put into words how much I love this movie": "To me this is when you just look at the movie itself the best animated movie ever created.It is such a simple story, but that does not have to be bad EVERYTHING else is just completely perfect!It's funny, it's beautiful animated, the music slaps, both villains are some of the funniest and one of the scariest ever seen in animation, it's emotional at times has a good moral about mortality.It may not be as well researched or thought out as Pixar pre 2016 with cultural history and such, but it does so much more with so much less and that's what makes this movie a 10/10 for me and my favorite animated movie.", "A really good film.": "Is movie was shot in 3D and it was an enjoyable show on several levels. The story is superior to previous Dreamworks movies and is even superior to the shreck movies. And the advantage is in the adult plot where very unusual elements appear in animated films such as death, redemption, love and payment for karma and the advantage of being naive at some moments in life. The characters that appear do not have much previous history and that ultimately helps the dynamism but also leaves holes in the story. There are characters that are not very appropriate for children, but the children of today are different from those of our time. It is a great animated film, recommended.", "Filled With Feeling": "First Impressions:An emotion-driven action-adventure based on one of the most popular fairy tale characters ever written, \"The Last Wish\" was packed with seamless storytelling value and one of the most relevant messages conveyed through the medium of animation.The Crew:Directors: Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado\nStory & Screenplay: Tommy Swerdlow, Tom Wheeler, and Paul Fisher\nMusical Scoring: Heitor PereiraThe Voice Cast:Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots\nSalma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws\nHarvey Guill\u00e9n as Perrito\nFlorence Pugh as Goldilocks\nOlivia Colman as Mama Bear\nRay Winstone as Papa Bear\nSamson Kayo as Baby Bear\nJohn Mulaney as Jack Horner\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph as Mama Luna\nBernardo De Paula as the Governor\nWagner Moura as the wolf symbolizing DeathPlot Analysis:So much value and meaning was packed into this animation feature, which was technically a \"Shrek\" spinoff. The story came full circle near the end with Puss, Kitty, and Perrito off to see an \"old friend\".\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" re-imagined several popular characters like Jack Horner - the boy from the \"Little Jack Horner\" nursery rhyme who put his thumb in a Christmas pie and pulled out a plum - and Goldilocks and the Three Bears. These re-characterizations were elegant and flawless.The idea of Puss marrying Kitty held immense merit, especially when see in the context of \"The Last Wish\". On a related note, every interaction with the wolf that symbolized Death was a lesson in enriched storytelling.The musical scoring and animation teams did brilliant work in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\". They made the movie feel profound and great for both adults and kids alike. Nothing less than excellence came from their respective departments.Writing and direction were a 'make or break' factor in this movie. They certainly made it. As for the voice cast, they delivered on every count.This tale saw Puss coming to terms with the fact that he was getting older and may not live forever. In keeping with the spirit of his character, he was down to his last life (the ninth). This plot-element added great tension in \"The Last Wish\" and made the motivations of every character in it seem relevant and credible.Final Notes:The idea behind the \"star light, star bright\" wish was amazing. I couldn't guess how things would pan out with Puss in relation to the titular last wish.I admired how the team kept things simple and relatable. They focused more on emotion rather than just high-octane action, which received its fair share of attention in the movie anyway.\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" set the stage for a major continuation of the \"Shrek\" franchise. It also delivered a high standard in animation-movie storytelling.", "One of DreamWorks best - I am stunned.

How is it that a decade later a sequel to a spin-off is one of the sharpest, most thoughtful, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year?Undoubtedly one of DreamWorks' best. The writing is brilliant. No second is wasted on this beautiful animation that is much like the Spiderverse. The voice acting was superb! Banderas and Hayek are perfect. Pugh as Goldilocks nearly killed me. All of the cast was great.This film is quirky, witty, full of heart, and again genuinely funny. It manages to juggle many interesting and memorable characters.

They took out things that made the first one brilliant and everything moves at a pace of tremendous pace which means you don't get to know the characters and the speed is uncomfortable to watch.The animation style was change and I think this new company really destroyed that which made the first one so good.The story wasn't really something I could relate to either, it was detached from its true meaning and that kind of sums up the whole movie, discombobulated and lacking true meaning all of which the first movie had bucket loads of.", "surprisingly good and very stylish": "The only reason i've seen this was because my children wanted to go. So i agreed. I didn't expect something good since most sequels are inferior to their predecessors and the first movie wasn't that great to begin with.

Even though its rendered it has a certain style to it that most visible in action scenes. But even in normal scenes it looks like a mix of rendering and painting. So visually there was nothing to complain. Almost perfect.The story was also pretty good. It was completely free of woke elements and in its core it did focus on friendship and family. And it also had a real evil villain. There was even some great character development. Everything about the movie felt good. The best animation movie this year!", "One of the best surprises of the end of 2022": "Undoubtedly one of the most interesting works of the end of 2022, the film of Joel Crawford It is exquisite in too many ways, starting with the visuals of the film, the sets are extremely beautiful and manage to convey a typically Spanish experience in 1470 to 1500, The Character design They are extremely well done, especially the portrayal of Goldilocks and the Big Bad Wolf, with this character stealing the show with every appearance he made. But the animation, oh my amigo, The animation in this film is intoxicating, it is immaculate and AWESOME, I don't mind saying that in many moments of the film I let go of the experience and just thought of myself contemplating the beautiful animation,It is visible that with each film DreamWorks improves its animation style even more. The Sonography of the film, well it exists, is far from being impressive and incredible but it works, And the songs in general only serve to have a little noise playing in the background of the scenes, except for one, I don't want to spoil it here, but when you watch it or if you've already watched it, you know it well What am I talking about, that hiss is just terrifying. The script Paul Fisher & Tommy Swerdlow It's good, he manages to read and hold and is very effective in the emotional moments, The mcguffin of the film, he is interesting and causes very memorable scenes with the protagonist and the antagonist wanting to catch him, the film also has a greater maturity of our protagonist and it's quite rewarding to see him change throughout the film in an organic way, but in particular one of the best scenes in the film is the combat at the end, which is without a joke one of the best action scenes that I've already seen it, it's incredible and our villain, the big bad wolf without wanting to give away the gold at the end, is one of the best animation villains in a good 5 years. It's amazing. If you haven't watched this movie yet, I highly recommend you, you won't regret it I promise.", "A bit too dark and scary for a \"kids\" movie": "I'm glad I *didn't* take my younger kids to see this. I would not recommend this film for young children.The big bad wolf appearing throughout the film is quite a dark/scary character, combined with the overall themes around death.The other 'bad guy' characters (Jack Horner, Goldilocks and The Three Bears) are quite sinister in parts.There are several jump-scare moments, suspenseful scenes and fight scenes with dramatic SFX.There is some humour to offset the darkness, but this is definitely not the bright and happy comedy movie you'd expect from the Dreamworks / fairytale / Shrek spin-off franchise.", "Much much better than you'd expect.": "Let's start by saying saying this film is better than it has any right to be. Seriously, it's excellent. Aaaand if you want to leave it at that, feel free, because below is going to get into the nit picks.Alright, now we're set up for some criticism, the opening sequence isn't great, it's not bad, but it let's the rest of the movie down and lulls you into a \"oh no it's gonna be one of THESE dreamworks movies\" kinda moods. Thankfully that's kicked into touch within 5 mins or so and the story begins proper.Without spoiling, the wolf design is superb, equal parts menacing and beautiful, modelled and animated with a passion that doesn't come across in too many other characters.Speaking of the animation.... it's... well, not to my taste. Substantially deviates from the original style and leans more into modern anime for the \"exciting\" scenes (fights and what not), which while interesting to watch, does lead to an odd deformed cell shaded look perhaps more often than i'd like. Certainly not up to the standard Dreamworks put on show in the 1st film.And now the 1st films been mentioned, yes, some time has passed but the 2 main returning cast both sound like they've been smoking 40 a day since then, which is unfortunate if you watch these back to back as it's a little jarring.Oh and you might have to look up who the hell Tom Thumb is, because that isn't prevalent in the UK amongst my generation.In any case, minor niggles aside, it's excellent and fully deserving of all the praise heaped on it. Best animated film i've seen for years. 9/10.", "Hey Disney! See how to it is done.": "Better than the first one, I went to watch it three times with different people and it keeps getting better. Why? Because the story is deeper than it seems. The humor is quite irresistible. The animation is gorgeous. I was starting to think that computer animated films were something of the past but it is more that Disney/Pixar are exhausted and there is still space for good stories and original animation. And there is no preaching. You don't feel you are in a reeducation camp. Still there is a strong and uplifting message. I guess it is how you do it Disney! Puss aside, my favorite character was Jack Horner, who is ultra weird and super funny at the same time.", "Awesome animation and moral message": "The level of animation absolutely blew me away! Wow! Seriously, this might be the best animated movie I've seen so far. Incredibly detailed, well visualized scenes, rich of colour and effect.Also, I was amazed by the great moral message that this movie delivered to us. The personification of Death is awesome, with him having nailed pretty much each line. I really enjoyed watching him. In my opnion, this was something meant for only adults to understand. The fact that wasting your life is bad and that you do have to move on. Bonus point for the doctor in the movie who said \"Death comes for us all\", which was a very smart foreshadowing.Must see!", "\"Now\", the year starts.": "Ok, so its better than every Disney movie ever made with the exception of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast,Lion King, Alladin and Dumbo. Its better than Afro Samurai. If I wasn't such a Sonic fanatic, it would possibly be better than both of them. I guess I have to thank Avatar 2 because I needed something to wash the 7/10 taste out of my mouth and boy oh boy did this film @*!#@ deliver. Imagine a film that captures the feeling of the best parts of FF7 (the original) when you played it for the very first time. Imagine film that treats you like a person instead of a complete idiot like most films do. Imagine a film that respects your childhood, similarly I guess to Shrek, but with no cheating this time. I'm blown away completely. Its a 10/10 from me. This is probably Antonio Banderas, best role since Desperado. Thank you DreamWorks - 2023 officially has a great film.", "Puss in Boots : The Last Wish 2023": "As of today 06/02/2023 in the UK 20:47, i wanted to leave my honest review of the movie.Let's start off with general feeling : I have cried at least 4 times during the movie and have been heart touched by many scenes, Goldie and the 3 bears, Kitty making a return to, Shrek reference apperance 2 times.Why 10/10 : It has meet my expectations after many years of waiting for a shrek 5 or in boots 2. It finally has happened and I don't care what anybody else thinks. I generally loved the movie enough; it has made a place in my heart in top 5 favorite movies of all time. I have gotten a reference to Shrek, possibly 5, which made me very emotional. Changing and being different for the better. New companions, new friendships. The legendary Team of 3.Why no 0 stars. I didn't see anything that would make me bored for a moment or hate seeing it or disliking. I found everything truly perfect and i am soo happy what dreamworks has made.", "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Review": "One of Dreamworks best movies and honestly one of my favorite animated films of all time. The Last Wish is just amazing all around and I'm really happy now that more stylized animation is being used by other studios in a really cool way. This movie was one of the last movies that I thought was going to be really good but I'm very happy that it went above and beyond what I thought it was going to be. The story is pretty cliche and generic yes but it's everything around the story that makes this film so good. The animation is incredibly. The Spider-Verse style works very well for this film and it still stands out from Spider-Verse in its own unique way. The characters and their own respective arcs are great. There really isn't one weak character here. Puss himself gets some excellent development and his journey of grabbing with the concept of death is very emotional and well written. Kitty Softpaws also has a really good arc and chemistry with Puss and Perrito has some really great moments. All of the villains here are great. Goldilocks and the 3 bears all have a good arc and Jack Horner is one of the funniest characters ever included in an animated film and works amazingly well as the irredeemable villain but the real standout here is Death. Death is probably one of if not the best Dreamworks villain. To have Death be personified and built up the way it is in the film is just something else. His interactions with Puss were always amazing. The humor was great as well. Pretty much every joke from Jack landed and all the other jokes were really great as well. Everyone involved with this film felt like they really cared about the characters and the story and that's what makes the film so great. I would highly recommend checking this film out as it's genuinely one of the best films of 2022 and one of the best animated movies ever.", "Sadly they changed animation...": "The first thing I noticed was how they had changed the animation. I guess some people like it. But the choppy and poorly detailed animation style made famous by into the spider verse has made its mark. But there is quality here too visually.The annoying part: it's a bit too jokey. I know it's a kids movie but it doesn't need to be a joke like you snap a finger. The dog? He's too annoying and over the top. I guess for contrast.... So that's the bad part.The good part? Wonderful voice acting through and through. Great soundtrack and the best of all, a great villain! They spared no expense making the antagonist in this movie.Antonio Banderas is a legend! He is.... Puss in boots!", "\ud83c\udf87 This is 1 of the Greatest Animated Movies I've Ever Seen \ud83d\ude38": "This is a Movie that has a Very Strong Case for Being in that List of Best Animated Movies Ever Created. Years Down the Line, I think it Will Enter that List.Why This Movie works NOT only just Good, but Great -1. Every Scene in this Movie is INTERESTING. There's no Time Wasting in this Movie, There's no Fat in this Movie.2. The Different Fairytales, Myths and Metaphorical Sayings and Figures are Written in and EXECUTED So well.3. All of The Characters, Both Main and Side Characters Work in this Movie.4. It all Comes Together in this Magical Adventure of the \"Map\".

So many talented voice actors: Salma Hayek, John Mulaney, Florence Pugh to name a few and, of course, Puss In Boots himself, Antonio Banderas.In the beginning, Puss was the ultimate hero, not caring for himself or anyone else. Over time, he changes.John Mulaney is the uber-villain, Big Jack Horner. Florence Pugh voices Goldilocks who is part of a small band of thieves including Mama, Papa and Baby Bear. Salma Hayek reprises her role as Kitty Softpaws. Perrito is a heartwarming little dog.The journey they embark on is an amazing one. Not only meeting Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the evil Big Jack Horner but also a cricket who functions as a conscience and sounds like Jimmy Stewart.The animation is wonderful, similar to The Bad Guys.Most enjoyable!", "Many cool characters and great ending.": "I really loved the characters, side characters, plots, adventure, the many competitions. The animations. Plot progression and timing. I liked the fairy tale and story links. I really liked to see how the main character learned and grew and learned from the past. The movie was perfect in some ways.The main character, the cat, learned and grew so much and realized his mistakes and changed. I learned a lot from it.I want to see the movie again. I loved the visuals of the animations too.The main character was annoying at first but that was the point. To see him progress and change. Great movies.", "Great movie and AMAZING VILLAIN": "Finally a return of a good animated movie that pleases both kids and parents.But that VILLAIN! (The wolf one)... WOW. Amazing style, voice and atmosphere. It really feels like everything fell into place creating him, haven't enjoyed a proper \"villain\" in a long time and he really filled all the boxes.Had to get used to the animated style on the first minutes but greatly enjoyed it afterwards. Catchy music and side characters with heart and purpose.Great movie and props to the entire team. A breath of fresh air. It can stand pround next to the other highrunners you have created over the years. Keep it up!", "I can boldly say that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of those works that managed to appear better than its first version.": "Puss in Boots tells a story that you don't need to be a thirty-two-year-old like me and have seen all of Shrek to understand. This animation is an independent film and tells its own story.The story intended for the new adventure of Puss in Boots is not a clich\u00e9 story and introduces us to new characters, the flagship of which is the character of the wolf.The wolf enters the story just as we have seen a long sequence of Puss in Boots' bravery and skilful battle with a gigantic giant minutes before its imposing and terrifying appearance. The hero's fear of this newly arrived negative character and the soundtrack that is played during the entrance of the wolf have joined hands to introduce this completely new character to us in a twenty-something-year-old franchise. He is a character that the hero is afraid of and is actually a personification of death.Dealing with the category of \"death\" in an animation is a difficult task, and we can safely say that a studio like Pixar has been able to enter this issue with great skill. Works like Coco and Soul beautifully displayed the phenomenon of death and scrutinized it. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, however, the issue comes back to the \"fear of death\". Puss in Boots is now afraid of death and no longer jumps into the water.The rhythm and tempo of the Puss in Boots 2 animation goes so that we can see an additional scene in the least moment. The makers took advantage of the second-by-second visuals they provided, and many of their jokes and comedies are hidden in the background of the sequences. In this case, it can be claimed that in many action scenes, the audience should pay attention to the image and understand several things at the same time, and this issue makes the audience have a good sense of the animation.\"But the best feature of Puss in Boots 2 animation, in my opinion, I can boldly say that it is one of those works that was able to appear better than its first version. This improvement is clearly visible both in terms of the story and screenplay, and in terms of character development. And the characters we meet during the animation.", "Your fulfillment in life is what you make of it": "Rating: 7.4A fun beautifully animated film about what really makes a life worth living. The way they illustrated the fear of death in Puss whenever Lobo showed up was masterfully done. Everyone's characters and outlooks on life seamlessly connected to each other whether it was softpaws cynicism to Perro's optimism or Jack Horners sociopathy to Goldilocks empathy it sends an an positive message to children without being preachy or cringe. The concept of puss losing 8 lives because of the myth that cats have 9 lives was interesting and creative premise. The ending was a bit sappy and some of the comedy was a little heavy handed but this is a good short watch.", "Appreciate Today": "This movie was absolutely fantastic!Start to end I loved every scene of it ! Yes there were the odd few instances it didn't need to be as long in a scene but there are so few !!The character development of SO many and none of them felt rushed at all, the animation was so good and dropping the frame rate for the fights was such a good idea because it worked so well.I think of course puss had the best story, needing to change from a self centred show off to an open and more humble character is such a great journey.Perrito was great, the voice of reason and the voice of appreciation. Possibly one of the most heartbreaking backstories created such a lovable character and in sheer comparison our villain who had a perfect upbringing and yet turned into a disgusting pig man.I could highlight each character and their strengths but Wolf the bounty hunter oh my god, I can't get over such a well written character, the movie used him in all the right moments and sparingly, it worked, it worked really well, his theme song gave me chills, his lines were so well written, BravoI really really loved this movie, Dreamwork did a fantastic job !!!!", "solid 6": "Puss in boots: The last wish is a solid 7 for me. It is nice to watch overall and good family movie but\ni think they could have done better with it\nthe first half of the movie is poorly written for me and\nless interesting to keep up to. Also didn't enjoy the\npink haired guy villian..he didn't give any emotion at all not good as villian and overall character plot was boring. Also new dreamworks intro was turnoff for me.Also i don't get why they changed old animation it was more realistic and smooth to watch. New one isn't bad either but i personally think old one fit better. The wolf arc was good.", "Great for Family": "It is rare to find a sequel that is just as good as the original, but this one pulled it off.What a great show to take the family to. It was so refreshing to see a movie aimed at children that just told a good story and didnt needlessly force an agenda (that is far above their heads and the age rating) that has nothing to do with with the story into it like Disney and Pixar does now on every release. I dont even know any parents that are comfortable letting their children watch Disnar movies anymore without watching them first, and that is beyond sad.Take notes Disney and Pixar, since you obviously have no clue anymore, but this is the good enjoyable entertainment that families want to see.", "For us millennials, this is now one of the classics": "What a story. What a villain. What an experience. 4chan recommended this movie and boy am I glad I saw it. I haven't seen such an amazing, bone-chilling villain in such a long time. What an emotional story that has such cuteness overload and heartbreak intertwined perfectly. This is a must watch movie. Dreamworld hit it out of the park with this one.I only saw shrek 1 and 2 which I absolutely adore. This movie has an awesome message even if the laughs aren't as good. The story of an adventurer facing retirement. It's a story that brings some Don Quixote vibes but also resonates with what I imagine old people feel as society tells them to stop living life and go to nursing homes.Definitely going to see this movie again.", "I must have watched a different movie from everyone else": "The overwhelming positive reviews tell me one of three things: 1) There is a secret, better version of this film that I didn't watch, 2) Dreamworks paid for hundreds of bot reviews, or 3) most people's bar for American animated films is so low it might as well be in the ground. Suffice it to say, this movie absolutely did not live up to the hype. Puss in Boots 2 is not only NOT as amazing as everyone is saying it is, is actually a pretty bad movie. Mediocre at best. If you love animated movies then go watch one of the movies that made you fall in the love with the medium again. This movie does not deserve your money. Watched on December 27, 2022.", "This film has no right to be good.": "Puss in boots: the last wish has no right to be this level of good. I entered the theater with low expectations. And I came out and was completely overwhelmed by this masterpiece.And honestly, I thought they would ruin him but no absolutely not I was so wrong. We still have the good old jokes and even the animation+style isn't bad at all, I like the new style. Plus seeing Shrek, Donkey, and all the other members back, it's awesome to see that again. If we talk about villains I can only say they all made a great performance on screen. My absolute favorite easily and I just wish he was just the only main villain, the Big Bad Wolf this character with his voice and his whistling gives chills on a different level and makes him one of the best characters and villains. His personality is extremely cold and also treacherous for little kids, maybe a bit too much. But I am so happy they made him a terrifying villain, I mean Dreamworks just knows how to make good villains. The story was also amazing it shows that even the fearless hero has his fears which is in this case the big bad wolf (he's a bit more than that but I don't wanna spoil too much) Even with all the angst this movie gives us some life lessons, for example, Puss likes himself he praises being a hero and cares less about others which can be quite problematic as we noticed. We saw many great moments such as a bit of action and course many jokes and a big adventure. This film truly is the definition of worth the wait, and I can't help but admire the direction these animated studios are heading (especially Sony animation picture and DreamWorks) to be more creator-oriented like Ghibli films and show the touch of the artist in Spiderverse 2018 and Arcane. I was extremely surprised and ended up with a new favorite movie in 2022. I can recommend this movie to everyone it may don't look like much at first but it's greater than you think. Also Perrito, I need a perrito in my life, I reallly do. 8/10.", "Why 9/10 for Puss and Boots 2022.": "First off, marry Christmas or Xmas to everyone on this long awaited project. My verdict for this movie is 9 out of 10, I felt that there was no indication on if we are going to have a Trilogy (Highly needed). I stayed in the theater hoping for a hint (Perhaps in my own view while there), but as far as entertainment concerned, thank you DreamWorks for making smile on Christmas, God bless.Moving onto the plot, well written I'd say, from the introduction all the way to the conclusion of the film, it kept me on the edges of my chair, but I started to really pay attention on the development. Lot's of villain to enjoy, good vibes between Puss and his new friend, fun fun fun.This is a great franchise and I highly recommend seeing this magnificent art, thank you.", "Familiar and enjoyable!": "'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish' follows the titular tabby cat, Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas), on a quest to find a shooting star and make a wish. After losing his eigth life, Puss decides he wants to use the wish to regain his lost lives, becomes haunted by the Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), hounded by Goldi (voiced by Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (voiced by Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo, respectively), and hunted by Jack Horner (voiced by John Mulaney). With the help of Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek) and Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillen), can Puss reach the star and make his wish before his last life is over?Firstly, the script and voice acting is amazing! The film feels much like the Puss in Boots (2011) and the series, The Adventures of Puss in Boots (2015-18), in that there is more action and wise cracking jokes. The animation, however, looks more like the series rather than the Shrek (2001) franchise; more comic book 'Miles Morales' style over fluid animation.Secondly, due to the number of antagonists in the film, it does feel a bit convoluted. Each of the bad guys is explained, but could easily have been featured in their own films. That being said, the movie was enjoyable and comes to a logical conclusion in the end.Worth a watch!", "What's all the hype about??": "This movie was not nearly as great as all these reviews are saying. Maybe I just got my hopes too high by reading IMDb? But this was so much action and not that much character development, it just seemed like other overly hyper kids movies. I don't understand why everyone loved it so much. The perrito dog was cute but not that great of a voice actor or cute of animation. Jack Horner was like a pie loving Wilson Fisk. Maybe it's that a 4 & 6 yr old were too young? It had it's dark parts but that's not what made it bad. It was mostly the predictability of it all. I think I'd rather just watch Shrek (1 or 2) or How To Train Your Dragon (1 or 2) again. And if I'm gonna scare my kids let's just watch Into the Spiderverse.", "Really enjoyable": "Great voice acting, animation every character is quirky, distinguished and likable like puss'es beard. Surprisingly villain was very likable too, action sequences are well done and flows.It would be great if we get to see some old characters but not complaining.And for some reason I have to write an essay of 600 words to review which seems dumb and it might also discourage many people wo write reviews this long because no one wants to write review this long.But I really appreciate people who come here and write a review and making helpful for all of us.How is this still not 600 words??", "Favorite animated movie of 2022 !": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.When Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll and he has burned through eight of his nine lives, he launches an epic journey to restore them by finding the mythical Last Wish.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is definitely my favorite animated movie of 2022 at least for the moment .It was a fun ride, with the hilarious Puss and all the other cute characters, not all of them were, I remembered the wolf and I got goosebumps too...It was also colorful with some good music and visuals ...\nIt's always great to hear some familiar voices, Antonio Banderas ,Salma Hayek ,Florence Pugh and Olivia Coleman...", "Pure entertainment that dared a little": "Road to the Oscars 2023. This movie is nominated for 1 award and it\u00b4s best animated feature. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, and it lives up to the expectations. It\u00b4s a fun, well animated adventure movie that really blurs the line between kids and adult animation. This twist took me by surprise, but it worked so well for the movie and gave it it\u00b4s own identity. Overall, I was entertained from start to finish and that\u00b4s all you can ask for.After dying once again, it dawns on Puss in Boots his down to his last life out of his 9. After learning an assassin is after him, Puss goes into retirement, but is also forced out of that. He learns about a map to a wising star, where he\u00b4ll wish back his 9 lives.The blend of adult and kid humor and adult topics and kid script. Surprised me positively but it also was a bit too much towards the end. The script can be over explaining and full of clich\u00e9 lines and tropes, but it didn't bother me too much. I was more surprised when I saw blood in this movie, when characters swore and it was bleeped, when a heavy topic like death is brought up with no metaphor or anything. The movie blurred the line between adult and kids' animation and it did it masterfully to really subvert the tropes and expectations you go into a movie like this with.The animation at display is incredible. The animation is so fluent, colorful, and vibrant. It\u00b4s a beautiful display of artistry and the different shifting set pieces shows immense control and creativity. The action with missing in-between frames has been compared to Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse (2018) and I see why. It has this choppy feeling to it that looks cool and reminds you of old school action cartoons where impact lands so well. The action in general is incredible really highlighted by the animation styles, the clash of styles and the phenomenal camera work.This is a great cast of characters, and everyone seemed to have a fun purpose. From heroes to villains, every character seemed to have their own character and felt so distinct and belonging in their own way. The voice cast is also great, and everyone is doing such a good job. I really liked John Mulaneys performance as he brought so much humor to his role. I thought Puss was a bit annoying and repetitive in the beginning, but you quickly forget that as the movie goes on. I also had a few issues with Perrito. I think he was supposed to come off rendering but ended up being a bit too clueless for me. He did, luckily, not hit minion levels of annoyingness, and his addition to the story worked for me.In general, the villain lineup is phenomenal. There are 3 villain entities and they all fee distinct and add their own flair. Goldilocks and the bears are a fun crime family, and their dynamic is so endearing. Jack Horner is the one with the least meat, but the one with the best humor and the most creative arsenal of magical items from all the fairy tales. And best of all, the wolf. Having a villain that is borderline horror is incredible to see, and the character feels so omnipresent and intimidating. It\u00b4s an incredible character and the action scenes involving him is incredible.The display of creativity here is incredible and is what makes the movie stand out. The weapons, the action choreography, the wishing star land that shifts with the holder. It\u00b4s all so well thought out yet leaves so many surprises.I mentioned the phenomenal action at display and it\u00b4s also frequent. The last action scene is of course the culmination in many ways, but earlier fights also feel like they stand on their own.It\u00b4s been a while since I saw a simple adventure movie. It\u00b4s one of those movies where the universe, action, and characters carry everything and while not a high art movie it\u00b4s one of those just pure adrenaline entertainment movies that are just fun and impactful from start to finish.What really makes the movie stick out is that it dared. It dared to have adult humor, it dared to talk about death and the fear of it, it dared to show blood, all this really subverted everything and as I\u00b4ve talked about before, animation that dares to challenge kids is on the rise. It\u00b4s a tough thing to see characters really get hurt, to hear they might die, but it\u00b4s important to talk about and using a movie that both adults and kids can understand, enjoy and talk from can be so important.Puss in Boots: The last wish is so good and that\u00b4s so weird, it coming from a now memed to death franchise. Seeing what came from this universe is insane and it might be one of the strongest dreamworks movies I have seen. It has heart, it has action, it has incredible animation and most importantly it dared to really tell an impactful story. This is an adventure movie I will return to no doubt.Oscar predictions: This movie is up against heavy hitters this year. It\u00b4s my personal favorite of the 4 out of 5 nominated I have seen, but I think it\u00b4s up against to stiff of a competition to win. From a pure animation quality standpoint, I see this as the potential candidate for winning. The academy has snubbed stop motion before. But Del Toros is an Academy darling, and the other heavy hitter is a Pixar movie that is a company with many wins associated with it. If it wins I would be happy, and I think it has a shot as it is in the top 3 no doubt, but I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s the academies number 1.", "A Whisker-Raising Adventure": "The movie had no right to go this hard. DreamWorks outdid themselves by raising the bar here, showing the other animation companies how to get things done. This film is surprisingly much darker and impactful masterpiece that showcases the animation studio's incredible talent and attention to detail.The animation in this film is nothing short of breathtaking, with a combination of vibrant colors and stunningly realistic movements (with shades of AOT type animation) that are sure to leave us in awe, sure did to me.The story is equally impressive, with a rich and complex narrative that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.But what truly sets this film apart for me is its villain, Death. He is one of the most ice cold and memorable animation villains I have ever seen, and his impact on the story is nothing short of awe-inspiring. His presence in this film is so imposing even though he doesn't have that much screen time he feels like he's there all the time.Also his whistle is crazy and genuinely terrifying and his dialogue is also superbly written intimidating lines which add to the tension and drama of the film. Just wonderful wonderful writing for him.All in All, the movie was just that good. A cinematic art and must watch, especially for animation fans. It's a shining example of DreamWorks exceptional storytelling and animation to produce such a quality animated movie in 2023 where others are producing subpar animated movies.", "The best Antagonist in all Animation?": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a shockingly good movie. The expectation for me going into this was high as i had heard so many positives form people i trust and thus was excited to view it. However i am still shocked at just how good the movie was.First lets talk about the characters if this movie. Death is by far and away my favourite villain in any of the Shrek related movies and probably in all of animation. For \"kids\" movie this villain was simply so much more than you would expect. He is by far the best character in this movie (including the main three). He is the glue that holds the movie together as something excellent. Every-time he is on screen i am utterly transfixed on all that's happening. He is an easy 11/10 for me and one of my favorite characters in any movie EVER. Saving my blushes however, i really must say that i enjoyed Puss so much in this movie. He was so interesting when in his own thoughts. I must say as someone personally who has trouble with daily panic, the way that his fear is shown in this movie is second to none. Most (if not all) live action movies cannot get this right. So for a movie i expected to be more childish to get this sense of fear and dread in relation to Puss and his fear of Death is utterly marvelous. Although i must say hearing the heart of Puss in Boots in those intense situations made me feel a scared myself. Besides from his fear and panic, Puss in this movie has a well made relationship with both Perro and particularly Kitty Softpaws that i really enjoyed. Both Kitty and Perro where great characters. I preferred Kitty a lot more it has to be said but Perro was special in his own little way. I will cut these characters short as i don't want to be writing for hours. However Goldilocks and the three Bears i didn't mind and Jack was my least favourite character (which is great as he isn't all that bad either).The story of this movie i spoke about briefly before. However this story n my eyes is the best in the whole Shrek universe. Death was an amazing antagonist, Puss's struggles where absolutely amazing and the duo of Kitty and Perro where really enjoyable. I think that the dilemmas that this movie presents are just great to be a spectator of.The animation of this movie was great. This animation was far better than most animated movies and or shows i have ever seen. To anyone who believes 2D Animation is always better than 3D animation i implore you to watch this film. The fight sin this movie where great. The is only single fight i didn't like in the entire runtime of the movie and it was the last fight with Jack Horner. The reasons for this are that i believe personally that Death should have been the final fight/boss of the movie and the simple fact i believed Jack Horner getting sucked into the bag was enough to end his character. But the fact it's my first major negative (or negative at all) is spectacular.The ending scene that revealed Far Far Away as the destination that Puss and friends are going to is a great tease. Will there be another Shrek movie or Puss in Boots film set in the lands of Far Far Away? I must say that i hope in the later movies of this franchise Death shows up as an easter egg at some point. I'm not sure if i want him to appear in full again anytime soon as there is always a fear of ruining a character. But imagine if in the next movie in this universe you hear at some point in the movie the whistle of Death as a little nod to him in this movie. That would be amazing. Or maybe you see his eyes in the background of a shot i n a movie. Whatever the case may be, i really want some references in future.I have not even mentioned how i think the voiced actors is this movie are perfect.Characters - 10/10Story 9/10Animation 10/10Cast/Voice Actors - 10/10Fights - 9/10This movie is one of which i highly recommend, 9/10.", "Best Films of 2022: This & The Banshees of Inisherin": "No joke. Wildly entertaining animation & dynamic storytelling make for one impressive cinematic adventure: The Last Wish was probably the most fun I've had watching a film since PG: Psycho Goreman.. It's platinum-solid family affair with tons of in-jokes, expertly crafted dialogue, & pitch perfect performances from its actors. I did not expect nor desire to enjoy this movie as much as I did, & indeed I would watch it again. Highly recommended for fans of other instant classics such as The Brave Little Toaster, Zazie dans le M\u00e9tro, Birdboy: The Forgotten Children, Boris & Natasha, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, or A Bug's Life. Ok love you, be safe out there & Super perfundo on the early eve of your day.", "Way better than I expected!": "So I had low expectations for this because sequels typically don't live up to the originals but I was really blown away with how good this was! It had a plethora of funny Disney and nursery rhyme mentions and the movie never got boring to me. There was however some cursing like Hell and crap that I wasn't expecting so heads up on that for the kids and there's a wolf character I thought was a tad scary for little kids too but I felt despite those things they were trying to reach out to both kids and adults for this film and in the end I felt was quite successful. The graphics have an Into the Spiderverse feel during fight scenes which is different yet fun and the message about friendship and family was great for kids but also had a deeper meaning for adults about reflections on your time on earth and what you would've done differently and what would you do if you had the chance to change it. Great film go see it!", "Animation quality not up to the original": "I watched the original Puss In Boots the day before seeing this one and I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more if I hadn't. The story and characters were fine, but there was a noticeable drop in quality of the animation and cinematography. Firstly the animations style had added clear Manga influence. Especially in the fight scenes which often had that flying background, stuttered amazon that Manga uses. The second issue I had was that the final rendering had obviously had a paint effect applied. As if each frame had been hand painted rather than 3D rendered. The result dropping a lot of the quality and detail that the original film had. If it hadn't been for both of these issues I would have given this film a much higher rating, but together it felt like a cheaper, less finished film than the original.", "Perhaps the Best of the Shrek Series": "This is a delightful sequel that is far superior to most of the films that preceded it. The filmmakers and the audience have fun exploring new sides and greater depth of the established titular character by having Puss in Boots face his own mortality. Several of the new characters, especially a chihuahua, are a delight. Remarkably, this film offers a story comprehensible and entertaining for children while also offering adults a rich viewing experience. Thankfully, the juvenile humor is at a minimum while rarely going over the heads of younger audiences.When Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll and he has burned through eight of his nine lives, he launches an epic journey to restore them by finding the mythical Last Wish.", "Here it is, the masterpiece I've been waiting for the last few years.": "Finally, someone reminded the giant studios how movies are made. The animation is incredible. DreamWorks decided to change the style of the cartoon for the better and they succeeded. The comic book style of \"Spider-Man: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and a bit of anime animation wink at the cat. The cartoon has enough morals. So you will have a lot to think about after watching it. And the main antagonist is one of the best antagonists in cartoons in general. His movements, look, and charisma make you scared. The sequel does not depend on the events of the first part and the series of Shrek cartoons. It tells a new story on its own, about a well-known fairy-tale character who, having spent his 8 lives, is afraid to lose his last one, running away from death itself. Visually, the cartoon is bright and fabulous. It was very unexpected that the director of the failed projects Trolls and The Croods: A New Era\" Joel Crawford, was able to make this masterpiece and wipe Disney's nose. So I recommend it to everyone.", "A welcome return": "Puss in Boots: The last wish does what few sequels manage to do and that's create a follow up story that expands the characters while telling a good story.The Last Wish starts off with Puss engaged in his antics before facing down a very serious, and kind of frightening foe. In searching for a way to fight this for, he comes across great past charactyand fantastic new faces that enhance the Shrek/Puss in Boots world.This movie uses adult themes but delivers them in an action packed, fun way. The humor lands and the heartwarming moments work. With out giving the film away, what more could you ask for? Also, the animation style is fantastic (very inspired by Into the Spider verse).", "Great fun movie, better than it's reading": "Puss in boots was fun, exciting and deep. Better than i expected. I liked how they addressed mental health and therapy with the dog and how death coming for puss in boots was a metaphor for anxiety.I thought the animation was great. It had a fast style and the fighting scenes were cool like kung fu panda. It had nothing to do with shrek but is a great story in its own right. I don't have children so i don't know what it would be like to take them and watch it together but as an adult i thought it was great.Funny and my girlfriend loved it too. Last few scenes really brought everything together. Cheers.", "The Tale of a Fearless Feline, a Cynical Cat and a Supernice Dog.": "Dreamworks really know how to nail their sequels. With Shrek 2 and How To Train Your Dragon 2 being better then the first. They really know how to see the room for improvement that is left behind by previous movies and expanding on them in very interesting and inventive ways. With Puss in Boots making his first apperance in Shrek 2 almost 20 years ago now, he has been a very popular support character in the Shrek franchise with a memorable voice performance by Antonio Banderas, he was bound to get his own standalone movie sooner or later. Eventually in 2011, one year after the supposedly final Shrek movie was released, the self titled Puss in Boots was released to mediocre reception. In my opinion it was a bit to weak and not very memorable when it came to Dreamworks productions at that stage and lost some of the charm that the Shrek movie were known for. It wasn't a terrible or even really that bad of a film. But it felt pretty throwaway that left a lot to be desired.The thing that makes Puss in Boots: The Last Wish so much better than the first, is that this felt purley like a passion project than a character cash in which is what the first one felt like. It is obvious that an insane amount of passion went into this movies direction, animation, writing and voice acting to make the movie as entertaining as possible aswell as giving us a few things that we haven't seen before.First off, the animation in this film is gorgeous. This type of cel shaded and traditional 3D hybrid style really fits this film and leaves me wondering if this is the type of style that Dreamworks Animation will stick with from now on, or they will do something different again with their next production. It is also incredibly vibrant and detailed in certain shots. I also like how many of the fighting and action scenes put the characters in this lower frame rate choppy but kinetic style of movement which worked very well when it was used.Antonio Banderas has never sounded better as Puss and every supporting actor knocked it out of the park aswell. Kitty makes a return aswell and she is utilized much better here than in the previous movie but the biggest surprise of this movie was the new character called Burrito. Whoever voiced him did a fantastic job and is the best new Dreamworks character in a very long time! You would think his infectious niceness would get old really fast, but they use it very well and he is actually pretty multi layered and gets a lot of laughs. I think he is in the realm of superniceness which is a term from reading a Richard Dawkins book a few years back where he said that being overloaded with the perk of niceness and kindness is a perversion of darwinism from a scientific standpoint. Though he also said that these kind of people don't bother him and wishes there were more types of people in this world. Burrito as a character symbolizes this type of person in my opinion.The humor in this movie is actually really good aswell and a bit edgy with a lot of bleeped swearing which lets your mind fill in the blanks without it breaking it's family rating which I thought was really smart. And there were quite a few good visual gags aswell.I do have to talk about the villans in this movie because there is more than one, and they all play off eachother basically perfectly and it really shows how smart Dreamworks have become at crafting origional villans. The character of 'Death' is the scariest and most menacing family film villan I have seen in a long time and I was surprised at how hard they pushed him as a character, because he's not really a typical villan but the embodiment of a dark concept, a force of nature.Overall I thought it was a brilliant animated sequel which took more risks than what I've seen in a very long while in the Western animation industry. Absolutley fantastic!", "The Pinnacle of Dreamworks": "I have been watching animated movies since I was a little kid. I own the entire Disney Gold Collection, I have every Pixar movie ever made, and my favorite film of all time is 1989s Kiki's Delivery Service. The Shrek franchise was also something I watched religiously as a child as well. Shrek 2 for a time was one of my all-time favorite films. Puss in Boots did not blow me away, but it was enjoyable. I was not expecting much from this film but I had heard much praise for it and so I went and watched it to see what the hype was.Puss in boots was fun, exciting, and fresh. It was much better than I expected. For a sequel to a movie over a decade old, it has so much heart and sincerity. This is one of the most gorgeously animated film that has ever been produced by Dreamworks. I thought that nothing could top the feel and look of How To Train Your Dragon. This blows that out of the water. I also never thought I would enjoy a Dreamworks movie more than Shrek 2. In my heart, Shrek 2 is still a masterpiece, but this is head and shoulders above anything Dreamworks has ever done. In most instances, I would have named this the best-animated movie of the year. Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio was just such a masterpiece that Puss in Boots becomes my second favorite animated film of the year. If you decide to watch this you won't be disappointed it is a masterpiece in its own right.9.5/10 One of the best animated films released during the 21st century.", "Pleasantly surprised!": "Went into the film expecting nothing extraordinary, but I came out pleasantly surprised by how good it actually was. The story was charming and the writers managed to make me actually care about the characters (which is something that's not always achieved even in adult films). I wasn't sure if I liked the animation style at first but it grew on me after I saw how well the action scenes mingled with the other scenes. I also loved all the cheeky Disney film Easter eggs that were just specific enough to make you realize they're referencing those films without explicitly violating copyright laws (bravo, DreamWorks). To top it all off, the writers actually managed to find a balance between kid and adult humor. I, a 24-year old grad student, genuinely laughed out loud at a children's film and I'm not ashamed to admit it, because DreamWorks didn't go the \"let's pander to all the kids without any consideration for the adults in the room\" route. Overall, a pretty decent film with fun storytelling and a good message.", "Probably the best animated movie of the entire 2022": "Amazing animated movie from dreamworks, this and the good guys are showing us that Dreamworks is in a renaissance, best movie in the Shrek universe since shrek 2 and you know how good is that 2004 movie, Antonio Banderas And the hottie Salma Hayek have a very good chemistry, The dog character is funny not as much as the legendary Eddie Murphy as donkey of course, the Villains are all entertaining specially the dead wolf played exceptionally by Wagner Moura is scary and very threatening, the bears and goldilocks are very funny and wholesome, and my favorite character in the movie John mulaney as the Jack motherfucer Horner is amazing, greatest villain since the fairy godmother, i cried with ghe anxiety's scene with perrito scene, i suffer anxiety attack all the time so is easy for me to feel related to that, anyways stop with the sadness, amazing movie and congratulations to Crawford for making another great sequel.", "GREAT MOVIE!!! I LOVE CATS!!!": "The art in this movie is FANTASTIC, especially the backgrounds that look hand painted, are they hand painted? I love almost every aspect about this movie the ONLY thing i dont totally love is SOME of the character design, i love goldi, jack looks like a dreamworks villain and that works well (also why does he look like hes made of jello?), but the therapy dog (who i dont totally know the name of im watching it for the second time right now) is a little off somehow? I feel like the eyes are too big as kind of a cheat-y way to make it cute you know? Honestly i would have loved it way more if the eyes were like overly small. Its just a personal change i would make. But none of that matters because theres cats in this movie and i love cats :)", "Movie of the year": "Solid storyline that's great for kids. It was a little scary for my 5 year old daughter but just scary enough to be cool for my 7 year old son. Though both liked it enough to pay attention the whole time without getting bored - which is half the reason we take our kids to the movies.The animation is really great. It reminds of of when Disney's Tarzan was a blend of CGI and animation that had never been seen before. Puss in Boots looks like a combo of CGI, animation, anime and at parts even looked like claymation.I didn't find the movie overly humorous but it was funny enough. The movie had a very \"epic\", LOTR feel to it.", "Puss in Boots The Last Wish is a dream come true": "Puss in Boots The Last Wish is crazy freaking good. The art style is beautiful, the fight scenes are masterfully crafted, all of the characters are endearing and likeable, the messages are on point and aren't forced (Looking at you Raya and the Last Dragon). Everything about this movie is just nearing perfection. The animation is also really dang good. The main villain could be one of, if not the best villain that dreamworks have ever produced. He is just so terrifying and a huge threat to Puss in Boots. The side plot with Kitty and Puss hits really hard. This movie is surprisingly emotional, you really care about Puss and Kitty's relationship. This movie is just really good and more. If we got a new shrek movie that looks like Puss in Boots The Last Wish, then I would be all for it.", "are DreamWorks back?": "Puss in Boots: The Last WishPuss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll when he learns that he has burnt through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives.The movie starts out as a simple cheesy kids movie but immediately shifts into being a lot darker and emotional. The film trys to build several character arcs all at the same time and surprisingly succeeds in connecting the audience with the characters and their development. Although the film was pretty emotional, it was also very comedic with a very funny screenplay including some really funny jokes, in addition to being action filled with amazing action sequences. The villain is also very good; I would honestly be scared if I was a kid.All the voice actors were amazing and perfect for the roles; from Antonio Banderas as Puss, to Salma Hayek as Kitty, and especially the British cast, including Florence Pugh, portraying \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". I also really enjoyed little cameos by famous characters from other fairy tales.However, the animation style used in the movie wasn't the best. Additionally, the colors used in the movie, especially in the action scenes, were a bit distracting and didn't really help elevate the movie so much. I don't know if this style is more attractive to the kids these days but I personally didn't love it.Score:7.5/10.", "Psychological Drama": "This is no longer a children's cartoon. This is a powerful psychological drama. The search for the meaning of life, panic attacks, the battle with death itself. The cartoon will appeal to both children and adults. Children will laugh at funny moments. But adults will have a lot to think about. You can talk about the main villain forever. The wolf turned out super-charismatic. Cartoon impersonation of Christoph Waltz. When viewing, you get the feeling that you are in the cartoon universe of Quentin Tarantino's characters. The final scene will definitely not leave anyone indifferent. Definitely a recommendation to watch.", "wonderful sequel": "Eleven years since the solo premiere of Puss in Boots comes the premiere of the long-awaited sequel to the animated film about that character we learned to love from Shrek 2. In a wonderful sequel that makes worth all the wait we've had for throughout these years.The magic of DreamWorks Animation is back.A special joy is what brings me back to the arena of the studio that was able to bring us Shrek more than two decades ago, although the studio has never ceased to be present, it is with the second installment of Puss in Boots that I have felt again. That the magic of the studio returns to the ring and it does so with a wonderful film that still brings us perfect entertainment for young and old alike who will equally enjoy an adventure that leaves us with great messages and above all a vibrant visual enjoyment.A story that entertains you from beginning to end without stops. It is a fairy tale without nuances that captivates you at all times with a story full of magical moments and reflections on how we appreciate our life and how we stand in front of it, without ceasing to reflect on everything we have and do not value.It has all the arguments of that always efficient hero's journey that touches our heartstrings with each adventure that unfolds as the story progresses. The integration of genuine characters allows that message and journey to end up being much more special, because they are the perfect condiments for us to enjoy with all the love, a simple but fulfilling story that takes us to the Dreamworks Animation of yesteryear and that is the best news that we can receive.In the right hands.Joel Crawford continues to hit the right direction and brings us refreshing and innovative animation that sets a new standard for competing studios. The animation is a real past that mesmerizes both for adults and children, with colorful settings and handling of action sequences that makes it clear that we are in the presence of a first-rate visual spectacle.A perfect script, with a development executed with tweezers and the management of humor and sensitivity, with all the greatness of knowing how to deliver what you want and being clear about it, without leaving precedents for dead moments within what we are seeing.ConclutionThe perfect animated film of the year 2022 and the mark that DreamWorks Animation has returned forcefully and what better way to leave us that gift that makes us dream of the return of that character that you are all waiting for again.", "Good message! Loved every minute of it...": "I think this is the best animation movie of the year. Amazing job as usual by DreamWorks Team. Mesmerizing views and story!The animations first of all is just so amazing (modern styled)-it really got me to the edge of my seat looking at the flashes and the bright colours. And there were the antagonists which were AMAZING especially Big Bad Wolf. I mean haven't seen any other movie where the villain makes a cool-spooky entrance (it literally gave me chills). The comedy and jokes were also pretty fun to watch and listen to it.And thats why if you're a big fan of comedy/drama/fantasy/adventure/magic check this movie out and see it for yourself.Always been a Shreks Franchaise Fan.

As a movie from the Shrek universe, yes, it's really awesome. In my opinion, it is the third best film in this universe, behind only the first two Shrek films. However, I think this movie was a bit overrated. That doesn't mean it's bad and I didn't like it, quite the contrary, I loved the movie and would easily watch it again. However, from what was said I imagined it would be an excellent film and ended up getting a film a little below that. That doesn't mean I didn't like it, because I'm very pleased with the movie and I can't wait to watch it again.", "Perfect Wish to a Film We Never Knew We Wanted": "This film was so jam-packed with thrills, sadness, and heart that I couldn't help but see it twice. Puss and the Gang, the Three Bears Family, Death, and even Jack Horner are so captivating and interesting that you just want to see more of them. Especially Death with how strong of an impression he left despite how little he was in the film. So on the character side it's perfect, and so is the narrative and animation side. Especially since the story and pacing is so quick yet strong, simple yet elegant in its presentation. And the art and animation took so much inspiration from Spider-Verse with its style that makes it all the better in its fantastical setting and makes the more action-packed portions even more exciting. An amazing film that was just right every step of the way.", "unexpected, phenomenal film": "I came in this movie with little to no expectations, but left very happy and satisfied. Puss is experiencing an identity crisis, he realizes that his ego is his greatest enemy, he fears death and this changes his entire persona. The characters are amazing from the frog, the dog, the wolf, and let's not forget about the Bears. When I watch this movie, I think of how far DreamWorks came and how they've been able to differentiate themselves from Disney and create riveting films that really strike an emotion. If you were looking for a film to enjoy with family, friends, or even yourself I definitely recommend Puss in boots. As clich\u00e9 as this plot may be, you can really take away real life applications from this movie.

But damn dreamworks nailed it with this movie. Characters were phenomenal, the story is fantastic and the overall experience was just so refreshing. This is better than the usual generic animated movies we are getting nowadays, and it mainly has something to do with Dreamworks willingness to push the movie to have bizzare and dark characters such as the wolf (I wont name him - he is one of the best things about this movie) and Jack Horner which are villains who are equally great but gives off different vibes.It has been a long time since I've smiled almost throughout a movie, not because of quips or jokes every 5 minutes that tend to get old very fast, I smiled through the movie because of its high quality delivery of a great plot that never feels too congested and I think that all characters actually had great development within a movie that is less than 2 hours total.I hope this would be the standard of animated movies going forward as other studios such as Pixar has become quite stale and generic lately.", "Hope For The Future": "If they could put this much passion and effort into a sequel to a spin-off of a memorable franchise, I can't wait to see what they're gonna do with their new future projects that are made with the same devotion. 2022 was a great year for animated films that aren't Disney, they're not all perfect like this or too perfect to be compared to this which's the right amount of perfect.I won't say anything that hasn't already been said about the animation such as it's like Spider-Verse but unique enough to stand on its own.Every plot beat is character driven with effective emotional impact, all the new characters are great, I was worried that with the big number of characters in this they wouldn't be fleshed out much and be annoying but they weren't and it took me by surprise.The director didn't need to go that hard with the style and spectacle but he did.", "A Step In The Right Direction": "The movie is fun. It felt like the animated movies from my childhood: lighthearted and timeless. It wasn't groundbreaking by any means, but it was one of the first times in a while that I went to a movie for the sake of entertainment and actually was entertained.The story was also fairly interesting also; I liked the addition of new fairytales that we hadn't seen before in the Shrek universe. Overall I think it added depth to Dreamwork's' filmography, and was a great follow up to the first Puss in boots movie which was such a fantastic film.The movie was also fairly funny, but I do have to say that Harvey Guillen's character Perrito was annoying to me. The character felt forced and was just overly \"cute\" which felt tiring after a while, but it is a kids film so its not too big a deal.So with that said this is still the type of movie that someday when I have kids I won't actually mind showing them despite it being being made in the era of dead art and overly greedy Hollywood execs. It's fun, it's cute, and I think in general a step in the right direction for animated movies that can be enjoyed by all.", "I really don't get the hype": "Was it good? Yup, decent script, unexpected laughs and visually appealing. It didn't have me gripped though. One guy even walked out half way through.Yes, I went for the happy ever after and it delivered, but I found it a struggle to stay with despite the short runtime. I felt it laboured the 'legend' point way too much, and yes I get that it's a kids movie and needs to be somewhat obvious, but I LOVE Dreamworks and Pixar - this is usually my sweet spot, but it was still over cooked.Full disclosure, it would've helped if there weren't parents talking non-stop near me, (please, please, please don't behave as though the cinema's your living room, even if you have kids - who were actually quiet).The part I loved the most was the depiction of mental health and coping mechanisms. It just added to the wholesome message of the film, which was about the value of relationships and how to cherish them. This for me was it's' biggest success.", "Better than the first one": "Puss in boots the last wish is an amazing movie it is funny emotional movie it gives every characters in this movie an arc. The villain in this movie is very scary and might give little kids nightmares and there is a lot of adult jokes in it. The animation is very good its a mix of 2d and 3d. And its hard to believe this movie took 11 years to make this movie . There is also a lot of villain's in this movie like the wolf there is also big jack Horner and goldilocks and the 3 bears. There is also a new character who is a dog who has dark backstory. Also there is a little tease at the end. Good movie.", "Surprisingly brilliant": "I haven't seen any of the previous PIB films & thought the Shrek series went rapidly downhill so didn't hold out an awful lot of hope for this. But.. I thought it was excellent ! The childhood fairytale references were spot on, the script was good & there wasn't really a duff character in sight. I'm thinking maybe I should revisit the older ones but I don't think they are essential to being able to enjoy this film on it's own. The only thing you really need is a decent knowledge of yer actual fairy stories & Grimm tales.Is it the \u00ab last wish \u00bb? I'd certainly not be opposed to more! Not like there aren't other characters to bring in!", "Caught off guard": "This movie caught me off guard 100%. Went with a buddy of mine to see this more as a joke but also just to pass the time. We (19M and 22M) just wanted to hang and chose to see this movie. There were numerous times we were bursting out laughing and also moments we understood deeply and connected to our emotions. I think the animation, while maybe a little too similar to spider-man, was still phenomenal. The bright colors used and the background artwork was amazing. Definitely not expecting that. Also the story was beyond amazing. Way better than it's predecessor and other animated movies released in 2022.As guys who grew up watching the Shrek franchise, I for one am excited to see what's next.", "What happens when you care": "Now I know that the top animation studios want mass production and marketable characters. The billions of dollars they bring in should mean that there's at least some heart in the mass production. In a world where animation has literally peaked with graphics and realism you have two options to stay in the game: 1:Great storytelling and originality, and 2: Stylize the crap out of your movies. While Disney has definitely brought in some stylization primarily with Luca and then turning red, the story writing is still lacking. Dreamworks looked at those two options and said \"why not both\". Bad guys is another great example of this. Studios need to realize that the animation community isn't just for kids, and when they produce films like Spiderverse where all the animation nerds make YouTube videos on the freaking frame rate, there is a business in styling your movies. Also I noticed how recently there hasn't been a token \"cute character thst sells well\" in the recent dreamworks movies. They fully focused into making unique character designs, even if it meant not getting the toy sells. Puss in boots has great writing, excellent character arcs, hell my parents laughed, my young cousins laughed, and my teenage siblings laughed. EVERYONE laughed. The textures are amazing, the world building is incredible, character design is immaculate, it feels very alive. It wasn't an over saturation of color like most mass productions are, which real atmosphere being created. Voice acting was incredible. The soundtrack was incredible and yes, the fight scenes were incredible. Honestly if you love animation, or even if you don't, see this movie. If we want to see studios do more of this (like spiderverse and bad guys) we need to show interest. Well done Dreamworks.", "Absolutely superb": "This is a truly great and entertaining film, with an engaging story, characters who feel real, and dynamic visuals. The blend of 2D rendering with the 3D makes it stand out from Pixar/Disney animation, giving the film its own look. The script is a well written one, with such great play on traditional fairytale and nursery rhymes in the way that the original Shrek film did that was so much fun. The big bad wolf is a brilliant villain and so scary, no wonder this film is PG. The design, editing, music, camera, acting, direction are all top notch. And finally it is a film within which the characters learn lessons about life, value of friends and family, and thus serves as a great inspiration for the audience.", "This movie works on all levels": "Disney en Pixar move over as there is a new king in town and it's Dreamworks.Puss is on his last life and that fact changes his perspective on life and the value of it. On his journey to the wishing star he meets a dog and Kitty Softpaws, two characters who are all changed after their adventure.The story is as simple enough and entertaining for kids as it is deep an thoughtful for adults. The voice actors, writing, direction and animation (that borrows lightly from the excellent Sony Spider-man animated movie) and it hits on every cylinder. There is no political agenda pushed, it's fun, emotional, scary and all done perfectly.I don't like this movie, I love it and it's a must watch for the whole family.", "Best animated movie in a while": "The way the whole movie is animated it amazing, especially seeing it on the big screen this movie was non stop fun and I was not bored at all.Great to see a Shrek character develop and would recommend this film for adults and kids alike. Voice acting was superb as well shout out Antonio Banderas and Salam Hayek.All in all this is a well animated movie with a great fun story and voice acting and would recommend you go and see this! (especially if you are a Shrek or Dreamworks fan you will not be disappointed) They did a great job with the art style and the story deffo go and see it it soon!", "Scratches an itch": "The first \"Puss in Boots\" film came out around a decade ago and it still holds up pretty well. It's very clearly a spin-off from the \"Shrek\" franchise but worked standalone. So who knows why it's taken so long to create this sequel.The benefit of such a gap is that \"The Last Wish\" is undeniably modern and a lot sharper than its predecessor. This is most obvious in the script with its wide plundering of nursery rhyme characters from far and wide. At the same time the animation is brighter and shows vivid anime influences in the action sequences.Add on excellent voice acting and some quite sophisticated dramatic tension and you have a film that appeals to both young and old. You do have to be quick to catch some of the easter eggs though as the story moves at a fair old pace.All in all this is a successful addition to the franchise even if doesn't plumb the emotional depths that you tend to find with Pixar.", "I never write reviews but...": "Yes, it's really that good, and well worth your time and money, go support this movie! It's nothing short of incredible, what a pleasant surprise... All three antagonists are phenomenal, and honestly work quite well with the direction of the plot. Character development is great, especially Puss's arc with him beginning to appreciate the value of his life, because he's down to his last one, along with kitty soft paws and perrito being very charming and likable. This movie is mature with its message, clever, funny, entertaining, and a family friendly movie. Death is my favorite character by far, his dialogue and the commanding, intimating, and cool voice he brings to his lines in the voice acting is super effective. This movie provides you with a 100 minute escape that is a blast, \"straight up.\" \ud83d\ude43", "A great movie for the whole family!!!": "What can I say? I'm a sucker for movies that don't take themselves too seriously. I grew up watching movies like Shrek and I still enjoy them today with my little ones. It's a shame that it took so long to come up with another version of Puss n boots but I'm glad they waited because this was very well done. The movie doesn't pull any punches with making fun of pretty much everyone at some point of the movie. It has simple life lessons that can be looked at not through a spectrum but as a whole, thus applying to everyone. I love that. There were several moments through the movie that I laughed out loud and I have to say it's been awhile since I've been able to do that during a kids movie. Usually I cringe and change the channel. I hope Dream Works continues to push that envelope and comes up with some new movies for my kids. We'll be first in line. Thanks Dream works for knowing exactly what we needed.", "My 14 Year Old Daugher Says: Weak Porridge!": "So me, single hot dad in Hawaii, watched this with my daughter, who thankfully has had some arts education and recognized it as the weak drivel that it is. I mean, gags are as fun as gags are as funny, I suppose, so there's some of that, but there's a little much too material directed at feline fetishists, and I say this as one, or not, anyway, the idea of visual gags being incredibly funny or surprising in an animated universe seems to assume that the viewer is infantile. To me, the movie was like a really long and entertaining youtube video, or the first time you play some story line oriented game. You kind of know what gag is coming next...Yes, I think the smarmy and gratuitous appeal to cat fetishists is annoying. Then again, cats are cool and can do things like jump 12 times their height, or something. They are also fantastically good at sleeping, as I am.Watching this with my daughter yesterday was a father-daughter bonding experience because we both were making fun of this stupid movie. It is what it is.It is an irrelevant art form, at this point, and so it attracts less talent.The core problem is that the story has no story to tell, so it tries to engage the viewer in an identity crisis. Sign of the times.", "Really disappointing": "And very overrated. I have no clue why people loved this movie so much. Maybe I'm old but the main problem is the incredibly fast pacing. Every single line scene and montage feels like a super sped up summary of the actual movie. As a result almost all imagery, enjoyment, emotion, and character beats feel overlooked and easy to miss. The whole thing feels lazy. The ending is also very predictable and lacks the grounded, emotional anchor of the excellent first film. Both also explore magical landscapes, but the better pacing of the first made the beanstalk realm feel so memorable. Most of all, the animation change is terrible. It does not fit Shrek-esque franchises at all. It makes the entire story feel less real and consequential.", "Good kids movie": "I wanted to love this movie, but there's not much to love. They throw in an annoying Olaf ripoff who brings nothing to the film. Donkey was at least voiced by a comedian and while I love Harvey Guillen, this wasn't the role for him (or probably anyone honestly).The villain is pretty cool, though he has one standout scene and is then reduced to a background chatter showing up every 20 minutes to remind you he exists. They muddy the water with 2 other groups of villains, one of which is just evil for the sake of being evil.All in all, it's fine. It's no Shrek 2, but perhaps those standards are too high to hold this up to.", "Family": "Puss in Boots: The Last Whish is the kind of movie that makes a menacing villain even with less screen time and that further more brings this aspect of threat to the viewer. The film has many good points, but the main one is its premise of putting family first and also the change of the main character, dropping his selfishness as the plot evolves, which makes the film split into acts, for example: fear of the unknown villain, development of the villains, family and more, not to mention the animation that, in my point of view, was simply perfect, this film is definitely one of the best animated films I've ever seen.", "Loved part 1, disgusted by part 2!": "What a big dissapointing movie! Me and my family loved part 1. But do not waste your time on part 2! It was way too dark for kids, horrifying. Also very cheap that it was 50% animation and 50% drawing effects. Just stick with animation, was very annoying and ugly too watch. Very sad they took this dark and weird turn with their movies, there was nothing wrong with how it was before.You will lose a lot of fans over this.We were watching this in the movies with are daughter who kept putting her hands in front of her eyes. This is really not suitable for kids, even though it should be a kids movie!", "Deserves the positive reviews.": "I was surprised reviewers here who didn't like the movie, also parents of young kids, claim that the positive reviews are bots. It's fine to dislike a movie, but there's no need to brush off those who didn't like that.The characters are great, even though there are quite a few! They're all given a reason to exist in the movie and I never felt like there was one just there for filler material. Not to mention each had a nice character arc that fulfilled unexpectedly at the end. The secondary antagonist is a pretty average one that you probably won't be surprised by, however, he adds more action scenes to the movie, which is surely welcome to people who need that.The primary antagonist in this movie may be one of my favourites of all time. It's nice to see an antagonist that isn't driven by greed, power, revenge or love, for once. Something different is always welcomeThe animation and the art style are also great. I can see why some find the more anime-style sequences grating, but I personally feel they add character to the fight scenes. The environments are beautifully realised here (the environment changes too.. very, very often)The writing was stellar. Some pretty good jokes and a lot of \"heh, that was clever\" moments. I ended up being quite invested in each character in the end, especially due to the writing. The appearance of different fairytale characters here and there is fun too. One of my favourite lines was \"you promised us our our weight in gold\".Also props to Dreamworks for making possibly the least annoying sidekick in one of their movies of all time!Would recommend to watch. It wasn't too hot. It wasn't too cold. It was just right.", "Surprisingly great": "Honestly I had little hope for this movie after the 1st, but seeing the trailer showing a new a fresh animation style got my interest.The animation and sequences steal the show. I have never been this entertained by an animated movie's action scenes, it is actually that good. The action feels fast and does not linger on anything that does not add to the fun.The story itself is nothing too special or crafted, but it does not mess up what is a great movie. The characters are very good and I was motivated every scene they were in, it felt like they spent time at every stage asking themselves \"does this need to be in the move?\".I also love Jiminy Cricket, I was surprised that I laughed at this movie, and it was because of him.I hope the possible future movies in this storyline are just as creative and fun.", "Fantastic film with a fantastic message": "I came in with high expectations after rewatching the classic shrek movies, and my expectations were very well met. There are plenty of unique characters that all have their own interesting story arcs and fun identities. Every character felt different and there was plenty of character development, particularly for our main protagonist. The animation was fluid and reminded me of a sort of comic. The music was upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.I loved the sense of adventure and all the unique obstacles certain characters were presented with. Although the plot was simple enough, it was filled with a magic and had several deeper meanings and messages than nearly all \"kid\" films you see today. It is easily appealing to adults as it features some darker themes that kids may not catch.Overall this movie was fantastic and it had many overlapping dark themes, fluid animation and plenty of enjoyable characters. It is also full of the brim of callbacks to previous Shrek films.", "The Future of Dreamworks is Shrexcellent.": "An amazing buildup on the world first introduced to us in 2001, with not only stunning new locations, but also colorful and interesting characters and ofcourse a plethora of phenomenal stories. When I left the theater I was left wanting more of that world. I can be lost in the visual representation of the animated world for ages. Every character only adds to the main plot and deserves a full story of their own.I hope that this movie is Dreamworks saying \"We are here to stay\" as one of the greatest animation companies out there. I hope this movie is an omen of what Dreamworks have in store for us in the future and that their glory days are up to come.", "Best Animated Movie of the Year!": "It has been over a decade since the last \"Shrek\" franchise movie released with the spin-off \"Puss in Boots.\" When \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was announced, I had no excitement for this film and almost decided to skip seeing it in theaters. I am so glad I didn't, as this is my favorite animated movie of the year. The original \"Puss in Boots\" was decent but didn't justify a sequel, and the vast gap between these films made me assume DreamWorks was simply trying to cash in on a popular IP. Instead, we got arguably the best film in the entire \"Shrek\" franchise. So what makes this movie such a thrilling watch?Puss in Boots, charismatically voiced by Antonio Banderas, has always been a daring adventurer, a borderline outlaw, a heartthrob with the female kitties, and a bigger-than-life legend known by all. This movie takes the Zack Snyder route of deconstructing our hero, but it perfectly works in \"The Last Wish.\"The story opens up in a lively bar where Puss performs the catchiest original earworms of the franchise in \"Fearless Hero,\" setting up his larger-than-life presence. The mood is quickly dampened for our partying pussy cat when confronted by The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). The wolf, who effectively acts as The Grim Reaper and reveals himself as Death, shows Puss that he is down to the final of his nine lives in a hilarious montage. That comedic tone contrasts the wolf himself, who is easily the most excellent, intimidating, and scariest villain in any of these Shrek movies and one of the best villains in an animated film I've seen. With his creepy whistling, massive scythes that scrape against the ground, glowing red eyes, and compelling voice performance by Wagner Moura, Death steals every scene he is in, and we sense the fear that Puss feels.Puss goes on the run, fakes his death, and seeks refuge at the amusing crazy cat lady, Mama Luna's house. Puss struggles with retirement in this new sheltered lifestyle and finds it demanding to settle down from his adventurous ways. When he thought things were going awry, he met an annoying Chihauha disguised as a cat. This stranded dog, later named Perrito (Harvey Guillen), would become an unlikely ally for Puss on his journey as Puss develops quite a soft spot for him. Perrito is one of the highlights of this movie, and his naive innocence is played with such enthusiasm and humor that you can't help but smile when he is on screen. He's infectious and funny as a character, but his backstory provides some of the film's darker and more emotional moments.Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss's former fiance and rival, confronts Puss and Perrito, and the trio sets off with a magic map to find the Wishing Star. Puss wants to use the wish to restore his nine lives, but Kitty wants to wish for someone to trust, as she's never known anyone trustworthy. That includes Puss, who we learn stood her up at the altar on their wedding day. Perrito, on the other hand, does not want to wish for anything as he is happy with his two new friends and content with what he has. You can see where the whole \"moral of the story\" comes in.The magical map changes the path in interesting ways depending on who is holding it and is utilized cleverly to deliver exposition and learn more about our characters. Of course, dangerous and magical obstacles get in their way on their journey, but this would not be a \"Shrek\" movie without some fun fairy tale characters characterized in a comical and witty way. This movie becomes a MacGuffin film when Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) chase after our heroes for the map. The incredibly talented voice cast plays all these characters with charisma, and the exaggerated Cockney-voiced characterizations make this group a lot of fun. On top of that, the big baddie \"Big\" Jack Horner wants to use the Wishing Star to acquire all the magic in the world. He has always been jealous of fairy tale characters and their magic since he was \"just a nursery rhyme.\" He is played delightfully evil without an ounce of remorse, making it clear he is the main villain and making his demise much more satisfying.\"The Last Wish\" understandably has the best animation of any of the \"Shrek\" movies since it came out 11 years after the most recent installment. Still, this movie takes animation to another level. The visuals are elaborate, detailed, and popping with color, and it is DreamWorks' best-animated film, which says something for an animation studio with the resume of DreamWorks. It hops between more traditional DreamWorks animation and lower-framerate \"Into the Spiderverse\"-style animation. While the movie becomes predictable in the middle act as they go on their traditional quest, the character moments, deep emotions, dazzling animation, break-neck pace, stellar voice performances, and engaging humor make this my favorite animated film of the year. 9/10.", "One of the best animation movies I've seen": "Non-spoiler review:\nSaw the reviews and had high expectations. And boy does this movie delivers.Funny, emotionally gripping, with amazing characters and mature themes.Didn't expect to care about one of the movie's villains so much (Rare in a kids movie, but tbh I won't even say that this is a kids movie)\nI feel like this movie is for adults with its profound theme, implied swear words, gruesome deaths (also implied), subtle character momentsSimple premise but beautiful execution.Well-directed action scenes.Amazing painting-like animation style. Fits the story well.Includes references to many fairy tales. And those elements enriches the story and fits in so well.Don't even need to watch the first movie. This movie has no connection to the plot of the first one. Only 2 recurring characters. (Puss and Kitty)", "Dreamworks' historic slap in the face to Disney.": "Puss in Boots 2 is everything you expect from a school, but better, although it does not reach the point of Sherk 2 (Movie with which it will be compared) I must say that it is exquisite in every way, the characters are a delight, I can not believe that in 1 hour 40 minutes they have done something better, something incredible, something interesting to the point that he made me say \"This with Pinoccho del Toro must be the standard of animation\" I must say that Dreamworks does something that Disney does not.Dreamworks makes movies with love, with brains and respecting children and adults, responing their intelligence, unlike Disney that thinks that we are all stupid and gives us the same garbage every year, because YES gentlemen Pixar is the only good thing of this company in most of the year. Congratulations, you have done the impossible and I respect this. You have to see this movie.", "\"A Really Enjoyable Movie. But With Room For Improvement.\"": "I really enjoyed this movie! That being said, it is in no way perfect and still has only a couple things it could have done better. Such as having John Mulaney as the voice of \"Big\" Jack Horner; it didn't work for me - I just couldn't take that voice seriously...and I found it to be a little annoying. A better voice might have been...someone like Kevin James. I while I did love the Wolf, I wish they would have used someone else as the physical embodiment of Death. Because I don't see Death, I see just another version of The Big Bad Wolf. They could have used someone like Xibalba (the Mayan god of death), that to me would have been better - and they could have taken design inspirations from Tzekel-Kan and his acolyte (from \"The Road to El Dorado\"). I also was not a fun of the animation, because we've seen Puss and his companions in traditional 3D animation, so to suddenly see them in a different style...it just didn't work for me. The worst for me was Perrito because comic-reliefs are almost done wrong. I mean, Perrito looked, talked, and acted like a moron. There is nothing wrong with someone being friendly, happy and positive...but that doesn't mean they also have to be naive and idiotic. Why didn't they just make Perrito happy-go-lucky because whenever he was stayed positive something good things always happened to him? The only times where he actually comforted Puss was when he was good, and I wish he was better at it because he even admitted that he wanted to be a therapy dog. I even wished there was just a little more time to rebuild the chemistry between Puss and Kitty - and I wish they actually kissed, much like they did in the first film. I did like the twist they did with Goldilocks and the Three Bears, but the whole reference to their story got old real quickly; also the bears could of had just a bit more brains. And while it is small...I didn't like the new mask they gave Kitty, and should have stuck with the black one. Finally the whole name \"Team Friendship\" was just stupid.That being said I loved how much darker and more mature this movie was than all its predecessors. My favorite parts were always when the Wolf was on screen. I was also shocked to hear so many beeping/swears in the movie, as well as the \"body count\". I hope other kid movies start taking notes from this. And while I did find Jack Horner to be a spoiled brat, I did find him to be a believable villain because of how heartless and egotistical he was. The same goes with Death - I really wish he was given a bigger role. The action was pretty fun to watch, and I like the message they were trying to get across: \"live your life to the fullest, and be happy with what you have.\" And I guess the animation worked every now and than, and most of the voice acting was done very well. I really did enjoy watching this movie, and so the good stuff outweigh the annoying stuff. It seemed to me that there was more to be told, which is why I wish it was a little longer. I also wish that Puss and Kitty prepared to redo their wedding, and planned on having a littler (and what they would name them). I would gladly love see another movie with Puss and Kitty going on another adventure together.", "This movie is not only one of the best animated movies of the year, it's one of the best Dreamworks movies ever!": "I can't believe that Joel Crawford who also directed The Croods A New Age, Took our favorite fairytale feline and enhance the story and espionage the animation! The animation gives me major Spider Verse vibes and I love it. If animation is going to be like this for the next decade, Count me in! Also, That death wolf is one of the most scariest Dreamworks villains since Lord Shen from Kung Fu Panda 2! Overall, this is the Best animated movie of the year! The story is well structured, the characters are all very interesting, the animation shines, the action is stellar and the jokes are funny!!!!", "Purfect": "This is an amazing family movie with a great animation style like the style from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse. The characters are well developed throughout the movie. There constant fear of death from Puss in the movie. There is a wolf who is death is a terrifying antagonist who may scare some children. Puss feels like he has the constant need to hide his fear as he is on his last life. Goldilocks and The Three Bears are antagonists while they search for the star which will grant one wish. Goldilocks and The Three Bears help Puss, Kitty Softpaws and Parito when the 6 realise they already have their wishes granted. After this, all six stop Big Jack Horner from granting his wish to have all the magic in the world. Puss defeats Death by instating that he is no longer afraid.", "Who Is Your Favourite Fearless Hero?": "I had no idea that this sequel to a decade old movie was being released until I kept seeing people saying this movie was great. Of course, being English, I had to wait until February to see it. Avoiding spoilers was hard enough from the Americans, so I made sure I saw this movie as soon as I could once it released in the UK, and I was surprised that even though this movie was sold to me as amazing, it still exceeded my expectations!The story was a \"reach the goal first\" type between the team of Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws, and Perrito the Dog, the team of Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family, and then Big Jack Horner and his Baker's Dozen. Each has a reason to get to the Wishing Star first, and so the stakes and motives are set up very well. Additionally, Puss in Boots, at his last life, is being haunted by Death (in the form of a big bad Wolf), which gives the movie a chance to explore anxiety quite well.This movie contains various types of villains and serves each quite well. Goldilocks and the Three Bears serve as the redeemable villains, as Goldi's wish is to find a new family, but she soon realises that all she needed was the Three Bears. Next, the irredeemable villain of Jack Horner. I'd never heard of Jack Horner before, but they explained his story pretty well, gave him a story as to why he was evil, and the back and forth between Jack and the Ethical Bug shows just how bad he is, but also serves for fun comedy. And then there's Death, who follows a sort of horror villain blueprint of relentlessly chasing down the protagonist until they reach an inevitable final confrontation.My main complaint about the movie was that some aspects felt a bit predictable. It became clear that Goldilocks was after a real family so you knew she would inevitably give that up to stay with the bears. Jack Horner obviously couldn't get the wish, as that would've been this movie's equivalent of the Thanos snap. The fact that no one got the wish in the end was a surprise though. And seeing Jack get so close just to be stopped by the Ethical Bug was honestly perfect. However, back onto the predictability, as soon as Death mentioned that Puss lived carelessly, throwing lives away, it was quite obvious that Puss would learn to use his life well and that would result in Death conceding in battle. Death obviously couldn't be killed, as he's, well, death! And killing Puss, as shocking as that would have been, would never have happened in a movie with the primary target audience being children.It must be mentioned though that this movie's animation was amazing, the comedy was on point in the right places, the themes of this movie were executed well, and somehow, this movie has exceeded most of what Disney's been producing in recent times. Would love to see more animated movie with this level of storytelling!A solid 8/10 from this reviewer.", "cinema": "I dont want to spoil much, but i just want to say please go watch this movie over avatar 2 this is way better trust me. I will say the biggest postitive about this movie is that the animation is amazing mainly because it feels so much like a fairy tale come to life. The second thing I love is that this movie really gets to the heart of who puss really is more than any of his other appearences even more than shrek 2. The third thing I love is the villains like Jack Horner, who's just this really bad dude that has good intentions or the wolf aka death, who is chasing puss to possibly get it to his head that he should be treating his life with respect.", "Best animated movie I have ever watched": "I have been waiting for this movie for so long and when I watch it I think director took right time to gift us this masterpiece what a movie it was fun to spend 1 hour 40 minutes on this movie I love 2 characters from this movie very much first wolf was one of the scariest villainin in animated movie I have ever watched in my life and 2nd dog perrito charcter was also amazing it shows you should always be calm in every situation and always be good to others and god will always help you in your difficult times and every other thing in this movie was also perfect from starting to end this movie was best animated movie ever created and it deserves oscar and Disney should learn from DreamWorks animation how to create great movie like this one.", "Dreamworks has the best villains": "Dreamworks continues to impress me with their amazing villains. Death doesn't have a lot of screen time but the whenever he does appear he steals the show. His look and design is frightening yet his voice is soothing. That contrast makes for a terrifying villain who's presence is felt throughout the entire film despite his lack of screen time.The art style and animation is leagues above that of the first. It has a similar feel to Into the Spider-verse except the colours are a lot more vibrant and dream like. It really gives the feel that you are watching a fairy tale movie. If I had to nitpick I would say the FPS changes can be quite jarring and I would have preferred if the entire movie were just shot in low FPS.", "Incredibly unexpectedly awesome.": "Easily the best animated film 2022. Amazing voice work and stunning animation. This is Puss in Boots at his PEAK. Other studios creating family animated comedies should be utterly embarrassed by this film.It's not often we get a movie this good appropriate for all ages, puss says \"hell\" one time and there is a drop of blood, aside from that all ages can and will enjoy this movie. 10/10 highly recommend watching this. The original Puss in Boots is pretty good, but this is very very very good.Its honestly incredible to see this level of thought and effort into a \"kids\" movie, like seriously people aren't doing this enough and dreamworks has just set the bar for what future animated films need to be.", "Good story, almost great animation": "The story is great, having both light-hearted, funny moments and more serious moments. The soundtrack is fitting too. Those specific latino style songs that always accompanied puss in boots. The movie will manage to pull on your emotional strings without feeling cheesy. You will care about all the main characters, and the conflict brings them all into a great clash.My one nitpick is with the animation. I don't like those few instances where the animation gets choppy / feels like it's 20 fps. I don't want to accept that as an \"artistic choice\". It feels more like laziness. Thankfully, the really important fight scenes are not choppy at all. Those feel great. Again, in the few scenes the animation gets weird, I can't find any rationale behind it. It just happens and then goes back to nornal. Doesn't make the movie less great, but it's certainly something that would gatekeep it for me from being number 1 on any list. I just hope it's not something movie studios are dipping their toes in to see if they can get away with it.", "Review: Antonio Banderas is at his best in long-awaited 'Puss in Boots' sequel": "While the earlier films (going back to the first \"Shrek\" in 2001) had a rubbery CGI style that typified the form in the early aughts, it hasn't aged particularly well. New director Crawford borrows a page from 2018's Oscar-winning \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" and DreamWorks' own \"The Bad Guys\" from earlier this year to give a stylized, dynamic approach to \"The Last Wish\" that imbues the proceedings with a whole new energy.There are several digressions - occasionally uplifting and oftentimes uproarious - as each group attempts to claim the Wishing Star, all with very different plans if they get it. Goldilocks, for example, wants everything to be just right, which might be positively endearing were it not for the fact that she sounds like a cockney gangster out of a Guy Ritchie movie.Of course, the most important part of the mix is the man whose dulcet tones carry us along on this fractured fairy tale. Banderas is in fine form as his animated alter ego, clearly having lost none of his affinity for the role in the intervening decade and change. Quick, someone convince Banderas to reprise his other iconic sword-slashing hero as well!How things culminate in \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" isn't exactly surprising. But in true storybook fashion, the script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow offers enough swerves to make the journey worthy of the destination. It's a perfect package of whimsy, sass and sweetness. Based on where this one ends, the filmmakers are no doubt already at work puzzling out Puss' next cinematic offering, and here's hoping it's not another 11 years before we see it.", "Absolutely Amazing": "The animation in this movie is top tier, absolutely AMAZING. The movement in the fight scenes, the painting art-style. Just absolutely jaw dropping. And the story, the character growth, it's just absolutely incredible. The journey that these kitties and dog go on is so heart warming and fun, it's wonderful.I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of animated movies, or a fan of the Shrek franchise. And even if you aren't a huge fan of Shrek, I still recommend this masterpiece of a film.Hats off to all the animators who worked on this film, they all did a wonderful job. 10/10 film, a must see!", "its masterpiece !!": "I can't believe in 2022 make this perfect animation\nits masterpiece from everything\nExcellent in every way.Animation\nmusic\naction\nstory\neverythingwatch and enjoy!The first part of Puss in Boots was a huge success and became very popular among the audience.

Now, after The Last Wish episode of this animation has been made and is ready for release, for the first time, its first 30 minutes have been shown at Annecy Animation Film Festival. This anime was directed by Joel Crawford and he says about Puss in Boots: The Last Wish:In this work, we did not intend to re-introduce this popular cat to the people of the world. Our intention is to talk about what he does. We want to show this popular character and his fascinating story to the world in a different way.", "WATCH IT": "The trailers for this movie don't give it justice at all. The film starts out pretty playful but gets very serious really fast. The characters are awesome, the settings are vibrant, and the animation is gorgeous. Although, one character who is a wolf could be scary for very young children so I would be mindful of that. But I do have to say this is a major comeback for the franchise and nobody should over look it at all. The humor has the same bite to it as the original movies and the drama is awesome. Please go see this movie though. The theaters are very empty and we need more people to support so that a Shrek 5 may be more likely.9/10, exceeds expectations.", "Top tier animation movie": "This movie checks all the boxes for a good animation film, it has a creative and artistic animation style to it along with a deep story to go along with, upholding the good rep of the Shrek franchise.The movie also introduces many new characters without making it feel overdone and also manages to develop these characters to a sufficient degree.The villian does an amazing job of commanding your attention everytime he shows up.The biggest problem in my opinion was the climax/ last stand against the villain, can't talk about it too much without giving it away but I was expecting a much more extraordinary duel.Worth and watch whether you're a child or adult.", "An honest story that is entertaining and beautiful with timeless tint, addressing the thrones and joy of our lives and ones we love.": "I am surprised that on a tiring evening deciding to watch a fun animation took us on a ride that does not take itself seriously, but it is magnificently serious.Swept away by the themes explored, I deeply relate to it, heck I even found solace and learned something from the simplicity in this complexity that I can take into my life.As a seeker of better ways to animate that would enhance the ability of telling stories. I am glad to share that the mix of CGI, drawn images like painted and frame rate changes are truly unique. It is innovative not just in its techniques but how it has been used to show the range of expressions and details of each element of this journey.Story 10/10\nActing 10/10\nScript 10/10\nAnimation 11/10\nThemes 10/10\nWorld building 10/10.", "Really Fun": "I went to see this purely to hear the voice work provided by Florence Pugh. I came away appreciating all of the film, the many nods to fairytales just like Shrek used to do and the very impressive animation which at times was as impressive as Into the Spiderverse.Most of the jokes made me chuckle, some only internally, but that's still a good thing and it was fun to try and figure out the who the voice actors were apart from the aforementioned Pugh and Antonio Banderas as the titular PussIt's fun. It's lighthearted and it's a good distraction for kids and adultsWell worth watching to pass a couple of hours.", "Absolutely excellent": "Perhaps I'm biased because I've grown up in a family that loves cartoons, but this movie is truly immaculate. I was expecting it to be more childish given the more cartoony animation style, but it feels very well made for all ages. I (25y/o) and all my mid-twenty year old friends have all thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I do think the animation is a little strange for the action scenes given that it's different than the animation in the rest of the movie, but once I let myself accept it as a stylistic choice, I actually thought it was pretty cool. Also, the character designs are perfect (Death might be a little scary for younger kids but I didn't hear any whines in the audience the two times I saw it in theaters). The movie was hilarious too if you're a big kid like me or even just enjoyed any of the other Shrek movies. I saw it thrice in about a week and a half and loved it more than the last each time. Highly recommend.", "'The Last Wish' Truly Proving Legends Never Die": "After years since anything new from the Shrek franchise graced the movie screen, DreamWorks jumps us back to the fairytale setting we know and love. While we end up following Puss in Boots instead of our favorite green ogre and his noble steed, Puss manages to take us on a fun adventure with references and fables we know with a twist on them.Puss is living life as a great legend, but after a fight he finds his confidence shattered. Upon hearing of the Wishing Star, he goes off with Kitty Softpaws from the first Puss in Boots and a new side character to find it before his enemies do. Meanwhile, another character lurks in the shadows, who manages to strike fear into the fearless hero's heart. It's a race to see who can get the Wish, and who will betray who to get it.Despite his appearance in other media, viewers don't have to have any reference to understand the plot and characters of this movie. There's a few cameos and easter eggs fans will pick up on, but the story itself is well contained.Puss in Boots remains a lovable rouge who fights with immense style. Watching him fight and interact with all the characters is great to see, and is held up by the pace and style of the animation. There's tons of details animation buffs will enjoy and is quite unique and smooth even to the non-trained eye.The story takes a little bit to get started, but it's a well paced film once it gets going. I found myself unable to look away from the screen even for a second, as did most of the audience I was watching with. Even pretty young kids in my viewing were glued to the screen and there was not any fidgets or whines coming from them. Everyone wanted to see what would happen next.The movie is rated PG, though are some scenes and dialogue that danced the line as smooth as Puss's tap dancing. There's a group of characters created with a British flare, so don't be surprised if you hear them pushing it a bit. There's also a few themes dealing with mortality and fear, so parents or guardians taking their kids should definitely sit down with them afterwards and go over the movie with them. It may scare some kids, but I think a lot more will appreciate the message.Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun, fast paced adventure featuring the best of Puss and a whole cast of new characters. There's a lot of heart, growth, and beautiful animation that can appeal to anyone, young or old. It's definitely a movie you want to see at least once on the big screen and definitely add to the Shrek collection.If this is a glimpse of what Shrek 5 will be like, then Puss definitely sold me on it!", "Best Animated Movie Of 2022, DreamWorks And League Of Superpets For The Win :)": "The Movie Is About Puss In Boots On His Last Life And He Retires For A Bit, And Goes On A Journey With Kitty Softpaws And Perrito (A New Character In The Shrek/Puss In Boots Franchise, So Puss In Boots Meets Before He Becomes A Lab Cat In Mama Luna's Home A Bounty Hunter Named Death And Hes A Wolf, After That, Puss In Boots Retires and lives as a lab cat in mama Luna's house and he digs a grave for his retire, putting his boots, his cape and etc in the grave and retires for a bit, then he meets perrito, a dog that lives with mama Luna's house, until one day goldilocks and the three bears trie to find puss in boots and bounty hunt him, until finding his grave and thinking he's dead, and they talk about the wishing star map being delivered tonight to no other than jack horner himself by 2 people, so puss and perrito set off to steal the wishing star map, and then they meet up with kitty softpaws (Salma Hayek), she's also trying to steal it, so the three team up together to find the wishing star and goldilocks and the three bears and jack horner, follows them to get the map of the wishing star, so basically goldilocks wish is to have her family back and jack horners wish is to have all the power and magic in the world, so death is not the true villain in the movie and just leaves after facing off puss, so in the end jack horner is the villain of the movie But he dies at the end after the wishing star map is ripped and the place is destroyed, this movie is my favorite Shrek/puss in boots movie and the best Shrek/puss in boots movie we've gotten in the last 18 years (Shrek 1 & 2), and the movie has animation like the movie spider verse and I was thrilled by it, this movie is a 100/10 movie for me, and best animation movie of the year.", "Fantastic": "The villains all have their own purpose in the story and the characters are well fleshed out through 1 hour and 40 minutes. The mix of serious tones along with comedic relief allow this film to touch your emotions on all ends. The dog seems to be the annoying comedic relief sidekick, almost like a wannabe donkey, but serves a great purpose in the film and has one of the most emotional moments too. I have watched this probably 3 to 4 times already and can't get enough of the vibrant and precise animations that were used, inspired by the success of Spiderman: into the spiderverse, and that animation can be original and different. This movie is exciting will a possible tease at the future of this franchise.", "A new hope": "Being a sequel to a movie about a supporting character.... I wasn't expecting much, until I started listening to the reviews and opinions about this one, I definitely wasn't expecting this level.The script is zany, witty and full of heart as it deals with important topics like trusting those close to you, finding purpose, fear of death, loneliness and even mental health. And it tackles these topics in ways that are always understandable for all ages, but never insultingly simplified.What I also didn't expect were the action sequences, they are very well choreographed and beautifully animated, I also appreciate that the film was at times scary and violent, while still being a film for all ages, it makes for a more complex story with real weight on the characters.Puss in Boots 2 takes the resources and adapts them to a mature story in the midst of the crazy world of Shrek, resulting in a gorgeous film of the kind I haven't seen in a while, it really is one to watch at the cinema.I think this film shows a growth in DreamWorks both visually, it left me sincerely surprised, as in maturity of the plot, a dark story, for the whole family with an intelligent humor, at the level of their classic gems, I hope this is the new direction for DreamWorks.", "Amazing movie!": "This movie is simply incredible. It has an amazing combination of emotions, humor, and stunning animations that can make you both laugh and cry. I honestly believe it surpasses Shrek in its quality. Dreamworks has done an exemplary job here, and I'm hoping to see more of their work in the future. Puss in Boots was an especially delightful surprise, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him in future productions. I don't often take the time to write reviews, but this movie definitely deserved one. Antonio Banderas was also spectacular in his role. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and believe that it's an absolute must-watch.", "Surprisingly good": "Being in no way a natural fan of animation movies, this was a great positive surprise.The beggining is quite normal and kind of normal for what I would expect from this kind of movie, but already in the first fight the animation shows the special attention and willingness to make something \"new\" for mainstream animation movies. They incorporated aspects of anime and HQs really well and made it quite unique in my memory.The storytelling was nice too, bringing other fairy tales that i didn't even know about.Overall a heartwarming movie, great to watch in a relaxed day with family, friends or alone.", "Shockingly Good": "I am a 24yr old female who watched this with my 45yr old mother. Neither of us like animated kids films. You literally couldn't pay me to watch films like Finding Nemo, Monster House, Walle, etc. The only animated film I watch is Monster House and Polar Express once year 5yrs.But some how the commercials really drew me into this movie.This film had me and my mom laughing out loud like children!!! I could (and probably will) watch it 1-2 more times.I gave it a 9/10 because the ending was just slightly boring for me.... But truly great film!!! Great comedy!I would purchase this on DVD.If you're doubting, go see it!!!!", "Beautiful visuals, great message, strange plot twists": "The quality of the visuals and effects in this movie truly were dazzling. The biggest flaw in this movie is that in the end, the big bad guy makes a very strange decision which kind of pulls the rug underneath the story.But otherwise - the characters have a great journey and are a lot of fun to watch. The jokes made us laugh, the action scenes were intense, and the allegory made us think. This movie really tackles how we see ourselves, how we should live our lives, set goals, and tackle challenges. Specifically with regards to performance expectations and anxiety. I want to have an emotional support dog now.Our ratings were:\nY 8\nH 9\nD 8\nO 5.3.", "Voice acting and story was fine, animation was lacking": "Was it just my theater? The action scenes appeared like they made fewer images so the movie seemed very jumpy. Did they run out of money to create the animation required? It was like they were trying to go anime style but it gave me a bit of motion sickness because it was so poorly executed. Still love Antonio Banderas! He and Selma Hayek made this movie great. The story had some scary moments in it for my 4 year old granddaughter but overall it's pretty tame as far as kids movies go. The other two granddaughters 6 & 8 seemed to enjoy it very much. I had hoped for an ending credits scene but there was none.", "Wow. It really is that good.": "What a fantastic surprise. I know I know it really is that good.Without giving anything away it was fun, action packed, humourous, thrilling and with amazing characters to boot.Probably one of the best animations I've seen in years, oh and watch out for the wolf he was menacing! He has to be the best animated villain to date without a shadow of a doubt. It was like a watching a Western on speed, fantastic the way the creators managed to keep the thrills going from start to finish. Absolutely relentless.I've got to be honest, I only went to see it with my son whilst my daughter and her friends went shopping. I certainly didn't expect this! Wow what can I say.It has been given a PG rating I can see why. There are some mild swear words but the wolf is quite imposing.Go see it you won't be disappointed.", "Wow!": "I can't remember having so much fun watching an animated movie in years. I tuned in expecting another mediocre sequel, just like most of the sequels we've been getting lately, but boy was I wrong! I had one hell of a time watching, and it was an amazing experience overall. The characters are fun, and thank God we finally have a villain who is not following some philosophy or purpose and is bad just for the sake of being bad! Other characters were also absolutely lovely, especially the wolf, who was definitely one of the most iconic characters in animated movies. Kudos to DreamWorks and the awesome people behind this work of art. Keep up the good work.", "It was a creative movie": "Way better then the first one it's a interesting movie to watch you like how it feel everything about it. . Yeah that's true I think it's just like a new one lol but it's just like that one time with me and my family primo that's why I'm going on the other one lol and I'm so proud of you and you I can't wait to see what I can see what I mean by you doing right I don't want you in my mind I love that I don't know what to say but is it that you can talk about it and say that you don't have anything to do with that you don't know how you feel about that but you don't know how much I appreciate this movie it's amazing.", "The Puss in Oz": "This is basically The Wizard of Oz remastered with Puss in Boots characters. Do not get me wrong, it is a lovely message and all and it's nice for kids, but I would've expected a more original idea... specially from the creators of Shrek. And comparing it with the first Puss in Boots movie, this could've been so much better. It feels like a regular movie that could've been played by pretty much any other animated character. I feel like it was missing all the cool jokes, it felt very basic.SPOILERS: So basically this is an epic journey for a wish where the characters discover they had what they needed all along...", "Excellent script with many meaningful messages": "This movie got all my attention during 1h43' thanks to the excellent script. Each character is unique in its own way, charming & attractive whether it is a villain or a hero. The most special is the little dog Perrito, who looks dazed but super cute with his philosophical sayings & a bright, warm heart. Although the film is for kids, it has many extremely meaningful messages for adults to reflect:\nWe can't love anyone if we only love ourselves.Sometimes we already have what we wish for without even realizing it.We don't need 9 lives like a cat, just live 1 life to the fullest.I would have given this movie a 10/10 if it had had better soundtracks.", "Greatest Movie of this year so far!": "This movie contained a flowing and smooth plow till begging till end. Every character has the perfect set of time to really enjoy and feel connected to each and on of the characters. This also includes the origin of the characters explaining their actions and building up their personality. This movie shows that everything has a reason basically they used objects that were first shown in the movie. Something especially remarkable is how they touched every little detail they could to make this movie meet all the expectations expected. It shows a great and heartwarming message. This movie is a great start to this new year of movies!", "Surprisingly Better Than Expected!": "I'm incredibly shocked by Dreamworks and how they animated this movie, the colors the designs of the characters! I loved all of it. I'm not going to lie, I came into this movie thinking that it's not gonna be that good. Normally sequels don't always beat the original. This one certainly did. It goes hard with its theme and I think it does a great job with it. The villains are well made and one in particular is down right terrifying, arguably one of the best villains I've seen in a long time. I feel like this is a movie that both kids and adults can watch! Great job Dreamworks, I can't wait to see more from you!", "It's not that deep, it just seems deep": "I consider it a sore to write a review on a movie like this as it was so underwhelming and banal that it doesn't deserve any review or rating except a simple thought after you've finished it \"It's so dull, I'm not gonna watch it again.\" I didn't intend to watch it because everything nowadays exposes itself in the trailer about how generic it's going to be, but seeing all the good reviews and excitement and fanarts I decided to watch it. Not because I thought it's going to surprise me, but because I thought it's too suspicious for people to literally glorify an animated movie made today, especially one that didn't look promising. Since there are so many viewers praising and praising and praising and overanalyzing the \"depth\" of this movie, it's an irony for me who doesn't want to give a second thought to this movie to write a review about it\nbut think maybe it would be good to leave one to counter all that praise, not out of spite, but to shine a bit light on what I think makes this movie not that great and why it doesn't deserve all the hype.Puss in boots' narrative has an interesting premise, you know it from the summary, but is it executed well? No. It's not an issue that the wolf, the most (seemingly) intriguing character among all barely had a screentime, the issue is that they waste that screentime on characters that have no importance to the story or connection to the main character other that being an obstacle to reach the star when they could've given it to the wolf or some more worthy characters. They have their own backstories which don't play a huge role in the movie or enough to make me give a damn about them. The importance of the backstories lasts for only couple of minutes. The rest of the characters' screentime is filled with quarrels and dialogues that don't reveal any depth to them than we already know. As someone who hasn't seen the first movie, this one doesn't introduce Kitty Softpaws as anything other than Puss in Boots' acquaintance and ex-fianc\u00e9e. She is tough and that's all I know about her now. Everyone loves Perrito, even people who dislike this movie, but for me he is a dumbed down version of Donkey. As I remember, Donkey is a happy-go-lucky character who despite his troubles and rejections, he is not extremely oblivious and serves as a good moral support to Fiona and Shrek in their moments of crisis where he becomes the more reasonable out of them, while Perrito is completely oblivious to how annoying he is to the characters around him and what kind of intentions they have towards him. His moral support is basically platitudes and quotes/advices on mental health copy-pasted from social media's psychology coaches, a trend I see too often in modern movies. A touch on mental health topic is not bad. What is bad that your touch on it does not have originality and Twitter users are your best scriptwriters for it. The Fairy Godmother did not tell Cinderella that \"Nothing bad lasts forever, every storm is temporary, sunny days will come.\", she told her \"Even miracles take a little time.\" and that's the simple originality that it's so hard for current scriptwriters. Big Jack Horner has a disturbing, ugly design and aura together with his bakers or pastry chef's and I don't see the greatness in him as a villain except that he wants power and he doesn't care if people die, but there are so many villains like that and they are labelled as evil for the sake of being evil. Him being a previously unnoticed good theatre kid is not a big driving force in this story. Most interesting thing about him is that he has huge collection of various fairytale items he can use to obtain his goals. Goldilocks has a beautiful backstory, but you can't notice that she has any inner struggle about having a bear family except in those couple of minutes in the dark forest where she reminisces of the time she fell asleep in the bears' house and when she admits that her wish is to find a human family. All conflict about it is immediately solved between the family with such quick positive response from her bear mom \"I knew this wasn't going to last. If this is what you want, then we'll make it come true.\". Other than that you can't see any abnormality or problems in them as a family except the fact that they have an adopted human daughter, but this is a fairy tale world so why would we think that's odd? They are all loving towards each other and when they are annoying each other they quickly brush it off and it makes you think they have no problem, only goal - to reach the star.Now, the wolf a.k.a. Death who first appears as a bounty hunter. I agree that he is a scary character and his whistling creeped me out as well as his animation plus character design. But is he a deep character? In my honest opinion, no. He is there to kill Puss in Boots and that's the end of his motive. Explanation for like why does he want to kill him so much to the point of making him anxious is not mentioned as much as I remember. It needs to be mentioned because if he is indeed Death and he was there everytime Puss in Boots died, why would he hunt him so much in his last life when he can just wait for him to make a fool of himself and die? Is Death chasing him a metaphor of reminding Puss in Boots that this will be his final death? I don't know, they don't make it clear especially since everyone can see him as Death and perhaps he is no metaphor. I found everything about him a gimmick to make you think you're watching such a cool, terrifying, interesting villain when in reality he is there to make you scared and that's it. I can see how kids can have nightmares of him and other parts of this movie, like the gore of the bakers dying from big blue flowers and razors or whatever. Really unnecessary.Another of the big flaws in this movie is that they don't need the map. Any\ntime a character has it, the dark forest changes its surface which should make it confusing for the characters that don't have the map to find their way to the star or the way to map. Well, all of them find the way to either of those things without the map either way.Also, this is in Shrek's universe, but I forgot about that during most of the movie and was only reminded through the flashbacks where Shrek's characters appear. This doesn't look a bit like Shrek's universe and it puzzles me how other people can see that. I've seen all Shrek's movies and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish doesn't have their spirit either in script or animation which is by the way psychedelic, not fairytale-like.I don't know why they constantly try to come up with new Puss in Boots stories when they haven't even considered the original with the poor boy that inherits the cat, though that doesn't mean that they can do it justice, not nowadays. The character Puss in Boots takes inspiration from Zorro, the most memorable role of Antonio Banderas for me, but it's disappointing how The Mask of Zorro which is certainly not perfect, but has great effort in directing and dialogue has such a low score compared to Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Some may say that it's stupid to compare the standard of what makes an excellent animated movie for kids to that of regular movies, but how can you raise the value of animation if you frequently make it or intend it for kids? This doesn't even look intended for kids, that's a point to remember. I'm not against people who think this is a good movie, there's always going to be someone that's easily satisfied, what actually bothers me is that the majority declares it a masterpiece. But as that word is thrown around to the point of losing its meaning there is nothing to be confused about, I guess. As others who have rated this movie low or same as me, I agree that the reasons for the high reviews and ratings can be bots or simply that the bar for movies is low these days. Older actually enjoyable movies have ratings lower than these \"masterpieces\" perhaps because there were many more quality movies you can choose from and it was unfair to give 10, 9 or 8 stars just like that when there were movies better than them, but now when you're jumping from one bad movie to another those that have something more exciting or meaningful than all the awful ones will seem like a masterpiece to you...Especially animated movies. It's sad and I will not agree that animation has progressed. In other words, when you have constant access to water you'll never drink from a puddle, but when your throat and mouth are dry and you haven't tasted water for a long time, a puddle will taste like fresh water.My conclusion: maybe a fine movie for some, but certainty not a deep masterpiece.", "Best (kids) movie of 2022": "This movie is the best (kids) movies of 2022. The reason why I put \"kids\" in parentheses is because this movie can be enjoyed by both kids and adults alike. I am an adult that found this movie really good, funny, and heartwarming.There are scenes that almost made me cry, and countless scenes that made me laugh. This story is also neatly constructed, with many characters and twists. Yet it doesn't feel bloated.Not to mention the animation is amazing. It looks like a magical pop up book. It somewhat resembles Spider Verse, but it definitely takes its own twist on that type of stylization.If you are an adult who saw the trailer and was worried about the dog character, worry no more. The dog wasn't annoying at all. He was endearing and had an actual purpose to being in the movie.In conclusion, this movie is great. I've seen it twice now, and I don't regret it at all. I want it to make as much money as possible. You should too because it is phenomenal!!", "BEST KID MOVIE IN 2022": "PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH\nThis movie is one of my childhood memories and I absolutely excited for this sequel of puss in boots.its still with the same voice actor, Antonio Banderas as puss, Salam Hayek as kitty and many more. With budget of 90 million, this is gonna be a bombastic and full of new things.this studio also has produce bad guys, kungfu Panda and how to train your dragon. Without further rido, here is my opinion about this movie:the graphic is pretty good from the other sequel and the animation is rendered perfectly but the monster scene is a bit canny and kinda laggy.The comedy in this movie is timed perfectly and suitable for kids\nit shows that how to cherish our life's and aware that we live once. This movie also a bit emotional.The plot is scripted perfectly and the action is in point not forget about the angle in this movie is magnificentcinemotography is kinda good and I always laugh in the cinema\nwell if you need to understand the movie more you need to watch the first sequelits also have many Easter egg about the previous movie collection and that make this movie really fantastic\nthe graphic is been fusion using a comic tone and sketches make the movie nostalgicthe ending has biggest plot twist ever and this is totally recommended for all people and agesRating:\nPlot:6/10\nGraphic:9/10\nImpression:8/10.", "Wholesome and awesome": "The movie was so wholesome and awesome, colorful and entertaining. Not a moment of boredom. Loved the new characters, loved the animation style and loved the simplicity of the story. Magical elements were so funny. Surprisingly violent and foul which only made it more compelling. Gotta say that my expectations were high but it did not disappoint. Easily one of the best animations nay best movies I seen lately. It is hard to deliver such a strong sequel story. Puss in boots himself had a strong character development and the villain made him even sweeter. And yes, even though the villain has to be the best animated villain I've seen for the past decade. For a animated sequel movie, it delivered! Big time!", "I went in with no expectations...": "I did not like the first movie, found it dull and generic, decent enough to pass the time but nothing worth going out of your way to watch. Hence, I went into the sequel without any expectations especially of it being any good. I was aware of the hype around it even though I tried to avoid it. Checked it out eventually and was very pleasantly surprised.The beginning was more of the same as the first movie but it changed gears a few minutes in and I felt myself getting engrossed in the story. As it went on, more characters were introduced who added so much to an already strong main cast and were beautifully and subtly developed throughout the runtime. The animation is sublime, the voice acting is so much better than the first movie which was still pretty good.The story is extremely well paced and the character development is brilliantly portrayed, meshing perfectly with said development.This gets a strong recommendation because of the strong characters and a beautiful story!", "A must Watch...": "I find it incredible when a movie or show that was made for kids is able to grab an adults attention. Sometimes the best movies or shows are ones that can grab the attention of anyone. Puss in Boots accomplishes this and more. It still has those lighthearted scenes a kids movie needs, however it is also funny and has themes that are not common in a kids movie. Themes such as the fear of death and panic attacks. They incorporated it in a way that actually works very well and is impressive. They were also able to create a main antagonist that is actually scary. With subtle things such as puss's hair raising, the whistling, and even the voice actor all builds on his character. Puss undergoes real character development and you can clearly see this change in the way he perceives himself and the world around him. A great watch whether its with your family or just by yourself give it a try.", "Quite simply BRILLIANT!": "This film has renewed my faith in movie making. There are still some really talented people out there, there must be. This film is a testament to it. I was really taken aback by how good it was.There is so much in this film, so many references, so many tangents it could well have veered off on, but it didn't. It held itself together perfectly.All the characters were well rounded, remarkably so. I wouldn't be surprised if other films were made off the back of the rich pickings found in this film. By this I mean in regard to the attractiveness of the personalities it so clearly defined.I haven't seen a film of this calibre for quite some time.Well done.", "An astonishingly good sequel": "MOVIE REVIEW -PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH\nTotal score: 9/10I don't even know how to begin writing this review. I'm still feeling the trace this movie left on me.**ANIMATION AND VISUALS**\nAbsolutely stunning and on point. The animation style matched the feeling of the frame but at the same felt so well bound together. Like for example in the scenes where the main emotion was downright bone chilling, you could stand feel your hairs standing up as the one's of Puss in boots'. The low frame rate at times made the movie feel like the fairytale experience that the story was actually telling. The way the fur was made was astonishingly simple yet believable for the movie's perspective, the flow and the movement was clean despite the frame count. The colour palettes and the whole colour theory in general was very well put together in the whole piece, even when they transitioned from one to another completely contradictory to each other. The details were as many as to you could clearly see what's happening in the character's eye reflection when there were close-ups.**CHARACTER DEPTH AND DEVELOPMENT**\nFirst thing I have to give credit for is that even the character's intonation and accent was thought of so they got the character depth down to that little detail. Each and every of them was severely distinguishable compared to one another. The character of the death was actually very well put in perspective because when in the end he gave up on killing Puss in boots that distinctively shows how if you are no longer after of the end you will be able to simply enjoy it as it is, not the fast and unappreciated life, but one where you are grateful for everything you already have. Which also put the development of Puss' on first place, and Kitty coming in second, their mutual realisation and confession actually made the overused \"happy ending\" trope meaningful. I can't not speak of Perrito's character because it was clearly the most down to earth, positive creature that lives in that vile world, his impact was massive on viewing how someone can stay happy and innocent. It's important to acknowledge his story that no one asked for until they were near the middle of the screen time, and he didn't brag about it, he told it as this \"funny story\" without realising how horribly gut wrenching it sounded making him the pure, gold hearted character that shows everyone they can be better even with such a life story behind him. The three bears and Goldy also supported the theme of being grateful for that you already have as stated earlier in this review.**SCRIPT WRITING**\nThe most lovely part is that the development was like a non stop progressive movement that felt as if the time passed by quicker than it was in reality. And the last 20 minutes of the movie felt so intense that you would stare at the screen at the edge of your seat without time to process or to question whatever is going on you just sit and experience it. The only little flaw I experienced is that I wished there was a few more scenes inbetween the moment when Puss escaped the \"place of the lost souls\" and him reaching the star, but it was still good. The fact the whole movie revolved around the idea of the perfect ending, but then destroying what it built up to made the writing style very outstanding for a \"child's movie\". And on top of that it still had that exact \"perfect ending\" but in a different, more moral and meaningful way. On top of that the whole production had a very high emotional impact on the viewers. At a time I dropped a tear or two I admit, but that only meant to me that the movie was getting better and better.**CONCLUSION**\nThis instantly became my favourite animation of all time bot only because of the beautiful visuals, but also the genius writing of the movie.", "PERFECT IN EVERY WAY!": "Seriously, it's just perfect. The first episode was also entertaining, but the sequel just blew my mind. Puss in Boots just grown to be the best spin-off movies in the Shrek universe. The animation - which is slightly reminded me Into The Spiderverse, which I also love - is just candy for the eyes. The plot was well crafted, it just glued me to the screen. The character development of Puss is just spot on. Perfectly emotional, fun and filled with action. Well done DreamWorks. Looking forward what's coming up in the near future for them. If they manage to make Shrek 5 this much fun, DW will be the best animation studios out there imo.Please go and watch it, this movie and DreamWorks deserves the support!10/10.", "Absolutely wonderful film and animation": "I absolutely loved the concept and animation, it is executed so beautifully and the frame rate makes it satisfying to watch. It's an original with such an unexpected storyline. The fighting scenes are done amazingly well and even the music is great. Reminds me of Attack on Titan. Usually, I am unwilling to watch a movie because many are unentertaining however this film caught my eye and kept my attention the whole time. I would definitely recommend this movie to audiences of all ages but more towards the younger generation. Overall, the movie was a stunning masterpiece. If you are a cat lover and are into cute animation, this film is for you!", "Finally, modern animation is on the right path.": "Me - I'm a fellow who couldn't get along with the 3D works of this century for the longest time. I am a fan of the lavish hand drawn animation of the '50s, and far more appreciate the slow pace and the dark, serious tones they present, as well as their hidden cleverness and the superb attention to detail in them.But this? Hell yeah, I can really get behind something like this too! It oozes with style and detail and, for the first time in forever, it's not a movie plagued by lifeless and tasteless \"modern audience\" material that has poisoned the industry for far too many years now.I loved almost everything about this movie. The dark tones scattered around were a delight, and the cuteness inserted wasn't really bad at all. I wish Perrito wasn't so... exaggerated, though. I understand the meaning behind him; that he's the embodiment of loyalty because he's a doggo, but still. And I'd have loved more of that stylized animation style! It wasn't enough! It really helped set it apart!The villains were also great, each with their own motivations. But god-damn, whoever designed Death, must really love Dark Souls/Sekiro, because that's the kind of character design I'd expect in those type games. It was my favorite thing from the movie. It was just right!Can't forget the references to Pinocchio, the bears, \"you only had one job!\", and the telegraphed attack of Horner. Good stuff!9/10 - should've been longer (I feel the bond between Softpaws and Puss didn't receive enough attention, felt a little rushed), Perrito could've been toned down a just a little bit, and the stylized 2.5D animation should have received more screen time.Verdict: Absolutely solid movie. Great for the whole family.", "Why?????": "Why??? Why did the internet tell me that this is good? And most importantly, why in the hell is it now, that you cant even watch a cartoon, a cartoon about a cat, without beeing traumatized?? I honestly hate it here, I cant believe that nowadays serious means bad and sad and traumatizing, and not serious also means the same?? Also, really dont recommend it to children because some scenes are abnormally scary for a cartoon.... But oh well, I must be the stupid one to think that watching puss in boots gonna be a lighthearted program for the night. And I dont care what is the ending, I dont need a happy ending after a horrible movie, I need a nice movie.", "Great": "Puss in Boots is back and with it came one of the best animations of recent years. Paradoxically......who expected from the second Kocour just filler for cinemas? Probably most. But that is a big mistake. The second part came with the animation of Into the Spider-Verse, familiar characters and above all.......a great dark story. There is no shortage of humor and exaggeration, but as one of the few animated films, it even contains horror sequences and adult themes. The central point is the fear of death and the questions surrounding it. She takes the form of a Wolf in the film and is really disturbing to say the least. Related to this is the perfect dubbing where we hear Antonio Banderas aka Kocouro, Selma Hayek as Chichi and the excellent Wagner Ruma as Death, who steals the scenes for himself. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a great sequel to a slightly above average spin-off. It can entertain children and give a powerful and chilling story to adults.", "Puss in boots": "In my opinion the new movie \"Puss in boots\" produced by Mark Swift is one of the best movies in 2023. The travel who Puss in boots, Kitty Softpaws and Perro did were really funny and gripping. The characters are well written. I think a Jack Horner carried the plot.This movie is full of the humorous moments. Durning watching this i often was laughing. The music conveys happy atmosphere. A graphics are fantastic and the voice actor did very good job.If you like movies with a action, travels, friendship and adventures i definitely recommend this film to you. On a scale from zero to five, I give this film a five.", "Perfect": "Perfect. It reflects mortality and enjoying life amazingly. The villains are very well written with one standout in Death. Its humor is nothing short of hilarious. One character in the trailers appears to be annoying, but in the movie provides great humor. Puss and Softpaws also contain some funny arguing that doesn't get annoying. Even some of the villains have great movements like when Jack Horner sacrifices his minions or the banter between Goldilocks and the three bears. Finally the animation is utterly beautiful and on the same level as spider verse. I find this movie to be the best Shrek movie since Shrek 2, and the best animated film of the year.", "I am death, straight up": "God daymn.. animation style is so beautiful, voice actor did amazing job. Story and dialogues both really good. AND the fox. DAYMN, that character was so good, i can still imagine his red eyes and that whistle from the dark... just amazing. Background music is also great, and take away from movie is also mature. Didnt expected it too be this good. I just watched it on weekend to kill time but i am happy that i invested my time init. I watch animes most of the time, and really glad to see past few year's growth of western countries animation series and movies. Will go back to my watchlist now. Until next time.", "The Puss in Boots film we all needed - A beautiful masterpiece.": "The art direction this film took was such a great decision by the film makers. Introducing an almost anime/Ghibli look to many of the scenes and deviating away from 24fps animation and using a more 'traditional' style of animating on 'twos'. This combintion gives the film an almost painterly look and is a joy to watch for the entire running length.The story is well thought out and the pacing of the film is perfect (in my opinion). The only reason it missed out on that last star (pun intended) is I think they could have gone a little further with the story to make it a little less predictable... but this is me propely hunting for something wrong.Go see this film. You won't be disappointed!", "The Best DreamWorks has been since the first How To Train Your Dragon": "The obvious first standout offcourse is the gorgeous art design and direction taking the footsteps of the likes of Spiderverse and Arcane, accompanied with jaw dropping scenery, vibrant colours and hand drawn aesthetics that embrace the wacky and over exaggerated nature of the fairy-tale world perfectly presenting it like we've never seen it before, and I love how both the plot and action take advantage of them remarkably to create both some truly haunting and beautiful imagery, especially THE ACTION which as soon as you see frames dropping, you know some serious stuff is about to come down, as they completely soar with outstanding direction, unbelievable angle positions, phenomenal choreography, snapy and fluid shots, impeccable pacing and a ton of up lifting energy that whether it is a giant Shadow of the Colossus looking set piece or a simple confrontation between two characters, there was never a moment where something new wasn't being brought up to the table in terms of visuals, humour and details, bringing even some of the best action films to shame with its amount of creativity, charm and substance. Not to mention a well written script that understands perfectly what made the first two films so special, full of quotable lines, layered and surprising jokes that rarely miss and satisfying payoffs for almost every single character, plot line or event it introduces, that greatly balances the mockumentary aspects with more emotional and dramatic beats never feeling like one overestimating the welcome of the other, and both of these haven't been this greatly utilised since Shrek 2, from antagonising good characters to providing a genuine look at how a panic attack plays out and how to deal with it correctly (which brought me to such tears, like damn what a scene ). It is also wonderful to see the film continue the franchise tradition and deliver with banger musical numbers like Fearless Hero and Por qe te vas (which quickly became one of my go to songs to cry to) accompanied by a great western like score helping separate it from the rest of the franchise.Although, the most surprising aspect for me personally is definitely how great the story and narrative turned out to be executed, as well as how they weren't afraid to go harder and deeper into both their themes and characters that completely left me speechless. I never would have thought Puss in Boots out of all of Shrek's characters was going to have the most unique and complex character development cycle, as his self centered and arrogant behaviour has left him with only one life left, throughout the ups and downs of the wonders of the Black Forest, he will come with terms how fragile his former lives really were and how to make the most of the life he has left, as well as overcome his fear of mortality and accept the inevitability of death, caused by a special someone I'll talk about later, bringing such a unique contrast to it's previous appearances, as well as a new emotional layer to his character making him even more likeable and relatable than before, which is also elevated by Antonio Banderas's best vocal work to date as he brings even more charm, quip and nuance to the role better than he ever did before. Kitty Softpaws and Perrito also took my by suprise with their development and arcs as well, with Kitty actually having a proper strong personality and arc of learning how to open up to people and earn their trust, compared to her quite one noted appearance in the first film, as well as Salma Hayek doing a much better voice job matching Antonio's energy phenomenally, and Perrito who managed to avoid the annoying comedy relief sidekick treatment by having a very distinct and loving personality who's curious and wonderful attitude and outlook on the world around him have such a wholesome impact both on the narrative moving forward and helping Puss, Kitty and even Goldilocks soften up to other people in their lives.It is also incredibly impressive to see the films story juggle between three different antagonists simultaneously without feeling overstuffed and unfocused, with each of them having proper characterization and impeccable on screen presence each in their own right. I love how Goldilocks and the three bears are represented both as an obstacle for our main trio yet are still given proper emotional story beats about acceptance and family inclusion implying that they are not really evil, but the desire for the wish let them come out as such, and it definitely helps that their chemistry and banter with one another is very charming and entertaining to watch throughout, that is even further improved by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Ray Winston giving out great and sweet performances enhancing the family dynamic. And on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, I really enjoyed Jack Horner being presented as an irredeemable bastard with zero qualities and how self aware of that fact he is, who's main purpose to further embrace the mockumentary aspect brought up some genuinely funny dialogue every time he appeared, especially his conversations with Jiminy Cricket, and was by far the most hilarious part of the film.But truly the absolute standout and one of the main reasons why this film was as good as it was is the character of Wolf, also referred to as Death, and I don't mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or any other fancy way. He is Death straight up!, and OH MY I am so much in awe with how outstanding of an antagonist he is! From the phenomenal design, incredible flighting style, the menacing dialogue that makes even comedic lines scary, the bone chilling Twisted Nerve like whistle every time he appears, to his unsettling yet charming voice fantastically done by Pablo Escobar himself Wagner Moura, every single aspect about him added up to such a mesmerising and intimidating stage presence that completely tonal shifted the film in the best way possible with his every appearance, bringing up Heath Ledger's Joker levels of terror, insanity and composure I haven't felt from an animated villain other than Coraline's Other Mother. And just like with Goldi, I also adore the fact that Death is treated more like an antagonist rather than a full blown villian, as he's pretty much just doing his job, and due to Puss's irrational behaviour that disrespects the meaning of life as well as the fact that he is annoyed by the idea of nine lives as a way of escaping him, it would make perfect sense why he went to hunt and take his last life seeing him as unworthy and selfish, only to realise he had played with his food long enough for Puss to grow and take in the fact that he isn't truly untouchable, leading to a PHENOMENAL CLIMAX that is up there with Nope when it comes to best final acts of the year with how satisfying, moving and creatively it concluded. Easily one of my favourite antagonists not just in animation, but film in general!I feel like I can be here for days spitting everything I loved about The Last Wish, from significant character moments, to choreography details or talking about Death for another four paragraphs, but I don't think any kind of writing can translate how much pure joy this film provided me with, as well as not wanting to spoil the film as I encourage everyone to give it the love and support it rightfully deserves. 10/10.", "My new favorite movie": "I absolutely love it! My new favorite movie (I'm 20 lol). It features a different animation style for the epic action scenes which helps with the immersion. As I said, it has amazing action, it has humor, the puns, the quips, the funny performances. As I said, it has immersion especially with the emotions, both romantic and psychological. And great drama enough for adults and kids.Few tiny plot holes, I'd say plot slight cracks, here and there but can't have it all.And Papa Bears voice was scarier (Imo) so I think he should've played the Death Wolf, or someone with a slightly deeper voice.", "Funny and entertaining": "A funny and entertaining movie. There's so much action scenes and the story development is well thought out and written. Puss in boots character ensures entertaining the audience. You will be entertained by old and new characters, even nostalgic ones which the writers blown fresh air into.Children, teens and adults can watch this movie. It makes for a great family movie.There's also scary moments in the movie that might scare kids under the age of six. This movie also have hidden life lessons within the movie which children and grown ups can learn from. A definite movie to put on your watchlist.", "Best animated movie": "I am suprised about how good this movie actually turned out to be. I'm 20 years old and I never write reviews, but I felt like I have to. I'm sad that this movie is not getting the recognition it deserves, that's why I want to help out a little how I can hahahah This movie truly made me more emotional than Avatar 2 and it's a kids movie. It was dark but heartfelt, funny but serious. It was also interesting to see how accurate they potray panic attack, which I have not seen in children's movie before. Also the animation, it was so beautiful and artistic. The characters were great and the Puss in boots himself, had great character development. Overall, I loved everything except one tiny thing, the song after the movie did not fit and it sounded quite annoying, I'm not judgy about songs usually but it just threw me off a bit hahah but that's the only tiny flaw, that I don't think you can call it a flaw really, when everything else has clearly outshined it. So that's why I'm still giving 10/10 for this outstanding animation.", "Best movie in 2022, go watch it!": "This is literally the best movie of 2022 and one of the best from DreamWorks. When I saw the trailer I could already tell that the animation was going to be amazing, and it completely blew my expectations away. Its an absolutely gorgeous movie.From a story perspective it's also that good. There is the perfect number of characters, villains and friends. There isn't too much comedic relief or not enough, it's just exactly right.I can only recommend this movie for everyone, no matter the age. It's just the perfect movie.If you have the time to watch it, absolutely do, otherwise you'll miss the absolute best movie of this year.", "Really Good": "One of the best movie that released in 2022. I really enjoyed this movie even i never watched all of Shrek franchise neither first puss in boots movie. Somehow i never interested to those movie, then i just watched this movie and thankfully this is almost perfect.Compared to another Dreamworks movie that realeased in the same year : the bad guys, this movie is just better in almost everything. There are not much plot twist, Big Jack Horner is a real bad guy, the wolf is just \"Death\" straight up, perito is an annoying, kind and dumb character and Goldi is another wish Hunter that make the movie just better. The animation is simply better. The story is Good, very easy to understand as the way it should.Things that sadly miss in this film is the fighting scene especially when Jack Horner there. It's kinda too violence for a child movie.Conclusion, it's one of the best animated movie especially that released recently, very easy to understand, good story, good character, good animation, very worth to watch.", "He Is my favorite fearless hero": "If you haven't watched this film, do yourself a luxurious favor by gifting your eyes the pleasure of viewing this cinematic masterpiece. And the rest of this review is just gonna be random because it needs 400 more characters. Sorry. It starts now, and it will take about an L for the next few weeks before it gets too late for the rest the year for the next one in my opinion on this project and I hope it works for the next couple months and I will get it to the point I am going with a more solid foundation that will allow the rest to go away in a couple months or two months time to be fully healed... there sorry :)", "Perfect sequel": "You can clearly see that they worked very hard on this film. The pacing is great and Ithink they got some inspiration of \"Spiderman into the spider verse\". The animation is new and fresh. Also not forgetting the first film and how he got the boots but it is also a film you can watch without ever watching the first one. The voice actors really did a great job of portraying their characters. The characters are build very well and got a lot of dimension. Especially Death every time i heard the whistle i would get chills. Its great that they straight up said \"he is death\". It's for young and old to enjoy and a great set up for the next shrek movie.", "A great second movie :)": "An well crafted second movie from Dreamworks studios that's has the charm from the new and old character's:)Cool animation, good story and well blended dark and light elements. We went to looked at it when it was children's day at the cinema. 7+ is recommended because it's little scary moments for younger a children and a more mature storytelling than the previous film. But my family enjoyed the second film, and the message from the movie's storytelling when through because they talked about it all day of both the good decisions and the scary moments all day long :)Recommended movie to watch together with younger children och older, if you like me enjoyed Puss in boots:)", "Good story telling.": "Well, Well, Well, have we finally got back to good story telling? Seems more animated stories better written that live action these days.Normally sequels often fall short of original, this firm does not.Not complex story just fun and heart warming. Worth seeking out and watching.Why 9 not 10 stars, only due to being sequel not original.Not sure mix the animation styles like \"into the spider verse\" was needed and did not add anything to the story.Have to feel sorry for Death and dealing with cats and 9 lives. But could be worse and be a squirrel (e.g. Conker) Gregg the Grim Reaper \"squirrels can have as many lives as they think they can get away with.\"", "Unoriginal script, animation just about saves the day": "We are a cat family so we do enjoy comedies featuring cars. My wife and I were hoping that it'd be as good as the first one. Unfortunately the structure of the story line, maybe too many characters to fit, meant we couldn't get into it. Very few funny scenes and most of them were lofted from the previous movie.The animation is mostly nice but at times it felt cheap. It felt a half way of some of the 3D TV cartoons and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse.Hollywood has lately been giving us too much style/packaging over substance in the past few years. Pixar is an example of that and it's a shame to see this franchise going the same way.", "The first movie in a while that I enjoyed.": "The art style is beautiful and the cool shading mix with such warm saturated hues made me just mesmerized- I love how they're going for a more paint-like art style aaa. And the characters are just so fun especially Puss. He goes from a narcissistic cat who believed that he was an immortal because of his legend who also works alone to a humbled hero who will risk it all for the ones he loves. The side characters are also really cool and funny but like... JUST GO WATCH IT PLEASE if Shrek 5 will look like this or maybe even with more neutral tones, I'm all for it! I won't spoil it so please please go watch it in the theaters.", "Simply a masterpiece, a worthy sequel!": "In this new adventure it shows that Puss in Boots has lost 8 of his 9 lives. And who breaks the news is the Big Bad Wolf! To get their lives back, the Cat must go to the Dark Forest to find a Wishing Star.However, it's not just Cat who is looking for the Wishing Fountain: Goldilocks, the Three Bears and Jack Horner are also interested in targeting the star.Puss in Boots easily surpasses the original, with an animation with a lot of visual identity and a lot of creativity; delivering a familiar and simple, yet absurdly engaging story.Characteristic that even denotes the way in which the feature walks to its apex, always expanding the scenery with more and more vibrant and fascinating colors.They make this sequence simply amazing!Puss in Boots 2, is a film that would easily win the Oscar handily.", "I hated it's first 8 minute but then it started to get better and better": "I hated it's first 8 minute,\nToo much color,\nFast movements,\ntoo much pattern plus music...\nfor me was a mess which was hurting my eyes and ears and my head was spinning but then it started to get better and better.Beautiful concept,\nAmazing story line,\nAdorable characters,\nLoved the villains, Specially the wolf (death) He was super cool and far from cliche villains,\nMany amazing art frame worthy scenes,\nwith a strong and meaningful message,\nThankfully not much of stupid singing,\nSome really funny scenes,\nIt could have easily become another cheezy storyline that we have seen over and over again but it was handled very well,Great work.Loved it.", "A must watch!": "Finally! A kid's movie with a worth-it plot with great characters and a lesson. Seeing my childhood characters on screen again was so nostalgic and fulfilling! I was not a fan of the animation (comic book style, is it?) probably because I grew up seeing Puss in the Shrek style animation, but it was outstanding considering how animation styles have changed now. They need to make more movies like this again! (Disney Pixar take notes!) Not everything has to be modern social topics, politics or cupcakes and rainbows.The ending was perfect as well! Brought back so many memories! Maybe we'll see Far Far Away in the near future! (HOPEFULLY)", "Where was Shrek!? \ud83d\ude21": "Yet again another overhyped terrible animated film. No plot, no good characters, no fun or interesting villains, and terrible action scenes. I can already tell this film tried to copy into the spider-verse, but that was a very bad decision. If you want good action look at a movie like Batman and Robin a cinematic masterpiece. The wolf was just a character made for furries. You want a good villain? Go look at Hans from Frozen then you will know what a good villain is. Oh boohoo meow meow oh no only one life left I'm so scared. And what's even worse? No Shrek! \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 I am not kidding when I say that I am truly ogre with these Puss in Boots movies. They somehow made this worse than the first one. At least with the first one and had a good twist villain, but this couldn't even deliver a good villain. And I can't stand when this film tries to be dark. If you want to know how to make a dark film then go look at Shrek the Third and Boss Baby. DreamWorks really needs to learn from their past mistakes such as Kung Fu Panda, Shrek one and two, and How to Train Your Dragon. They have finally been making good movies such as Boss Baby 1 and 2, but they just never learn from their mistakes. \ud83d\ude24", "Your Favorite Fearless Hero": "The Last Wish's breakneck-pace comedy scenes come off as a bit hyperactive for my tastes, maybe because of just how much it's cramming into its 1 hour, 40 minute runtime, but when it wants to be, it is chillingly good. The best scenes are honest to god 10/10 material, executed to near-perfection. In an age when so many animated kids' films always feel the need to make villains somehow sympathetic or relatable to the audience, here we get some real monsters that get to be unapologetically fun and bloodthirsty. And because of that, we get a hero who feels genuinely imperiled. The film is smart. From its absolutely madcap opening sequence that makes Puss in Boots out to be an invincible Looney Tunes cartoon character, we then get a killer introduction to the movie's big bad who doesn't play by those same wacky rules. Puss has his whole world turned upside down in one gripping life or death fight sequence, and must learn for the first time what it means to be a legend who can actually live up to the high, prideful standard he's set for himself. It takes guts to stand up to terror and truly gamble everything one values-there is a subtle morality that infuses the hero's journey here which feels straight out of the most classic spaghetti westerns. But the emotions expressed come off as much stronger and more genuine for our vulnerable protagonist. His journey really brings out his kindness, understanding, fear, depression, and truly epic bravery which might be enough to move you to tears (amazing range from Antonio Banderas here). And it looks and sounds eye-wateringly gorgeous at times, with bits that beg to be paused and admired on re-watch. This is a great movie and one that absolutely deserves all the love (and word-of-mouth hype) it's been getting. I highly recommend you check it out for a vivid, gag-loaded swashbuckling fantasy with a heart of gold.", "10/10 as a Movie not just Animated Movie": "The writing and character development in this movie is phenomenal. The voice acting is the best you will see in animation. This movie has everything, it really does. Most people won't give this movie credit because it is a Puss in Boots movie but it has such creative storylines it is unbelievably enjoyable for everyone. My kids loved it, my wife and I loved it.Might actually go see it again in theaters. The build up of all of the characters in this movie is wonderful. While at the same time they give them all their instinctual animal traits. John Mulaney's character was such a perfect and creative villain.", "Wonderful": "I haven't seen any of the other Puss N Boots movies so can't compare but this one took me by surprise. We had been seeing the trailer for months and it looked mediocre. I honestly did not want to go see this but my 5yr old did so we went to go watch it and hands down one of the best movies I watched all year. The whole family enjoyed it and I would watch it again.It's hilarious, has a great story, heartfelt, and just overall fun to watch. I loved how they brought back some old fairytale characters and it brought me back to my childhood. The best part is that it was under 2 hours and being 9 months pregnant it's hard to sit in one spot for too long so this was perfect.", "This movie is amazing. The art. The meaning. All of it.": "This movie deserves the silver screen any time any ratings out there that are negative... you don't deserve good movies.I will write 600 words just to fill out the minimum capacity for reviews here that I didn't know I needed but this movie is fantastic and I wish more people would go see it because not only is it a movie that \"oh my mom loves puss in boots\" it's a movie for people of all ages and a movie that really \"Moves-Me\". So yeah all kids would love this and I'm sure would be encapsulated by the design of which I \"WISH\" the studio and others will use more prevalently in further films bc the best CINEMATIC UNIVERSE is the SHREKAVERSE officially.", "LOVED this movie !!!!": "The first movie was alright, honestly hard to watch with Humpty's character, but this movie is one of the best i've seen in the past few years!!!So glad they left him out of this. Otherwise it would have ruined it for me. The sequel is 10x better, hopefully they'll make a Shrek 5 with this level of quality. Had me on the edge of my seat watching it too despite being a children + family movie. Adults and children can both entertain themselves with this movie! It's a perfect balance for both.Excited to watch it again when it comes out of cinemas. Plot was solid and the animation brought it all together for me.Easily a 10/10 movie!!!", "A True Masterpiece": "Okay let's just be honest. Puss in Boots 1 wasn't that good. It was lame, a bit boring and had a terrible villian. But Puss in Boots 2 is big step up. The storyline was amazing. It was Dark, Intense and Adventurous at the same time. It was only like an hour and forty minutes, but it was still pure entertainment. The villian, Death, based of the Big Bad Wolf, was horrifying. I do warn you there are jump-scares with Death in it. After all he is the sort of Grim Reaper. The other villians like Goldilocks and the Bears were great too. But not as good as Death, the best DreamWorks villian in my opinion. Can I just say, with Puss's therapy dog, the whole movie just gets 10x funnier. The animation is also pretty decent, though it resembles Into the Spiderverse animation style. Anyways, action is amazing, storyline extremely good and the villian, perfect just absolutely perfect. I strongly recommend watching this film if you like, well... Masterpieces. Young audiences may get jump-scared with Death's scenes, but it's just mild horror. And we'll that's it. Please have a Puss in Boots 3.", "Great experience": "I just love how much care seems to have been put into this movie by everyone involved. The animation was such a treat for my eyes and was gorgeous to watch and felt genuinely inspired. They did a really good job at developing Puss' character as well as Kitty and their relationship with one another. It just feels like a lot of heart was put into this movie and you can really feel it while watching, which is super important to me. This movie can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone thanks to it's mature theming and the people in charge who seemed to really have cared about making this a movie that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. In fact, I would even say that some parents might find that this movie was TOO mature or frightening for their very young children, but that is not inherently a bad thing at all and is entirely on the parents for not doing their research and showing this movie to a child who it isn't suitable for anyway, as this movie has a PG rating I believe. Wether you're 12 years old or a fully grown adult this movie is just such a wonderful experience from start to finish, and I think that's the real beauty of it.", "Really a bundle of fun": "This is one of the best animation that DreamWorks have done - Great story and songs, animation design, colorful, so many deep subjects and well done characters.I loved all the characters, seeing a lot of Latinos voicing the characters is a huge plus! Antonio Banderas as Gato is unique and kept the character's signature, but I have to give kudos to Wagner Moura for voice of the wolf... It's not common to see Brazilian actors behind great productions like this one (if you don't know who he is, please check Narcos on Netflix... He played Pablo Escobar).Puss in Boots - The Last Wish won't let you down, trust me! Worth every penny and second. Kids and adults, mainly adults I will say, gonna love it!", "Shrek can still be good?": "I was really excited when this movie came out and I finally got around to seeing it. First of the animation of this film is beautiful, the watercolor background and the comic style is great. I can say with this and Bad Guys DreamWorks animation is looking up. This story is heartfelt and loving. I can feel Puss's despair when he was on his last life and the unlimited ending message left of well. This movie jugles 3 villains and I can say handles 2 of those 3 great ( goldilocks and the big fat guy) Goldilocks got a good story and the big fat guy got what was coming to him. The wolf however was left on a undeveloped and odd note. He was portrayed as the main threat and Cillian, but really only appears at the beginning and end and throughout as a shadow taunting Puss. One thing about this movie though is that it is hilarious, made me laugh so many times. All the characters are great and have their funny moments. The story is intriguing and exciting. I love this and would 100% recommend.", "Great movie...for a 12 year old.": "This movie is terrifying. You know those movies that we look back at and say, \"that one really messed us up.\" This is that movie for a new generation of kids. I should of have NEVER off have seen it with my 5 year old. It's 9:30 and he's already gotten up once wanting to get in our bed. It really went out of it's way to be extra creepy. Nothing like Shrek. And it's terrifying the whole way through. It's not just like one scene. Great film, but don't go see it with your kids.My review needs more characters...So charachters and other characters that have to go to the same places to make the most...great thanks autofill.", "I just want to analyze the movie here. I love it!": "Yes, I love it!Here is why:Let's start with animation and visuals... Cause it's the best part film! The animation is really fluid, with a lot of movement, personality, it's fast and slow (when it needs), fur animation (rare animation). What I want to say is that is the animation is gorgeous and really different from any other animated film that I watched over the years. Everything that I write here is in principles of animation, like anticipation (character prepares to do an action), slow in and slow out (acceleration of actions) and a lot of other animation things that make this movie out of this world. For me, it's not normal what this movie did with animation, I mean it! And the characters designs are unique as well, with colors vibrant, very well shaped, with different items which makes them distinct from every other character (what is good to understand those characters well), sometimes the designs makes fun of themselves (which I really like)... it's just perfect in every aspect. Production design (Scenarios) is brilliant as well with cartoon designs (like the characters), colors true to color psychology (that is a study about the influence of colors in our brains) and color theory (human perception of colors). Like when the wolf appears and make the screen red to produce the viewer thinking to know that this guy is really DANGEROUS (cause of the red). Well I think that's all in the part of visuals thingy.Now, to storytelling/narrative... It's great as well, but sometimes it's just a little predictable due to conveniences in the story, like when Goldilocks says something o bears and... Pickles (puss in boots) hear the whole conversation... why they say that out loud?? It just doesn't make sense. But it doesn't make the movie bad, it's just a convenience that a lot of movies do, but it's not like one scene, it's a lot BUT, this doesn't make the movie bad, it's normal, it's in the premise of the film, so it's ok. It has good parts to, like in the final (which made me cry, a little XD), cause it's just too beautiful when Puss in boots accepts the friendship with the other characters. And the antagonist is really good too, because I think is so good, and it's really scary sometimes, because of the moment when he shows up, when the main character know that he can die, the moment is perfect! And the girlfriend of the main character shows up in percent time too. She has good timing, great motivation (with past and own philosophies). All characters are really well written (good motivation and past, in general). Actually, maybe Death should have more past and motivations.... only maybe, probably. So in general the movie is well written, not just the characters but the World too. Because it has world building due to fairy tales, it's a meta to those, like the Goldilocks, Little Jack Horner, all the magic in the movie... Is very well done! And the message, that is live the life like if its was the last is really good! They had screen time to do everything they needed but I didn't see the time pass because it's dynamic and very well build! Congratulations to whoever wrote this movie! It's almost perfect!So, now I just want to watch the new Shrek movie that this movie teases with my \"Far Far Away\" logo and the dialogues in the end which makes this movie more perfect!!!!See ya, in the next review! =D.", "It's really good I recommend": "I really like new puss boots movie I hope they do part 2. For some kids it might be scary but it's better what Pixar and Disney do now so I would rather watch this than what Disney and Pixar do Pixar posting LGBTQ+ movies, while I was watching it I had such a cool vibe. Probably DreamWorks gonna earn a lot money from this movie I'm gonna wait untill part two gonna come out I already have watched puss in boots two time when you watching it it gets more better and better I recommend to everyone probably it's best movie in 2023. But for now I'm gonna wait until shrek 5 date release at May 20.....", "I saw how poular it was and I loved it. So imma gonna take a brief look at the antagoints": "One prop is that it didnt treat the audience like children and had genuine subtlety and scary moments. You would assume that 3 antagonists would be overwelming and atleast one would be boring but noo all of them where unique and fun in thier own way.1. Jack Horner\nA unaplologetic, no nonsense, unsypathetic, funny, selfish brat.Jack is the pinnacle of a villan who knows hes evil and rocks it, he is heavily foucused on comedy even more than Goldi and the bears but dont let that fool you he is evil he hoards all the magic items he can get his fat hands on and uses them to kill anything that opposes him. He had a good child hood with only one bad thing and that was that all the kids only cared about the performances and because of that he wants to get all the magic of the world and kill all that dont like him. And its such a creative spin on the first nursery rhyme.He is the pure evil antagonist2. The wolf\nA intimadating, confident and downright scary force.The wolf is the litteral personifaction of death, he is not sympathetic he is not sorry for being who he is. He doesent hate Puss'n boots himself he hates that puss doesent value the lives he spent he hates that puss is so over confident and arrogant that he cant die and in the end he realises that puss has changed and now values his life and he just leaves. The wolf has no backstory because he doesent need one he doesnt even have a complicated personality! But thats what makes him special, he is just death, thats all his purpose is just to make puss change and learn that he is not indomitable.The wolf the force of nature antagonist.3. Goldi and the 3 bears\nThey are sympathetic, fun and each of them have unique characteristics.I am not gonna go to far with them because they are not so simple as the wolf or Jack, but i can say that unlike the wolf they have comedy and unlike Jack Horner they are likable in the good way. I love how the writers made them like just older version of a what if of the original story where goldi was adopted by the bears and raised with brother bear, I loved how fun they were and how much it seemed like they care about eachother. Again im not gonna go to close into their characters because im not writing 3 more paragraphs so watch the movie or something. Though there is growth and change among them unlike how jack never changed and the wolf just was suprised.They are the sypathetic antagonistAnd thats why this movies antagonists are sooo good and why I cannot make a full movie review without writing an essay about anything. WATCH THE MOVIE ITS SO GOOD. Sorry about the spelling I dont want this to be like school work and I tried.", "Dark themes incorporated in to Family Film but executed perfectly": "I really thought this film was going to be a mediocre film like the first one. So my initial expectations were low. After seeing the film I would argue that is way better than Avatar 2 or really any film in 2022. This film tackles very heavy topics like anxiety, death, letting people down, and dealing with huge changes if your life. All the characters are humanized, visuals are better than Spiderman into the spiderverse, and I was rarely bored.Another thing to consider if you are taking your kids to see this film, is that the film has a dark themes. However is still more suitable to watch with kids than 90% of the films currently out there.So expect a roller coaster of emotions.10/10.", "The Greatest Movie Not on My Watchlist": "Such an amazing movie, great for any and everyone. Dreamworks has given us the best animated film I have seen recently and perhaps the best movie I watched in 2022. This unexpected gem has an amazing plot, phenomenal writing and stunning animation. This sequel is a great blend of humor, edge & darkness, appropriate for kids and entertaining for adults. I found myself laughing heartedly and just enamored with all the childhood classics littering every scene. The underlying theme of valuing life and friendship is extremely relevant and relatable for all audience. This is a surprising must see for the entire family.", "Inspired by Spider-Verse ?!": "Let's just get to the point. I hate 2.5D animations. I think it's just stupid. It's like going backwards and making animations deliberately bad. And for the sake of what? Trying to be like Comic Books?! If I wanted to see a comic book, I would've buy a comic book. But No! I want ANIMATION. Or maybe some people who like anime, would want to see something like this. But I seriously don't understand why would someone prefer something that is obviously worse! Every time I wanted to connect with the story, the weird low frame rate and the 2D flat pictures just throw me out of it. If this is going to be the future of animation, then I'm done with it. Thank you very much.", "Surprisingly Very Good": "I sat down not expecting much from the movie. Loved Shrek 1 and 2 but the sequels that followed along with the first Puss N Boots movie were average to below average, which set my expectations rather low.However I found this movie highly entertaining. People will complain about the animation but it was a production choice to go the route they did...at first I wasn't sure about it but as the movie progressed I understood their choice and embraced it.The story overall is great...family, living and loving the life you have, what more do we need. This coupled with the interweaving of the characters was smartly done. If you like me, watch animated movies to be entertained, have a few smart laughs along the way and smile when they are over...then I think you will really enjoy Puss N Boots The Last Wish.", "Cherish what wraps you right the moment.": "The Wishing star is a symbol of the \"fantasy\" that occupies a place in everyone's heart. Because life is not perfect, we fantasize about immortality, we fantasize about never being apart, we fantasize about never being defeated. Many of us spend our lives in vain for this fantasy, but we don't stop to look around us. What is the beauty and truth that is neglected?Death, loss and failure are all things that we have to go through in our life. This story about the omnipotence of Wishing star and the non-existence of Wishing star tells us that nothing can help us avoid all these things. We can only accept, face and adapt to them with the spirit of our heart. The beauty of fantasy may not be so good, but the real beauty may be in the present, perhaps it is not too late, waiting for your discovery and embrace; Abandoned heart, insatiable, will come back to bite you.", "you love it": "Shut up. It's beautiful, a masterpiece even. If you say you don't like this move then you're lying to yourself. You can't look me in the eye and tell me that this movie was bad without being a liar. It's antonio banderas playing a ginger tabby cat in boots. Either accept that it's a masterpiece or accept that you're a liar. This movie is better than so many other sequels that dreamworks has done. Kinda kung fu panda 2 in a way that it adds to the first movie perfectly without ignoring the story or changing the original point of the movie. Cmon guys, it's a talking cat IN BOOTS, you can't sit there and tell me that you hate it.", "It stinks!": "Shrek and earlier Puss and boots were clever and delivered a great message- we all have our strengths and weaknesses, but kindness is available to all, so be kind and spread it around.This is just a rehash of flying/ flipping/flopping with little or no plot. Animation is great- but old school plot is what knits a treasure together. This is no treasure.No one is dazzled anymore by computer generated stunts. There is no substitution for great writing. Great writing it ain't ( poor grammar intended). I've read comparisons to Bullwinkle which is like claiming McDonald's is fine dining. Can you eat it? Yes. Is it good- not really.", "Best animated movie of the year": "I honestly had no idea what to expect going in, through out the year i had dissapointment after dissapointment, with certain agendas being pushed and stupid side kick characters that are just plot devices to move the story forward. However this movie since the fist fight scene subverted all expectations and hooked me immediately. The movie overall was a touching meaningful masterpiece, so amazing i watched it twice. The Second time the movie hit harder in my opinion. As a person who doesnt really cry in movies...i had to be honest sometimes i just wanted to. The animation also was stellar and beautiful. I would recommend watching this movie.", "So so...": "Some nice ideas there but it lacked the previous movie's atmosphere and characterization..The first one felt like a nice surprise, The Last Wish looks like a Disney copy paste with the usual dream/friendship/correctness and general lack of surprise.Some scenes felt either too long or useless and shoehorned there to respect some basic checklist for a kid movie.The dog was cringy and I hoped that they abandon him somewhere during the movie as he felt like the standard sidekick which will be useful for one very scene.The bear gang was nice and I liked the dynamic between them and the dilemma they had to face at some point.The wolf (Or Malthael for anyone who played Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls) was interesting but kind of redundant, also I feel sorry for any sensitive younger kid in the audience as he is scary af. It didn't bother my 6yo daughter as she's into dark stuff but I can see children having nightmares after meeting him lol. This very character felt out of place in this mellowish Disney inspired movie.And... I may be nitpicking there but I really disliked that weird sluggish animation style they used during the fights. Not only it hurt my head but also looked bad and got me out of the movie every time it happened, destroying the immersion.Felt like you're eating your favourite meal at the restaurant and suddenly the waiter jumps out of nowhere and drown your plate in liters of ketchup, making it gross and disgusting.Kitty felt like her character from 1st movie got switched with some generic soulless cat.Story was ok.. a cat scared of losing his last life was a cool idea, graphics and animation were really nice too (except during the fights, urgh...).Story was ok.", "Viva Team friendship!": "Oh what can I say about this one, a masterpiece, a sequel better than the original! It's something rare but it's true.It carried so many good memories from childhood, with great new ideas and characters. Every one of them was apt and they were \"just right\".The villains were great too, especially the Death. He was perfect in every possible way. Frightening, charismatic, and so strong. I really hope to see him in the following sequels; of course if there is one.One of the greatest things was the references. I don't know if anyone noticed that but I loved it! Five-Way Standoff gave me the vibe in the \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\". Also the quote \"Say hello to my gatito blade\" reminds me of the Scarface movie. Besides, in my opinion the last quote was utterly the best line in the whole movie.To summarize, LOVED AND ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.", "The trailer doesn't give this movie justice": "After watching the trailer I had really low expectations, but reading the reviews prompted me to watch it, and I'm so glad I did. Heart, Soul and humor, plus a smooth and creative animation experience that just shows the pinnacle of what DreamWorks is capable of.As other reviews have mentioned, what makes this film shine is it's characterisation and their individual development, without losing track of the overall meaning of the film. It's not just another kids write off but also something meaningful for older animation lovers to enjoy as well.Kudos.TLDR: A touching start to 2023, with great characters a meaningful story line and proof that DreamWorks still knows what they are doing.", "It's not a movie, it's a Film": "I first seen the trailer and I wanted to see it for the meme.. BUT this movie blew my boots off no pun intended. This is literally my favorite movie this year and that doesn't mean much cause there wasn't that many good movies this year (2022) but everything about this movie was perfect. The archs, art direction, humor, story and the characters. Speaking of characters the best was death and his little use that was used for him but he left a big impact on the story/puss and the whole character arch of puss he came from being a fearless hero and then became a man that was very appreciative of his last life it was meaningful and very resonating. The art style was a great breath of fresh air compared to Pixar's ray tracing super realism yeah that's cool and all but we need some stylistic ART but other than that this is my favorite animation film next to Spiderverse.", "Is it a 10? Well... yes": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was a huge surprise to me. I enjoyed the first one but it was no instant classic so my expectations was not huge to say at least for a sequel but I ended up watching it anyways and boy did it hit just right.The villains are great, from Big Jack Horner to Goldie Locks with Bears and the Wolf, they are in each their own little story adding to the whole.While Big Jack Horner is great as a main villain with a GREAT disregard for anyones life, Goldie and her bear-family have a great dynamic and their own goals.The Wolf does not appear much but he leaves such a huge impression that his fe appearances are nothing less than legendary. He's probably one of the best villains depicted I've ever seen when it comes to the animated/cartoon type of villains, his presence is just fantastic.The main cast of Puss, Kitty and Perrito also have an excellent chemistry and it just works perfectly.Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek is an excellent cast for the main kitties while Harvey Guillen makes the overly positive Perrito work when it could so quickly have become something like Jxr-Jxr Bxnks.And lets not forget the rest of the cast that are allowed to shine and really delivers at all times.The animation is inspired by Spider-Man: Into the spider-verse and it's fantastic, the attention to detail, the colors and the anime-like action makes this movie a joy to watch.I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone.", "Amazing movie, good for the whole family, very good story and message": "When told that the sequel to Puss In Boots was worth a watch, I did not assume it would be THIS good. This movie is fun for all audiences. The movie deals with topics like anxiety, fear, death, and many other topics, all of which are dealt with very well.In the scene where Puss has a panic attack, it was dealt with extremely well. I deal with very bad anxiety, and this scene felt very personal to me. And when Perrito helps Puss deal with it, it's done very well.The animation is done very, very well. The fight and action scenes made my jaw drop. Fantastic animation.On the topic of the characters themselves - Puss, who at the beginning, was an arrogant warrior who felt as if he was above death. And throughout the movie, but then is brought down to his last life of 9. He learns to appreciate the life he has left instead of wasting it like he did before.Kitty, her trust issues are not hammered down on the viewer to get the message across, but it is clear to the viewer that it is how she feels. Her growth and development to learn to trust people - to trust Puss, specifically - was very well done.Perrito, I thought he would be an annoying sidekick like in many movies. But he ended up being one of the most endearing characters in the movie with his love of life and positive attitude. I cant possibly talk about every character, so I chose the 3 main characters, but every character has a great personality and development.The story itself was very good. The topic of Puss running from the manifestation of death itself alongside everything else was amazing. The characters mix well with eachother and the story to make something phenomenal.This movie was also very friendly to new watchers. You don't need to watch the original Puss In Boots or Shrek franchise to understand what happens, which is really good! I haven't seen the original Puss In Boots movie from 2011 in years and barely remember anything from it.I've rewatched this movie 3 times within the week and I'm constantly thinking about it. Thank you, DreamWorks, for making this movie.", "It's awesome": "The animation was well done. It was better than the previous movie and one of the best animated movie\nAnd i love the death character and iam the fan of the\nDeath's whistle sounds and it has the good life lessons and it has a few faws other than that it was a perfect movie no character has wasted in this movie and i am waiting for the seqeal of sherek and iam a fan of dream works I want to more projects like this and after watching this movie I love the puss and boots character and especially the dog character and kitty and i love every character and all perfect except few things and this is my review.", "Did my childhood justice": "I remember watching the 2011 Puss in Boots at least once a day when I was a little kid, so naturally I was super excited to see the movie. I was kind of worried because the style was different and it seemed very different from the first. But it was honestly better than the first one. The characters are all so much fun and fleshed out perfectly, the art style is gorgeous, and the story is so engaging and creative. I even teared up in some parts. All the characters are so cool, especially Death. I appreciate how they still made the first movie canon to the second story. I was bracing for the dog to be insufferable, but i ended up adoring him. It's just mature enough to appeal to both young and older crowds without being insultingly simple. Worth a watch in theaters and all your love! Very excited for what comes next with Dreamworks!", "Just Amazing.": "I really loved it.Every life matters. The action. The animation and the death character just amazing. Gave me goosebumps several times. The efforts on animation, the effects characters. Just amazingly amazing. Antonio sir I have been fan of yours since my childhood. Never missed a single movie of yours.And you being the puss in boots made it even more amazing. The soft paws tremendous. Everyone played their role amazingly.Just awesome.I know how much efforts were their and I really do loved it.It's not just a movie but a moral story if anyone could get it.Life is a gift, have some value for that.Lots of love to everyone\nThe cast,\nThe director\nThe singers, musicians,\nSound artists, video effects artists,\nThe graphics engineers,\nThe team\nEveryone.Stay blessed.", "The BEST animated film in the last couple of years!": "It's darker, more mature and funnier then any other animated film that came out in last 2 years. I really like the character development and seriousness of the plot - but in the same time keeping the humor and family friendly vibes on point. The music is great and animation is on another lvl. The Last Wish is the closest I've ever seen a movie get to emulating hand-painted concept art. On their way to the wishing star, Puss and company traverse prismatic backdrops, from bright pinks and green forests to the rustic interiors of a cat-lady prison that feel dabbed on by the artistic team - it's just awesome! The hopes for a good animated movies returned!", "And old friend comes back": "This movie was absolutely amazing, it was like that old childhood friend of yours that you liked reconnects with you and they were just like you remembered them to be. I always criticize current children's animation to be too childish for my taste compared to what came before them. Well, this wasn't like that there were bits and pieces at the beginning that were a bit cheesy yet later on, the movie becomes that 2000s to 2015 style of non-dumbed down somewhat darker piece that doesn't treat their audience like they were a bunch of 4-year-olds. In summary watch this movie, watch it with your kid, watch it with a friend, and recommend it to random people in the streets.. so studios keep making movies like this.", "A highy enjoyable expirience": "Besides the beautiful art style of the new Puss in Boots, I am highly impressed by the animation and action of this movie.The animation flows smoothly, the action sequences are impressive and booming from the very start of the movie. The comedy is very well written and nicely tuned with the more serious scenes of the movie.I did not expect such a battle with death and mortality as well as coming to terms with it in a Dreamworks animated movie. My expectations were shattered, it outperformed in every way. I also really like the continuation of the story with Kitty as well as the implementation of new characters, Pusses' past lives, his personality, and his ego.I love how the motives of the characters come out and how they on their own tell stories. And I especially love the fight scene with death, and how it affects Puss and Kitty, all in all, a highly recommended watch.", "Raises the bar for animated movies": "First things first, the animation looks incredible, with comic-book like aspects incorporating 3D animation with 2D effects, and character design that isn't ugly, but pleasing to look at, and creatively done. This movies messages apply to everyone, that you should enjoy the life you have instead of fearing your inevitable death, and appreciating those who you call family. Even as a grown adult, I still got something out of this movie. The character design and creativity is peak, and the movie lacks cringey, immature childish jokes, using genuinely clever humor. Everything about this movie trumps your average Pixar film, making it a very enjoyable watch, even from a picky film fan.", "The best Puss ever.": "I didn't expect a lot watching this film and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. Puss in boots is laid back and witty, I found myself laughing and smiling through the whole film. It's a kids movie, but there's enough witty humor to entertain an adult. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants something funny to watch with a good moral to its story. At the heart of this film is the importance of friendship and love for those closest in your life. A simple, but powerful message.Now the artwork in this film is incredible \ud83d\ude0d. Ever shot looks like a painting, truly beautiful. Well done!", "Didn't Have to Be THAT GOOD \ud83d\udc4d": "I was skeptical before the movie at first because a lot of quarantine-delayed films haven't done so well. BUT MAN WAS I PROVED WRONG THIS TIME!A good handful of Dreamworks' movies are very good and this one didn't change the pattern.Puss In Boots: The Last Wish surpasses the first Puss in Boots as it establishes great plot, amazing climax, and OUTSTANDING SATISFACTION of the characters' wishes.Go see this movie with family and/or friends as it's a treat for all ages and actually causes tears- well for me...Overall, from beginning to end, I enjoyed this movie very much and want to see it again very soon.", "Pixar quality without the pixar formula": "Pros\nAmazing animation, fun to see into the spiderverse inspiring movies like this oneFelt a lot closer to an action adventure compared to Disney / Pixar movies. While those movies have to have most set pieces advance the main characters' arcs or villains that are foils to the main characters, this movie seemed to have villains that have their own arcs and act primarily as obstacles to the heroes. Felt more like a rollercoaster then a movie meant to deliver one primary lesson or theme, though Puss in Boots still has his own satisfying arc with lessons learned throughoutThe Wolf was actually an intimidating villain with a satisfying arc through the end\"Jiminy Stewart\" Cricket, every line was brilliantCons\nComedy is hit or miss.

I enjoyed the way they dug deeper I to Puss's character, he went from being very egocentric to admiring to needing help and being able to trust and be trusted by other. Goldilocks and the bears' accent was brilliant. Perrito is adorable, he was a very well written character. The movie, although appropriate, took a darker turn and I enjoyed, the wolf's whistle is terrifying, and t was overall more serious than many other children's movies. The voices are amazing, Salma Hayek, Antonio Banderas, and Florence Pugh did a great job. I expected it to be an okay movie, but I was agreeably surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Holy moly": "This silly talking cat movie mite unironically be my favourite move of 2022, and it's been a year with some great competition. There's not really that much I can say about this that hasn't been said by everyone else on this platform, as the consensus is clear. Everything about this movie is perfect, from the wonderfully creative animation, to the well crafted story that genuinely almost made me cry. And of course the villains oh my god the villains. At first it appeared that the villains in this movie would be overcrowded, considering there are 3 of them, but each and every one of them was so expertly written and fun to watch. The movies score is something that just isn't talked about enough, with the music blending seemlesly with the animation and each song the soundtrack is an absolute banger (fearless hero and jack Horner's theme are some personal favourites). Overall, DreamWorks have absolutely outdone themselves, and puss very much is now our favourite feerles hero(That was very cheesy I am so sorry)", "Funny, light hearted and enjoyable": "Lately I was watching a bunch of movies. \"puss in boots the last wish\" is undoubtedly the best movie I have watched during the Christmas season. It is light hearted, it is funny and every one can enjoy this movie. I was engaged with each of the characters from beginning to end. There was a different perspective to some of the characters. Goldilocks comes as bit selfish and narcissistic but all she was craving is for a human family. The sweet Little jack from one of my favourite childhood nursery rhymes is definitely not the bully.The animation and special effects in this movie is mesmerizing. So is the dialogue.All in all there is a very good message, you have one life and enjoy.", "Reminded me of the first Shrek": "Humor for both kids and adults, and a heartwarming message. I was so impressed that Disney could make this without it being a soulless money-grab...and then I realized it was Dreamworks, not Disney. Good on them for not being like Disney! My four kids and I were highly entertained, even the 3 year old which is a rare find.Nothing else should really be noted other than that it actually had some slightly scary parts. Nothing was too scary for my littlest and \"dark\" is a better description than scary. I realllllllly hope Dreamworks comes out with more content like this, and it doesn't have to be Shrek. Please keep promoting the stories with good scripts!", "A Modern Classic": "This movie is a masterpiece, I would recommend everyone to go see it. When I first heard of it and saw reviews of it on YouTube and them saying how good it was I thought this movie turned out like Morbius, I was thankfully mistaken. The animation is lovely and is jaw dropping, we need more movies like this instead of another Boss Baby or Trolls movie. The Antagonists were great, the villain was funny and disturbing at the same time. The film doesn't take itself too seriously and remembers it's supposed to be a kids movie. This movie was the first time I was genuinely felt scared and intimidated by an animated movie's antagonist. I feel like one antagonist in particular would scare the life out of small children, which happened in the theater I was in so don't take young children to see the movie it could make them too scared. The only bad thing about my experience in the theater was the guy snoring loudly in one of the rows behind me which made me really annoyed, make sure not to go to watch the movie only to fall asleep and snore. Anyway the movie is great go see it just be mindful of other people in the theater.", "Animation done right": "Another fun filled adventure with heart, humor and action. This movie wipes the floor with many of Disney's offerings of late. The quality was excellent. It was a great movie for young and old alike. Great and memorable characters that defy their tropes. Some good lessons presented in a way that was natural and followed the fairy tale origins. The music was catchy, and the jokes actually funny. I wasn't sure if the dog was going to be annoying, but he turned out to be the glue for the characters. Definitely a movie to share with the family and provides a fun and exciting experience for all - and I'm usually a dog person.", "Most enjoyable movie I saw this year": "Loved it.Puss in boots 2 doesn't have the most compelling plot, it's very predictable even, but that certainly doesn't take away from the experience. It's a beautiful story, filled with many funny moments and with amazing animation. The scary bits are amazingly well executed, gave me goosebumps! Very friendly to fill in your own references to other works and let your imagination fly. I applaud the artistic decisions of the studio and absolutely loved the classic animation \"12 fps\" scenes. Don't know what the future of animation will bring, but for me once again DreamWorks has delivered something really unique and new to the scene, and I hope they will continue to develop on that path.Bravo!", "Fantastic animated movie for all ages": "This is, without a doubt, one of the best animated movies in recent years. This movie manages to complete so many different character arcs in its just over 90 minute runtime it is genuinely spectacular. The three antagonists all work because they are all very different types of villains. And genuinely, Wolf is one of the best animated villains of all time. I cannot stress enough how absolutely terrifying he is in this movie. Some parents may think he is too scary for small children, I don't necessarily agree, but it can be argued. The animation looks amazing, you could pause almost anywhere and get a beautiful shot. Some people may be turned off that this movie is not going for the hyper-realism that other recent animated movies use. And during action scenes they actually lower the frames per second which may seem like an odd choice, but it makes the action far easier to follow and makes it more visceral. Of course, this being a kids movie, the story is very predictable, but the movie focuses far more on the journey that each character takes to get to their inevitable ending. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone, parents or not. If you haven't seen it already, do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.", "Disappointed": "The first movie is one of my favorites. It's funny, the story keeps you on your toes, the visuals are amazing. This one... didn't live up to the amazing adventures of puss in boots, nor his humor. Watching the animations I thought to myself that something must be wrong because it looked like something from 2005, not 2022. Or at least a different style that the original and what I'm used to seeing from DreamWorks. Puss in boots, kitty and some other characters were really well animated whereas, comapared to perrito and the environment which felt like a really early scketch. It didn't feel finished and it wasn't worth the wait.", "expectations was low, but wow!": "I have never done a review on a movie before but after watching this i must do one, i was thinking it would be a funny movie and an enjoyable movie, but damn, was i wrong, i fell in love with all the characters and the plot the build up and and everything it had to offer. It grabbed me within 5 mins of the movie and it just kept climbing to the point i didn't want to move incase i missed something. If you have not seen this movie. Defiantly watch it has a great balance for kids and adults to watch. I wont say too much but this movie was enough that i cant stop but feel i want more! Thank you!!", "Shocking": "First of all I am shocked that this film is so popular in the community. I am so shocked that I have to write my first comment about a movie on IMDB.Positives:\n+ I personally liked the animation style for this film, something refreshing+ colorful scenery and nice use of colors+ i like the wolf character all around (looks, whistle, etc.)Negatives:\ncat in boots isn't the same character anymoreuninspired jokes that is labeled as funny filmway too many new characters that aren't even characterizedcharacters are exaggerated and annoyingone new character is completely predictable and always talks about friendship there and friendship here enormously boring AND annoyingthat film isn't even closely for someone under the age of 12 in my opinionthe authors make it easy for themselves by adding tons of magicConclusion:\nI am immensely disappointed. It was simply way too much and nothing I would connect with the first movie. Lost completely the roots why I liked the cat in boots and I am happy I didn't waste any money for this because it was a gift.I would have felt guilty if I hadn't warned you about this bad, bad movie.It will rob you of your precious lifetime.", "Heartwarming Lovestory!": "What I loved most about the first movie was the love story between Puss and Kitty!She didn't care about anyone or anything at all before she meet him!\ud83d\udc95 When she told him that in the movie I almost started crying! I could literally feel her love for him!This movie shows the exact same thing, again! Kitty loves him sooo much!!\ud83d\ude2d That makes my heart swell! \u2764I sound silly I know, but I've always been a hopeless romantic. This movie is therefor perfect for me! And probably for everyone else out there who also loves heartwarming love-stories! Puss and Kitty is right now my absolute favorite couple!!", "Must came from heaven": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the best adventure films and spinoffs ever.What a triumph achieved by a fantastic team spearheaded by Joel Crawford, having only directed 4 films being one of them Croods 2.Trying to find some order in the midst of my enthusiasm, I will start by talking about the story, and what a story well told. Simple, smart, exciting and moving, it's the perfect movie for all ages (and for all tastes but this is me being a fanboy). It plays very well with the ideas it establishes and involves all the characters, not depriving any of the remarkable and genuinely funny moments. I laughed like a kid, vibrated like an adult and cried like an old man. That's the power of a good movie.And the fantastic direction of Crawford, (totally inspired by Spider-Man in the Spider-Verse) contributes and in what way to the grandeur, excitement and beauty of the scenes. Not only that, but also for the dramatic moments, showing great maturity behind the wheel. I can't wait for the next project.Now, the cast, but that cast, stuffed with quality stars. Even so I ended up going for the dubbing and it was the best part of the movie without a doubt. Everyone's accents were fantastic, but the Alentejo totally stole the scene. It is rare to see a movie voiced by people with an accent (which is a shame), fortunately this film changed it and gave life to the film. It surpassed the simple dubbing they became part of the creative process. Certain Portuguese expressions have given a different taste and contribute a lot to a better and memorable experience.The editing is fantastic, the action is very well marked and the transitions are of another caliber: quite creative and visually fantastic. They provided really good moments thus helping to ward off the general conception that ''animated films are not cinema'' .Finally, the post-credit scene (it's more post-film, because fortunately it was before the credits), yes THAT scene. What a good time and that warmed me in an indescribable way. It is the return to childhood with the same or even greater joy with which I started this journey and I hope very much (REALLY HOPE) continue to enjoy it. Shrek 5, I miss you ogre.Me looking at the masterpiece I just made...Puss In Boots\nCinema\nFilm\nMovie Review\nMovies.", "Better than expected": "I had no desire to watch this movie. I wasn't a fan of the first Puss in Boots and the last Shrek movie wasn't fun....but a dad's gotta do what a dad's gotta do and I took my kids. I was pleasantly surprised by this entertaining little number. The animation style of the action scenes harkens to some of the newer anime and video game cut scenes with a little Spider-Man: Across the Multiverse thrown in. Many of the jokes are meh or fall totally flat but there's enough there to make a 40-ish guy giggle a few times. The voice talent does an excellent job, which is something we've come to expect from the Land of Far Far Away.", "Good movie overall": "All around great movie. Favorite character was death and how he was always watching Puss and boots throughout his 9 lives. I loved the chilling introduction of death as his whistle sent chills down my spine. The movies portrayal of death as an antagonist makes death my favorite character in the dreamworks universe. I loved the animation quality in each of the fights. My favorite thing about the DreamWorks universe is the different takes on classic fairytale characters. The movie pacing was good as there was a never a dull moment in the movie. I was able to enjoy the movie even without watching the previous movies.", "Amazing. Simply amazing": "I haven't seen an animated movie this impactful and truly moving in such a long time. However, from the moment I saw the trailers, and only got a snippet of the amazing action sequences, I just knew it would be something special.(Very Minor spoilers)First, I'll start off with the story and characters. Puss in boots has some of the best character development I've ever seen, and it was truly impactful. Kitty Softpaws' internal conflict is also integrated very well and leaves a nice message that isn't too in your face, but it was still crystal clear. Perrito was an amazing addition that not only made me laugh, but cry, frown in sadness, and feel warm inside. Perrito also taught me that it's great to stop and smell the flowers throughout life ;). The bear crime family was an amazing addition to the cast, and the message that they gave was so heartwarming, and they made me cry a few times too for sure. Jack Horner was a hilarious villain that brought some nice good vs evil conflict and levity to the film. Finally, Death gave me the chills every time I heard his whistle theme play throughout the sound system, and he was a truly harrowing villain that I couldn't get enough of. Truly terrifying. The story was executed fantastically as well. Nothing felt too rushed and everyone in the movie got enough screen time. The humor was hilarious, the touching scenes were tear inducing, and the action was butt-clenching. 10/10Now, the animation was something else. The way the frame rate of the movie shifted gave the action such a dramatic effect. Sometimes, I thought I could almost see a smear from for a millisecond and I found that to be such a cool effect. The camerawork was INSANE. As the characters flipped and fought, the camera would move a ton of different angles, making this not just a movie, but a whole experience. The stylization was beautiful too, I really like how more 3D movies are going a more \"2D\" stylization. The backgrounds looked so vibrant, and the characters really popped out as well, I have to say this is the best animation I have seen in a while.In conclusion, Puss in Boots really knocked my boots off this movie. I have no regrets spending my time and money on it, I wish I could give it more. This movie was made with so much love and care, and it shows.", "Difficult on the eyes": "The story is meh. It drags in the beginning. The person next to me started to snore. No one in the audience was bothered by the snoring. It was received as more entertaining than the movie. The animation made it difficult and unpleasant to watch. The fight scenes were choppy . I actually turned away several times because visually the movie was stressful. The movie leaves the impression that the studio needed money and rushed production just to have a product. Or worse the studio supports lazy production now. I didn't see much advertising for Puss in Boots so I feel they knew it is a bad product. The hype of new animation and what I now expect as cooked reviews on another sight appears as spin to catch the dollars. I really want an apology.", "Incredible": "I am a huge Shrek fan and kept on putting off watching it, now I'm regretful that I didn't go see it when it first came out!!This Puss In Boots film sequel was amazing! The animation, storyline and comedy was perfect.Beautiful scene shifting and the comic style (similar to the spider-man films) was amazingly projected.Had me laughing out loud and up there with the first 2 Shrek films (we don't talk about 3 & 4...)\nWaaay better than the first Puss In Boots film. I went to go see it last night and I will be going to see it again it was that good!Wholesome and an absolute masterpiece! <3.", "solid": "I thought this movie was a fun movie to watch and had one of the best villains (Death) I have seen in a long time coming from an animated movie. This is my preference but I didn't prefer the animation style as much and the fight scenes felt like it wasn't enough frames. Overall though I enjoyed the movie and was fun to watch with the fam. I thought the dog was too much and frankly annoying, but I enjoyed the adult ish humor in the movie.

The characters are amazing as well as the storyline. You will never get bored of this movie. Puss in boots has just become one of the GOATS!!!! You will love how the side characters display themselves and how entertaining it gets each and every minute. It might seem a little scary but the villain role is excellent and brilliantly played by the actor. The animation as well is incredible and the comedy is also really good. There are a few parts where the movie could get better but I don't want to spoil anything and once the story is really one of the best stories I have ever witnessed.", "Puss in Boots: A Delightful Animated Adventure for All Ages": "Puss in Boots is a delightful animated adventure that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. The film follows the story of Puss, a charming feline hero with a heart of gold and a talent for sword fighting, as he embarks on a quest to restore his good name and reclaim his rightful place in society.The animation in Puss in Boots is top-notch, with vibrant and colorful visuals that bring the film's magical world to life. The character designs are especially noteworthy, with Puss being a standout with his expressive eyes and charming demeanor. The action scenes are also well-done, with smooth and fluid animation that really sells the excitement and danger of the film's many battles.The voice acting in Puss in Boots is also excellent, with Antonio Banderas delivering a memorable and engaging performance as the titular character. He perfectly captures Puss's wit and charm, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is spot-on. The supporting characters are also well-voiced, with Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis both turning in strong performances as Puss's allies.The story of Puss in Boots is a classic tale of redemption and adventure, and the film does a great job of balancing its more light-hearted moments with its more dramatic ones. The film's humor is also well-done, with plenty of clever and chuckle-worthy jokes scattered throughout the runtime.

Its top-notch animation, excellent voice acting, and engaging story make it a must-see for fans of the genre. If you're looking for a fun and heartwarming adventure to escape into, Puss in Boots is definitely worth a watch.", "It's so good!": "Honestly I prefer it over the first one so much I still enjoy the first one of course but this movie is so good. The villains are perfect especially death (wow no surprise another person likes death haha) but honestly I still liked Goldie and jack are great as well! If I'm being honest I was happy that the three bears and Goldie survived alongside, puss, kitty and the dog (I can't remember his name lol) I can't wait for the eventual realise of Shrek 5 seen as though it was teased at the end of the movie. I'd even like to see a game possibly as that would be cool we haven't had a movie tie in game from a franchise for a while.", "surprisingly good!": "I went into this movie having absolutely zero expectations, other than that the animation looked pretty good. Impulsively decided to go see it with a couple of my friends, and boy was it good!I could rave about everything. The animation, the music, the characters, the story- all spectacular. I appreciated how, despite being a kids movie (and I am very much not a kid), it did not treat the audience like they are dumb. Because we're not, and neither are kids! It was very refreshing.The spiderverse style inspired animation was VERY much appreciated. I hope dreamworks continues with it in the future, as I'm now invested. I thought the Shrek franchise was dead to be honest (Not that the previous Shrek stuff was bad, just thought they'd had their time and it was over), but if they keep up the work like this I will gladly continue watching.", "Animated Masterpiece": "I watched this movie in the cinema around its release and the experience was amazing. This is definitely a movie that benefits from a bigger audience as some moments can be quite cringeworthy due to trying to get a particular emotion out of the crowd so actually experiencing it makes it so much better.The art direction in this movie was fantastic and borrows elements from Arcane and Spiderverse. Characters have a nice dynamic together and the mature jokes as well as dark experiences definitely turn this movie into something everyone can watch, no matter their age group. It was a captivating movie with a well thought out plot, a story that caters to all emotions and amazing character designs. I love it!", "MASTERPIECE": "I didn't think Puss in Boots: The Last Wish was gonna be that good, and it was better than I thought. I was very hyped on how the animation looks and some say it was like the spider-verse type. My favorite character was Perrito because we is charming funny and likable. About Death the Wolf. He is like one of the best DreamWorks villains to ever exist he is on the same level as Jinx from Arcane. Every time he is on-screen, the movie become haunting and scary. Goldilocks and the three bears crime family were funny, cute, and fun. Verdict: the best DreamWorks film since Shrek 2.10/10 Go watch it.", "THIS IS SOOOO Great!!!": "Honestly when I got into the cinema, I thought it would be a good kids movie that is also kinda enjoyable for teenagers/adults, but I didn't expect it to be a MASTERPIECE. Especially the wolf was one of my if not my favorite Villain of cinema Villains of since 2000. It also has Goldi and the bears and this pie Kid guy, although they are sometimes funny, they are definitely not as good as death. I also LOVE the animation. It's the same as the animation in spiderman: into the spiderverse wich I also loved for its animation and especially the fight scenes with the wolf gave me goosebumps. The humor is also sometimes pretty funny although sometimes it's just basic kids humor, but I think that's a good thing, because it makes it enjoyable for even more peoples. But at some parts it's sooo dark that I would definitely rate it for 12+ years and not for 6+ years. It isn't that long, but at least there isn't ANY part of the movie where I would call it boring it's pure enjoyment and I would really suggest everyone to give it a try.", "Simply spectacular": "It is, without a doubt, the most visually impressive movie I saw this year, and I watched Avatar 2 like a week ago. Mind blowingly good looking, Puss in Boots also hits right in the feels when it needs to : I cried multiple times during my viewing, and I was the first one surprised. It's all about family and valuing the ones around you, and good lord, these characters are so touching sometimes.I had a big smile on my face for most of it because what I was watching was AWESOME. Simple warning : if you go watch this movie with little kids around 4, 5 years old, they might get really impressed, even scared, by some scenes. My 4 years old niece was not that scared, and you can definitely go watch it with childrens, but know that this movie takes itself REALLY seriously sometimes (which is a good thing)", "The greatest animated movie ever!!!": "This movie is amazing like it took all that was great about spider-verse, shrek, puss in boots, and dreamworks as a whole creating the greatest movie I have ever seen! The personification of death is the most horrifying villain in any media ever this includes classics like voldemort, green goblin, joker, the fairy godmother, and sauron. Best protagonist in movie history better than daniel radcliffe as harry potter and megamind. This movie is even better than spider-verse it's basically spider-verse 2.0 it is super amazing, deep, and has great messages. And the dog is the most innocent character ever it is so amazing,", "Dreamworks": "Absolutely perfect. This movie had the mix of sad, action, funny, nostalgia and it's Unique. I would watch again, it's cool to see the legend himself feel fear. The animation is perfect the movie is great for all ages, I hope there's a sequel, the soundtrack is amazing as well, the visuals ate a 10/10 the ending is amazing as well. It's perfect and pacing is amazing. It would be great to win an Emmy. After seeing this movie its made it onto my top 1 favorite, tied to sonic 2 by paramount. I hope it greenlights a mew shrek film. Also the characters were awesome and funny. And I'd like to see more 100/10!", "Genuinely Amazing": "I went into this movie with very high expectations and they were met. The painted style of the movie is genuinely gorgeous and despite it being jarring at first I grew to reslly like the frame rate changes. Despite it being 3D animated it feels like I'm watching a painting move. The villains in this movie are incredibly well written. Death being very scary. Every scene with the whistle genuinely sent chills down my spine while watching it. Big Jack Horner is just delightful. I laughed at pretty much every joke from him. Goldi and the 3 bears were really nice aswell! The family dynamic they have is really nice and relatable. The sound design in this movie is great aswell! The heart beat in the movie making every scene with it feel more tense. No sounds in this movie felt like they didn't belong. The music in this movie aswell, god is the music in this movie great! Since I watched the movie I have found myself listening to the sound track a lot! Especially Fearless Hero and Big Jack Horner's theme! The one thing that's stopping this from being a 10/10 is some of the Goldi scenes. They feel repetitive and it doewnt feel like theres enough time put into their relationships at the end.Amazing film! Will watch again!", "It's all that's right": "A beautiful movie, I really liked the animation a lot, a very fluid and exciting movie, I found the dialogues clear but deep, the message it conveyed was very moving, the characters fit perfectly, the story had no gaps.It was undoubtedly a great achievement and a great success, and it leaves the door open for another Schrek movie, which is something we have all been waiting for a long time.The voice of Antonio Banderas, is undoubtedly a registered trademark that makes the cat a very loved character, each character had a message to give without falling into toxic progressivism, which is seen in other movies.", "How Puss and Boots Saved my Marriage": "As I entered the movie theater, walking side by side with my beloved husband Jerry, I didn't know that this absolute cinematic masterpiece of a film would completely and utterly restore my marriage, rekindle my sex life, file my taxes, solve the hunger crisis in Syria, and bring me out of my depression. Jerry and I took our seats, and as we reclined to view the king-tier saga of a film that is Puss and Boots, we rejoiced, cried, and laughed at such a work of art. As the pure joy that this movie radiated continued, I found it to be the single funniest thing I have ever seen in the entire year and dare I say my entire life as well. Jerry and I couldn't hold ourselves from letting the entire movie theater know that such a movie had brought back years of laughter and most of all love that I had previously been without in my drought of a marriage. As soon as we walked out of that theater, Jerry Bear started to release a masculine, dominating, and sigma male growl from deep inside his lungs\nHis rizz was just right. He was looking for some good porridge. My puss in boots was all out to lose another life. This bed is too hard. This angle is too soft. When we got into the right bed, we had to find a position that was just right. At first he was too soft, then he was too hard, then mmphh, he was just right\nBefore this, Jerry was the most boring, dry, and limp-dicked shell of a man I had ever encountered, but after this, he turned into an absolute joy and my marriage was completely and utterly restored, and thanks to Puss and Boots, every aspect of my life was completely resolved. Thanks Puss in Boots. LOL! \ud83d\udc85\ud83d\ude08", "Wow, a perfect animation": "Going into this I didn't expect this movie to be one of the best animated kids movies I've seen aside from kung fu panda, Toy Story, and incredibles. Grapples with mature, real subjects such as life and it's importance once we realize it can be taken causing anxiety, while, keeping it simple, light and funny with its characters and story telling at the same time. It has jokes all ages can enjoy, and the animation is visually stunning and beautiful, you can tell a lot of art work and visual design thought went into creating it. It keeps the cliche feel of a feel good animated movie while keeping you on the edge of your seat of what's to happen. The main villain also steals the show every shot he's in and keeps the suspense of the movie at an high and was beautifully written. Side not, appreciate and respect dreamworks to not pull a Disney and try to force small messages with political agendas into the film which inherently made the film feel so much more authentic and enjoyable. Always support movies with a good story and don't rely on cheap gimmicks. 10/10.", "Hideous animation but good story and acting": "The plot was good, the acting was good, the pacing was good, but the animation looks incredibly cheap. It is definitely a down grade in animation style, it was honestly distracting, especially during the fight scenes. The animation from the first Shrek looked better, and that movie came out over 20 years ago. If the animation was a conscience choice it was a bad one. Other than the visuals the story was pretty good. Puss is being followed by a mysterious wolf who's out to kill him, and he must find a magic map to get to the star that will grant him one wish, and he makes some new friends along the way. Story 8.5/10, Animation 2/10.", "Best animation of 2022": "DreamWorks has done it! Must watch!!! Puss in Boots 2 is the best animation of 2022 for me. It surpassed my expectations!The film does not stray away from the story, message and fun of the Shrek franchise, but revamps with a brand new, stylistic, vivid and appropriate animation style and art direction to suit Puss' new exciting adventure.The creative choices and visuals Director Joel Crawford used to tell the tale really make me rate this film a 9/10. The only reason why it loses 1 star is I felt that there were too many antagonists.For me, Puss vs his ego and Death and relationship with Kitty is could have been the final fight. It would've been exciting for a final duel to the death between Puss and Death. Before that would be Team Friendship vs Goldi and the Bears, in which Goldi would realize she already has everything \"just right\". I felt Jack Horner unnecessary to the story, and the conflict between Kitty and Puss, while needing to work together to outwit Goldi and the Bears, then defeating Death, was more than sufficient for the story to hit the same note.Overall good family fun. Extremely funny and touching. Worth the watch and PLEASE watch in 3D (I watched in 2D but wish I watched in 3D)", "Wow what a great movie!": "I've always loved the Shrek movies and I wasn't really expecting much out of this Puss In Boots 2 spinoff since the first was OKAY. But wow did my perspective ever change. The characters were great, the story was great, the hero arc ROCKED, but man did Death ever carry the entire weight of the whole movie. That character will now and forever be iconic to the franchise. Dreamworks had no business making a movie this good! The foundation of Death, the INTRODUCTION of Death, the appearance of Death, it made me feel the same fear that Puss must've faced; and as a member of the audience, that's what you want. You want to relate to the hero and from beginning to the end you felt that same fear and overcame that fear just as our hero did. That's why I think Death was such a great character and is what made this movie so good.", "Honestly an outstanding movie": "I went to the cinema thinking \"Is that movie that good? Lets find out shall we...\" after seeing all those videos, having absolutely no expectations whatsoever. Well let me tell you, it SLAPS hard. The visuals are intense, the colours are vibrant, the story is interesting, the villains are... FREAKING amazing. This movie honestly made me want more, like I was begging and hoping Dreamworks would make at least one more installment of that franchise. Now, to get into more detail, I want to mention the villains in particular. One of them is actually dreary and makes you feel anxiety, ultimately making you sympathise with the main character. It is so well done and well written that I actually shivered multiple times throughout the movie. And this is A PUSS IN BOOTS MOVIE! A kids movie, if you wish. Astounding, absolutely blew my mind. I highly recommend it to everyone, kids and adults alike, its pleasing to watch, the morals are good, there are jokes for both kids and adults, its just... Perfect. Take my word for it and visit the theaters as soon as you can, so the studio will make more like this...", "One of the best animated movies in a while": "Everything about this movie worked out great, the characters all got interesting backstories, the villains were amazing, I really hope it does well so Dreamworks has an incentive to make more movies this good.In a time of the most mediocre movies I've seen all my life, this movie stands apart as a great piece of storytelling masterfully executed.The people saying death is too scary make no sense, it's an eerie villain sure but nothing a child will get nightmares from, I think it's actually a perfect movie for children.Only movie in the Shrek franchise to live up to the first two Shrek movies.", "Hype": "The first time. And then the next one I iuiuiui I was so excited for the first one and I just couldn't believe how many times it took to make a new character like this and then it just happened to me that it would take forever for the first person I was to get the new one and I had no clue how it was gonna happen but it did it so I could get the first person that was like a second one so it would take like two minutes and I just got it all over and I just had a lot to get the second person that was really good so it took like two seconds and I just didn't even get to see the second person that I.", "This movie raised the bar for animated films.": "Wow, this movie just exceeded every expectation that I have of it. I really loved the art style they went with for the show. This show is leagues above from the first film. The dynamics between the characters were also crafted well. There were no cringeworthy moments that you would normally find in today's animated films. Plus, the jokes were actually funny and are not just there for the sake of comedy.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has a good and creative storyline, interesting characters, and it delivered a fitting resolution without the expense of a good character arc.Hurray for Team Friendship!", "Missing a lot of humor": "I was enthrailed about a second part of Puss in boots, but after seeing the Film at Cinema, I was a little bit disappointed. I am missing a lot of humor/fun. The movie is to \"dark\" in it's intention. The technical style is very good, but specially the part how the puss to go on with the danger of death take to much part. I think for children under 8-10 years it was a heavy \"stuff\" to handle with. They would leave the Film with a bad feeling. I prefer more the intention of the \"Shrek\" serial, with many cross references to fairy tales and funny scenes. If a third part will follow, I hope this will be more observed.", "Should be rated PG13": "From a mother's point of view not child friendly enough for a PG rating. With inuendos of death coming for you and statements like \"death comes for us all\" my little ones found the death wolf a bit scary, and John Horner the antagonist of the story was on the eery side. My little ones also had to hold their fingers and cringe in pain when the \"Spanish splinter\" occurred, they felt that. Children's movies should avoid blood, cringe, and spook, in my opinion. Great for older audiences, not so much younger children. The moral however at the end of the movie was great, but it was almost like talking a walk down a violent path to reach a dim candle.", "Awesome!": "Was not expecting this to be the masterpiece it is. Cool animation, cool characters, cool storyline. Not much else to say. Death was pretty awesome, his whistle was a nice recurring trait they gave him and his scenes were pretty great. Jack horner was another pretty good villain. He had a ton of funny moments and his scenes with the cricket were pretty funny. I like how how he is completely irredeemable and knows it, and that creates a lot of the humor. I like the dark tone as well. The blood running down pusses forehead definitely caught me off gaurd. Overall, pretty great film that I so love.", "Wonderful in every way.": "Perfect in every way. And it was not childish, which we were very happy about. It had everything, it was funny, it was serious, it was emotional. We need more of that. The dubbing was very good. It was successful everywhere. It's a good thing the opinion of the underdeveloped Hungarian people doesn't matter. It would be nice if there were more of these animations in the world. It would be nice to get rid of the vomit, fart, and shoddy script book animations and movies. And to make more of these wonderful animations. We are looking forward to the sequel and hope it will be as amazing as this one. Go DreamWorks.", "this movie is the darkest yet most sad and beautiful movie in the shrek franchise": "The animation in this movie is actually well done and reminds me into the spider verse but it actually looked like water coloring in the movie like a fairy tale. Some of the scenes here was actually frightening to see because of this new and probably darkest dreamworks villain yet.. \"Death\". I really like what they done here with death. He is actually scary that my little brother started to tear up! And some of the scenes here can depict a anxiety attack which could be upsetting to some people. But the last scene in the movie actually made me cry because on how sad it was and pretty at the same time. 10/10 and i recommend!!", "This is why i love animated movies if done well.": "I saw Puss in Boots The last wish. It's fast-paced and packed with action and humor right from the start. I was able to enjoy the best 100 minutes.Puss in Boots is a fearless hero. He is a reliable cat who lives with friendship and dreams. Every character in this movie is unique and interesting, and the soundtrack selection is so good.This is one of the best animated movies of 2022. Animated movies usually have a few boring scenes, but in this movie the story progresses so fast that the viewer doesn't get bored.Puss in Boots has many other movies, but I understand that \"The Last Wish\" is highly rated. I plan to watch this movie again this year. Recommended as a family movie for the whole family to watch.", "Best movie of 2022": "This movie has everything in it, very well written, best villain created in the last few years.

Can.t wait for the next movie to show up.Recommended for anyone, best ro see in cinema.", "Zero rating just for the boots": "This movie is super boring. Its not even about Puss in boots, but his so called ex wife who never existed in the first movie just to give female characters a chance. The Puss in Boots was this coward that he never was in the first movie. The scared Puss in boots who acted nothing, and yet the so called ex wife and some dumb animals took all the movie from him. I would have loved if he did the acting and be as brave as he was in the first one. This was a perfect waste of my time and I don't recommend to anyone who really wants to see the real Puss in boots in action. You will only end up seeing another black cat taking the whole show. I even wonder how it has good ratings.", "Go Team Friendship!!": "I kid you not when I say one of the best things in my life right now is an animated cat movie. \"Puss in Boots The Last Wish\" is a modern masterpiece of animation and I wholeheartedly stand by that statement. My God, THIS is how you do a sequel. Hell, this is even how you do a stand-alone film. I would argue that one doesn't even need to have seen the first \"Puss in Boots\" film to see this one. The only thing that really crosses over is Kitty, but even then she stands on her own pretty well.I just can't get over this movie. Dreamworks brought their A game and man does it show. Such a simple story in concept but it's good so masterfully that it feels fresh and new. It's also incredibly character driven, with our main players all being likable and charming in their own ways. Even our villain is a nice change of pace, almost poking fun at the trope of giving villains redeeming qualities. Nope, he's just genuinely a bad guy with no redeeming traits. Yet he's still likable and charismatic in his own unique way. The character dynamics in this film are just gorgeous. The familial relationship between the bears and Goldi, the slow but sure bonds that build and strengthen between Puss, Kitty, and Perrito, even the dynamic between Puss and the Wolf when they encounter each other are all so endearing and believable.Don't even get me started on the animation. My God, I'm in love with how this film looks. I'm so happy Dreamworks has been experimenting with their animation lately because it looks fantastic. The \"Spider-verse\" style lends itself so nicely to this film and the story it is trying to tell. I could prattle on forever about this film, so I might as well stop while I'm ahead.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I know GDT's \"Pinocchio\" will probably (and rightfully so) take the Oscar, but this is a close second and my pick for sure. I can't praise this film enough. 10/10 recommend to all. A beautiful, mature, and charming story and film that can appeal to anyone young or old.", "Comfortable and down-to-earth movies in recent years": "Really, although the plot is very old-fashioned, the process is comfortable. I don't know when it started, the plot of a movie must be unpredictable to be considered a good movie, but isn't enjoying the process itself the same as enjoying the movie itself? Why does the plot of a movie have to be unpredictable? Reading Hegel and other philosophical works can completely achieve a similar effect. This movie is completely funny, and the advancement of the story is logical and has a starting point. To be honest, it's been a long time since I encountered a movie plot that made me feel comfortable. Although everything was almost a rough idea at the beginning, this movie is really enjoyable. The character of the gray wolf Reaper gives people a sense of horror directly from the physical and psychological aspects. It is really scary, and the design of whistling is very old-fashioned, but the horror effect is simply the scariest I have ever seen whistling.", "Great family film all will enjoy!": "There are a lot of great parts and my children absolutely loved the animation and character development through the whole series! How they introduced the bad guy was spooky, and entertaining! This is one of the best ones since How to train your dragon and Shriek and my children wanted to purchase it right when it came to video. We saw it in theaters and couldn't stop talking about the characters and detail in the art, it was truly something else. It fun and suspenseful during the fight scenes and death coming around whistling made puss in boots hair rise as well as mine. This is one all families will enjoy!", "DreamWorks back to it's best.": "The movie is good from start to finish. Wonderful performances from the whole cast, especially Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas.The plot is simple to follow but not in a bad way. The story is set out from the start and there's a nice meaning. The sometimes more serious tone will be great for older movie goers.The animation style is an squared taste, but much easier to handle than \"Into the Spider verse\". If you like that, then you'll like this one.The comedy was good, but the movie was at it's best when the action was flowing; with a fantastic final battle.One of the highlights of the movie was the true main villain (there are multiple). His final fight was a great watch.All in all, highly recommend.", "Another masterpiece from DreamWorks": "As always, DreamWorks presented fans with a very professional work with friendly scenes, romance, action, and most importantly, an important life lesson. Unlike most of today's animations, which are made with wrong and base goals. Also, the initial scene of the animation where the boy on the moon meets other popular animation characters was really beautiful. In general, this work is another masterpiece of this company, which, according to them, was a prelude to making the fifth part of Shrek, and this is great! Because I am 90% sure that this will be another outstanding work of this company.The best animation in 2023...", "Definitely not for children of any age.": "Guys...this is nothing compared to \"old\" Shrek movies or even to previous Puss in Boots. If I could I would give \"0\" but I can't. There is vulgar language, absolutely horrific scenes, brutality, fast changing agressive colors, abusive behaviours etc. Some scenes are like recreated from adult horror movies. No idea how this was released and got these good reviews. Perhaps bots write them? Definitely not for children of any age to be honest. I can not unsee what I saw. We were so shocked we almost left the cinema. Please do not take your kids to that movie. It is a waste of time and money. I hope this is the last movie in these series...", "Beyond good, 10 is not enough!!!": "I honestly expected fart jokes and dum dum humor, but honestly the way this MASTERPIECE balances out the funny and the scary and the serious and just everything is amazing!!!The flow doesn't seem forced and it's just smooth sailing, every character has sense for being there even some you don't expect. The way the heroes are driven the motivations and the way the characters are written are on another level!The animation style is a subject for itself! I wouldn't he surprised if it got an award for the best animated film of the year!DreamWorks is really doing stuff well but where I must take my hat of is the main villain.. The way it gives the puss motivation and the subtle hints and timings of him on the screen are perfectly executed, I've watched it 3 times now, tomorrow is time for the part 4.Definitely absolutely recommend it!", "Surprisingly Loved It!!": "I made an account just so I could review this movie. I'm afraid this movie is going to end up by the wayside and I just want to tell people who are wondering about this movie that it's such a fun and entertaining watch for adults and children alike. I heard kids laughing throughout the theater and also adults. Is it groundbreaking? No. But there's something about it that feels fresh and is really engaging.I thought the storyline was not super complex, but still intriguing, entertaining, and honestly just a real good time. I found myself invested in many of the characters' individual storylines. I loved Goldie and her family's storyline, Jack was a fun villain, my heart broke for Perrito, and oh my gosh I LOVED the wolf. One of the best villain characters I have seen in a long time. He was ACTUALLY scary and every time he was on screen, I felt some of the same fear Puss in Boots did. Such a cool villain.I think all of the voice actors did a great job, and I honestly didn't find Perrito super annoying, and he actually made me laugh a few times.TL;DR - go see this movie! I think it'd be hard to be disappointed. The animation, score, storyline, and characters are all so good. One of the best (if not THE best) animated movie of the year.", "new favorite movie, hands down": "When i first found out this movie existed, i saw parts of it in an instagram ad. I was intrigued, mostly because i noticed how much the colors popped and the animation seemed reminicescent of spider verse, but ultimately, i felt pretty cynical (seeing as a lot of newer animated movies, while beautiful, have been soul sucking in terms of plot). Regardless, my mom really wanted to go see it, for nostalgia's sake- long story short, neither of us really expected it to be good, and just felt more obligated to see it at least once being longtime shrek fans. We watched the first puss in boots movie again before going to the theatre to refresh, which didn't help raise my hopes.However.I was sold as soon as the first song started playing, as soon as puss lifts his head for that introductory wink, as if knowing something my mom and i didn't. And every second after that, i was absolutely sold. The animation, the coloring, the choreo, the updated as well as new character designs, it's all absolutely gorgeous. I've seen that most of the criticism directed towards this movie have to deal with how \"it looks nothing like the original shrek franchise.\" ...why would you want it to? The first puss movie came out in 2011, and it feels absurd to me to keep a movie released over a decade later in the same visual box, but i digress. The overall visual style of this movie alone had my eyes glued.The characters. My god, they are all near-perfect. Remember that instagram ad? It included perrito, our favorite fearless canine protagonist, and seeing him there, i was 100% ready to hate him in the same kind of way i grew to hate olaf from frozen, like an overdone cutesy visual gag added purely to appease small children. Nope. His personality, design, story, themes and role, it astounded me just how much i absolutely loved him as a character. Seeing such a depth to kitty compared to her first movie debut? Amazing. Seeing goldi and the bears who at first appear seemingly as villains but turn out to be incredibly sympathetic and likeable? Loved every second they were on screen. Jack horner? Absolutely hilarious in every way shape and form and added such great contrast to all of the other characters as someone completely unsympathetic, yet still such a captivating character to watch. And i don't think there's Anything new to be said about death that hasn't already been said. His simple but menacing design, his voice, the little hints here and there to his \"true identity,\" and especially his motives, which are not directly villainous at all. He's hands down one of, if not The, best dreamworks villain to waltz out of the studio. And the fact that this movie has ALL of these characters, and a couple more on the side, and they ALL feel properly fleshed out while keeping my adoration through every single scene? Perfect. Huge bravo.And the themes. The plot itself. None of it feels convoluted or contrived, not even necessarily complex; there's a legend of a star in a scary forest that can grant one wish, and multiple parties want to reach said star to make said wish. That's all there is to it- until you apply all of those deep and vexing character motivations, then jam them all onto one long road they're sharing to win the race to it. All of them have a unique wish, all but one is a completely valid and sympathetic wish to make, and yet no one gets to make their wish, and all ends well. On paper it may sound clich\u00e9, but we are still dealing in the fairytale realm here. And it all fits in \"just right.\"the way the movie deals with death, mortality, the fear and panic of it, the emotional turmoil of learning to trust and to ask for help, to rely on others, to find positivity in darkness, it's all so masterfully done in a way that's digestible for young audiences and so very hard hitting for older ones. Seeing this movie multiple times, i found a new reason to tear up everytime i saw it because it was all just that Meaningful to me, even parts that don't feel they apply to me quite as strongly (such as goldi's plight to have a happy family and being content with a found one).I'm sure there's more i could say about this film but i've yammered on enough. Do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already, or better yet, go see it again. Tell your friends, spread the word. This movie, and entire team behind it, deserve all the praise they can get their hands on for their amazing, gorgeous, passion-filled product.", "Absolutely stunning in every way": "The animation and the villains were so amazing and all 3 would rank top 10 animated villains of all times. I've been getting bored of movies with no good or scary villains. Things like some rich guy with lots of guns or just no real villain like a man vs self or vs nature type show. That being said I really enjoyed every single one of the villains and none of them made the show annoying to watch. This show was extremely funny at some times but it's also very good with all the fight scenes. The first fight scene especially. The story itself is so good (small spoilers) the story is mostly about puss learning to not be all about himself. Enjoying the little things in life and making the most of your life plus getting over your fears. The acting in this movie and the attention to detail is also spectacular. I cannot think of a single character that truly annoyed me or seemed repetitive. Every single one of them just made me extremely happy. They all had different personalities, strengths and weaknesses. Overall this movie really brings my childhood back and a lot of scenes had some amazing messages and gave me shivers.", "A masterful reimagining of a classic": "This movie is the best animated movie in the last 4 or so years. It has a masterful animation style similar to \"Spider Man into the Spider Verse\". The characters are relatable and inspirational, and they also have a sense of duality in them. The villain is one of the best I've seen in an animated film ever. But where the movie shines brightest is in the theme death. This movie conveys the message that death will come for us, but we must enjoy our life with friends and family, and it does this in an easily digestible way. We can all benefit from this movie and the genre has to learn from this movie as a whole. This is a top 3 Dreamworks movie, would watch again.", "One of the best animated movies ever!!!": "I enjoyed puss in boots 1 but mostly because of the fantastic, epic and iconic character puss really is.I was quite excited for this movie but holy mother of god was good. Every single character was fantastic, puss was epic as always and this movie had probably the best villain ever, Death himself straight up. But to call him a villain is almost inaccurate because sure he fought puss and stuff like that. But in the end he only wanted puss to appreciate life more. And that shared feeling of terror you share with puss every time Death appears on screen. That fading of the audio and the whistle it's amazing to say the least.", "Unforgettable fantastic!": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an absolute fantastic movie! Beautiful art stlye mixes und super awesome villains! The mix of 2D and 3D styles match perfectly. Some midgame changes of framerates of elements make it intense. The adaptations of fairy tale characters are incredibly well done. The characters are delightfully funny and epic at the same time. Each character has their own story, but no one gets in each other's way. They complement each other. A perfect movie; for adults and for kids. Characters and facets work in translations and syncs too! I will never forget the forest scene that made me cry.", "Great Movie- better than expect": "When I saw the internet trailers, I didn't expect much of this movie. Honestly, I thought it would just be a cash grab like a lot of animated movies have been recently. A lot of people have told me it's great, so I decided to watch it.I honestly didn't expect it to be so awesome to watch. Not even because of the beautiful visuals, but because the story was intriguing. The topic of mortality faced by a seemingly fearless is an amazing story concept- and Dreamworks excelled at using it.The sound design is wonderful- Death's whistle sent shivers down my spine each time I heard it. The emotion put into every scene of this movie is astounding. I expected it to be a dull movie, and it certainly surpassed my expectations.", "The wolf is the best villain I have seen in a kids movie": "Okay I just want to start by saying I did not expect this to be this good especially this was a spinoff from shrek but this movie was amazing the quality to the animation the style its all so beautiful I would recommend this movie, Now lets get to the highlight of this movie, THE WOLF aka death he is just too good, He had one of the best introductions I have seen and his whistle its just all so good I love him and I love this movie But the ending it was a bit corny about friends and family but whatever its a kids movie, overall watch this movie you will not be disappointed 10/10 whoever made this movie did a amazing job.", "It's a good movie to watch in a group, accompanied by friends or family.": "Puss in Boots 2 clearly has a more polished, polished look, in short, aesthetically better than the first title, especially taking into account the blending of 3D and 2D elements... of fights, it's eye-popping. However, the script leaves a little to be desired, with some very truncated narratives, which does not mean that it is bad, just to say that the story was very mediocre in some aspects, but these aspects almost become imperceptible at such a large scale. Aesthetic beauty that the film provides. In short, it is a film with a charming aesthetic, which easily captures the viewer's attention even in the first minutes of the film, and holds it throughout the rest of it, in addition to guaranteeing some laughs, the comic tone is characteristic of DreamWorks films, however nothing exaggerated, here they hit the tone between the comic and the dramatic. It's a good movie, fun, interesting, thought-provoking, and aesthetically beautiful.", "I wish I had this movie when I was a child.": "I've seen some people say this movie isn't for kids, so, I'll just say this:Parents shouldn't shield their children away from death. I don't mean out-right expose them to the cruelty of reality, I mean stop pretending bad things in life don't happen. It only makes life worse for them.When I was a kid, I was scared of death. I constantly thought about it. I constantly worried about when it'll happen to me or someone I love. I constantly kept shutting myself in my house where it was safe.No one taught me what it was. No one taught me what it truly meant. And because of being shielded my entire life, no one taught me how to cope with it.How am I now?The exact same, but worse. I haven't gone months of not thinking about it at least once a day. I'm still worrying, I'm still scared, but now that fear leads me to rash decisions. And I'm still sitting alone for days and days. But now, it's not just fear. It's anger. It's confusion. It's hopelessness. Now, I feel like no matter what I do, or how hard I try, my efforts will be useless in the end.This movie felt like a breath of fresh air. It felt like I actually wasn't alone. It felt like...for once in my life, it was okay for me to be sad. It was okay to be scared.It's your kid so it's your decision, but please, don't let them end up like me. Help and prepare them, please.Also, P. S,\nKids are smart enough to understand or at least slightly grasp complex morals or concepts. This generation is opening their eyes more. My parents missed every single moral and couldn't understand why characters did what they did or said what they said. Life is getting more complicated mentally, and we need to prepare the new generations who will have to live in that mess.", "Wow": "This was something I was not expecting, the storyline is great, likable new characters, funny dialouge and the animation it's just outstanding and euphoric to look at. Not to mention they have one of the creepiest antagonist that I've seen from an animated film in a long time. They do an excellent job in immersing you in and making you feel something for each of the characters. DreamWorks did not pull any punches when making this movie this is by far one of the best movies I've seen come out in a while, and I'm starved of good entertainment if all of there future movies are going to be anything like this one was please give me more. A lot of people need to start taking notes this is how you enterain people disney.", "Pure cinema": "The only animated movies that blew me away from the last decade are How to Train Your Dragon, the Croods and How to Train Your Dragon 2 gets an honorary mention. Puss in Boots The Last Wish is the first in this decade's list. Hope DreamWorks keeps making more like this. I guess The Bad Guys isn't that bad either and I'm kinda a Spider-Man purist so there were some parts that kind of bothered me in it (especially with aunt May). But that aside the humor and the story of this film, it shows that they cared and put in effort. The only nitpick I have is that they overdid it a bit with the \"just right\" with Goldie and there was probably a better way to have Puss do the big eyes than they did, it made it kinda cringey. But again those are only nitpicks and not enough of a reason to not give it a 10/10.", "Death Comes For Us All": "Minor Spoilers. The movie as a whole is a surprising masterpiece, but it is worth seeing just for the introductory scene of the Big Bad Wolf (Death). It is a sequence so haunting that it had me questioning if i was even watching a kids movie. The bone chilling whistle that precludes his appearance combined with stunning animation and a great vocal performance left my heart racing and a genuine feeling of fear coursing through my blood, which is more than i can say for most horror films. Puss in boots goes from an indomitable living legend, to a petrified and cornered animal in a matter of seconds at the hands of death. His fur stands on end as he stares at his bloodied paw, and his life flashes before his eyes. The fear and panic in the face of this unstoppable force of nature is only natural. Easily one of the top villains in the past few years of cinema, animated or not. It would be a shame to this amazing movie flop in our modern sea of soulless cashgrabs and mediocrity for the sake of marketing, so get down to your local theater and support this genuine work of art.", "A pleasant and unique film": "I found the film exceptionally enjoyable. The animation shifts between action and dialogue, being given a more comicesque outline throughout fights, reducing the frame rate making them easier and satisfying to follow, while reverting to the normal 3d style, I must say the colors are really vivid, the character designs are stunning, and the story is fun and deep.Each conflict I believe is given time to breathe, while we are also provided a breath of fresh air. For once, I understand the difference between an evil villain and a villain. You have characters to root against, and characters to outright fear. It's an outright genuine experience for Children and Adults who grew up or around this cinematic universe. It would be doing one's self a disservice to not watch this while it is in theaters!", "BEST DREAMWORKS PERFORMANCE": "The book illustration like visual are so stunning, the animation are top notch, the voice actor deliver their role very powerful, the direction are so strong, the music was fantastic, the message make me cry! Solid movie to end 2022! It's so amazing that an animation for kids doesn't hide the darkness of compelling storytelling while being funny! A lot of animation movie nowadays trying hard to be funny but doesn't give moral towards kid. But this movie, it's teach us to value life, value of trustworthy, friendship, froster family, appreciation of the one you love, etc. The characters are so good that you can feel each of their personality and get attached towards em. I'm shocked a 2 hours animated movie can make me cried while 3 hours movie just felt empty lol.", "An Unexpected Masterpiece": "This might be one of the best-animated films to come out in the past 5 years. The animation looks amazing. The characters are all likable and endearing, the voice cast did an amazing job of bringing the characters to life. The story is one of the best I've seen from Dreamworks in my opinion. The movie isn't afraid to take dark topics such as mortality. The antagonists are some of the best villains in any Dreamworks Film, And the film is emotional when It wants to be. Go Watch This Film, It's worth your time and money. I hope we get more films like this from Dreamworks, And I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.", "Amazing!": "I saw a few reviews before I went to watch it and they said that it is a good movie but I wasn't expecting this movie to be sooooo good. In my opinion was DreamWorks in the past few years not like back then. The movies were ok or just unnecessary but this one makes the old feelings come back, it was so much fun and as good as the best Shrek movie in my opinion. I would recommend this movie to everyone it is funny, not to long, catchy, and it has great action. I mean it's amazing. The characters are good and the the style of the movie is just incredible it is kinda like the animated spiderman movie. But there is not much more to say, just go in you won't regret it.", "Too Dark, Heavy and Demonic": "We were really excited to see this movie, but were completely thrown off guard. The amount of dark and demonic scenes in this movie is outrageous. This movie brings a heaviness and uneasiness into the atmosphere as you're watching it and instills fear into kids. It's sad to see where \"kids\" movies are going nowadays. They also throw in some language. We left partway through the film, as both of our kids were unsettled and worried about having nightmares. I honestly don't blame them because us as adults were disturbed and bothered by it too. If you're a parent, I highly suggest reconsider not taking your kids to see this or go and watch it yourself before showing this to them. Those images in their heads and that fear can leave lasting impressions. I wish we knew beforehand what we know now, next time we will do more research before going to a \"kids\" movie. This movie is HORRIFIC!!", "A beautiful movie for all ages": "Like a lot of people, I thought this was gonna be a decent movie, but it's really an amazing movie. The story is original and the animation is fresh for the eyes and feels like illustrations from a fairy tale book. Jack Horner is an old school villain and I love it! It's nice to see a charismatic and unapologetically evil villain on the big screen again. The characters are super well-written and comedic in a way that's more natural and the humor doesn't overpower the story. Dreamworks did a phenomenal job on designing Death's character seeing that he's trending on social media. The movie teaches a great lesson on mortality and the value of life. Fun for kids, an eye-opener for adults, and a great revival of the Shrek franchise.", "Shockingly good!": "At first, I thought that I might not end up liking this movie but the more I watched it, the more I enjoyed it. And I am a person who likes references and all the cliques. To be completely honest, I cried many times during this movie in theatre and I am sure I wasn't alone. It has so much grace and character development, not only from the main characters but also from the side characters as well. It's not even predictable and a bit scary. A character fighting death itself in a film for kids, have you ever seen something like that before? Also, can't wait to see Kitty and Puss with perrito in Shrek 5!", "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING": "If your a fan of puss in boots already you'll LOVE this movie and if you're new to it in general it's a whole mix of emotions it makes you feel that go together smoothly, there's even small details in the movie that add a fun charm to it! I loved this movie so much and even made me some what emotional for parts that were sad and happy. The villain to the movie was awesome and down right cool. The visuals for the movie were amazing as well a beautiful style put into it with contrast of colors in some of scenes, it's a fun movie to look at and just a even better story I love how it ties into the next movie they'll make.", "Best movie of the year": "This movie was so amazing best animation also like a good sequel in general probably my new favorite cartoon movie. This movie will maybe get 10 10 out of 10 in the coming weeks. This movie was fun to watch it was hilarious thought I was going to be like the first one boring but broke my expectations great movie great story great characters everything about this movie was so amazing I just wanted to say to the writers that they did an extremely well job the overall post overcoming his fears was so great because you know we have to overcome here at some point you're probably not going to read all of this this review.", "Why this movie is the best movie in 2022": "This movie is perfect from its dark and mature story to almost avatar visuals. This movie Is perfect it's the best shrek movie and I think it's the best movie of 2022 sure you have The Batman and black panther 2 but puss in boots the last wish is perfect and it's my 2nd favourite film of all time. Death aka the main antagonist and my favourite movie villain ever is portrayed amazingly well. And I'm surprised it had dark humour in a kids film (not really) and I Look forward to see it grow in the box office I think it may have passed 400 million by now therefore it's one of the best movies 100/10.", "NOT FOR KIDS!! I'm shocked it's rated PG": "I took my 7 and 5 year olds with me, as we'd seen the trailers and excited to watch it on Boxing Day 2022.WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE. There was NO sign of the terror in any of the trailers and had I known, I wouldn't have gone.The movie is rated PG, but it is NOT suitable for children.I grew up loving Puss in Boots and Antonio Banderas is brilliant, but this movie is not for kids. The sick thing is that it's rated PG! I'm utterly disgusted by this.*SPOILERS*I was shocked at how the morbid wolf was only out to kill Puss. With his haunting 'wolf whistle', his blood red eyes, the pair of sickles as his weapons and fire flames as he walked in... it wasn't a sight to see for any young child.We closed our eyes and turned around every time he came onto the scene, but honestly we should've left.", "I absolutely loved it!!": "I love cats, I love cats wearing boots, enough said! The way the art style changes during battle scenes, is amazing! An adorable movie, with serious tones so both kids and adults will love it. Only thing I didn't like, was the bleeped out cussing. This is a kids movie, bleeped out or not that was inexcusable. Other than that, absolutely adored this movie. I love the characters they chose, it was a nice surprise. I love the singing and dancing, the songs in the movie were very catchy. You just can't go wrong, it's cat defeating evil while learning what friendship really means. I don't see how anyone could hate this movie!", "talking cat movie didn't disappoint": "The animation for this film is gorgeous. The bright vibrant colours perfectly juxtapose the dark and scary scenes that represent more emotionally intense moments. The action packed scenes are visually stunning, and the drop of frame rate helps the viewer take in each moment. Every ounce of emotion is shown through the details of the characters' faces, which help you experience what they are feeling.Dreamworks Animations knocks it out of the park with this dashing new animated film, not only with stunning painterly visuals, but with an amazing story that captures the audience's hearts. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish manages to touch into deeper topics while still being able to communicate to younger viewers. Those who go into the theatres fully expecting an adventure packed movie about a talking cat will get what they were looking for. Plus, a therapy session they never knew they needed. I for sure did not know I needed it. I recommend watching in the cinema, as a pirated website would not do the film justice. For people looking for a film that has many comedic aspects, splendid animation, memorable moments with their favourite characters, and a great story and message should watch Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Go ahead and don't make the same mistake as I, and watch this masterpiece with friends or family on the big screens :)Rating: 5 paws out of 5!", "Big improvement": "The trailer left that feeling that it would be good, but it was better in all aspects compared to the first one, which I don't even remember how \"marking\" it was.I loved what they did to one of the antagonists and how he affects the cat. Most of the jokes work (it's a shame they show the montage of lives in the trailers), the arcs are well divided, the characters' goal, I can say that Spiderverse had its share of influence in the animation, which is beautiful.The team has a lot of work ahead of them if they want to make one more, and the cat is an excellent character who deserves the challenge.You can watch it, it's really worth it !", "The best animated movie in a long time!": "Having been recommended by a friend I entered the cinemas with the highest of expectations in mind. Having said that, this movie went above and beyond the highest of my expectations, with its delicious animation and simply perfect plot-line and character development.It is clear that DreamWorks took the animation of this movie to a new level, embracing elements of 'The Spiderverse' along with the more traditional animations we'd seen previously. The animation was refreshing and engaging.More importantly, the characters in this were well thought out, with personal stories and struggles that all of us can relate to, resulting in an often highly emotional watching experience. Furthermore, this movie has a consistent theme and message interwoven in its plot, one that is inspirational and often lacking in most contemporary films today.All in all, this is a film that I will continue to watch on an annual basis, as it's message is one that we all too often forget in this current climate.", "Very emotional and very scary": "Went in with no expectations and was very surprised at how deep this move was. The themes of running away from fear and manifesting your own wish by being trusting and open definitely hit me. It was also pretty scary. There were some scenes that had me holding my breath from the intensity of the situation, especially the scene near the end with Puss and Perrito. I loved the movie as a whole, it made me cry and made me laugh. I definitely relate to Perrito as well, wonderful character. They could have easily made him a generic comic relief, but instead they gave him so many layers.Animation was great. The colors were incredible and the way they played with the frame rate added to and made the action scenes pop.This movie might be too mature for under 13s.", "A new standard for family cinema": "Hard to believe this is a part of the shrek franchise.Puss in buts: the last wish accomplishes things that few children's movies even dare to dream of in our time. With it's well-directed and charming opening sequence it immediately brings us back to the same feeling of the last movie, wich was released over a decade ago, but makes us feel like we had watched it only yesterday.The movie's first subversion to it's predecessor lies in the meeting with our main antagonist that comes right after the opening sequence.Our new main antagonist is nothing you can find in other children's movies, he is pure evil, he's brutal, he's menacing and he's enjoying every second of it.The rest of our antagonist, who are more family-friendly, are also handled quite well.Goldilocks and the three bears are villains you can and will eventually relate to and root for.And \"big\" Jack Horner is a villain that we love to hate, he's an evil manager with funny lines and he gets beaten at the end.The film uses its new antagonists and familiar protagonists well, every scene where they all interact with each other is well written and beautifully animated and directed.The action scenes are out of this world, the use of color and the \"into the spider-versey\" animation create magnificent arenas for our characters and every frame is a work of art.The character of puss in boots himself is much more relatable this time. It is uncommon for a protagonist to admit his fears, especially in a movie meant for children, but his journey and eventual acceptance of death as a part of life is a bold and wonderful lesson.This movie reminds me why I love cinema, and how to enjoy it. Puss in boots: the last wish made me both laugh and be on the edge of my sit, it better get the recognition it deserves.Because honestly, a sequel of a spinoff to the shrek franchise has no logical reason to be this ****ing RAW.", "A Surprisingly Great Adventure": "It's a shame that the metacritic score for this movie isn't as high as it should be. The Last Wish is easily the best animated film of 2022, a great return to the beloved Shrek franchise, and a theme that actually makes the viewer emotional. Without diving into spoilers, the antagonist is a genuine threat, and his looming presence instills a feeling of dread. The movie is so colorful and vibrant too- it never feels boring to look at. This is exactly what animation should be. You never want to take your eyes off the screen, and the spectacle couldn't be achieved in live action. If I could, I'd give this movie 9.5 stars because there were some parts I felt weren't perfect, but I have no problem rounding up for this review. Easily recommend this film for anyone.", "How they managed to pull this off": "Every aspect of this movie is at least great.From lovable main character, despite he isn't that good of a person, through great story, beautiful animation style, well written story, good jokes, just amazing usage of sound, amazing music, great and well developed side characters to main villains.Jack Horner is a pretty funny but still threatening antagonist. His magic weapons arsenal is pretty good usage of shown by Shrek films world where all fairytales lives together.Death himself is just amazing. First scene with him shows his potential perfectly. While watching i couldn't wait to see him again and when he does, i was scared about what is going to happen, what puss is going to do?Goldilocks and bears are pretty charming and they aren't that antagonistic as Jack Horner (Death himself isn't hunting but for puss so im not comparing him). They are well developed and it is hard to not like them despite they are against main characters.", "This movie has no business being this good": "I went into the theater only looking for a fun reminder of my childhood alongside shrek's side kick however I was shocked to find this film first of all gorgeous (truly a little marvel of modern animation) but foremost touching. Indeed, the last wish portrays anxiety in a way that just felt right especially as someone who has struggled with similar issues. On another note, the film is quite hilarious aswell with jokes made both for children as well as adults. The lightness of the tone really added to an already delightful watch. All in all, loads of laughs and some tears threatening to be shed. A truly great cinematic experience overall.", "More than meets the eye about appreciating life and those in it": "This movie somehow changed my view of death. And now thanks to Joel Crawford wonderful storytelling and animation style and I came too see this movie as more of lesson in life than just as an entertainment. It shows that even the most badass and fearless of hero like Puss. Have fear and insecurities despite his fame and bravado. And how it comes to appreciating the love ones you left out in your life. For that i am happy and grateful what this movie showed me. And especially how the creator are slowly changing this character's story and personality for the better. I am sure we can expect great things for this character stories in the future.", "I LOVED THE MOVIE!!!": "I love the new Graphics and Colors there better than the old one this is the best movie for this year I love this movie so much it brings my childhood back and I really love puss in boots sooo much. And the new characters are really amazing too and I love the story a lot and it really made me enjoy the time watching them he movie on Dec 23, 2022 my family enjoyed it too. I hope DreamWorks makes another puss in boots later on in the years and I really love the Puss in Boots Cast & Crew the after so great and just one compliment Kitty Soft Paws Looked really Cute and Puss in boots together W Movie.", "Appealing for all ages": "I really enjoyed the Puss in Boots sequel. Less focus on detail seemed to make it attractive yet cheap animation without compromising on quality. Probably, this new style will become more popular in new animations, imitating Spider-Man. The combination of adult elements and jokes between the colorful childlike world of the animation is well done. Fight scene are busy and breathtaking, and the fight scenes are very action-packed and similar to anime's. Perhaps the message of the story is more understandable by adults than children. I personally enjoyed the character of death. His presence with music and dark moments made gave me goose bumps everytime. He was one of the best animation villains who had a small presence. However, the story may have taken a repetitive path and adventure, but I think it has done it's mission correctly and is worth watching for one and a half hours. Perhaps only a few questions remain unanswered but I shouldn't expect too high of an animation that os aimed for kids.And I won't expect much from my first review and bad Grammer.", "Astounding Animation and Beautiful Storytelling": "I went into the movie theater with zero expectations and got a wonderful experience and my hopes up for the future of DreamWorks animation and further Shrek sequels!The story flows naturally, even if the numbee of side characters make it seem like there's too many storylines to follow. But that doesn't happen! Everything is neatly done and all the story arcs have great endings by the end of the movie. They managed to give every character a change to shine, without giving up any of the fun gags and shenanigans.The choice of dropping the framerate during action scenes is a master's trick in my opinion, the flow of the characters makes these shots very unique and differentiate them from the rest of the movie.The themes were well thought out and come together at the end of the movie, the payoff is worth the incredible journey.Will definitely rewatch this before it leaves theaters.", "The film is good but dubbing was awful": "The movie is interesting, the children enjoyed it very much. But the Bulgarian dubbing was terrible! Goldilocks and the bears talked disgustingly. The children did not understand what they were saying. We have to explain them what they are saying. The stunt doubles had chosen to speak a dialect from a region that was incomprehensible. I don't even know how they would translate this in English.It was awful experience for us. We have to relax and enjoy, but we were afraid how to explain what you have in mind.I think that in Bulgaria you have a big problem with the dubbed. Most of people won't understand the story.", "Goofy Loveable Gato": "Honestly one of the best movies or kids movies I've ever seen, definitely top tier DreamWorks movie next to how to train your dragon, incredibly more colorful and vibrant and especially to a cat and Hispanic person it feels a lot more personal and makes everything more lovable and enjoyable, even still you don't need to be a cat or Hispanic to enjoy this movie, it still has its laughs and the art style is as great yet different as spider man's art style that made it so nice, from the great art, enjoyable characters, an interesting narrative with enjoyable characters and especially villains, all with a lovable cat main character, the movie is perfect in nearly all regards and already finished my second play though, it's a movie all ages and backgrounds will love. If you haven't already please go watch it you won't be disappointed, hell I'm only a teen who plays games all day and hates just going out, but I'm so glad I did that night, and with all the mid tier/terrible movies coming out, gives all the more reason to give this one a try.", "NOT recommend for kids under 12": "Definitely NOT recommend for kids under 12. Crazy, messy and not really kind, greatly disappointed.. The first part is a masterpiece to compare with \"this\", the graphics is strange, no simpathy to ugly and grotesque personages.. Journey to the magic forest just reminds an acid trip, colors irritate eyes and constant action -nerves . The plot itself is very poor, looks like chip Hollywood blockbusters of 90's. Really don't understand so high rating, any Disney movie of the last years is great deal better! The dog is probably the one who \"save\" the situation a bit, it's nice and one of the most mentally healthy \"person\" in this asylum\ud83d\ude48", "Everyone will be entertained": "The Last Wish was pretty entertaining. The story was really good and funny. It is very colorful and is filled with a lot of imagination. Looks like they used similar animation techniques from Spider-verse in the action sequences, and it brought a lot of great dynamics and style into them. The voice acting was also pretty strong too. I don't really have many problems with the movie, nothing that is really worth mentioning anyway. All in all , The Last Wish is a good movie with good music and even a couple of great moments for the adults watching as well. Meaning everyone will be entertained, no matter the age.", "Super funny and adorable": "\"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" was filled with the same lovable characters reprising their roles from the previous films. Antonio Banderes and Salma Hayek Pinault's character's enduring relationship does not disappoint. The additional new characters are just as funny, charming, and comical. The storyline was easy to follow for all ages. A definite must-watch, at least a couple of times to catch the one-liners in both English and Spanish. The incredible background character antics and animation really keep the movie moving in a positive way. Overall, a comical, adventurous and heartwarming story of lovable characters.", "A Sequel With Teeth": "I was not the biggest fan of the original. But this movie was one of my favorites I've seen all year, and one of my favorite animated movies of all time! Everything about this movie is beyond excellent: the writing, the animation, the emotion, the humor, the voices, THE FIGHT SCENES, everything! The Big Bad Wolf is without a doubt the best movie villain of 2022 and one of the best animated movie villains of all time! I laughed, I cried, and I jumped for joy! It's a movie that makes you want to experience it again and again! I've already seen it twice in theaters, and I cannot wait to see it again!", "Just as i just expected,another classic movie of DreamWork": "Dark with Light,Day and Night combined,Funny and Scary,Happy and Sad. This \"kid movie\" bring me nostalgia at first then bring me all the emotion i could feel,it deserves to be nominated for it graphic especially when its in 20fps when fight begin. Thank you DreamWork (again). My little brother of 7 year old \"Just LOVE the smell of\"this movie. Thsi movie show how family matter,how all loved one is more important than new one and most importantly how life is priceless,it teach us that no matter if you are a legend,or rich,poor,old,young,a politician or a doctor we simply die equally and that why i rate that movie a 9 out of 10. Bravo DreamWork.", "The effects of into the spider-verse": "I would have never expected Puss in boots of all things would end up being one of my favorite animated movies of all time!! The animation is gorgeous and, while obviously inspired by into the spider-verse, keeps its own style which fits the fairytale narrative. Death is a fantastic villain and the scenes with him have a complete tonal change. Hes such a fantastic villain. The other villains are also great. I love all of the characters and they all have some great arcs, especially Puss. Everything in this movie is amazing. Its an exhilarating thrillride that you never want to stop. There is also \"swearing\" in this movie. In a kids movie!! Just amazed at the quality of the movie. BTW there are no actual F-bombs or anything like that.", "The best film of the year": "Before reading this review I want you to know that this film is quite dark for dreamworks film. This is not a film for small children. This was just my cup of tea. This may sound insane but the sequel to a bad spin off of Shrek is a masterpiece in so many ways. The biggest surprise I've had in years. Firstly, this movie balances three villains perfectly, (technically six but anyway.) I won't talk about them much but the best character is the wolf by an extremely long shot. All, and yes I do mean all, of the characters are so entertaining.I can easily say this should win best picture or at least be nominated for best animated picture. Another thing to mention is that the trailer in my opinion should not be watched to get an idea of the film except the animation. Oh the animation. It is probably the best looking thing in the Dreamworks catalogue. They also use it in some of the greatest ways especially with the wolf villain.Not to mention the fight sequences. Those both use animation to its fullest potential and are incredibly well choreographed. Please watch it. Dreamworks both needs it and deserves it for this amazing amazing film .", "One of the best movies of 2022": "I saw this movie in the theater and was amazed by the animation. It was crazy good. I have always been in love with dream work studios and puss in boots. Character design is amazing, totally recommend seeing this with your kids!! What ever karens are saying about Deaths character design is too scary, don't listen to them. I saw this with my 6 year old sister and she wasn't scared. His design isn't even that scary. To all of the Karens out there, if you don't want your kids to see an amazing movie, you probs make your 10 year old watch Cocomelon. Again, totally recommend this movie if your bored! It's one of DreamWorks best movie!", "A genius return of the cat with boots": "This movie perfectly captures the world of Shrek and the atmosphere of the first movie, only with a better story.As in the first movie the stakes weren't that emotional, this movie improves on the storytelling. The characters are well written and funny. This movie does not sacrifice it's story for some comedic jokes, but rather incorporates very funny jokes with a witty story with some emotional real stakes for the main characters.The bad guys are well designed and either extremely funny or actually terrifying (or both).In conclusion I think this movie really captures the magic of the world of Shrek with a style that perfectly captures puss in boots.", "it is awsome": "Finally i watched this movie. Tbh this is one of the best animated movie i ever watched. I think it is kind of scary for small kids. But this movie is so amazing. The villain is so good. I love the wolf ( the villain ). He is so cold and that whistle gives us some chills. I need another sequel of this movie. This movie has became one of my favorites and i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone. I think small children would be scared of this. The villain might be so scary for small children. And also the dog is kind of an interesting and weird character. I definitely need new adventures of the team friendship.", "My New Favorite Movie!": "I watched the original Puss in Boots as a kid. I thought it was alright, but because I watched it as a kid, it stuck with me.When I saw the news about a new Puss in Boots getting a sequel, I was so excited. Years pass by as I was waiting to get more news about it, but it's finally here!Like most people who have reviewed this movie, my expectations were blown away!The Music was superb! The Art and Animation screamed personality and passion! And let's not forget about the story and it's characters! Everything about it screams fun! But then I was surprised by the dark twist this story went for.It didn't even bother me, if anything, I was intrigued.In this movie, the legendary Puss in Boots is stripped away from his confidence as he literally faces death. All he has is a single life. He's lost the other eight, being completely careless of his past lives.We have Kitty Softpaws, a character who was in the previous movie (Don't even need to watch the first movie to see the relationship between Puss and Kitty) and Perrito, a new character who is just as important as the other two.Just wanted to say that the very last part of the movie had my heart pounding as I'm watching Puss fight Death (He's literally a character). Seeing Puss fight for his life made me smile, because it really felt like Puss has changed for the better. I felt so genuinely happy that I almost shed a tear.I don't want to go over everything because one, too lazy, and two, you really should go see the movie for yourself and experience all of what this movie has to offer! (That's if you haven't seen it yet) Because it's criminal that this movie still isn't getting the attention it truly deserves.I went to go see this movie six times in the theater.Just thought I'd show my support to Dreamworks...01/21/23.", "Absolutely fresh and amazing.": "I really enjoyed the movie because of how they changed the artstyle, animation and the style of the narrative, the jokes weren't destroying the sentimental value of the film and were actually funny. The voice acting also had a huge spotlight for me, especially during songs that i found amazing. The movie shows a more mature take on a shrek character so hopefully they do the same for Shrek himself. The movie has some flaws without a daubt, but the good parts heavily overshadowed them. Death is an actually scary villain for once in animated films from past years and i love it so much. Death as a villain is perfect, materializing a fear many of us have allows the character of Puss in boots to become more relatable, especially with the anxiety attack scene, it captures what it feels like and how our little friends can help us through out it.Love it.", "Yeah it sucked": "It is cringy, creepy, unfunny and with weak creativity about its characters. I am going to stop going to dreamworks movies anymore cus they are way over hyped from bots. I dont recommend you bring children less than 10 to the movie and adults as well cus it is a lost of time. The quality of animation was decent which is expected when you pour tons of money but that is all it has. I am sorry for losing my time and money. I walked out on the 20th min when I didnt smiled at least once from the experience till then. Shrek and Puss in Boots 1 was 1 million times better form the 1st sec I still rewatch it from time to time, but this piece of ... I would NOT even finish it the first time. Disney are corrupt wacks it is obvious for every with logical and critical thinking after it sees even the first quarter of the movie. Sorry not sorry.", "Best animated movie of the decade": "Surprising how deep \"kids\" movies can get. It is a\nmovie that entertains kids but at the same times gives a very very very meaningful message. Everybody internally runs from something but at the end trying over compensate this void with external things is just an illusion. Sometimes are fears make us act in ways we hurt people that love us. Life is about establishing meaningfull connections. Love, friendship, family complete us, not power or money. We can spend all are lifes running from are deepest fears, but it is a decision we make. As I said, deep movie.Also has a good pace, you never feel like its slow or fast, hits the sweet spot.", "Dreamwork's Still Has It.": "Puss in Boots the Last Wish was probably one of the most surprising movies to come out last year a sequel to the first Puss in Boots movie which was a spin-off the Shrek series has somehow in many peoples eyes undoubtedly reached the upper echelons of Dreamwork's catalogue. The movie tackles extremely mature themes from Puss learning to except his own mortality and the inevitability of death to living life to the fullest even through traumatic events. The Story is very simple and yet incredibly effective the way the Wishing Star ties in the three main groups of characters and what each want from it is done incredibly and how at the end each character gets their wish (except one) without the wishing star and whilst that might seem like a very generic plot the characters, animation, themes all make seem so fresh and new, and that brings me to my next point the animation is incredibly stunning and beautiful it feels like a fresh take in animation and it reminds me of when animation company's pushed the boundaries and made such creative and expressive art which feels so rare these days, the perfect mix of the 2D and 3D animation is seamless and the drops in frames in certain scenes, the small details in scenes, and how colorful and distinct every scene is it just makes the viewing experience and spectacle incredible. Now for me the strongest part of this movie were it's characters which is surprising to me because in a movie with nearly 10 main characters it perfectly juggles them with enough development and screen time that makes you care about each and everyone of them even Perrito who many thought would be an annoying gag character is used so well throughout the movie and his scene where he helps Puss through his panic attack like a real life therapy dog is so emotional and well done, now this brings me to the strongest part of the movie it's villains now of course everyone already knows about Death so I won't talk to much about him, but he is now objectively one of the greatest Dreamwork's villains ever created alongside Lord Shen, Lord Farquaad, and even the Fairy Godmother the way the tone of a scene changes when he enters is so dramatic and perfectly executed his motives make complete sense and the final confrontation where he excepts that Puss has changed and he won't try two kill him anymore is so well done and fits perfectly with his character, and also there is Big Jack Horner who is in my opinion one of the funniest characters in the movie his dynamic with Jiminy Cricket is hilarious and also how he is pretty much evil incarnate for no reason is just funny and I really liked that they did that because for the past decade we have had sympathetic villains who we are meant to feel bad for and Disney twist villains who feel like a cheap way of trying to subvert the audience so just having a character be evil for the sake of being evil is just hilarious to me and also his death where instead of some moment of sorrow or regret for his actions he simply accepts that he was a horrible human being. Overall this movie was near perfection my only gripe is that I feel Puss's initial retirement from his heroic life early in the film could have been more fleshed out but other than that this movie checked every box for a timeless classic and it also proved that Dreamwork's can still make incredible, mature, funny, and creative movies.", "Muy buen": "Muy buen, very good movie the quality is amazing I'm surprised that DreamWorks made puss in boots such good.i didn't believe Antonio Banderas play puss in boots so we'll and it's surprisingly the plot so good better than Disney and the character is good very much better than Disney film kiddos for DreamWorks for making this film. This is film is good for any age cause it got the thing that makes you fun, DreamWorks such a good upgrade l....... That's probably all the things that makes DreamWorks much more sent then it's competitor I hope DreamWorks made a more good film..... Kiddos for DreamWorks for make amazing film.", "Part 1 was better": "Part 1 was way better. Part 1 had a better story and animationstyle. Part one really had that wild west vibe, but this one not at all. I didnt like this new animationstyle, it is comicbooklike and too colourful. My opinion about this movie is that too much was happening at the same time, it was like they tried to show as much as possible in as little time as possible. They tried to make everything funny, but it didnt work for me most of the time, this made it really cringe.The storyline was also cliche and therefore predictable. When you are a fan of romantic, artsy animation movies, this one is definitely not worth your time and money.", "Fantastic and Dark": "I watched this movie in theaters and I couldn't believe it, it's been years since I saw such a beautiful animation, captivating and charismatic characters and a villain that every time he appeared I got goose bumps. The puss in boots was afraid because it was his last life and he didn't want to die, but at the end of the movie he changes his personality, he stopped being an arrogant guy who considered himself a legend for a person who fights for his own life even though he knew he couldn't defeat death, now he assumes that he is no longer a legend but a flawed person like everyone else. 10/10.", "Favorite movie of 2022": "Easily my favorite movie of 2022. Among all of the mediocre movies Disney has been releasing, it's refreshing to see DreamWorks release a masterpiece of a movie.Aside from a great story, the villains were very well written. Every time the wolf came on screen, I was on the edge of my seat. Even the other villains were all well-written and well incorporated into the story.It was surprising to see a kids movie do a \"coming to terms with your own mortality\" theme so well. But, Puss in Boots nailed it.The relationships between Puss, his friend, and love interest is very wholesome. I can't wait to see what the future movies this franchise will bring.", "Went for the toddler but loved it more than him": "Fun animation that adds a lot of movement to the action scenes. Plenty of fights and action with jokes that can be appreciated by adults but still go over the heads of little ones.The integration and characters that have been developed from the fairytales and nursery rhymes work very well. Similar to Guardian of the Galaxy, going with less mainstream characters has allowed some great direction for the movie makers to go with and be creative with.Also enjoyed that it was fast flowing giving enough background and story to feel engaged but not having to go into backstories that would slow the pace of the movie.", "Great Film! Questionable Actors.": "I saw this film in theaters a couple weeks ago and it was great but I feel like the beginning was the peak of the film and all of the things with Jack Horner felt like they dragged on for me. I also feel like the voice acting could have been better, for example I feel like the voice actor for Death didn't really fit the character that well and it wasn't really that intimidating for me, I also have the same problems with Jack Horner. The ending was great and in the final battle in which Puss in Boots bleeds actually shocked me that they'd have that in here. This film also had wind design and art.", "something different from normal": "I would recommend you to watch the movie with your family without hesitation. After all this time someone did something different, Disney Pixar or dream works itself didn't do anything like this before from showing blood to use of cuss words by a puppy in socks to death coming for a cat. Pretty positive and scary movie at same time. But while seeing this movie ending was not as satisfactory as i thought the wolf turns out to be a Mexican amigo and jack Horner start collapsing into a start.after the original puss in boots it was the best sequel till now (maybe because others were Netflix adaptations)", "Not up to snuff": "The charm of the 2011 Puss n Boots, which is one of my favorite movies, is missing. The 2011 movie was entertaining for both adults and kids. This one, not so much.Even for a \"Once upon a time ...\" story within a Nursery Rhyme, the plot doesn't make sense. Sadly, as a sequel it's par for the sad course that sequels often are. Even as a stand-alone-movie I found it disappointing.It suffers from what many animated movies do and what I call \"Super Fast Action Sequences\". Meaning the action happens so quickly it's impossible to determine what's going on. My guess as to why it happens in this movie, is because the action doesn't make sense. For example characters are able to leap/fly very long distances without any super powers or mechanical help. And there's no delay between an event and characters reaction to it. They apparently know something will happen, before it happens.The action sequences are also overly long and boring since it's impossible to figure out what's happening. During several action sequences I was tempted to fast forward but didn't because from what I had already seen, fast forwarding wouldn't be any less boring.The animation lacks sincerity as some of the new characters are drawn in nonsensical ways. For example the new Chihuahua character doesn't resemble a Chihuahua, other than it's small stature. On another nonsensical note, the Chihuahua is dumb and smart at the same time.I'm unable to find any entertaining qualities in this movie. I feel the $24.99 rental price was inappropriate. At best it's a $3.99 movie and that's only if you have very young kids you want to get out of your hair for a while. As an adult with no young kids, I felt it was a waste of time and money.", "Ugly animation": "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is a charming and entertaining animated film that will delight audiences of all ages. The movie follows the adventures of the titular character, Puss in Boots, as he embarks on a quest to find the legendary Last Wish, which is said to grant the holder any wish they desire.The story is well-written and engaging, with plenty of action, humor, and heart. The characters are well-developed and likable, and the voice acting is top-notch. Antonio Banderas once again brings his trademark charm and wit to the role of Puss in Boots, and he is joined by a talented cast that includes Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianakis, and Billy Bob Thornton.However, the animation style of the film is a major letdown. The movie uses a computer-generated animation style that lacks the fluidity and expressiveness of traditional hand-drawn animation. The characters move stiffly and lack the subtle nuances of expression and gesture that bring animated characters to life. Additionally, the film's visual style is inconsistent, with some scenes beautifully rendered and others feeling flat and uninspired.Despite the film's many positive qualities, its unenjoyable animation style ultimately detracts from the overall experience. While the story and voice acting are strong, the film's animation style fails to impress in any way and may leave viewers feeling underwhelmed. As a result, \"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\" is not recommended to those seeking a visually compelling animated film.", "Best movie i've watched in years.": "Im not really here to write a ginormous paragraph, but I want to show my extreme appreciation for this masterpiece.-The new animation style for dreamworks is BEAUTIFUL.-The humor is not dry whatsoever and there was not a single time where i rolled my eyes.-I love the characters with my whole heart. The character development of Goldi, Puss and even Kitty is amazing.-The whole plot is just mind blowing and so creative.-Death deserves his own bullet point. The character design, the voice, and even the ending. I LOVE how there wasn't just death 'dying' or getting beat, and he just walked away.I've watched this at least 4 times in the span of a week. Best movie ever.", "Enter the best movie of 2022": "Alright! Today I'm reviewing Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the sequel to 2011's Puss in Boots, which itself was a spin-off from the overall Shrek franchise. This movie sees everyone's favorite sword-wielding cat grapple with his mortality after using eight of his nine lives, thus setting off on a quest to wish upon a star and gain more lives, reuniting with old friends and making new ones alike while occasionally sparring with Death himself.Right off the table, it must be known that The Last Wish is genuinely fantastic through and through, superseding expectations in its animation, humor, villains, and heart. It's a solid time at the movies through and through, and with a tight hour and forty-minute runtime that I cannot express my appreciation for enough. With more and more blockbusters surpassing the 2-hour mark and even venturing into the three-hour territory, it's nice to return to animation that keeps doesn't bloat and drag under the weight of sequels and spin-offs. It was a quick and effective runtime that, at the exact moment I thought it was dragging, kicked into high gear with an adrenaline-inducing finale. Fantastic timing on the movie's part.Also appreciated was the visual style of the film. Once again, compared to contemporaries, The Last Wish exceeds all expectations by eschewing the typical photorealistic style popularized by Pixar in the early 2000s, favoring a more artsy \"painted\" style a la Spider-Verse that is perfectly fit for a fairy tale. Some of the more beautiful shots reminded me of The Wizard of Oz's painted backgrounds, which I thoroughly appreciated. It's also important to give a ton of love to the design of Puss in Boots - easily one of the best anthropomorphized designs ever. Every facial detail is perfectly captured yet still distinctly catlike, it's amazing to watch.Also amazing to watch is the rest of the movie. It still has the trademark Shrek fairytale satire that borders on edgy, but it's also built off of fun character interactions and clever dialogue and line deliveries. It's gut bustingly hilarious for the majority of its runtime, although nothing matches the superb \"day in the life\" sequence where Puss takes down a giant with swashbuckling charm. Once the plot kicks into gear the jokes begin to slow down, which was somewhat disappointing but also allowed for the emotional beats to not be drowned in lame gags, an attribute lost in modern action films.The emotional beats in this movie are what make it work, and with that in mind, The Last Wish, like all good fairy tales, has a very clear lesson to be learned. At its core, Puss in Boots is a story about making the most of this life, about how we have to claw and bite to fight for it to make it truly worthwhile. It's also a story about coming to terms with mortality, hubris, families, and trust. It's a heartwarming and inspiring tale of bonding and friendship, a bona fide classic that could come to rival Shrek 2 given time.It also, and I am so happy to say this, has a villain. I have complained about animated movies not having strong villains for years, with most of them either having last-minute twist villains (Moana) or no villain at all (Also Moana). Puss in Boots has several villains, each fully taking advantage of their fairytale setting and their inherent absurdity. Goldilocks encapsulates the theme of family alongside Puss, Kitty, and Perritto. A grotesque Little Jack Horner serves as the movie's primary physical threat, while Death himself serves as the movie's thematic threat. Words fail to describe how much of a standout Death was in this movie. Everything about him - his voice, his design, weapons, whistling, dialogue, the rapid tone shifts, terrifying imagery, inescapable force of nature dread versus sympathetic attributes, and honor - all of it was pitch perfect for a representation of Death.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fantastic movie. It's the best movie of 2022, the best animated film since Spider-Verse, and the best DreamWorks movie since How to Train Your Dragon in 2010. This is the type of movie that should make Disney afraid, a crowd-pleasing smash hit that relied on word-of-mouth to get going and has healthy box office numbers ($90 million budget, $393 million box office). It's all deserved, but the fact that Puss in Boots stands so tall in a year when Lightyear and Strange World fell flat on their faces (Combined budgets of $335-$380 million, $299 million box office) makes the victory so much sweeter. Puss in Boots is the hero 2022 needed.Overall, I give Puss in Boots: The Last Wish a 10/10. \"Shockingly emotional, hilarious, and terrifying, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a touching story about mortality and making the most of the time you have.\"", "Best DreamWorks movie": "I did not expect this to be that good the animation was super good some of the best I've seen ever and I mean this is probably tied with the Spider verse. Also one of the best parts of this movie is the plot it's is nothing like great but it is good one of the plots of 2022. Now probably my favorite part is the characters let's start off with puss in boots oh my god he has such a big character transformation in the movie it's insane. Now let's talk about death is one of the best animated characters of all time he is one of the best villains of all time too. Spoilers, now I'm going talk about the post credit scene wow I loved seeing Schrek on the big screen again. Those are the reasons why I think this is a 10/10.", "Astonishing movie, MUST WATCH": "To preface: If you plan to watch this children with very young children, I don't recommend it. That being said, I want to be clear that this movie isn't bad for that reason and young children simply aren't a great audience for it. If you're going to bring your family to this movie I recommend 12+ or other children able to handle or enjoy mildly crude, slightly dark visuals, and mature themes (in the meaning not of explicit material, but just heavy concepts) The content I speak of is some innuendos about foul language (both in cut-offs and outright ambiguous bleeping) and Death's appearance being somewhat frightening with blood-red eyes and scythes. There is also very light blood, limited to about 2 scenes where it's about as heavy as a bad papercut.Plot: Puss in Boots, after dying for the eighth time, has an encounter with Death in wolf form (first villain) in a bar. When he loses a fight against Death, he feels ashamed about not living up to his legend and goes to live in a cat lady's house. Here, he meets Perrito, a silly therapy dog. Goldilocks (Goldi) and the Three Bears, a crime family, raid the house looking for him and this is when we are introduced to them as one of three villains. Puss, right after, hears of a Wishing Star that grants one wish and he intends to use the wish to get his 8 lives back. The map for the Wishing Star is held by Jack Horner (the third villain) and Puss goes to steal it. He meets Kitty Softpaws here. After escaping, we enter the expedition phase where the three villains (Death, GAT3B, Jack Horner) and three protagonists (Puss, Kitty, Perrito) venture to obtain the wish. Throughout this phase we watch Puss struggle with his sense of mortality while being haunted by Death, Kitty struggle with trust issues, Perrito functions as comedic relief and a bonder for P + K. Death pursues Puss, Goldi has conflicts with her feelings of belonging as her family is three bears, and Jack Horner functions as the classic all-bad evil antagonist.Now, past that, this is a WONDERFUL film. The animation is strong, unique and absolutely pops. On top of the vibrant, hand-painted, 2D backdrops you get to see the equally vibrant computer-generated foreground elements. In slower paced scenes, the movement is more traditionally made and smooth as you would expect which is fantastically contrasted by the style it takes on in faster-paced action scenes. In fights or other exciting sequences, it takes on a stop-motion appearance like that of the Spiderverse movies. This is a great tool the filmmakers used, and adds more mindless \"wow! Boom boom pow punch wham!\" excitement to the film when it is meant to while also communicating that you should be listening and thinking instead of indulging in action candy.As for the themes of the story, it tackles multiple tactfully and wonderfully. Puss becomes anxious, suffering a panic attack (displayed better than some actual adult media) while having to come to terms with mortality. He also conflicts with Kitty because he abandoned her during their wedding which goes into her trust issues. Kitty wants the star to have somebody to trust. Perrito functions as a contrasting character to these gloomy characters with pessimistic views on their lives. Goldilocks struggles with being human in a family of bears, which is also handled beautifully and realistically. Death and Jack Horner are fairly one dimensional and archetypal in comparison (scary bad guy and evil bad guy) but they're still very enjoyable and well-made characters.My only complaints is that the story takes slightly too long to lift off (not enough to become very bored, the phase is still enjoyable but somewhat dragged out) and the Goldi plot is not as polished it could have been. Its purpose is kind of ambiguous when it's introduced but becomes really good. These bad aspects aren't quite detrimental and don't bring the movie down to an unenjoyable rating but if you look closely they are definitely present flaws that rob the movie of perfection.A lot of the negative reviews are people who aren't thoughtful, or didn't get what they expected. Most are parents not fond of it's somewhat more mature elements since they were wanting a classic children's movie while the others are some who just didn't grasp the themes. Some critiques I've seen are of the animation being \"choppy\" and \"bad\" which refers to the aforementioned stop motion style which is only a well-executed stylistic choice. It's not low-quality, a low-budget artifact or anything like that.I've dragged on enough though! WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you have small children, watch it on your lonesome! If you read all of this, you know what to expect so it won't drag your experience down. Enjoy!", "Cat in Boots must-to see!!!": "I'm not a fan of such films. However this one made me change my opinion.There are a lot of hilarious jokes, which kept me laughing while watching it.This film is supposed to be for kids but the themes seem to be mature and kept adults engaged.The animation is incredible! With over 620 artists working on the film, this is without a doubt, some of the best 3D work we've seen. The characters, not only the main, are so sincere and kind-hearted that made me love all of them.The film is full of actions that I haven't follow the time! The story moves at a steady, fast pace.PUSS IN BOOTS gives new meaning to \"cat dancing\".", "Surprisingly Good": "I had low expectations walking into the theater. I haven't seen any of the Shrek movies, and I had seen the original Puss in Boots movie a long time ago and had mostly forgotten the plot.I was telling my girlfriend before we went in, \"All I remember is that Humpty-Dumpty's evil, something about a golden goose, and that Puss has a really fun voice to listen to. Oh, and there's some female cat as well.\"\nThat was all that either of us remembered (besides his theme song) when we went into the theater.So man did it blow us away!The movie was actually good.Not for a kid's movie. Not for a Dreamworks movie. A legitimately good film.They talked intelligently about mortality, heroes, commitment, and responsibility, made brilliant satire of current movie tropes, and threw in a good dash of humor and a feel-good attitude.The villain was epically portrayed, and the characters were well done.I was so certain that the little dog character would be the death of me, but when I watched the movie I learned that he was actually funny and useful to the plot.The lore was well built, and the characters and themes well-developed.And I can't stress enough how they handled the theme of mortality. It blew me away.I very much recommend this movie.As we got back to the car I told her, \"But it wasn't just us having fun, either. Every little kid in that theater had a good time as well. When you can leave the kids laughing and the adults pondering death, you know you have succeeded as an artist.\"", "Nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc": "I suggest you to watch this animation\nIt will change your life style.And ithink this must be the the top of the animatinon in 2022.I hope the shrek 5 will be that much better\nThis animation deserves the Oscar prize...Enjoy. This animation you can also wath this with your family because all you know animations can teach to everyone a lesson for life\nAnd about the wolf death its a character that i dreamed i think it needs a movie\nIt teachs us that we dont have time to live and we all have one life and desreve that because we can do a lot of things or works that could be enough\nIm waiting for the shrek 5.", "Simply a great movie": "(No spoilers) Super interesting, amazing visuals and moments of dark humor despite being mostly family friendly. This movie really exceeded my expectations! This movie doesn't have a single boring part and it's really funny. A must watch for animated movie enjoyers! So many fantastic fairytale references, all the characters are great and the ending teaches us a valuable lesson. The main antagonist is genuinely scary and thrilling and keeps you on your toes at all times waiting for him to appear. This is a movie I'm definitely gonna return to time and time again and I will enjoy it more and more everytime. 10/10 great job DreamWorks!", "My Favorite Fearless Hero": "This movie was top tier material from dreamworks as per usual with these kinds of movies.Puss is the nostalgia we needed by a long shot especially after all of the bad entertainment we've received in the past few years prior.This movie makes the first one honestly look kind of off; which is shocking considering that the first one is also a 9/10 star movie.We absolutely needed something like this to bust into theaters and onto streaming services with a shocking wave of quality over quantity.These characters make me relate to what they are saying in the script even as animations, which I find super difficult to accomplish in the first place."}
