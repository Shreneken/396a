            "content": "There are very few movies that make you wait for their day of release just like a torn lover waits for its lost love for that one last glance and Dev.D was certainly one of them. I just knew I had to watch it the moment I saw breathtaking visuals(The snorricam shots inspired from classics like Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting) in the trailer itself. The fact that the movie was directed by Mr. Maverick (of new age Indian cinema) got me even more excited. So now when I have seen the movie I am ecstatic because I got more than what I expected. This movie is all about your sense of perception of art. If you find charm in innovative screenplay, extraordinary photography, symbolic scenes and realistic acting you got to love this cinematic masterpiece and if you have a thing for colors, its an icing on the cake! But if you want to see an entertainer which is going to generate temporary emotions, unfortunately, its not for you. All those who find the story unrealistic must understand it is not the portrayal of what happens in love but the most beautiful depiction of what is going through one's mind when one gets/doesn't get love. So, either you will crave for the movie to go on till forever or wait for it to end. Of course, the story line is based on the original Devdas but this contemporary version has its own twists and turns and you better not expect the expected. Abhay Deol is absolutely fantastic.There is not a single scene where one can doubt the authenticity of the character he is playing. Both the new actresses are equally good. Mahie Gill deserves all the applause for doing many a tough scenes with calming ease and expression that can light a fire. Kalki's eyes never lose the innocence in the truest sense thanks to the beautiful portrayal even though her character transcends into one of the highest zones of maturity. I just fell in love with the movie and wanted to see more of the unpredictable series of events through extraordinary musical narration.The only thing which I missed in Dev.D was a bit of soul but that is exactly how it was meant to be.",

            "content": "Dev.D, Anurag Kashyap's contemporary take on Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's classic novel Devdas is simply extraordinary. Kashyap's direction is excellent and his interpretation of the original story is a perfect example of how creative and artistic an adaptation of this sort can be. The film is set partly in Punjab and partly in Delhi and captures the atmosphere of both places with precision. Kashyap masterfully portrays the effervescence, colourfulness and rusticity of the rural Punjab areas from one side, and then explores the morbid and dark reality of the urban Delhi. The film is very realistic and aspects which contribute to this include the simple writing, the slick editing and cinematography and the natural acting. It deals with such themes as sexuality, love, drugs, prostitution, self-destruction, and complex relationships. The film's fast-paced narrative style, which includes authentic dialogues, serious proceedings and many many songs (all of which are lovely, modern, and appropriately selected), is very unique and matter-of-fact. Abhay Deol stars as a modern-day Devdas, and he does an excellent job. He shows Dev's confusion, complacence, gradual ruin, and later his self-acceptance and coming to terms, with conviction and depth. Kashyap introduces two young girls in the leading roles. Mahie Gill is the first, and she is first-rate in her debut performance as Paro - very believable and impulsive. Kalki Koechlin is less impressive at first, but grows on you as the story goes by. At some points in the initial portions it looks like she's struggling with her lines, but in the second half, she confidently turns into a charming young lady and ultimately leaves a mark. The film's ending is fantastic and unexpected. To sum it up, Dev.D is Kashyap's gem. It is a prime quintessence of Hindi cinema's capability and coming-of-age. I recommend you to watch it.",

            "content": "Ever thought of going to a 'remake' Hindi movie and getting apprehensive whether it will turn out to be better or as good as the previous, in this case, Devdas? well, here it is. And its not a remake, its much better. The most striking feature of this movie is the part played by Abhay Deol,(guy s got talent) which is simply very subtle and practical. No overacting (unlike any other Hindi hero), no songs around mountains and valleys, no getting emotional over your love (yes, believe me). Just chronological events that takes place with three characters around. Thats it. With a gist of recent events which include the DPS girl blow-job MMS, and the famous Drink n drive BMW mauling case in New Delhi, Anurag Kashyap has proved its possible to relate recent events in Indian cinema, which it lacks today. Never once in the movie you need a toilet break even if u need to pee really bad. Even the boldness in using the words like f*** (which i guess is the first time in commercial Hindi movie)is so well mixed, it never strikes out of the ordinary or routine. Must appreciate- Screenplay, direction, Abahay Deol. Music sucks mostly,( not a very good experiment) except a few times. Overall a very good experience, will be the most appreciated movie of 2009, unless anything else comes up.",

            "content": "Well I had been waiting for over two months for this film to release. And It has been worth the wait. Anurag Kashyap's Dev.D is a contemporary take on the immortal Devdas, whose boldness will dazzle you, to say the least. The direction and screenplay, as expected, are top-notch. The music is terrific, and has been used creatively to take the story forward. The performances are excellent too, with Abhay Deol delivering a brave, powerful performance that won't be easy to forget. Mahie Gill and Kalki are very impressive too. Watch this movie also for some gems- Paro going in the fields to get laid with Dev with mattresses tied to her bicycle and Chanda and Dev in the sauna-there are many more I promise. AK has successfully ironed out the flaws in the original Devdas, and that's what makes this dark film also a feel-good film at times. AK has handled sexuality and some real-life incidents (MMS scandal, BMW hit- and-run case) in a very mature manner, without being sensationalist. Don't miss it for anything. Watch it for its sheer audacity.\"I give a 10/10 and two thumbs up for AK's newest piece of art.\"",

            "content": "The movie is a great depiction of modern world or modern love. The movie is absolutely mind blowing. Abhay Deol delivers his best performance till date and he is definitely in main league of actors now. If there is anyone after Aamir khan who we should credited for his choice of movies, its none other than Abhay Deol. I can blindly spent to watch any of his movies without reading any reviews.Coming back to movie apart from the modern remake of Devdas it explores the modern sexuality. It depicts what is going around and the way youngsters explores their sexual needs. This movie isn't for old age people and they will rate it 1 out of 10 as they wouldn't be able to digest the realism shown in the movie. First part of the movie is very charming and indulging. Though its not a comedy but you laugh every minute because of the hard hitting sexual dialogs and realistic talks. Direction is superb and actors did more than justice to their role. Second half is not as enjoyable as compared to 1st half but still its very enjoyable.This movie may turn out to be a flop in actual as its not a family movie, but i think this is more than commercial. Those who understand cinema needs to applaud it all the way. First time in my life i felt that i actually paid less to watch a movie.",

            "content": "This movie is 'not' a remake of Devdas. Probably, Anurag Kashyap wanted to borrow the base story from there, but I repeat if you are a big fan of Devdas then this movie isn't for you. But then again this is one of the most insane movies to come out of Bollywood. You might probably end up with a headache after watching it, but its completely worth it. There are few movies with such exceptional cinematography and music which blends completely with the movie.The characters are well defined, but also over the top. Abhay puts in a real perfect act of a self-sympathetic fool, who drinks and does drugs just in the obsession of Paro. He becomes completely lost and finally ends up in the arms of Chanda. Paro has apparently never known the words 'shy' nor 'blush'. Chanda has seen a lot of pain and is the only character who slowly becomes sure of herself.This movie is more about how they have painted the characters rather than the characters themselves. This is a first in Bollywood and I have never heard such dark, yet at times beautiful music. Its loud at times, but Amit Trivedi's work is a sheer genius one. If you do end up liking the movie, you would give half the credit to the music.Anurag and the entire team have poured in their heart for this movie. Most of the work and the ideas are genuine and is not picked up from some other random movie. It is an 'its own movie'.",

From that moment, I knew this movie is gonna be one of a kind. It takes place in the modern era. The instances shown in the movie are very life-like. The story deals with a loser ( Abhay Deol ) and how he deals with his life. Its like a modern rip-off from Devdas.Everything about this movie is top notch. Right from the direction to the sets, its stunning. The screenplay is impeccable & the cinematography couldn't get better. The visuals are delightful. The music score is exceptional. Even though it is a slow movie, the pace seems very fast. The editing also is so well done. The dialogues are perfect, used in a really vulgar tone. The story is set in & around Delhi. The locations shown are ideal.I really don't remember the last time I had seen such a good bollywood movie. But this flick is not one that will please all audiences. Only connoisseurs of movies will respect & admire this class act. Hats off to Anurag Kashyap. Legend.",

The beauty of narrative is that it doesn't speak in dialogs but rather gratifies on the senses of the viewer . The editing is brisk and is noteworthy of its nuances to help add the necessary twists in the plot.Fresh music with loads of it helps to contemplate the emotions of the protagonist.It isn't banal or prudish ..the dialogs are witty and minimalist !For those who have watched the archaic DevDas , it's overwhelming to match \"loosely based original characters \" to our new era real life DevD( trying to empower his childhood love or trying to understand what love really is ), Paro ( Very Indian but yet liberating and sexually charged and also at par with the ultimate Indian \"aadarsh\" Bahu agnostics ) , Chandramukhi ( A thumbs up to the Sex industry which preaches what the whole world tries to echo in darkness and unlike the world which then raises fingers of indignation and loathe - CMon India did preach Kamasutra long back )not to forget Chunni( an amiable friend but a pimp of the sorts ).The ensemble has done a worthy job . Newcomer : Mahie Gill easily transitions from a vulnerable lover girl to a mature responsible lady , Kalki Koechlin epitomizes the naiveness of a teenage girl whose social stigmata con-volutes her essence of life into an awry ordeal which she readily accepts and moralizes as a state of \"Trying to move on ..\" And Abhay ( I read him being at someplace learning Wood Carving during the release of this movie ) - ( is purely a treat to watch ..the way he triumphs in being a sole loser who worships Vodka and doesn't chastise himself rather acclimatizes himself to the corner of the world called \"SELF\" -- the virility shown by his hairy bod -- a pungent antonym to chest waxed embellishments -- 10 kg's lost for this role -- shows the kind of efforts put on screen )All of this with a maverick Director's surreal vision ( trademarks being his liking for water and snow .. he uses them as props and landscaper's to unearth the beauty of the far .. No Smoking had loads of it) is a cinematic milestone in itself ...If your above 18 then go with a heart of redemption, lust , despair striving to the ultimate nemesis with oneself --- you shall be a winner !!!",

            "content": "The depiction of a modern day Devdas could not have been done any better then what Anurag Kashyap managed in Dev D through Abhay Deol. The deciphering of the movie in totality, cant really be ascertained in a single viewing. Subtle nuances keep coming up with every viewing, that is very unlike any regular Hindi potboiler but very much like the work of Martin Scorsesse, Coppola and Stanley Kubrick, the directors who have influenced Kashyap a great deal. Few are able to disencumber the wannabe tag of wanting to create something like the illustrious directors, but Anurag crosses this great divide with Dev D. He is truly the best voice in Indian cinema today because he makes a movie for himself first and foremost, (like the other great directors mentioned) and makes it with all his heart and soul. The result of his dedication can be seen in Dev D which is a flawless flick with bluntness that will raise eyebrows in the western world, what to talk of Indian sensibility? Everything is just that perfect in Dev D.Cinematography is delightful & vividly colorful. Delhi has never looked better, looks even better then in Mouna Ragam of Mani Ratnam. Abhay Deol pulls off a remarkable character with consummate ease. The depth and the recklessness and the pain and the disarming smile is very reminiscent of the great performance of Robert De Niro in Raging Bull. Is there is any better young method actor in India, then Abhay Deol? Plain simple, No! In a career spanning just a few films he has shown a repertoire that few actors don't achieve in a lifetime. Kudos, Abhay. Mahi Gill is very competent as a village belle and Kalki Koechlin-just superb. Drugs long seen a taboo in the Indian society, though it remains a rampant problem is dealt with great finesse and audacity in Dev D. People may point this as patronizing drugs but that is not it. He wants to talk about an important social issue and he pulls it off with aplomb. It gives a feeling of hate drugs very reminiscent of Trainspotting, and that is not patronizing but presenting a very important social problem with a difference. The remaining cast is solid and helps in the overall movie compactness. Music by Amit Trivedi is very different from the repetitive bollywood music that we keep churning out. It is fresh and strikingly different from anything that we have heard in Hindi cinema. That this movie is a hit should bolster Anurag's confidence. India, is finally ready for his kind of Cinema as he keeps on saying.",

            "review_title": "The movie that earned Kashyap fame!",
            "content": "Dev D is a modern-day interpretation of the classic novel \"Devdas\" by Sarat Chandra. Dev (Abhay Deol), Paro (Mahi Gill) and Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) of Dev D reflect the sensibilities, conflicts aggression, and independence. Free thought, exuberance and recklessness of the youth of today. A generation that is jammed between eastern roots and western sensibilities. Dev D is set in the rustic and colorful Punjab and also explores the dingy, morbid, dark underbelly of Delhi. From sprawling mustard fields to a riot of neon. Now we have come through various versions of the novel \"Devdas\", but \"Dev. D\" is way different than all the others. It's not actually the remake of Devdas, yet it can be said as it has been just inspired by it. There are minor similarities yet the characters are similar in a way. The new Devdas likes to have his vodka with Coke, asks Paro for some nude pictures of herself, chats with Paro through IM, likes to have sex, smokes even during pissing after waking up in the morning & does other various stuffs according to the current trend of Indian Youth. There are so many reasons why \"Dev. D\" strikes hard on it's viewers. It's a coming of an age cinema of Bollywood. Bollywood never did witnessed any stuff like Dev. D ever before. The soul of the movie lies within it's characters, specially \"Dev.D\" along with Paro, Chanda & Chunni. The movie also depicts Delhi in a superior way. Anurag Kashyap always trying to do something new & creative with each of his movies. First it was Black Friday, which portrayed some stunning reality behind the blasts in Mumbai in the year 1993, which also made it highly controversial & then it was \"No Smoking\", which was an attempt of a cult movie, though it failed to express the real message behind the movie. Anurag Kashyap this time does it in a Tarantino style. A love story in a Tarantino way. Now that's something really innovative! He gives an extra-ordinary direction, with keeping in mind to entertain the viewers. The humor of the movie with it's witty one liners keeps the viewers hooked during the first half. Though the second half looses it's momentum a bit, the movie still strikes in a powerful way. Now if we talk about the performances, Abhay Deol is one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Not only he performs well, but what he did in this movie is called \"Class Act\". Top class act by Abhay. Also the performances by the two of the new-comers is refreshing & amazing. Adding to all the factors above is the music or the score of the movie. That's something different yet again for Bollywood. The track \"Emotional Atyachar\" is already famous. But the best tracks of the movie are \"Ek Hulchul Si\" & \"Emotional Atyachar (Rock Version)\". It would simply blow the mind of the lovers of rock music. Excellent songs & score by Amit Trivedi. The unusual cinematography of the movie gives the movie a different look, yet a dark look. Dev.D is a fantastic movie to be made in Bollywood history. A never before experienced love story with sex, drugs, drinks & lot many stuffs. A classic love story with fantastic performance by Abhay Deol.",

In particular, Abhay Deol and Kalki Koechlin proved their acting chops in playing complex characters which definitely deserves some recognition. The cinematography is magnificent and the film is a visual treat. However the main reason for the brilliance of this film is its well-written screenplay. Anurag Kashyap has never shied away from doing things differently and with this movie he has proved that he is the best director in Bollywood.

Dev D is not a film but a reflection of Indian youth as it is in the new century. If there was something called a psychedelic film this would definitely be the one. The soundtrack itself through out the film creates a unparalleled atmosphere. Blended superbly is the story and the characters. I am not a movie critic but I have seen IMDb top 250 and exhaustively Korean, french , Italian and Brazilian movies. This movie stand apart from the rest. There will never be another Dev D like there will never be another Avatar or Schindler's list. The only reason this film did not get worldwide recognition it deserves because it is an Indian film maybe and there should be more exposure of Indian films.If you are not from India, and you are reading this review, watch this film once. Please make a point of watching it with headphones on or good loudspeakers. Watch it at a time, when you are most relaxed and trust me, you will never forget this film. I can personally guarantee that any Indian worth his taste in films, have not watched this movie less than a couple of times.Enjoy the film. I don't write much review, but I like sharing the happiness i get from watching great films. More so, if i can share it with someone not from my country. Dev D is a reflection of India of the 21st century. A India you may have not seen or thought off. This will change your perception of the country to a large extent and will definitely be one of your favorite movies of all time. Blurays are available with subtitles. But trust me, except for some dialogues, the film will reach you beyond the barriers of language.If you are in your 20s, or early 30s, and if you have not watched Dev D , you cannot say you have watched world cinema.I think Schindler's list should be IMDb's no. 1 film and i think Dev D definitely would deserve a place in that list's top 15 if it was watched by the world at large. So watch the film, you will love it, share it with your friends. After-all that's what watching movies is all about. Enjoy with a drink or whatever makes you feel good. :) Adios..",

            "content": "This is not your old-fashioned Bollywood film, with colored saris unfurled in green fields with dancing waves of wheat while romance blooms back at home in spite of interference from the older generation: when those musicals are good they are very good indeed.Instead, this is a gritty modern take on misunderstood romance, on living an attitude rather than a reasoned existence. The story is brilliantly filmed in many ways, with lots of electric neon color, the stunning visuals backed by a modern beat, a trio of moon dancers tossed in at one point for ironic counterpoint. I thought the young actress Kalki Koechlin was sensationally effective as a young woman on the run from her past, but the lead, Abhay Deol, although magnetic, can only carry moody angst so far, and after almost two hours of sulky, unshaven drugged-out, drunken staggering, Id had enough--how many times do I really want Abhay to get drunk or stoned or beat up?. It is fascinating to see the Bollywood product evolving in modern ways, but although sincerity was evident from this film, it went on about an hour too long: someone get the scissors!",

            "review_title": "Post-modern take on the eternal loser lover of Indian cinema",
            "content": "I am not very familiar with Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's 'Devdas'. I know that it was about a rich bugger from Bengal who drank himself to death over a girl he loved. I also know that there have been several filmed versions of the novella though I'd failed to catch any of them, save a couple of scenes from Sanjay Leela Bhansali's version starring SRK. Anurag Kashyap's reputation for art-house genius aside, it was the standout publicity hoardings, wreaking of seduction and psychedelia that pulled me in -- first day, first show. Picture's up and I am greeted with the playful camaraderie between two kids, with the little boy Dev biting little Paro's hand, followed by a scene in which the same brat argues with his father as to why he cannot address him by his pet name -- Sattu. One resounding slap later and Dev is packed off to London, where he magically evolves into a horny, pot-smoking, i-pod-toting cad (Abhay Deol). The little girl whose arm he had nibbled on earlier has now grown into a gorgeous young Paro (or Parminder, played by Mahi Gill). The childhood fondness has evolved with puberty into a teasing romance bathed in sexual innuendo. And when Paro consents to sending Dev a snapshot of herself naked, he promptly decides to head homeward (Kashyap's naughty lines are priceless in this scene). However, destiny intervenes by way of a gross misunderstanding, shattering the 'happily-ever-after' and giving us a story. In the ensuing misunderstanding, Dev shuns Paro, leading to her taking the rather severe step of getting married to a rich widower. Fraught with guilt, Dev begins to sink to the depths of alcoholic depression, as the frustrated loser begins to take shape. After one particularly violent bout with the bottle, Dev passes out and wakes up to find himself in the squalid interiors of a hotel in Delhi's neon-lit Pahar Ganj area. The third vital character in the plot, Chanda / Chandramukhi (played by Indo- French actress Kalki Koelchin) is introduced here. A former victim of a horrible MMS scandal, she now wears the persona of an in-demand, college-going prostitute who, when she is not bringing men to orgasms over the phone in Tamil, dresses up in a variety of imaginative outfits (ironically, one of them happens to be that of an 'all-American school girl') and engages in kinky role play with mama's boys. Through a delightfully slimy pimp Chunni (a fine performance by Dibyendu Bhattacharya), Dev is introduced to Chanda. In Chanda, Dev finds an outlet for his love for Paro, a comforting listener. Just as things begin to warm, Kashyap's tale veers off in a different direction from the original and... I shan't tell you more. Technically, Kashyap's 'Dev D.' is a visually delectable film against the psychedelic backdrop of sex, drugs and some Desi wedding band fare. Cinematographer Rajeev Ravi does a fine job of capturing the grittiness of Pahargunj \u0096 whether it be the grimy squalor of Dev's hotel or Chanda's lair drenched in shocking pink. The play with film speeds works particularly well in the heady drinking scenes as do the 'Requiem for a Dream'-like floating shots of a well-hammered Dev wandering back to his room in a chemical daze. Amit Trivedi's music (a bulky, multi-genre score that moves from folk to jazz to hard rock) is a solid character in itself, as it meanders through scenes, hitting the spot every time.The screaming reception his 'Emosanal Atyachar' got in the cinema hall,is testament that brassy wedding band fare can indeed be made to sound hip. The acting department is damn tight. Mahi Gill's Paro is a thrill to watch \u0096 a character perfectly aware of her sexuality and surprisingly expressive for her small-town background. Although Kalki Koelchin may run into rough patches with the accent and diction, her emotional scenes make up for it, especially in the film's second-half, as the relationship between her and Dev begins to evolve. Dibyendu Bhattacharya almost steals the show as Chunni (Kashyap's re-incarnation of the original Chunnilal) but in the end, it is Abhay Deol who takes the cake, champagne and the butter chicken home, playing the coke-snorting loser lover, with measured confidence and understated cool. The gentleman's acting chops are firmly in place and I am not surprised as to why everyone is raving about him. It would be good to see more of Mahi Gill, Kalki Koelchin and Dibyendu in the future.So where lie the pitfalls then? For one, the film's length (a heady three hours) is overwhelming and Kashyap might have just managed to overcome this, had it not been for its extended trajectory that runs into an abrupt wall. Some might even argue that Trivedi's score drenches almost all the scenes in the film. But the pros far outweigh the cons here. For the most past, the film's characters are unabashedly honest and real. Kashyap's script-writing chops give us gems like the 'haldi' scene, the 'ticket' scene where Dev gets reprimanded by an old female co-passenger on the bus, after a particularly nasty alcoholic binge as well as Paro's delightfully ingenious solution to finding a venue for her and Dev to consummate their relationship (and the aftermath). Those of you familiar with the medical sitcom 'Scrubs', will take great pleasure in Kashyap's use of the aforementioned dancing boy trio for moments of random delight. ' Dev D.' is an important film to consume as we sit on the cusp of a more progressive Indian cinema \u0096 a sign of good things to come. You may not exactly fall in lust, as the film urges one to, but you will certainly want to discuss it, perhaps even fight over it.",

            "content": "The novel 'Devdas' written by Saratchandra Chatterjee has forever fascinated Indian film-makers. The story has all the ingredients which a film-maker can utilize to create a magnum opus. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, Dev.D is a tweaked version of this legendary novel.Bimal Roy's Devdas and Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas were the same in terms of the story but differed greatly in treatment. The story was seen and depicted differently by the two directors. Anurag Kashyap, who belongs to the bright new young brigade in Bollywood, a gang which is willing to experiment and truly do different stuff, gives Devdas a smashingly cool urban treatment.The story has the structural frame of the old Devdas, but the building blocks are different. Devdas is Dev, a rich spoilt brat, a highly complex character, a nymphomaniac who asks his childhood love to send her nude pictures via web cam! Paro is a Jattini, not quite the gentle Paro we know from the previous two versions. This Paro is a real toughie. She is passionate, carries a mattress to the dense farms so that she can make love to her sweetheart Dev and runs around with sticks in her hand beating the crap out of guy trying to assassinate her character! Chandramukhi is 'Chanda', a young girl who becomes a prostitute after her own parents give up on her when she is caught in the web of an infamous MMS scandal.The tweaked storyline might sound cheesy for many people but Dev.D does successfully and charmingly retain the major ingredients of the original story - of romance, jealousy, egotism, unrequited love, anguish, addiction and tragedy. The film is anything but melodramatic. The story is real in the truest sense of the word and what happens in the protagonists life could very well have happened to someone you know. Even if that is not the case, one has surely heard of true tales of men completely losing it and going down the drains after a heartburn.The real highlight of Dev.D after the adapted storyline is the brilliance with which it has been shot. Right from the farms of Punjab to the dark creepy lanes of Paharganj in Delhi, Dev.D is a remarkable achievement in Cinematography! In fact, the film captures Delhi in a manner which no film so far has been able to. It is also superb on visuals and art direction. For instance, instead of the clich\u00e9d coughing-up-blood-on hand we have the sloshed Dev immersing his face in water and exhaling red bubbles of blood. Yes, that is creative film-making for you! What further supplements the screenplay is an insanely addictive soundtrack incorporated superbly into the storyline.Dilip Kumar did it in the 1955, Shahrukh Khan did it 2002 and now Abhay Deol has done it by playing Dev.D in 2009. Abhay Deol's character is a highly complex character with many grey shades and it's not a role which you would think is suited to his good-guy-next-door image but he excels and prove his mettle once again. Here is one actor in the Industry who has consistently experimented and delivered the goods over a period of time, be it Socha Na THa, Ek Chaalis, Aahista Aahista or Oye Lucky. Abhay Deol just keeps raising the bar with every film.The two newcomers who are the female leads are well cast in their respective roles. The beautiful and mesmerizing actress playing Paro is quite a show stealer. It's a performance which comes across as very natural. The other actress playing Chanda after the initial hiccups, settles into the role and ends up leaving a mark.Dev.D is not by any means an absolutely flawless movie. It has its share of glitches. The major one being the lack of emotional connect with any of the characters, particularly with the character of Dev. But then I don't think it was the intention of the film makers to establish that connect in the first place.Like Luck By Chance which released last week, Dev.D is again a movie which caters to a niche audience but shows the way forward for Hindi Cinema.",

Though No Smoking did not do well at box office, I still consider it to be one of the most underrated bollywood movie. But Dev.D is a step ahead of No Smoking. Its the age old Devdas meets No Smoking meets Trainspotting. Dev, played by Abhay, is a spoiled brat without a motive in life. And our Paro is not helpless this time around; she is headstrong and ready to kick asses. Even Chanda is not as cheeky as she was. She is slutty and confident. The trio makes up for contemporary youngsters of Indian metros, who have little emotions and no values. And there is so much intoxication that it reminds you of 'trainspotting' and 'fear and loathing in Vegas'.But the greatness of movie is not in the story. In fact, after sometime, you don't even care about the story. This movie is about great direction and amazing music (Amit Trivedi). After watching the movie, it is impossible to imagine it without the music. It so much a part of the movie that probably Dev.D has more background songs than dialogs. Dev.D is highly unconventional, radical and futuristic (the dialogs, camera work and editing) from Indian standards. A very brave movie indeed.",

It is brash, explicit, and shows Indian youth in a way not often portrayed in Indian cinema (rude, obnoxious, disrespectful). But that doesn't make this a good film. Just different.The acting is passable. I don't think that anyone is grossly miscast, but at the same time, there is very little call for real acting in this film. The biggest problem lies in the script, which never creates any emotional connection between the characters. The only character we develop any sympathy for at all is Chanda. Frankly, making the film from Chanda's point of view, and discarding the ties to the Devdas story, might have been a better direction to go with this.Technically, it is decent work. The use of the Snorricam is unique in Bollywood, but it doesn't break any new ground. Same with the underwater shots. The lighting is excellent, but the direction and cinematography aren't memorable. Most of the songs are forgettable, although one theme is used very well. The songs are not well-integrated, often rendering them an annoying distraction.Overall, this can only be rated an above-average film, at best. I don't think I'd watch it more than twice.",

            "content": "Not every film is required to entertain its audience, but every film must engage its viewers. Now that's a tall order when the film in question centers around the most boring, uni-dimensional character Indian literature could have possibly produced \u2013 the alcoholic, self-destructive romantic, Devdas. Add to that the fact that at least three Hindi films have already transported Devdas' tragic story to the screen. Still, director Anurag Kashyap's Dev D, is a fresh, original take on the subject and the characters, but it's also a long and tiresome film that is not for the fainthearted. Rooted in the real and the contemporary, Kashyap's film stars Abhay Deol as Dev, an aimless Benjamin Braddock-like drifter who returns home to Punjab after a graduation abroad, but has little in terms of future plans, except for getting into the sack with his childhood friend Paro, with whom he's spent many a long night talking dirty on the phone. On learning that she might have had a promiscuous past, Dev rejects Paro and her advances, driving her to marry a man she doesn't love, and landing himself in a downward spiral of booze and drugs and whores. Kashyap takes the basic structure of Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's original story, but in setting it in the now, updates much of the film's narrative, and makes the characters' actions and motivations more relatable. So you get a back-story to the Chanda character, the hooker Dev hooks up with in his desperate, despondent phase; and sex itself becomes the invisible but omnipresent motivation that drives many an important plot-point. In it's first forty odd minutes Dev D sucks you into its drama, shocking you with its brazenness, and more specifically with Kashyap's audacious re-imagination of the plot and its characters.Take that scene in which Paro (played by newcomer Mahie Gill) sends for Dev to join her in a dense field so they can get down to doing what they've been unsuccessfully trying to do for some days. Watch the manner in which she virtually attacks a reluctant Dev into submission; and then the following scene in which she heads back home, mattress folded and tied on her cycle, after Dev spurns her overtures. Watch also the fantastic song Yeh meri zindagi hai and the inventive manner in which Kashyap uses it to introduce Lenny (played by newcomer Kalki Koechlin), the character who goes on to become Chanda. But from the moment Dev's descent into despair begins, the audience too plunges into what seems like a never-ending roller-coaster ride of loud clanging music, neon lights and head-spinning camera moves. Using music instead of dialogue is a unique and interesting narrative tool, but song-after-song-after-song-after-song your patience wears thin. The film's second half is indulgent and repetitive to the point of being excessive, as it focuses much of its attention on Chanda; and let down by a disappointing performance and stilted dialogue delivery by Koechlin, it never really regains the momentum or the sheer bravura of its early parts. In comparison to Koechlin, Mahie Gill makes a more assured debut as Paro, investing both vulnerability and a cocksure attitude into her character. But it's Abhay Deol who's the real scene-stealer, holding together the film with a fearless performance that is so rare to find. Despite the clever new approach and its stylish telling, the flaw that hurts the film ultimately, is the fact that Devdas is never an engaging enough character and his story lacks soul. Speaking purely for myself, I was bored watching him repeatedly drown himself in drink and drugs. Self destruction is never an attractive quality.It's one of those films that's likely to either dazzle you or drain you. There is no middle option. Watch it, and decide for yourself.",

            "content": "The first thing I had heard from here and there about 'Dev.D' was that it was a 'modern take' on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's famous novella 'Devdaas'. It was only after seeing it that I realized as to how it was much more than that. 'Devdaas' is a script that has been visited twice in B-Town's history. Once by the legendary sobbing superstar Dileep Kumar sa'ab and the second time by the stammering success story Shah Rukh Khan. I have seen both of them and found that both of them stuck to the basic premise. Arrogant rich boy Dev finds his fancies in childhood sweetheart Paro. Being of different economic backgrounds there is serious resistance to this blossoming romance and so Paro is married off to someone else while Dev drinks himself to death while finding comfort in nautch girl Chandramukhi's court. Dev eventually dies a heart broken lover without the shadow of Paro's love. As much as I had expected 'Dev.D' to be similar to this plot what I ended up seeing was superlatively refreshing to say the least.From what I could fathom the only similarities between the third version of the novel and the former two were the names of the main characters. Apart from that everything else has been blown to smithereens in Kashyap's take. In 'Dev.D', Devdaas goes from being a character in a novel to a metaphor of any cocky young man. Our Dev isn't afraid to ask his Paro if she touches herself. He isn't scared to ask her if she could send him a topless photograph of herself via the Internet and he doesn't flinch calling his father by his first name. And Paro? Well she is not the timid and submissive damsel as seen in the previous versions either. This one actually ties a mattress to her cycle and heads to the farms for a session of mad monkey lovemaking with her Dev. She photographs herself topless, gets the film developed, scans the photograph and emails it to Dev in London. She isn't afraid to grab his arms and smother him with kisses at the first opportunity. The list of such brazenly relevant modifications to Chattopadhyay's original work goes on. The Dev in this feature is not so much 'in love' with his Paro as much as he is obsessed by the idea of loving her. He yearns for sex \u2013 plain and simple. No expensive duets to be designed for this emotion to come through. No colorful dancers gyrating in unison in the middle of a mustard seed field. No sir. It is this direct, no frills approach to human attraction that I found the most refreshing.He is a clueless loser who is a victim of his own self. Period. What is more? The 'friendly' Chunnilal in the original is a cheap pimp in this one who ends up being a close liaison with Dev in his visits to Chanda's brothel.One can easily argue that Dev.D is nothing more than garish sleaze dished out in a format that is similar to the original Devdaas but I would have to respectfully disagree. It takes a bold film maker to get his female protagonist to say she has to use the potty when the male protagonist wants to undress her during a bout of 'pity sex'. A feat, I am sure, no 'established actress' can mouth even if her life depended on it. It is in things like this that the movie goes from being a B-class dish out to an A-class path breaker. If not anything, what Kashyap has managed to do is show Bollywood his middle finger when it comes to documenting romance. I can safely say no one will ever dare to make another remake of 'Devdaas' after watching 'Dev.D' since it's a benchmark too high to surpass.Performances belong primarily to Abhay. This young man is making excellent decisions in his role selections and is quickly becoming a metaphor for 'hatke' cinema genre. I liked him in 'Ek Chalis Ki Last Local', 'Manorama Six Feet Under', 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye' and now 'Dev.D'. A very strong performer with a wonderful future ahead of him. Mahie Gill puts up a good performance as the hopelessly in love and clueless about Dev's terrible attitude Paro. Her eyes speak louder than her voice and that was something which I liked the most. She captures the quintessential Indian girl with apt brilliance. Newcomer Kalki Koechlin is a surprise! This French-Indian actress does a terrific job as Chanda, the misguided and abused young girl who is still coming to terms with a lost family. Her Tamil is quite eloquent and on further research I found out that she does speak it fluently.'Dev.D' stands out like an eyesore of a scarecrow in the middle of a familiarly patterned sugarcane crop.",

For some reason, he fails to gain my sympathy even in this particular adaptation of Sarat Chandra's time classic of a hopeless romantic. To bring the tale up-to-date, the plot makes liberal use of contemporary controversies: the MMS scandal of a schoolgirl filmed in the act of fellatio and the BMW case, when an industrialist's son drove his BMW over seven unsuspecting roadside sleepers, crushing them to death- both are incorporated into Dev D. The direction is slick, the songs funny, and the drug-induced sequences, well, they are a direct rip-off from Danny Boyle's Trainspotter. And yes, it could do with a bit more editing.However, this isn't a film you would want to take your family to, as I learnt to my great embarrassment: both my mother and woman-friend had little choice but to leave the theater post-interval.

            "review_title": "Reinterpreting a classic",
            "content": "Adaptations of literary works is a rarely ventured territory in Hindi cinema. Going a step further then, as Anurag Kashyap tries to adapt Saratchandra's Bengali classic and place it in the contemporary times, it is no less than a radical step for Hindi film industry. Kashyap's last film, 'No Smoking', was too complex for a regular cine-goer and it suffered as a result. This time around, in 'Dev. D', he has mellowed down in his style and treatment. The outcome, therefore is easy on the mind.The story begins in the green landscapes of Punjab. Dev is the son of a rich businessman. Paro is his childhood friend. Unable to control Dev's notoriety, his father sends him to London for schooling. The childhood friendship of Dev and Paro blossoms into an adult, long-distance romance. Dev returns and wants to marry Paro but refuses when is blinded by the rumors of a local claiming Paro to be promiscuous. Paro marries a rich widower from Delhi. This sets off Dev on the road of drinking and self-destruction. On this road, he meets Chanda, a prostitute. In Kashyap's 'Dev.D' she also has a scarred history which include a scandalous MMS and father's suicide. Kashyap's Devdas takes a different route thereafter from the book that it is based on.The first hour of the film is very rustic and rural in its look and feel. Paro (Mahie Gill) is raw, sharp and irresistible. It is easy to see why Dev (Abhay Deol) is floored by her. Some dialogs and situations are probably a bit bold for the Hindi audiences, almost bordering on the lewd, but that is Paro for you - all open for her Dev. It is only obvious then that she reacts with speed and vengeance, without giving Dev any time, when he breaks her heart. We are then introduced to the school girl Lenny (Kalki Koechlin) and witness her transformation to Chanda. All three characters converge in Delhi to set up the second half of the film.Abhay Deol gets into the skin of Dev. He does not try to add any new dimension to his character but very naturally and effectively brings out the wasted Dev. Mahie Gill is fiery and probably lives out Paro as Kashyap would have wanted. Kalki is very convincing as her character traverses time and emotions.The Devdas in Saratchandra's novel is a spineless character who cannot stand up to anybody. Kashyap's Dev is a little different. He decides and sticks to it but is weighed down by the consequences of his decisions, unable to bear the outcome. The climax establishes that he is by no way spineless. Kashyap goes to extremes to establish his characters. Dev upgrades to narcotics from alcohol. Paro is bursting with sexual energy, eager to consummate her love for Dev. Chanda is educated, multi-lingual and a realist, unlike the romantic in the book.Anurag Kashyap's style is what I'd call collage film making. There are so many patches stitched together, it is difficult to carry an image outside the theater with you. All the energy of visuals and the bursts of music thrill you while you watch the film, but like a sparkler only for its lifetime. A very different film and worth your time and money.",

Rare occasion might be but this conversation between young Dev and his father provides enough insight to Dev's ungrateful and remorseless character. In next 2 minutes grown-up Dev (Abhay Deol) asks Paro (Mahie Gill) for a 'bit' of a cyber fun. She agrees while knowing what a tease it will be. Follow-the-heart or in other words where the heart is at, the LIBIDO.Please welcome back with a round of applause to the mind behind grenade exploding Satya (1998) and bone-chiller Kaun (1999)'s writer Mr Anurag Kashyap. I missed out on his first directorial venture, Paanch (2003), but Black Friday (2004) and No Smoking (2007) gave me reason to wonder his courage, only. Dev D is a chance at reminder of his true writing talent resembling the widest horizons of Satya and Kaun. Dev D is a movie of the generation of MMS voyeurs, cyber punks and flesh famished junkies. Male and Female hand in hand narrowing the gap to a single 'byte'. The 'byte' being the difference between the core properties of their respective 'connectors'. Nobody can ask Mr Kashyap,\" So what is your contribution to Saratchandra Chatterjee's classic novel?\" It is as blatant as any internet sensation's strength to spread over the globe overnite. Nailed it!! I mean, 'proper' nailed it.Abhay Deol does it again. After playing desi-version of JJ Gittes, Manorama-Six Feet Under(2007), and a cool superchor, Oye Lucky Lucky Oye (2008), he is back as arguably the most popular loser in the history of Indian literature, Devdas. Unlike charming Yusuf saab's 1955 version or beloved Shahrukh Khan's 2002 version, this one is a brat. Not only that but he is surrounded by brat versions of Paro (Mahie Gill) and Chandramukhi (kalki Koechlin). Blame Dev and Paro's 'choices' on the age of internet but Paro has her strong reasons. Talk about character building. Chanda's pre-call-girl story is unfaltering. Reminded me Fenix's troubled and bloody childhood in midnight-movie-genre inventor Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre (1989). Can't really blame Chanda's choice at the life style. But it is rather necessary to get drugged to the tunes of 'Ankh Micholi' as Chanda leans her head out of the bus' window. Strongly reminiscent of Joker's head tilt out of the stolen cop car's window in The Dark Knight (2008). Talk about Dev and his character's impulses. Well impulse is what makes us human. The characters in this movie have impulses to watch porn, gulp down vodka-coke (i mean seriously?, screw-the-world choice maybe) and chase dragons. These guys have 'rivers of white water' (like the dudes in Dil Dosti Etc). Regret is unheard of. Fear is un-felt of, until one moment for Dev. It had to be the fear of death for Dev to re-evaluate his choices in life. The character study doesn't get any more convincing than this. Abhay understands the necessity all the way and gives a stunning performance. The scene with his mother is a great example.When writing stops the camera starts to show it's power. Kashyap went with Danny Boyle's suggestion to use the German camera, used in Slumdog Millionaire, to shoot Dev D. The revolving takes focusing nothing but Abhay's drooling face are illustrious. The steadicam reminds of Arronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000). The luminous streets of Delhi and blinking cheap hotel signs are 'Oldboy'ish and striking. Amit Trivedi's music becomes an integral part of this bonanza. 'Nayan Tarase, Pardesi and Emosanal Atyachar' blend and make this flicker-show fly high.How much ever Dev D reminds of anything seen before, this one stays as one of the remarkable original works of art. Dev D is an important addition to the current golden era of Bollywood. The era of A Wednesday, Rock On, Manorama, Dil Dosti Etc and Luck By Chance. This era is reminiscent of the independent film driven '70s Hollywood era of Taxi Driver, Network, Dog Day Afternoon, El Topo and Chinatown. That era was ended by gargantuan commercial success of an independent film called Star Wars (1977). Paul Schrader said, it killed Hollywood. I am fingers crossed for the independent filmmakers of Bollywood.",

The main characters of the original work are given a totally modern look and outlook and the result is a successful face-lift and not a botched up chop-and-change, as most remakes end up coming out as.The casting seems near perfect with both the heroines, Mahie Gill (playing a Punjabi version of Paro) and Kalki Koechlin (playing a mixed-race controversy-hounded schoolgirl turned high-profile escort) doing full justice to their characters. The movie feels like a cross between 'Devdas' and 'Pretty Woman' but without the tragic end of the former or the sickeningly sweet ending of the latter. The director even manages to sneak in a public service message about the dangers of alcohol abuse without sounding preachy! Movies like Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi, Fashion, Dostana and now Dev D are shaking off the last shreds of prudishness that once blanketed Indian movies. Even while earlier movies have been bold, the boldness was often portrayed as a depravity and something to be ashamed of, but that, is a thing of the past. Both Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi and Dev D portray married Indian women having sex with their ex-lovers without suffering any post-coital guilt/shame and that is a sure sign of increased maturity.Abhay Deol's portrayal of a spoiled brat's journey through life, which starts with loss of love, meanders through drug and alcohol abuse and finally culminates in the discovery of true love, is splendid.

            "content": "Anurag Kashyap is one of the bravest contemporary directors. I'm not saying I like all his films but the director dares to do something different and make films on subjects that others won't dare to even consider. However, different does not equal good. I liked Kashyap's 'Black Friday' but could not sit through the entirety of 'No Smoking'. In my defense, the movie got stuck after the first hour but I had already lost interest anyway, which is why I did not bother finishing it later on.Overall, I liked the concept behind 'Dev.D'. It is pretty much a modern adaptation of Saratchandra Chatterjee's tragedy 'Devdas'. I prefer this interpretation much more than Sanjay Leela Bhansali's miserable melodramatic version. I loved the stylish execution, slick editing, soundtrack, raw and colourful visuals. The various hues create a psychedelic effect (which is perhaps how a heavy-headed Dev perceives his surroundings). The eclectic soundtrack is exceptional with songs ranging from Punjabi bhangra to rock. The track 'Emotional Atyachaar' is quite catchy and stays in mind.However, the flaws of this film really prevent me from calling it a masterpiece because they could have easily been modified. There is absolutely nothing likable about Dev. It is arguably that women were intrigued by his bad boy vibe and he is portrayed as the ultimate spoiled brat but how can a viewer have any sympathy for a character who has no good quality? It also makes me wonder why Paro, who is portrayed as an otherwise strong character, would fall for someone who has no respect for her (or anyone else for that matter) at all. He is also ignorant towards his loving parents. In addition, Dev is quite stupid since he'd rather believe a local village sleazy scum over his girlfriend. So, why would one want to watch a movie about a guy who has not even a single likable trait about him. His sudden change in the end makes me only despise Dev more.Then there's the whole Internet porn angle with Chanda which is an interesting idea but there is one dialogue which is very off-putting: when Chanda tells her parents that she won't suck every (censored) that comes her way. What was Kashyap trying to imply here? Chanda is shown before to have a loving relationship with her parents. Why would any child talk like that to their parents? Is it because of her part Western upbringing that Kashyap decides to show her as a young lady who has no respect for her parents? Following this sequence, there's a scene where the father admits to having watched what his daughter had done. Now, what kind of dad would watch their daughter give a (censored) to a stranger (or anyone)? Moreover the several references ('Dola re Dola', 'Maar Daala' and the Devdas poster) to Bhansali's 'Devdas' are irritating. We get it, Mr. Kashyap, that you were influenced by his film and one reference is enough.Now the performances are competent. Abhay Deol makes the best of his one-dimensional Dev. Mahie Gill and Kalki Koechlin are confident as newcomers. Koechlin looks a little uncomfortable in parts but otherwise pulls off a part that couldn't have been easy for a newcomer to play.Had it not been for the above-mentioned flaws, I believe 'Dev.D' would have been an excellent interpretation. Yet, it's far from a bad film. It deserves credit for its creativity and execution and not a bad watch if you don't mind seeing a movie about a hateful stupid drunkard.",

            "content": "That is Dev D for you. The question on everyone's mind prior to Dev D's release was, Is it going to be another \"No Smoking\"? Will Anurag Kashyap alienate the audiences yet again? Is it going to be self indulgent? Well, lets get the obvious stuff out of the way. This is not a typical commercial film that is tailor made for Indian audiences as the director and rest have touted it to be. Yes, it is more mainstream, yes it has more linear or conventional narrative as suppose to his previous effort, yes it is based on the novel \"Devdas\",cheap work of literature (almost pulp fiction) by Sarat Chandra Chatterjee which has been a source of inspiration for 9 previous efforts. But here is the kicker, this is not a remake of Devdas, but an interpretation of the original work in the context of Gen x.Rooted in the real and the contemporary, Kashyap's film stars Abhay Deol as Dev, an aimless drifter who returns home to Punjab after a graduation abroad, but has little in terms of future plans, except for getting into the sack with his childhood friend Paro, with whom he's spent many a long night talking dirty on the phone. On learning that she might have had a promiscuous past, Dev rejects Paro and her advances, driving her to marry a man she doesn't love, and landing himself in a downward spiral of booze and drugs and whores. Kashyap takes the basic structure of Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's original story, but in setting it in the now, updates much of the film's narrative, and makes the characters' actions and motivations more understandable. So you get a back-story to the Chanda character, the hooker Dev hooks up with in his desperate, despondent phase; and sex itself becomes the invisible but omnipresent motivation that drives many an important plot-point. Where most of the other versions of Devdas have failed, Dev D succeeds. The movie is not driven by caricatures or some puritanical, monogamous idea of love. It is a movie about lust, sex, loyalty and love in all its imperfections and complexities. This makes what is redundant story more relevant and poignant for the current audiences. The cinematography and the editing is top notch (however it could have been shorter by at least 20 minutes). The use of colors is some of the best I have seen in Hindi cinema since Bhansali's Saawariya. However, one major player is the narrative is the brilliant music by Trivedi. In many senses, Dev D is a musical in the way it uses songs and music to drive the narrative.From the performances, it is Abhay Deol who comes out with flying colors with one the best performances in recent times. Abhay has carved a niche for himself with his choices of films but the jury was out on him in terms of his acting abilities. Well, he has laid a lot of them to rest with his arrogant, existential, flawed portrayal of Dev. His performance is more driven by his body language than spoken, subtle yet poignant. Mahie Gill is excellent in her debut effort bringing the external brazenness and internal vulnerability to Paro. Take that scene in which Paro(played by newcomer Mahie Gill) sends for Dev to join her in a dense field so they can get down to doing what they've been unsuccessfully trying to do for some days. Watch the manner in which she virtually attacks a reluctant Dev into submission; and then the following scene in which she heads back home, mattress folded and tied on her cycle,after Dev spurns her overtures. Kalki, in my opinion, was the weak link of the film and her back story was an hindrance to the narrative.And finally Anurag Kashyap. What started out as a cult following for him as an accomplished non-mainstream filmmaker is slowly growing in stature, popularity and recognition. One of the finest filmmakers and a compulsive \"contrarian\" by nature, he is slowly starting to find some common ground. This movie is driven by his take on the subject and also his need to break all supposed norms associated with it. I hope he is less angry from hereon.",

            "content": "From the word \"Go\", you already know that you are going to watch the legendary story of Sarat Chandra's Devdas, made in a new style by Anurag Kashyap. But the amazing thing is that while experiencing the movements on the screen, you neither remember K. L. Saigal or Dilip Kumar nor the recent Devdas, Shahrukh Khan. Anurag Kashyap unexpectedly takes you on to a completely different journey filled with alcohol, drugs, reality takes, abuse and sex. The movie is well made, well shot and well acted but crosses its limit of vulgarism, which makes it strictly enjoyable for only the adult audiences.It starts with the background of Punjab and its beautiful locations, moving into the lives of Dev & Paaro. This part of the movie is well executed but is also filled with surprising sexual dialogues, which are quite offensive at times for family audiences watching the movie in the theater. Abhay Deol as Dev is superb as he acts with such an ease and remains calm and cool throughout the first half. The charcaterisation of Paaro is the best among all the others in the movie and the initial one hour clearly belongs to her. Maahi Gill playing Paaro looks gorgeous and acts well in the difficult scenes without showing any reluctance. She has earlier acted in Punjabi Movies but has chosen a very bold flick as her debut in Hindi Cinema. So, she has to carefully watch her next steps in Bollywood. The confrontation scenes between Dev and Paaro are among the best in the movie directed remarkably.The next part is about Chanda, a teenage girl who with her own choice becomes a hooker in Delhi's famous Pahar Ganj area. Kalki playing Lenny or Chanda is just fine in her act as she has to face her limitations due to her foreigner looks. This part of the movie shows Abhay as a druggist, alcoholic and a person touching the bottom levels of his consciousness. Abhay plays his part with conviction and continues to impress with his different choice of movies. But in some scenes he seems to be repeating his \"Oye Lucky\" cool act, which requires his immediate attention, otherwise he is shaping his career real well. It was indeed pleasant to read in the titles that the concept of this movie was also given by Abhay Deol himself. Way to Go, Man! Amit Trivedi's music is not usual and therefore manages to stand out of the current lot. The track 'Emotionall Atyachaar' is a huge hit among youngsters due to his wackiness and rough appeal. Amit tries some Punjabi stuff but is unable to create the required Punjabi spirit in spite of having some well known singers from Punjab. Cinematography is worth watching in the scenes involving roads of Delhi, drugs & pubs. Punjab and its ambiance is also captured well in the first half of the movie.Now about director Anurag Kashyap and his vision of a modern Devdas.Anurag starts off brilliantly and after few minutes the viewer is sure that he is going to watch something great. But slowly the movie starts moving into an unexpected zone of distasteful dialogues incorporated deliberately to catch attention. And I myself witnessed a few families moving out of the theater after hearing some bold dialogues in the first half. Here I am not referring to some abusive language used in the scenes (which has now become a norm in our movies), but I mean strong suggestive sex dialogues, which you may have never heard before on the Indian silver screen. If this was done intentionally then the producers should have publicized the movie as a strictly adult version of Devdas and in turn would have saved some viewers from sudden embarrassment in the cinema halls.The interesting thing is that the movie has not got any bold hot scenes as such, but has far more impactful suggestive lines for a change. And strangely our Censor Board once again clears them all without any cuts. It's quite amazing that in one movie they insist on putting \"BEEP\" to all offensive words used in a scene (like in A Wednesday) and in another, they blindly pass such strong language used only to make a debatable impact. This time, Anurag also adopts the realistic approach in his movie as he uses real life incidents in the narration similar to the works of Madhur Bhandarkar. But the difference is in the approach of using the references. Whereas Madhur has always incorporated the real life incidents in a positive manner in his movies, Anurag uses them all in the most negative manner possible. The Delhi School MMS clip and The BMW Accident are the two incidents used by Anurag in Dev-D.In the storyline, the MMS Clip incident is the main reason why the young teenage girl (Lenny) turns into a hooker and in my opinion that was the most drastic and bizarre angle given to the real life plot by the director. Here I also felt that the director has used his creative liberty license way beyond its social and moral limitations.Anurag chooses to give his movie a feel of \"Trainspotting\" and maybe that is the reason why a Thanks Credit was given to \"Danny Boyle\" in the opening titles. But in his attempt to give a rustic feel to the project, he missed the emotional depth of the subject. No-where in the movie, we find Abhay as a lover boy with deep love in his heart for Paaro. So, it can be said that from artistic point of view the movie is impressive and worth watching but its content and execution might be offensive to many. And it is certainly not a family movie like all the earlier Devdas versions were.",

            "content": "OK, I just watched Dev. D and was really, truly disappointed. Which is still totally fine, you don't have to like every movie out there. But the more disappointing part is I came back and read reviews and so far only found good ones. But then I noticed something. All the reviews were saying how different it is from the typical Bollywood movie. No review said why they truly enjoyed the film. So yes, if your going to talk about it being different from Bollywood movies then yes, it was a great movie. But as a movie by itself, then no.So many movies are different from typical Bollywood that 'different' should stop being taken into consideration as the only good aspect of the movie. A movie shouldn't be judged and given good ratings just because its not the usual Shahrukh movie. India has been making different movies right from the good old black and white days of the Apu Trilogy. Here is a short list of some other good 'different' films - Everyone says I'm fine, No Smoking, Missed Call, Hyderabad Blues and many more. So coming back to Dev.D, as a stand alone movie was it good? Not at all. As an experiment or something different from Bollywood? Sure. And here are my reasons:The characters didn't ever show any emotional connection, which in turn left the viewer never being able to feel for the character, specially for Dev. I probably felt a little for Chanda. But that's it. Dev really didn't have that much going on in his life to be so upset that he had to go out and get wasted or high every night. His love for Paro was never so strong to begin with. He came back to India just to get laid. This was very clearly depicted in the film. And even after meeting Paro he just wanted to get laid. So his whole 2 hours that followed felt like a waste of the two hours coz it never felt like he wanted to that bad to begin with! The whole confusion between Paro and Dev about her sleeping around with many people was such a childlike fight because really, how hard would it have been for them to figure out the truth, all they needed to do was have a 5 minute talk. Anurag, come on. You should know better. And the music. I usually always remember the score after a film. Except for the way it was shot and lit everything else was poor. Being a friend of Anurag I was extra disappointed because I had such high expectations for the film. I read the other review on IMDb and it was quite evident that the writer, like many people in India are right now, was just infatuated by Kashyap and will take anything to fill the hole in them that Bollywood has created, but in the process will forget how good a movie really is. Therefore its important to watch movies from all around the world, because sure, if you only watch Bollywood then this movie will surely blow you away.",

            "review_title": "Must watch creative and in-your-face version of today\u2019s Devdas",
            "content": "Devdas, the desi heartbreak icon from the 1917 Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay novel has over the years had over a dozen stars play it in as many languages. Probably, the audience\u2019s emotional connect with failed romances that real life is replete with is the lifeblood of this century old character. Vis-\u00e0-vis the Dilip Kumar, Nageswara Rao, and SRK versions, Anurag Kashyap\u2019s Dev D is contemporary, creative and realistic.Having rated Kashyap\u2019s \u2018No Smoking\u2019 among the worst movies I know of, my prediction was quantal \u2018either Dev D would be truly amazing or turn out to be a complete disaster\u2019. A neat script-art-music and a flawless Abhay Deol turned Dev D into a masterpiece. Although different in packaging, this time, Kashyap had the comfort of Devdas being a well known story. Probably lessons from the abstraction misadventure were well learnt.Set in Punjab, debauched Dev, the London educated son of a rich industrialist, dumps childhood sweetheart Paro, probably for being promiscuous, showing the decadent male obsession with virginity. The break up hits him hard as she moves on and marries an older man with kids. Dev turns to vodka and drugs funded by a doting father. Events lead a lost Dev to finding solace in Chanda, an escort who has fallen from innocence! Unlike SRK\u2019s melodramatic Devdas, one is not expected to feel for Dev, but only witness the events as they happen. Rich as he is, Dev has no care for money or inhibitions as he sleeps around, albeit with Paro eternally dwelling on his psyche. A wise man once said, \u201cWe are happy or sad with things or events only based on how they affect our emotions. Money and materialism are indirect; but love hits it hard and direct\u201d. Dev embodies this! Have you ever wondered why you never see a female version of Devdas? Going by Dev D, it has something to do with their innate ability to handle emotional issues better and to move on while the men live in the past and loathe themselves in self pity! Paro not only moves on but also makes it a point to rub in during a rendezvous with Dev, making the best of both worlds with little regret. The selfish hypocrisy of Dev and Paro is evident! Chandramukhi has always been my favorite character from the story. She is someone who loved Devdas unselfishly when he is at his deepest trough, all alone, shattered and intoxicated with his lost love! Newcomer Kalki koechlin, the French belle, portrays it to perfection from a schoolgirl turned MMS victim and then into flesh trade. Surely, the ending to this story, though not revealed here, will surely leave you with a good feeling! Sensuousness here is with no-holds barred. Imagine Paro carrying a mattress to the fields to accommodate for her desires with Dev! Can it ever get more direct? Hats off to Anurag Kashyap\u2019s most relevant adaptation of Devdas reflecting today\u2019s acceptance of casual relationships and hip hop lifestyle. Also thralling you are its 18 songs including the anthem Emotional Atyachaar that flow with the movie. You just can\u2019t have enough!",

            "content": "I've seen this movie more than 15 times. The director (Anurag kashyap) has done a brilliant and outstanding job & showed the real meaning of film making. The screenplay is chiseled with genuine characters & their performance is highly appreciable. The art of photography is mind-blowing which has never been seen yet in any other Bollywood movie. I consider this movie in the category of \"Masterpiece collection\" in Bollywood. It's a fine blend of contemporary drama & factual romance with perfect music as a luscious ingredient. The storyline revolves around three main characters dev(abhay deol) whose ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, Paro(Mahi gill)accepts her parents decision after being insulted by Dev, Chanda aka leni ( kalki koechlin) after being disowned by her family & humiliation pushes her into prostitution. Story reveals the connectivity of both characters dev and chanda after sharing their past melancholy. The most appealing factor of this film is its environment with classic scenes of masterful editing. The way its music connect with the situations gives a realistic touch to story. The lifestyle of characters depict the real picture of today's cause for relationship issues eventually leads to usage of alcohol and drugs to find solace. Some of the content is offensive so it's not a family movie. Heads off for acting and direction once again. People who don't know anything about the 'Art House cinema', please don't watch this movie.",

I haven't watched Shahrukh Khan's version; but did watch the one with Dilip Kumar and thought that it was superlative. Unfortunately, Dev D left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The film has very poor direction. However to counteract it, the film makers have included copious amount of gratuitous sex to attract the attention of Indian audiences. The music is very good; however unfortunately it does not offer much else. It is really upsetting to watch the poor directorial effort. The acting of Abhay Deol and Paro is OK. Chanda is played very poorly. Forget about this one unless you wish to watch off screen lovemaking and dialogues with double entendre (to skirt around the censors). Go for the original instead.",

Many of Bollywood's leading men struggle to play a broken character, as most are used to playing guys an an upward trajectory, but Abhay does it in perfect measure.Both Kalki Koechlin and Mahie Gill are very pleasing on the eye, and yet both as so very different both in terms of how they look and what they bring to their respective parts. Top marks to the casting department for choosing such a wonderful pair of actresses to play off Abhay Deol dysfunctional lead.It would have been easy for this to have been a pretty run of the mill romantic comedy crossed with a coming of age movie, but it is so much more and deserves to be rated highly as a movie that isn't your typical Bollywood production line creation.

            "content": "Back when love was a compendium of silences and sighs, Devdas was an icon. These days, when it's more a matter of working off those pesky hormones as quickly as possible, the legendary lover is regarded as a champion loser.In 'Dev D', Anurag Kashyap and Abhay Deol dust him off and resurrect him, making of him just another guy who goes at romance with all the arrogance and prickliness and insecurities of a young man. Recognise yourself in him? Dev's (Abhay) childhood sweetheart Paro (Mahi Gill) has all of these qualities, tempered by the essential femaleness of her. When, in a fit of jealous pique, he throws her off, she doesn't beg or grovel: she turns her back on him, too. Recognize yourself in her?The film invites you to come along on a stunning multi-layered journey---the psychedelic contours of the overloaded-on-substance, on-the-verge-of-losing-it mind, the physical degradation of the body, the slow dissolution of the spirit. With Anurag and Abhay, (whose idea it was in the first place), 'Dev D' becomes one of those rare films which is all of a piece: every single frame is where it should be. As Dev and Paro part ways, Chanda aka Chandramukhi (Kalki) enters the equation, and the film steadies into its triangular groove, rocking to an inverted, just-right climax.In this virtuoso re-working of the Devdas story, there's none of the obfuscatory self-indulgence that marred Kashyap's last outing, 'No Smoking'. The cast is perfect for their parts. Debutante Mahi Gill is no Bollywoodized phoolkari-dupatta-wearing ingenue: she dresses, moves and behaves like a feisty girl who's been born and brought up in sugarcane country in rural Punjab, she already her tryst with quintessential Indian Cinema before with a miniature role in Khoya Khoya Chaand. The other first-timer, Kalki, is astonishingly apt too: her journey from a traumatized schoolgirl (based on the MMS scandal emanating from one of Delhi's top schools a few years ago) to a role-playing, phone sex-worker Chanda, is riveting. The first is raw and sensuous, the other raises the lust-meter as high as any red-blooded male can handle, but both are heart-stippling, blatantly alive, needy, looking-for-love-with-sex-as-a-by-product - real girl-women.But it is Abhay who makes this thing sing. His Devdas is both eerily similar to the others who've played the part (Kashyap cheekily references posters and scenes from SRK's 'Devdas' in a couple of scenes), as well as completely his own. Spoilt rich brat, king-of-the-castle, center-of-the-universe, the kind of male who is always so sorry for himself, that he can't see anyone else as clearly. Right from the attire\u0097jeans, Tees, strap-across-the-chest-bag--- to the attitude\u0097love me, love me, love me-- this joint-rolling, alcohol-swilling ( Coke, vodka 'ke saath', is his line in seedy bars) Devdas wears his victim hood with panache, blaming others for the 'emosional atyachaar' (one of the eighteen sparkling songs Amit Trivedi and Amitabh Bhattacharya have created for the film: sometimes the film seems too stuffed with the background music, but that's a very minor quibble and mesmerizing at the same point of time) being wrecked upon him, but reserving the right to a chuckle in the middle of it all. Dissolution, despair, and redemption\u0097the film unerringly hits all the right notes of a life sliding down the precipice, teetering on the edge, and drawing back from the brink, at the very last moment. 'Dev D' is a contemporary classic. Watch it, whatever else you do. A special applause for amit trivedi and bhattacharya for their bizarrely rocking music. Go for it.",

And it certainly does not boast about being in the league of the previous Devdas's may it be Dilip Kumar's or Shah Rukh Khan's. Dev D, is a fresh script and the characters are superbly written. Director Anurag Kashyap, has made a movie with a simple script told in a really complex way with the casting director being absolutely on target with the casting of every character. Dev D is no over the moon movie, but it simply justifies the fact that you do not need big stars to make a movie look good.Dev D's protagonist Devender Singh Aka Dev(Abhay Deol) is a spoilt brat coming from a really well off punjabi family. Dev,arrogant yet so sensible falls in love with his childhood friend Paro Aka Parminder(Mahie Gill). Unseen circumstances lead to Dev losing Paro, who goes on to marry an close family acquaintance leaving Dev to his all time companion \"Alcohol\". Dev goes on to realize how much he actually loved Paro and gets completely into Alcohol-Drugs and Girls. Now during this phase is when he comes across Chanda(Kalki Koechlin), a prostitute through a local pimp Chunni(Dibyendu Bhattacharya). Dev finds comfort and lot of relief as he continues to spend time with Chanda letting out all that he ever had for Paro, both fall in love. Dev leaves Chanda no sooner his conscious pricks him about Chanda being a Sex Worker. Life again seems to take Dev for a ride as circumstances put him into some serious legal tangle. The things that follow is to watch for, which gives this movie a happy ending.Dev D, definitely is engaging.. but only in parts. The movie is slow paced which might make the audience restless during certain parts of the movie. Dev D also has the real world touch to it, recreating the DPS MMS Scandal and BMW Road Rage killings in the movie. The man who steals the show with an impeccable performance is Abhay Deol. He is awesome throughout the movie making you cling onto the movie even in the most slowest of scenes.He is definitely showing his worth as an Actor. The performance of Mahie Gill and Kalki Koechlin is to watch out for. It definitely does not feel like its their first movie. They're too good for their first movie. And as far as the other actors go, they've delivered the goods quite perfectly. Dev D, is movie that shows intimate scenes of the movie differently and boldly. Music of the movie is average,the song \"Tauba Tera Jalwa\" being the most liked one.Dev D simply lacks the pace that's needed, making it an average movie at the end of the day. And am quite sure about the fact that the movie will get mixed reviews among different groups of audience apart from the Critic's. Dev D is a movie that not everyone will like after watching it, as its so far from the usual commercial cinema. I would suggest you to go watch the movie and see for yourself. But still for people who're in a double mind, this is not a Must Watch.I will go with 7 out of 10, for Anurag Kashyap's Dev D. Ans two thumbs up for the freshness and the direction of the movie.Not a Must Watch, but i suggest you to.",

I have never experienced something like this before where you can almost feel that you do not need dialogues, the songs says it all. Anurag himself confessed sometime back that Amit's music was so impressive that he changed his script to rationalize and credit Amit's work. Welcome to new-age Bollywood. Times are changing. Those who understand and believe in lucid and rational cinema know that SLB's Devdas was a ridiculous movie with idiocy written all over it's frames and the essence lost in its grandeur. Chuck it. Embrace brand new Paro, Chanda and Dev. The movie has Anurag's style of film-making stamped all over it. The first half is radiant, full of life as we slowly gets introduced to the characters. It's the second half that would blow your mind off. Each and every person can comprehend the happenings. The third plus after Amit's exceptional music and Anurag's characterization of the trio is Rajeev Rai's photography. The movie gets dark in the second half with almost the whole second half shown in neon-lit streets and bars. The concept is by Abhay Deol which Anurag wrote along with Vikramaditya Motwane to give it a position of a formal script. Anurag Kashyap was given unimaginable names after No Smoking.

Anurag Kashyap has not adapted Sharatchandra's Devdas. He has set it free from a shackles of old age India and given its characters a new lifeFor the first time in an adaption of Devdas, has any writer tried to delve into Chandramukhi's past. For the first time does any Indian movie talk so boldly about lust and sexual desires in a relationship and does not apologize about it. It brilliantly deals with our Indian double standards and hypocrisy without spelling it out or throwing it in your face.For the brave and adventurous movie watcher this movie has a lot to offer - >Brilliant contemporary dialogues, > Well written strong central characters of Dev, Paro & Chanda, > Amit Trivedi's great soundtrack, > Rajeev Ravi's visually captivating cinematography, > Complimenting performances by Abhay (and also Mahi).But thats about it - It is not that 5-star movie that Nikhat Kazmi bragged it to be nor the 1-star crap as rated by Taran Adarsh. I found this flawed movie very lovable with only a few things that did not work for me - > Chanda's story from the beginning till her return to Delhi was sluggishly slow and boring, > Some of the songs just didn't fit in - I would have loved some silence in the background where the movie gets time to breath or sink in - Anurag didn't have to use all the 18 songs just because Amit created it for him. > Despite these, I liked the movie at several levels - esp. Creativity & great scene-level execution. Is this better than No Smoking or Black Friday? - Not as per me. Could Anurag have done it better? - Definitely.

Humor was good as it was situational comedy and not intentional, which is what i prefer.Abhay deol projected Devdas in a different light altogether. The modern devdas. Smoking, drinking, doping etc. Abhay deol convincingly played the character well, easy for the youth to relate to. Good amount of swearing involved. Yes it was required and so it was given an A certificate. At no point of time you will feel sorry for the protagonist though as you know the story he screwed up so he has to face it.Mahi Gill an average looking Jat girl playing Parminder (Paro) lacks the charisma but i guess her feisty nature may help you overlook that.Kalki Koechlin the girl with a french heritage, parents were hippies who came to India 38 years ago and then settled here, playing chandramukhi (Chanda) lacks that charisma too required to convert our own devdas to a responsible or a good man (read obedient cute little puppy).Having said that, Anurag kashyap made this movie keeping in mind The Youth today and incidents occurred in the recent past. So it becomes a little easy to watch and enjoy the movie or relate to it.The end I liked it at first. Then it was pointed out that the end would have better if it was something else. The movie could have been ended conveniently within 120 mins but it had to be dragged for another 30 mins for no obvious reasons, or for some reason i don't understand.

Amit Trivedi is one of the best thing to happen to commercial Indian music in recent times. After Aamir, this is his second outing, and shows absolute brilliance in this 18-song album.

I don't find any cons in the movie but I happened to notice many people leave at the interval or before the movie ended. Interpretation will differ from people to people and may be they felt embarrassed watching with family. They were smaller part of the audience and many seemed to enjoy with joyous and surprising comments at every turn.When I got out of theater, I felt like sedated. DEV.D is filled with liquor scenes and we can smell the taste of it on every reel so are the gals who are intoxicating. It set new trend by discussing sex so blatantly. The \"F\"-word and \"Slut\" are spilled all over the film. After watching so many movies we can easily expect the forth coming scenes. DEV.D stands out there as a unique, unforeseen, impressive, spectacular and matchless surpassing entire film industry. The movie poster says like \"Contemporary classic\" \u0096 a true statement. I wish to watch it again that's what I said to my friend after coming out of the movie hall. The theatre manager/owner is my friend's father so I know all of them working at the hall as I am a regular. He seemed to get negative replies from others and got surprised when I said this is the excellent movie I watched so far. Even after showing unconditional love towards dev, paro gets ditched, the unfortunate moment where we will feel sad as if it hurt you. Your heart would crave to tell the truth to Dev about paro.. but goes in vain. The meaning for contemporary lies in showing paro's sexual desires where she is ready to do anything like taking nude pics for love, showing affection towards dev even after her marriage observing his condition, MMS scandals on chanda, chanda's part time studies or sex working(I think both are part time), Atlast Dev realizes he is a slut as enlighten by chanda that he never loved paro.. etc., we can go on praising at every scene.. Modern day devdas fits the bill perfectly. kudos to Anurag Kashyap and Abhay Deol who dared to take such a movie in India.So overall I give a standing ovation and suggest people who are willing to explore new phase of love or movie definitely watch DEV.D",

The vision of Abhay Deol brought on screen by Anurag Kashyap (and Vikramaditya Motwane) is nothing short of speechlessly rebellious by nature.I was an amateur film-goer back then. Dev.D was one of my initial Hindi films in a theatre. In fact, seeing the initial credit of a \"Thank You\" to Danny Boyle, I even joked to my friend that he had mistakenly bought a ticket to Slumdog Millionaire! Not Funny. But the initial ten minutes of the movie certainly were funny. In their own wicked way, at that. It gave an outrageous background of lust to the lead characters of Devinder Singh Dhillon and Parminder (so much for adapted names!) in stark contrast to their love that forms the soul of the story of Devdas.Thereafter, the movie moves wildly through the lives of the three lead characters and how they get affected by the gossip of the side characters. The language use was preposterous in places. But limited to the point of enhancing the movie and not degrading it. It was amazing to see the amount of care that Kashyap has paid to the detailing in each scene. I particularly remember three of these scenes. In the first, when Dev.D first meets the pimp Chunni (Dibyendu Bhattacharya), the background flashes a big neon light that spells out RAND (slang for \"prostitute\" in Hindi). I was shocked as no one else seemed to notice it and I pointed it out to my friend who was amused. We waited and watched and as they started walking, the camera zoomed out and we read the words \"GRAND HOTEL\". Our respect for Kashyap had increased manyfold. The second scene was similar in nature and displayed the words HIV in the background of a brothel balcony where Chanda was standing. (I didn't manage to catch the remainder of the word but never mind!) The third scene involves a verbal fight between a girl and Dev.D in the bus and the camera zooming to catch the word \"Mahilaye\" (\"Ladies\" in Hindi) on the bus with the letter \"Ma\" scratched out. It now spelt out as \"Hilaye\" (\"Jerk off\" in Hindi). It gives the clue to the viewer that a break-up is on the cards. Hillariously Epic!Such kind of detailing by a filmmaker is rarely observed in Indian cinema. Who, after all, bothers to show anything else apart from the actor's faces and body language at the most? But Kashyap, the rebel that he is, refused to stop with just that. He has used dizzying camera angles and tricks (apparently taught by Danny Boyle) that are usually not employed by Indian filmmakers. The drinking scene during the song \"Pardesi\" uses a special camera that was imported from Holland by Danny Boyle and can capture an incredulous 40 frames per second in contrast to normal 25fps cameras (not sure about the specs, read about them a long time ago).The adapted writing also includes three narrators that appear throughout the movie and keep an eye on the characters, some real-life incidents that serve as backdrop for many important scenes (the Delhi school MMS scandal,the BMW hit-and-run case) and also some awesome scenes (the hilarious episode at the bus, the car crash outside the phone booth) that have been adapted from world cinemas as an ode to them. By the way, the first customer of Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) is a cameo by Anurag Kashyap. See if you can spot him!The brilliance of this movie does not, however, end with the screenplay and direction. The trippy soundtracks featuring 18 tracks by Amit Trivedi (that fetched him a National Award) are a treat to listen to. They still remain my all-time favourite soundtrack album. Sadly, I have never heard any of these underrated songs sung in any stage concert or in any of those mind-dumbing reality shows. The extraordinary cinematography (Kashyap's regular Rajeev Ravi) has been carefully used throughout the movie to enhance the mood of the different scenes. The cutting-edge editing (by Kasyap-experienced ex-wife Aarti Bajaj) in many of the drinking scenes take this movie to the dizzying level you would expect to find yourself if you were as drunk as Devdas.I still remember to having spent the least amount on a Multiplex movie ticket (Rs.60) but having enjoyed it more than the costlier bigger budget extravaganzas. In fact, the only ever thing that I could complain about this movie, was the way it ended. I really didn't expect the lights to switch on at that point. It kinda leaves you incomplete. But the rest of the movie makes up for it.Lose your control, Kashyap. Be the rebel forever!8/10",

To give it a kick start, \"Dev D\" happened to be a very satisfying experience for me. I would certainly rate it as one of the finest movie I have seen so far. A benchmark movie in its own right and demands (& deserves) an entry into the film archives. And come to think of it \"Dev D\" is not original, it is based on Saratchandra classic and host of other screen adaptations attempted so far. Yet what makes it innovative is the intelligent juxtaposition of the plot into the contemporary times without losing the essence. It neatly blends the situations around us thereby making us connect, believe and identify. The flip-side is the risk of being branded as hard-hitting/ rebellious/ audacious. So you will either love it or loath it - there is no middle ground there. The finished product speaks volumes of itself. The effort gone into making is nothing short of herculean task. It reflects that the director has played Devil's Advocate at every inch of progress. And the result if I may state \"every frame is an art\". The inspiration is taken from Baz Lurhman's \"Romeo + Juliet\" (and chapter-wise narrative is of course, Tarantino).Performances, I wouldn't even go there for everyone is simply \"SPOT ON\". The only shortcoming I felt were the songs which hampered the flow. And yes, the ending couldn't have been better and so are the final credits. PS: Where RGV fails, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 excels.",

I went with the expectation of seeing a stylish obnoxious devdas and glad to tell u i got it :)). People with a good humor sense will love it. The movie is on similar lines to Sharath chandra's novel where the protagonist has broken relations with his father and is sent to London for higher studies. He is in constant touch with his childhood love paro, with whom he keeps contact through modern communication mechanisms Phone and internet! Trust is very important in any relation, which eventually is breached when dev hears some stories. From now he becomes the real devdas, Smoking coke, drinking Vodka and then Chandramukhi ! Overall a great performance by dev ( Abhay Deol ) and Paro. I would say chanda was not bad too. The dark humor in the movie is brilliant. There are a lot of humorous moments including a scene where dad tells devdas that paro was yours @ paro's wedding ! How chanda becomes a so called \" commercial sex worker\" and also the BMW Incident. Wonderfully blended into the movie. Well done anurag 9/10 for the script and 8/10 for the direction !! I travelled 30 kms to watch this movie because didn't' get tickets at multiplex near my house. Anywayz no regrets",

Anurag Kashyap is a synonym of vision and he is cultivating the Indian Cinema for the global viewers. While watching DevD you will realize that it is a Magnum Opus of the new generation cinema. The Crew of the movie consists endowed people like Anurag Kashyap, Abhay Deol, Adity Motwane, Amit Trivedi , Kalki Koechlin and Mahie Gill.The concept was given by Abhay Deol and executed brilliantly by Anurag Kashyap. Set in the milieu of Punjab and Delhi with a scintillating cinematography makes this movie beautiful.Abhay Deol as protagonist has done a magnificent job. It gives a feel of \"Fear and loathing in Las Vegas\" or \"Requiem for a dream\" but in its natural technique. Mahie Gill is awesome in his very first movie as a liberating Indian girl. Kalki is cute and plays her role of Chandramukhi with elegance in her debut. It is hard to have sympathy or apathy with the characters at the same time. The background score and music is flawless and refreshing with several moods.Finally it is Anurag who is taking the cinema to next level and the day is not far when we have the Oscar Award. Go for the \"EMOTIONAL ATYACHAAR\"",

The most beautiful part of this movie is color dominating emotions and of course the Musics ! Ohh man after a decade also I'm feeling like it's refreshing and chilling especially pump-rock mode of Emotional Atyachaar song, Slow beats of Nayan Tarase and my fav pop-mode of OOO Pardesi... It's music is still chilling in my brain.Overall a complete adult movie with some raw sexual intimacy scenes,80% of the movie containing Vodka,Drugs, Cigarettes and all so definitely a strict warning for you all to don't watch it with family and even don't recommend your family members as well if they're above 40+ age.Ha ha anyway! 9 Out of 10 Stars from my side for this brilliant bollywood movie ; Kudos to Kashyap for his brilliant work.

The cast comprises of lesser known faces and I was really impressed with their acting. Abhay Deol portrays the titular character effortlessly and his downward spiral after having his heart broken, is both realistic and painful to watch. Deol has been able to extract sympathy from his audience and I'm not sure if anyone else would have been able to step in his shoes. The newcomers, Mahie Gill and Kalki Koechlin were well cast and considering this was their first film, were very good in their roles.The star of this film though, has to be the music. Amit Trivedi has produced a gem of an album with this film. I remember when this film had released; all of the songs had become immensely popular. From Nayan Tarse, to Payaliyaa, the soundtrack intertwined with the story and enriched this film further. This album is one of my most favorite film albums and I will keep listening to these songs for a time to come.Anurag Kashyap has done a great job with the direction and the story.

This movie should be appreciated for its storytelling, acting, and cinematography and the pace at which the movies moves. Many have described this movie as 'coming of age' and rightly so. The language used in this films is not for kids and it does not seems anywhere that the language used was forced. It fit in the script perfectly. And the good part about the film's language is that the actors do not put any emphasis on the 'adult words'. All the words were used with ease, as people do in their daily routine. Abhay Deol was very good and so were other actors. I think this is a season of lookalikes, First we got Aishwarya lookalike, we are hearing that Salman Khan is launching Katrina lookalike and now Mahie (Paro) of this movie has a striking similarity to Tabu. People have said that the second half was a little slow, it was not as fast as the first half but it was equally good if not better.All in all a good movie and youngsters will enjoy this movie.",

But that is not the only difference this movie offers compared to its previous interpretations. Thus, Devdas Mukherjee becomes the hip London returned Dev D. Paro remains Paro but a far fetched modern version of her . Chandramukhi becomes Kelly who turns into Chanda because of a MMS scandal against her. Damn, too many changes than the previous ones. But that was the motive actually, to present a satirical view of the much talked about loser in Indian cinema history. Anurag Kashyap with his intelligent and different style of film making has made this much repeated plot the most interesting . Another mention must go to the abundant use of alcohol(Mainly Vodka), cigarettes, drugs and slangs(Damn, I just remembered my first break-up :P) Another different thing in this movie is the mention of real news that shocked the country such as the teen MMS scandal in Delhi and the car accident by a rich man's son killing half a dozen people. These are cleverly moulded in the main story. AK's movies have tremendous cinematography and it is evident in this movie.About the performances, Abhay Deol convinces the viewer that he is going through a mental trauma. His best performance till date according to me. I even heard somewhere that the original concept of this movie was suggested by Abhay to Anurag few years ago. The two leading ladies played their part well. A special mention to the Patna ke Presleys and the hip hop dancers who showcase the pain of Dev D brilliantly . Overall, if you have seen the previous versions of Devdas, there is no reason why you should miss this oneRating : 8/10",

Although it is not a remake of Devdas, only the base is taken from there, it has its own twists, taste, and colors. It feels a different kind of cinema with lots of art put into it if the viewer can see and feel that drugs and alcohol through the way it's shown on the screen with an amazing camera and editing work. If you are a big fan of stories, it is not the perfect story, sorry! But, it is almost perfect visuals with those lightings and colors used in it. And along with Abhay Deol, both new actresses did a good job as well. The most amazing thing was moving motion lapse in drinking and drugs feel, made it like real.A must watch for all the cinema lovers, buts it's a no for those who want it to compare to Devdas like story and emotions.",

I think he also puts \"love\" under heavy introspection causing the viewer to come to terms with just how subjective love can be and how wrongly it can be perceived.And the soundtrack accompanies this film almost perfectly. Amit Trivedi's work on this is beyond stellar. From psychedelic synths on Saali Khushi to the raw screaming on Emotional Attyachar, this soundtrack is filled with emotions and, in a shocking turn of events for Bollywood, isn't filled with love songs.The only complaints I have regarding this film is the very quick cuts and the score sometimes feeling tonally out of touch with the scene.Else this movie is a wonderful work that is quite different from what Bollywood usually produces and it deserves to be seen.",

It is damn difficult for you even to remember who you played with as a kid, and that too at a time when you are surrounded by thousands of British hotties. What is that, that forced Devdas to go in the path of self destruction? Is it the love for the girl he romanced for a month or so? And what did he do, apart from being a mere spectator watching his beloved getting married, because the families don't approve the alliance? If you tell this story to a today's teenager, he will laugh in disbelief.Today's youth values Lust more than Love. Sex matters more than Platonic love. 'Fuck Plato and his love,' they say while turning the pages of Playboy magazine.Dev D is today's Devdas. He talks dirty to Paro every night and books the ticket to home when he sees her nude picture. He wears his heart in his sleeves, drinks coke with Vodka, but doesn't approve of promiscuity on the part of Paro. He severs his relationship with her and turns to Vodka instead. Chanda is the same girl who you saw in that controversial MMS. And now she is an established porn star giving refuge to our inebriated Dev.For those who dismiss this movie for its sexually explicit content, I presume they are more hypocrite than conservative. Not a single scene can be termed as arousing. Yes, there are lot of allusion to sex, but that is more suggestive than stimulating.Dev D is a bold statement. A movie that shows the contemporary mindset. No. I am not saying it's an everyman's movie. But, it is an entirely believable tale of today. Story is about self discovery than of love. And regarding, Saratchandra turning in his grave....let him be. What he wrote hundred years back is no more relevant today. Today's Paro doesn't hesitate go down a guy's pants and Chunni Babu doesn't talk in rhymes.I have not seen many Anurag Kashyap's directions apart from Black Friday. But must say, his brilliance is visible from the treatment of this subject matter. He didn't have any great actors to ease his job. So he just employed kaleidoscopic colours and songs to narrate his thoughts. As per the music department, I'd say probably the best collection of songs in recent times. Amazing melange of folk and western. Listen to Payaliaa and Saali Khushi. And, of course The Emosonal Atyaachar.(originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",

However I can scarce remember when an attempt to capture the essence of the classics and blend it in the current socio-cultural context has been made and that too in a seemingly natural way as if it couldn't be anything but that. While a autocratic father might have been a obstacle in their children's wishes such was not the case. The insecurities and lack of volition on the part of the boy himself defeat his longings for love. Girls do not become prostitutes only because they are trafficked or are poor. They might belong to extremely well off families and maybe ostracized because they were caught on film doing something which mankind has been doing ever since its dawn. These paradoxes make the film an exciting and mind opening experience and are a refreshing break from the clich\u00e9. My favorite moment in Dev.D is ironically the point where it departs from the original piece of literature. Not so much because society approves of it now but because the character is more evolved.

Its as if the character gets inside of you and takes you on an endless journey of painful joy. every moment is restless and unremitting and yet you want to go on and explore much like the main protagonists go about their lives.So what have you? A revamped version of a deadbeat spoilt rich lover kid who spirals down the path of self betrayal and loneliness ending up alienated to everything in the world even his own love for whose sake he gave it all up initially, An unforgiving yet kind, level headed beauty who tells her lover this that he loves nothing but himself as if to console her own loss for which she portrays little or no sympathy, and then you come across the worst of the worst possible love trader who sells her heart every night to the highest bidders and like sweet poison even destroys that which breeds her. Here there is no hope no sympathy and no love as well and the only thing that stays constant is the feeling of being lonely in this overcrowded and saturated world. Yet they all survive and strive to prosper.Its not for the weak hearted to endure or the narrow minded to understand the intensity of this movie which keeps every aspect of Dev's life raw. He doesn't comes across as being the kind you'd take a liking for or sympathize with. His words are not the kind which would evoke mercy on his condition. His actions are provocative. With all this he manages to still bind with the viewer just like Chanda who is as repulsive in character as attractive in physical traits. Nothing is what it seems to be or so we would like to believe just like Dev would on his escapist trips.The movie belongs to Anurag Kashyap for his unique direction on a subject often so many times portrayed on screen in Indian cinema yet never taken to these depths of realism. I have seen his other movies and had high expectations on this one which it topped up easily. Abhay Deol may or may not win an award for this but he definitely should do well to grab some more great opportunities that he truly deserves after this performance. The songs throughout blend well and are worth listening to.Its been quite some time since I watched this movie but I cant seem to get it out of my head and so couldn't resist writing this review. I hope this movie is not going to be one of the exceptions in Indian cinema and there will be more to follow.",

And Anurag Kashyap proves his mettle to all the naysayers.And with this future of Bollywood looks rosy again!",

            "content": "Here's a review on a movie which won't be forgotten by Indian Cinema, for long. It is bound to enter the realms of unforgettable classics, because of the vibrant energy this movie displays in its every single frame, and also because it intoxicates you to the level of sin by making you a part of the journey of an immortal character called DevD.DevD is not Devdas. AK and AD tried to attempt a new version of Devdas and they bring someone to us, whose thoughts you can relate with and whose failures make you desperate. Kudos to Abhay Deol for bringing out such a fine concept to Indian Cinema.But this is not the reason what makes this movie a cinematic experience of lifetime, the cinematography and editing simply took my breath away. The nuances of direction were so perfect that you could see a wonderful blend of colors in its every frame and could feel the perfection of every detail in each shot. Be it the scene where DevD meets Chunni with the song 'Pardesi' in the background, or the scene where Paro defies Indian sensitivity by showing the woman who cycles to the farm with a mattress to meet her lover, or the scenes where hell enters DevD every time he takes drugs (though it has been inspired by Danny Boyle). All these scenes prove that Anurag Kashyap is a person who is not letting Indian cinema remain the same anymore. The exquisite boldness with which Kashyap presents the movie without an iota of vulgarity shows that Kashyap is a master craftsman, I have to admit I haven't ever seen even a Hollywood movie with such boldness embedded in the spirit, while not letting it show on face and still hitting you hard.And as mentioned earlier, this is not for the faint hearted, as it hits you very hard, and takes you to a different world only if you are able to survive the blows. Its not for the \"Intelligent\", its not for the \"Masses\", its for every person who knows what intoxication is, because you don't feel good or bad after watching this movie, you simply feel intoxicated.This review is incomplete without the mention of Amit Trivedi, the creator of the best music Indian Cinema has seen in years. This movie is still not in my top 10 all time favorites but its music certainly is. Pardesi or Nayan tarse are such passionately rendered tracks, that they build on your heart and not on ears every time you hear them.Thanks once again, Anurag. This was not beer or rum, this was Vodka.... neat..",

If you ask me i would consider it a musical but unlike other bollywood movies you wont find stars dancing around the trees.the music is off beat and gives the movie a life which otherwise would have been very dull because of a repeated subject.The Cast was fresh and well selected and well placed. This movie takes on some issues which have not been touched yet, keeping them subdued so as to not give them prime importance. movie is beautifully framed and presented.could not have been made better.",

Though the movie is based on the text, but it is so very original ! This movie contains many things, thats very rare in a Hindi movie! This movie is dark, yet will mak u smile! And what actually makes this movie work is the music, and the way they have used it! Its very rare to hav a movie with a narrative-soundtrack (by amit trivedi) which actually adds on to the film narration! and satirical too, where u hav a breakup song in actually a wedding-song backdrop !This movie has certain things u wudnt normally hav in a Hindi movie - Reference to sex, abusive language, a narrative soundtrack, amazing narration, and an aim to actually mak a genuine, original, and remarkable film than to mak a super-hit clich\u00e9d Hindi movie! The cinematography (Rajeev Ravi) is superb ! The visuals add on to the darkness of the story !All the performances are great, except for one possible drawback which is the dialogue delivery of kalki ( chanda )!Mahie Gill has given a remarkable performance. All the emotions - anger, embarrassment, love, lust, is brought out well by her!Abhay Doel acts perfectly well portraying an egoistic, broken man helplessly in love with a married woman.The climax is great, but a little abrupt ! This movie was simply an awesome experience! A very rare piece of Hindi cinema! Go watch Dev D. Step out of the hall. And then, go watch it again.",

Would have been a decent modern classic, but its just too long and I myself started to lose interest after the intermission because of the above.The film does tackle some real life events which have been documented in reviews and I think its a good lesson for everyone esp young people. How a silly simple mistake can turn your world upside down and the dangers of ego,drink,drugs etc.The part I didn't like was when Chanda spoke to her father in that tone and language - Id hate to think this portraying as the norm in modern Indian continent.I also found Dev's character souless, with hardly any feeling for his family or anyone else.

Dev D's soul reverberates in every youth of today. Unlike the novel and like the youth of today, our \"Dev D\" is also perched between 'Desi' mind and 'Ultra-Mod' lifestyles and struggles on a daily and nightly basis. 3. Danny Boyle's suggestions have been optimally used. The journey of the Coke-infested DevD's mind is visual treat. As a movie fan, I feel the camera work and positioning sets the tone and gives 3-D like experience. 4.I want to share more of my thoughts with you, including some story lines which I think only you can put on the screen.",

            "review_title": "Not every film is required to entertain its audience, but every film must engage its viewers",
            "content": "Now that's a tall order when the film in question centers around the most boring, uni-dimensional character Indian literature could have possibly produced \u2013 the alcoholic, self-destructive romantic, Devdas. Add to that the fact that at least three Hindi films have already transported Devdas' tragic story to the screen.Still, director Anurag Kashyap's Dev D, is a fresh, original take on the subject and the characters, but it's also a long and tiresome film that is not for the fainthearted.Rooted in the real and the contemporary, Kashyap's film stars Abhay Deol as Dev, an aimless Benjamin Braddock-like drifter who returns home to Punjab after a graduation abroad, but has little in terms of future plans, except for getting into the sack with his childhood friend Paro, with whom he's spent many a long night talking dirty on the phone. On learning that she might have had a promiscuous past, Dev rejects Paro and her advances, driving her to marry a man she doesn't love, and landing himself in a downward spiral of booze and drugs and whores.Kashyap takes the basic structure of Sarat Chandra Chatterjee's original story, but in setting it in the now, updates much of the film's narrative, and makes the characters' actions and motivations more relatable. So you get a back-story to the Chanda character, the hooker Dev hooks up with in his desperate, despondent phase; and sex itself becomes the invisible but omnipresent motivation that drives many an important plot-point.In its first forty odd minutes Dev D sucks you into its drama, shocking you with its brazenness, and more specifically with Kashyap's audacious re-imagination of the plot and its characters.Take that scene in which Paro (played by newcomer Mahie Gill) sends for Dev to join her in a dense field so they can get down to doing what they've been unsuccessfully trying to do for some days. Watch the manner in which she virtually attacks a reluctant Dev into submission; and then the following scene in which she heads back home, mattress folded and tied on her cycle, after Dev spurns her overtures.Watch also the fantastic song Yeh meri zindagi hai and the inventive manner in which Kashyap uses it to introduce Lenny (played by newcomer Kalki Koechlin), the character who goes on to become Chanda.But from the moment Dev's descent into despair begins, the audience too plunges into what seems like a never-ending roller-coaster ride of loud clanging music, neon lights and head-spinning camera moves. Using music instead of dialogue is a unique and interesting narrative tool, but song-after-song-after-song-after-song your patience wears thin.The film's second half is indulgent and repetitive to the point of being excessive, as it focuses much of its attention on Chanda; and let down by a disappointing performance and stilted dialogue delivery by Koechlin, it never really regains the momentum or the sheer bravura of its early parts.In comparison to Koechlin, Mahie Gill makes a more assured debut as Paro, investing both vulnerability and a cocksure attitude into her character. But it's Abhay Deol who's the real scene-stealer, holding together the film with a fearless performance that is so rare to find.Despite the clever new approach and its stylish telling, the flaw that hurts the film ultimately, is the fact that Devdas is never an engaging enough character and his story lacks soul. Speaking purely for myself, I was bored watching him repeatedly drown himself in drink and drugs. Self destruction is never an attractive quality.I'm going with two out of five and an average rating for director Anurag Kashyap's Dev D. It's one of those films that's likely to either dazzle you or drain you. There is no middle option. Watch it, and decide for yourself.",

But what if someone is really on a confused path of self destruction? Well then you are a DevD. The film came to Anurag via Abhay when Abhay was in Las Vegas and heard the story of a regular Romeo who used to visit a strip club in vengeance of a lost relation. Anurag agreed almost instantly when Abhay proposed and the duo decided to film it with a modern tango of the \"Sarat Chandra\" classic \"devdas\". Anurag decided to use Punjab to set up the childhood context of Dev and Paro while shifting the youth to Pahargang in Delhi. Both turned out to be a great move as Paro here is a lady from the village. She is rustic yet sexually provocative. Dev retains the flavor of a rich US return man who is indeed driven by his desire of lust and his tall ego of the riches just adds to his long list of weakness. The result was that Paro dumps him as she saw no future in her relationship. Enter Chandra, when a school girl discovers her transition to adulthood and does a blunder of a mms that goes backfire and viral. A sorry state to be family disowned and hence finally shifts in underground escort services in Delhi. Chuni plays a role of a story catalyst and helps and disowns Dev as his needs. A parasite who plays his cards with the chemistry of Dev and Chandra and then just vanishes. The film was cult and a trend setter in camera work where Anurag used a point to shoot 11 frame camera imported from Amsterdam to shoot Dev's hallucinations while drunk. The \"twilights players\" are a real bunch who played cons as the story progressed. The song \"Saali Khushi\" was actually a mistaken take for \"Saari Khushi\" and the wrong take was finally selected for the punch. The story paces very fast as the film hits delhi and one can see Dev getting trapper more in the state of confusion of love and addictions. His destiny goes against him when he gets in a hit and run case and loses his rich father. Dev's final attempt to seek truth about his love takes him to the northern hills which sets the climax and his ground touch. Frustrated, weak, poor Dev takes a rebirth along the same old momo galli in delhi when Chandra rescues him. The sudden end of the film adds to end the loop that audience goes through and a clear depart from the classic. Anurag thankfully ends it on a high note and this is what the film stands out from the numerous prior devdas films. DevD for sure would remain one of the best works of Anurag and Abhay, no doubt this film is a collector's item and I am sure you dnt mind watching it again tonight. Just a word of caution Devdas is and will always be a looser. His sorry state of affairs make him a legend, so dnt take him too seriously. Just enjoy the film\".",

However I am glad that I did.This movie is no less, than any movie made by any of Hollywood's top Directors.It has rebooted the entire Devdas Genre, and given it an entirely new perspective. Shahrukh Khan's Devdas, just simply pales in comparison.The visuals in this movie are completely breathtaking. Raw as well as stylish. Completely blows your mind. Esp the shoots around Paharganj in Delhi. Plus the dizzy camera-work, that very often show a head-on perspective of Dev. The background score is also commendable.

The couple's breakoff is shown like any ordinary and real, then protagonist's emotional give up. Spoiler: He accepts the girl who is professional CSW, though she sleeps with many men. However, he couldn't accept the so-called homely girl, who had one sexual relationship in past! So true. Plot's flow is perfect, shown in three parts.I reduce my points on musical part of the movie. There are too much musical tracks in it. Well, the plot moves on during the tracks as well, but still. This brings lack of drama for characters. I quite dislike the movies, except they are \"musical\"( typical rom-com category with lot of tracks). May be this is done to add commercial value to the movie.",

Not only that, I think DevD has given a new meaning to Indian cinema and creativity.Hats off to Anurag Kashyap for making this in-your-face gutsy flick!As the promos state: it's a lust story (\"Come, fall in lust\") I do not want to say anything about the story here, because I don't want to spoil it for you. Just 2 words: \"mind-blowing\".It is \"loosely\" inspired from the story of Devdas (its characters and the storyline) - but this one is all fresh and new. It's based in Punjab - the characters are all contemporary and hilariously \"weird\" - weird because you don't expect such characters and dialogues in Bollywood movies. But, at the same time, you can very well relate to them.The acting by everyone is A-grade. Abhay Deol is brilliant in his best film so far, as the brash, arrogant and shameless brat who cares a damn about anyone. Both Mahie Gill and Kalki - play their parts of Paro and Chanda superbly. Their outspokenness and audacity is too cool. Not to forget everyone in the supporting cast (especially \"Chunni\") - they are all marvelous. I think a lot of credit for this goes to the director - he had the guts to make a movie which takes the so called Indian \"culture\" and the concept of \"love\", and turns them over their head. Dev D is indeed a cult film and I hope it inspires other directors to trash their formulae and think out-of-the-box.The music (Amit Trivedi) again is another star of the movie, (with no typical song-and-dance sequences) the songs carry on in the background, taking the story forward and depicting the characters state-of-mind. Cinematography is flawless. At 2.5 hrs, the movie is well-paced.To sum it up, a classic out-of-the-mainstream movie which will be remembered for years to come Watch it for its brazen and defiant attitude!",

The movie follows a pattern of few western movies like Romeo & Juliet and Macbeth (the new versions set in the modern world). I found both the above to be quite palatable.I would first commend the director for making this movie, just to show what the audiences can also expect from THE SAME OLD STORY! The story of Devdas, although quite an interesting piece of literature, would have worked great in the 90s, when showed in the same manner. But this is the 21st century & we would like some creativity in the movie.At the risk of being thrashed by a dear friend of mine, who is an ardent Madhuri fan, i have to say that her & Shahrukh's Devdas bored me to death! I found the whole portrayal so stupid, i couldn't have found a worse way to spend my time! The performances in the movie were excellent (except for Shahrukh, who is capable of doing much better work), but the script, the art direction & the locations were absolutely wasted for this era of films! SL Bhansali must understand that even theater needs creativity, lets not be monkeys!To come back to DevD, the movie was absolutely stunning from the point where i realized it was a remake of Devdas. Till then, I was lost, trying to understand why this movie was even made.Abhay Deol gives yet another great performance with his no-nonsense no- emotion acting. The non-Indian actress also gives a good performance, while Mahi Gill leaves a lot to be desired, including her wardrobe choice.The movie moves very fast (thankfully), brashly trashing unwanted parts of the original story & adapting itself to the current society. Most of all, the director tries to give it an enormous amount of accountability (by connecting it to current events) & making it interesting, but reflecting on the society through a historic story! That part is what i liked best! That also forms the premise of the remake, and the freshness endowed with such directorial angles makes the movie lively & bewitching!Bewitching, because although we hate some characters, although we hate some parts of the movie, it keeps us glued! As if, he director intended to bring out hate in us for some parts! That, I think is a class work of art!Another aspect of the movie which i wanted to discuss is the way viewers are kept sub-consciously confused and drawn into the movie. The art director uses a lot of high paced, loud sequences, which keep changing the environment in a jiffy. Although it creates a shock, it does not make the viewer lose interest at any point. The repetition of a few words, characters' names, incidents from current society; all of these mixed with trance music & dazzling colors & carefully choreographed scenery create an effect of a high!This, i think is the most important part of Devdas's story! The whole story is about a man in a trance, due to whatever reasons in life. Dev-D does justice to that aspect & hence portrays the story more realistically & in a more classy fashion than Bhansali's true-to-the- book version!",

The ambiance just worked perfectly, and the choice of cast was beyond brilliant. Deol has made a habit of working in the best movies of late. For a change, this is an Indian movie that is completely de-spiced and brought right back down to earth where the majority of the Indian populace finds itself. The debutante leading ladies do fabulously well, and the movie has this air of class about it..quite like a Tarantino flick. Regardless, Masand in his reviews for ibnlive criticizes Anurag kashyap's take on devdas. Masand is a mindless worshipper of icons and idols, and it wont be until kashyap has a temple named after him that Masand will consider pandering and kissing his ass.",

Abhay Deol--this man does know how 2 act;not a single bit of over-acting,viewer ll not be able 2 distinguish him with any other random characters in our daily life suffering from same syndrome. 2. Anurag Kashyap-- aw sum directing....no words suits for him. and finally 3. the treatment--this is the most interesting part of this stunning movie;dev d isn't at all a fast paced movie,but AK never let us feel the slow nature;the camera-work is exceptional ( reminding me of legendary requiem for a dream );and the base of the story is so much realistic that it ll surely give a blow 2 the viewers.the conflict between conventional,orthodox nature with modern,open-minded nature is well portrayed.the final realization of the main protagonist of this movie is the USP of DEV D....nothing more 2 say,DEV D is indeed a milestone in Hindi film history",

I don't know in-spite of it's raving reviews I underrated this movie when it is released.But one way it is good at that time I was inside \"emotional aatyachar\" so it wud have made me more emotional :PComing to the movie now... Wowwww is the first word.. I mean is it a bollywood movie? yes bollywood has moved a long way. Each scene and each character is crafted with thought, creativity and most importantly common sense (which is lacking in 99% of the directors in bollywood). Acting:- Hats off to Abhay Deol. i felt he really drank and took drugs.. superb acting. The beauty of acting is going with the character. First part of the movie we see an innocent, tom boy and a typical punjaban Mahi Gill and next a very mature married lady who comes to tell his ex-bf that she also has guts to remind the insult he did to her.That scene was superbNow finally coming to Chanda. Don't mind but the way Kalki acted I really thought she is a prostitute. It is very difficult to portrait a person , a lifestyle which u never lived. Both Mahi and Kalki dint look like that they are newcomersDirection and Screenplay:- Anurag has his own style and that is his trade mark. Nothing much to say about this genius but the scenes where he has shown Abhay fully in grip of drugs n alcohol with camera focusing on Abhay and background moving was awesomeMusic:- Finally here comes the most important part. Music in Dev D plays a very imp role, so imp that I will rather call this movie Dev D the musical. Each and every track is appropriate and different like the movie. I know it wud have been very difficult for Amit to deliver such a master piece. That is the reason why he got national award Bravo!!!All total it is an awesome experience to watch this movie. The one mark which I cut was because of the last part before the ending where Abhay is again shown drunk and deep inside drugs. I mean it cud have been edited. Though it is a very minor flaw which I cud find but all total this movie is an all time classic which redefines the style of movie making in India.",

Pretty good and realistic form of acting by Abhay proves his success story in Hindi Cinema after movies like OLLO, Ahista Ahista, Soch Na Tha... Mahie Gill does an awesome debut job as Paro and Kalki truly excels being Chanda. Dibyendu Bhattacharya being modern \"Chunni\" did fine work ... much better than Jackie Shroff in 2002.Fast moving camera angles just along with face of Abhay Deol in few scenes tells the story of hard work behind the screen by DOP. Color Scheme is simply great.Direction is something that kept the pace of the story. Anurag Kashyap's genre of movies are not so likable by general commercial audience in India but the message he delivers just proves every commercial film critic wrong.Music & Background Score...the heart of the movie... Amit Trivedi outstands even the giants of Indian Cinema like Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy & Vishal Shekhar & Salim-Suleiman. Sudden techno to funk to folk and back to techno and then to rock...really makes you fall in love with the music...Dance and Cam performances by \"The Twilight Players\" from the UK will surely blow your mind (even the trailers tell the dance story).Overall, the movie is simply awesome..Deserving 10/10...",

But then Dev.D being the same story is somehow believable (may be because of some real life incidents).The performance given by all the actors is just brilliant. You just cannot ignore the hard work put in by Abhay Deol. Mahie Gill as a typical Punjabi girl was excellent. I don't think any known actress could have done this role.I had doubts about the other new girl, Kalki. I don't know but it was hard to imagine her as chanda. She looks so young and na\u00efve, but the director didn't make the mistake of not showing her background. This was the sole reason that she fits in the role.Dialogs were amazing specially the ones given to Abhay and Kalki. Direction and camera were amazing. Music was just awesome, suited each and every part of the movie. Whether the marriage song (Emotional Atayachaar) or the rock songs in the second half.The only thing which I didn't like about the movie was the length of the movie.

The movie is an grim reflection of a man spiralling into a sea of booze and drugs and repeated bender trips after a fallout with his childhood sweetheart. While on the surface the movie deals with issues of a break-up and the consequent self-deprecating addiction-fuelled journey, the larger issue of the movie deals with the protagonist's narcissistic personality. Throughout the movie this point is driven home repeatedly as we see that Dev spurning away people whenever his ego is threatened. There are many instances of Dev seeking to gratify himself through others, be it his family, or Paro, or even Chanda, which becomes evident when Chanda says to Dev, \"You can't love anyone, just accept it.\"The film was long yet it was beautifully woven together and struck the perfect balance between a gripping story without going overboard with the theatrics. Anurag Kashyap provides brilliant direction, coupled with a whacky soundtrack by Amit Trivedi and an absolutely fantastic acting by Abhay Deol. There is a lot of symbolism in the movie meshed along with the headlines prevalent during those days, yet the rendition of the movie remains relevant even after a decade since it was made, making it well-deserved to be a timeless masterpiece of Indian Cinema.The only thing which was similar to a mainstream Bollywood movie was the ending, which was somewhat made to appeal to the larger audience and leave a more hopeful chance at redemption for what seems like a complete mayhem of a person. In real life though, that redemption is rarely found for people like Dev.",

I was damn sure, this was gonna be a helluva ride. And it was much much more than that. It was\u0085.. hmmm.. Read on.From where the hell should I start. The film begins with the clash of Dev and Paro. They flirt, dirty talk, make out but just before the finale the misunderstandings trigger their arrogance, temper and egos. They just hit off each other. Sparks fly here and there. And after finally bad mouthing each other they settle and decide to move on. But for Dev, the emotional Atyachaar has just begun. And then, as the age old story of Devdas goes, he drowns himself in booze, dope which finally leads to self destruction.The main 'attraction' of the movie was indeed 'Emosional Atyachaar'. And what a song. And what a 'music video' !! Patna ke Presleys kick start the song with sheer retro/whacky brilliance. Paro cuts loose on the dance floor, and apna Dev boozing to the brim vomits, then trying to walk up to Paro collapses. Whoa!!! I just cant stop gushing. EA was an event!!!!!Coming back to the movie,The detailing is phenomenal, the dialogue, the graffiti, the camera, a \"real\" Punjabi wedding, the abuse, the bong, the drugs,the momos,the brothels ,the black goggles and even the sex everything is so well placed and thought of that you just cant stop ur self from standing up and giving AK a bow for this work.The movie's progress was totally guided/dictated by the songs. The lovely rustic flavored Dhol Yara Dhol introduces to the world of Paro. The free spirited Yehi meri Zindagi takes us through Chanda's back story. Pardesi plays during Abhay's first real 'trip' in an underground pub. Look out for the Dev's dip in water and the visuals that follow. The movies from the west have used it often, but to see it on the Indian screen was a treat. The three break dancing dudes stuff was pure insane brilliance. Also look out for the three dudes when they sing Saali khushi. Hilarious!!!!Casting is another high point here, with ABHAY standing tall and Mahi,she was just as raw as the character wanted her to be( I wonder if a director ever before dared to show what testosterone charged young lovers talk on phone like the brilliant \"have u touched yourself?\" in the starting scene ,couldn't stop smiling).But that kick which we all aspire in life and mostly while boozing and doping, is here delivered by the intoxicating visuals which follow the glass break on the wall. EA rock version plays in the background and hits you like a snort of coke (just imagining..). It was a roller coaster ride.After I left the hall I couldn't find a word to describe it. I was just needing somebody who could ask me how was the movie and I could say \" awesome\". Luckily when I reached home my brother asked me how was it???..............",

            "content": "This film was absolutely breathtaking. It showed so much reality and how the world has corrupted in modern days, yet still enabling the audience to empathise with the characters. I have never felt compelled to write a review of a movie before, but I felt that this movie has opened a new door for bollywood, and that I need to help keep that door open. This is not a family movie, there is explicit language, sexual innuendos, drugs and drinks, and fairly vivid imagery. Though there are these things, they only help add to the overall image of creating a very realistic movie that does not censor what life has become.The story follows the characters: Dev, Paro,and Chanda. The main character (obvious by the title of the film) is Dev, who is lost when it comes to recognising (or feeling?) love until it has passed. He is a spoilt rich boy, who takes everything for granted, and is constantly trying to blot out his feelings of regret, by binging on alcohol and O.D'ing on drugs. Though Dev can be fairly annoying, for me as part of the audience I felt I could empathise on his feeling of lostness and helplessness. The music fits very well with the film creating the perfect atmosphere to all of the scenes. The camera work is magnificent and the colours which are so bright and beautiful make you want to pause and just stare at them. The colours in contrast to the story itself is an oxymoron which is cleverly portrayed. Hats off to whoever thought of that idea. I am not going to say more.. I highly recommend this movie to anyone(not a child though) who does not hide from the truth and enjoys uncensored films that are not made to replicate other films to please the general audience.",

I loved that trippy camera work, and if you were wondering why there was a thanks to Danny Boyle in numbering.. he helped anurag to get special camera for those trippy scenes. What impresses me is anurag didn't copy a Hollywood movie, with his kind of camera work I'm sure he can do just to any of the top notch Holly-Movie, But instead he went with his gut feeling and chooses contemporary Devdas. This shows how much creativity he has in his blood,and not to forget his talented crew.All guys were spot on.I deeply believed they unleashed Indian cinema from the shackles these commercially sell out directors have created.This movie is a landmark in our entertainment industry, and I'm hoping our youth directors to imbibe a lot from this piece of art. We all consciously or unconsciously craving to see some life on screen, and that's exactly what this movie gave us.This movie has everything to be the first cult movie of our industry.",

            "review_title": "Too good",
            "content": "When I first saw Dev D, I was a little put off by the rawness, the realness of the movie. But when I watched it again (and again\u0085) I realized that this was a great movie. Not just because it's a different take on the old Devdas story, but because it is one film which puts a spotlight on women's sexuality and the uneasiness of most men (and society) with it. And for that I salute Anurag Kashyap for bringing in front of us a movie which actually depicts this hypocritical attitude both subtly (Dev and PAro) and in an in-your-face style (Chanda). When Dev overhears two assholes talking in typical locker room boasting about how one of them had sex with Paro, he breaks up with her in a frenzy of disgust and humiliates her by spurning her advances and listing all her shortcomings as offensively as he can. When I first saw it, I was pretty disgusted, I mean they knew each other from childhood and they chatted and all it took was one measly slanderous conversation to completely change his opinion of her? But when I saw it the second time, I realized that Dev and Paro's attitude towards sex is completely different. When Paro sends the topless photo of herself to Dev, when she gives herself over to his love making \u2013 for her, it's all about giving herself to the man she loves. But Dev? Deep down, he cannot help but feel that a pure woman would not let him do these things to her, that maybe her boldness with him means that she may be just as bold with others. He does not see that her boldness with him is her freedom with him, that she believes that they love each other, will marry each other and that is why she permits him liberties with her person. It's all about the girl you have the fun with and the girl you bring home to see your parents \u2013 in the minds of most men, they are not the same girl. The guy who goes around with a lot of girls is a rake, a PLAYA, but a girl who does the same is a sl** and cheap, and as such it is permissible to use and discard her without regarding her feelings and emotions. In Chanda's case, she was betrayed by the guy she was with, who posted the video of her online. SHE is the victim, SHE is a school kid for God's sake, she made a mistake, all teens do. But the attitude of people around her \u2013 if it was a guy who had been caught on camera, no one would have said a word, but because it's a girl doing something privately with a guy whom she is in love with, it's like she's evil incarnate the way they try to shame her. Like she says, her name was never mentioned anywhere, but everyone knew who she was, publicly denouncing her while privately getting off on the clip. Hypocritical. While Paro wrecks vengeance on her accusers and promptly marries someone else, Chanda becomes a prostitute and decides to make men pay for what they need. Both women are strong characters who fight back whatever way they can. As for Dev, he's a brat, immature and not really likable, his whole descent into drinking and self-destruction is self-indulgent to say the least. But he does grow and by the end while he's not all that endearing, he's grown up enough that I couldn't help but have a faint respect for him in the end. Dev D is a great movie. Not perfect, mind you, but great. The acting is brilliant, especially Abhay Deol who never tried to soften his portrayal of Dev, but still conveys each layer of change in his character's mentality. The direction was great, the music loud \u2013 maybe too loud sometimes \u2013 but setting the mood to perfection. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a story with flawed characters and feminist themes.",
