            "content": "It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since \"3 Idiots\" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I don't want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee you'll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film.",

It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been \"The Legend of Rancho\".Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak \"Spanglish\" here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one!",

The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show.\nThe editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec.

That life is not actually a race; reveals that this is imposed on us by the education system. Rancho, our character who opposes the order at every opportunity, cannot make sense of not talking about new ideas but grades at schools. Because he goes to school to learn, not for a diploma, he gives importance to knowing the meaning, not memorizing, he does not say \"what I learn at school stays at school\", he applies what he learns in daily life. The secret of its success; Reading the part he is passionate about.",

Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned.",

But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch.",

            "review_title": "Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection",
            "content": "\"All is well,\" the three \"idiot\" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call \"Virus\" when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldn't dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project he's work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. I've read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. You're given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of \"living through a person\" that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film I've conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I can't see it being a struggle to get through any of the industry's films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.",

This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it..\" \"Chase Excellence and success will follow\".. \" Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams\".. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldn't get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel ' Five Point Someone ' by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Film's music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hirani's screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khan's finest film to date.. The film's climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...My Rating: 9/10Thanks and Regards",

It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.The 3 idiots of the title meet as engineering students, become life-long friends but are separated by that old fickle finger of fate. It's also bold enough to deal with such issues as suicide and poverty and, of course, the caste system and is lifted onto an altogether higher plain by a terrific performance from Aamir Khan as 'the idiot' the other two worship and who, naturally, isn't an idiot at all but the sharpest tool in the box and he's brilliantly supported by Sharman Joshi as his potentially suicidal friend and Omi Vaidya as his number one rival. Brilliantly directed by Rajkumar Hirani this is the kind of film Hollywood could learn a lot from and which, had it been a Hollywood film, might well have swept the boards come Oscar time.",

            "content": "I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.",

Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them.

As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 !

Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.Aamir Khan is a potent anchor for the story of three college friends attending the Imperial College of Engineering, and Rancho's ideas about success don't revolve around getting the best grades but actually learning something. I could see somebody like a younger Matthew Perry performing the role if this was an American film. I wasn't really expecting as much in the way of music from this story, but with the amount of song and dance you could almost call it a musical. The 'Zoobi Doobi' dance number was quite infectious and looked like a lot of fun.Another thing that keeps you engaged is the non-linear story telling technique. But the thing is, you never really get confused when the time line changes from ten years ago to present day. With all the humorous situations presented, this could have easily fallen into slapstick, and it did get close at times, but then the story pulled back with a poignant message or a sobering decision one of the characters had to make. Story threads are tied up that one forgets along the way and that's another cool element. I just thought it was a uniquely creative film with a neat twist at the end with the identity of Rancho. There's even a romance thrown in for our principal player, and when it was over, I had the feeling that this is what \"La La Land\" could have been but never came close.",

            "content": "This particular movie is my most favorite movie of all times. I don't even know where to start with. I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.Rajkumar Hirani has always addressed a certain issue and/or has boldly hit many lame principles and ethics of the society with a perfect satire. In this movie, it's about the cliched belief that if you're a science student, then it has to be either medical science or engineering if you want to get successful. In the real world, many people have been a victim of this belief and have wasted their life. Had they not been brainwashed by the society, they would've had a better life. That's what the movie justifies and as per my experience, it makes a whole lot of sense. Another thing is, you need to worry about excellence. If you are excellent, the good grades are almost obvious. And in the end it's your excellence that matters, not the grades.Hirani tells the story in his own unique way. Just like in every single one of his movies so far, he crancks up everything to 11 to make sure that his point has reached to the audiences' mind. Many of those cranck ups do not make sense in real life, but that does not even matter because the movie doesn't want that particular cranck up to be relatable. But it does want whatever that cranck up tries to tell to be relatable. And it succeeds in that. And whether or not it makes sense or not, you'll get the point and a great dose of laughter. And there are some of the sequences which are just hilarious and over the top, and are meant just for the sake of laughter. The characters are very likable and quite different from one another. Each of them are a representative of the kind of people there are in the society and in the academic field.The movie doesn't make all kind of sense if you look at it quite literally. Even I would say it's quite nonsensical if I am to look at it literally. But it's meant to be looked at literally. Many scenes are mere representation of something else that the story wants us to know. With that regards, it's pretty good. Even if you watch it at the face value, you won't be bored at all. There will be a build up to something, and the final result will be exactly the opposite of what you expected and that will make you laugh a lot.The songs are pretty good. They aren't the strongest part of the movie by a long shot, but are still popular than many recent Bollywood songs. It's strange that a late 2000s movie had songs which are still popular. Every single actor have given their best performance till date.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+",

The movie is terrifically funny and engaging, seamlessly moving from comedy to tragedy to musical numbers.The story centers around a brilliant, iconoclastic technical student who spends the movie telling people to follow their dreams. While generally lighthearted, the movie strongly addresses the apparently terrible stresses on Indian college students. But in spite of some dark movies, overall this is about as feel-good as you can get. Feel-good to an absurd degree? Sure. But what's so bad about feeling good?When I think of Bollywood I think of big musical numbers, and there are a handful here, although they're a tiny part of the three-hour running time.

I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharman's family. A typical 1950's family, it's hilarious as well as genius.The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. He's a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, he's astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with 'All Izz Well' being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now...",

            "content": "In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clich\u00e9s, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film.",

Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success \u2013 that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : \"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma\u2014which is living with the results of other people's thinking.\" \"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.\" Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it.",

I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, it's all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before it's too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Don't let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. You'll bless me for this advice !",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: 3 Idiots",
            "content": "When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.Set predominantly in the varsity days and told in chunks of flashback, this film will allow you to reminisce about a time where life was nothing but exams, lectures, and that paper chase, either making the grade or having to repeat. But there's also probably that one person, or a few if you're lucky, whom you'll meet on campus that will help you directly or indirectly, shape your outlook, thinking and just about forming long lasting bonds, whose interaction with will shape your character just before entering the workforce.3 Idiots tell of such a friendship, amongst 3 buddies Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi), two mediocre students who just scrape through, and the one huge influence in their lives, ace student Rancho (Aamir Khan), the livewire of the trio who irks the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering (modelled after the famed Indian Institute of Technology), Professor Viru (Virus), played by Boman Irani. In fact, it's something like a Hindi equivalent of the local I Not Stupid with its critique on the educational system, but done with a lot more finesse, fun and without sledgehammering its ideals down your throat.The gist of the disparity here is the concept of learning how to learn, or teaching somebody how to fish compared to just giving the students the fish. It's a reminder that knowledge gathering goes beyond just doing so for exams, and the techniques of blindly cramming will do one not much good later on. It's about the application of knowledge for the real world than to answer papers, and the joy of acquiring such knowledge. It's the 3 Idiots versus the Professor, and their peer Chatur \"Silencer\" (Omi Vaidya who played the role with glee, as the peer bootlicker that everyone loves to hate) who throws down the gauntlet to Rancho as to who will eventually be the more successful of the lot.What made 3 Idiots work remarkably, is the excellent chemistry between the leads. Aamir Khan, the big name as he is, doesn't upstage his co-stars R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, as their characters get into various forms of shenanigans in college. Instead they complement one another in their roles, and thanks to makeup, look very much comfortable as their aged selves, and their younger teenage ones through closely cropped hair, and outfits. Aamir aces the role of Rancho as the boy who gets ahead of the pack without really trying and at times being perceived as both the smarty pants and the troublemaker of his cohort, though his sudden disappearance after graduation has made his good friends try to track him down, albeit unsuccessfully. The film also doesn't take itself too seriously when the time calls for it, switching quite playfully to ramp up its funny moments, even at times breaking the fourth wall when telling the story of Raju's background (in black and white melodrama no less). The jokes here worked wonders as well, as do the couple of twists that roll along in the 2nd act after the interval, which is somewhat telling of the narrative depth that the film possessed. Songs were breezy and plenty of fun, and I personally enjoyed Aal Izz Well (All Is Well) best, a chant that the Idiots adopted from Rancho, who uses it to calm his heart when it's filled with anxiety and fear. I think it works.Affairs of the heart though are kept at a bare minimum, when Rancho falls for the daughter of Professor Viru, Pia (Kareena Kapoor). While they start off in quite testy terms, things start to thaw when Pia sees Rancho for who he is, except that the secret Rancho keeps threatens to keep them permanently apart. And that is unless the other 2 pals could help it in their quest to locate Rancho. Everything falls into place at the end, especially telling of the second act when you learn of this secret at the cliffhanger prior to the interval, and this provides yet another emotional sucker punch to your gut when themes like friendship lasting forever starts entering the picture.Chase excellence and success will follow; this film lived up to that tagline in being one of the most excellent I've watched this year. Amongst all the film offerings put out this festive season, my choice for the most uplifting, the most hopeful and a jolly entertaining ride all around with elements of everything only a Bollywood film is renowned for, is this one. Don't miss it, and it goes directly, albeit a late entry, as a contender for my top films of the year!",

Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena & Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman & Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we don't want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why he's one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. He's perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy who's chasing his father's dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and it's ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because he's so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. He's that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Clich\u00e9 word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Don't forget to say 'Aal Izz Well'",

            "content": "One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I don't know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is \"I don't watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks,\" discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why?\u00a0 Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised it's only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think that's one of the reason why it's so successful - their easy chemistry.\u00a0 The 3 characters' arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didn't only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc.\u00a0 In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasn't preachy. It didn't need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neo's I'm Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back.\u00a0 The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie.\u00a0 Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhan's version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know that's the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end.\u00a0 The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Mona's baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again ('death' of baby) and to the closing metaphor of \"All Izz Well\". Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the \"All Izz Well\" metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didn't end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didn't the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasn't totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end?\u00a0 I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didn't feel right for me.\u00a0 But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph.",

However, I've found it to be very engaging and entertaining.In this film, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi want to re-unite with college friend Rancho and recounted their college days at New Delhi's Imperial College of Engineering, recalling the memories of Rancho, who inspired them to think differently, their run-ins with the fiery college dean Viru Sahastrabudhe and their encounters with another student, Chatur Ramalingam, who reminds them of a bet they had made 10 years ago.This is the first and only Bollywood movie I have seen and while I am not a big fan of drama, Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi wrote a very inspiring story for the film that kept me entertained, covering friendship, sacrifices, relationships, antics, secrets, rivalries and struggles in the movie. Hirani took good care making each scene of the movie captivating and intriguing while directing, keeping the plot's momentum going strong even for a three-hour movie, and assembled a likable cast of characters - each delivering solid performances.I enjoyed watching the antics and misadventures the three friends go through during their college days, fumbling through exam notes and cramming in science projects, striving to reach success. Rancho's little romantic relationship with Pia is also a treat to watch, ***minor spoiler ahead*** especially when, unbeknown-st to Rancho, that she is the daughter of the dean. ***minor spoiler ends*** The songs sung in the film is wonderful to listen to - very catchy and fun - and the cinematography is very vibrant and colorful.Overall, it is a very captivating and heartfelt film from start to finish, sure to bring you laughter and tears.

The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I can't help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the dean's daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider today's modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of \"do what you can,\" or \"you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love\". And let's not forget the common contemporary comedy message \"have fun and worry about the consequences later.\" These messages make sense in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years don't have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if you're not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, you're legally dead.Those who are worried about China's looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle it'd be India. It's a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. It's got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But don't lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",

You know, eveyone bursts into dance in the middle of the film and the good guys beating up the bad guys with super hero powers. Or the cheese plots of the poor boy marrying the rich girl... Well Hirani's directing totally shifted my views not only on Indian cinema but also helped me understand and appraciate Indian culture. For me it was easy to relate with the struggles of the charecters to face their family's plans for them as well as to survive the rat race that our lives have turned into, in spite of the fact that I have no asian background. Hirani manages to make a serious case by using explicit humor which makes the movie a real masterpiece.",

The film itself lacks direction and the story tries to tackle too many issues, each of which are poorly and superficially handled. It is easy to notice that the film tries to be another 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.'. While some of the jokes are funny, most of them are ripped off from unacknowledged sources (mostly European commercials). I suppose it's become a new trend in Bollywood to rip off old and obscure commercials since the writer lacks an original idea. The songs are easy on the ears but forgettable. Aamir Khan is miscast. He is too old for the part and does not convince at all as a university student. Madhavan too looks old for his part but not as poorly cast as Aamir. Sharman Joshi may look the part but he does overact. Boman Irani is irritating and Kareena Kapoor is strictly average. I'm surprised that so many people are calling this the best movie of the decade. '3 Idiots' is bad.",

I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing \"All iz well..\" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated.

It's so well-written and performed that the time flew. The mix of savvy and silly adds up to a joyful package. The smattering of musical numbers kept the fun going somewhat more smoothly than has often been the case. The early conflicts hilariously established characters, setting up the rest. Several moments elicited more tears than I would have wanted others to see leaking from my orbs. The script builds to several terrific callbacks.

            "content": "As you can see, I'm a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, I'm completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. What's even worse, I've run out of American movies to watch since I've basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those \"silly\" comedies. However, my friend's non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy \"idiots\" started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend they've lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldn't allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the student's suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the director's daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Rancho's intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.Overall, it's really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, it's a lot more than that. It's more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears can't help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10.",

This is a global phenomenon and this is a great movie to watch early in your lifetime. I am not 20 or so, but it still taught me a thing or two and allowed me to objectively assess my situation in my work. I loved it. Humor is there in large doses, the scenery and landscapes are amazing and the movie is optimistic but also realistic at points. There are moments in the movie when you're laughing and in an instant you may find yourself crying. It was long but justified to be and it was never tiring, not at any point during the film.

And since brushing through the comments, I found a lot of good stuff written about it, I'd like to skip over the brownie points the film certainly deserves and focus on what I found so\u0085disappointing.1) sigh, the jokes\u0085what to say, I actually felt embarrassed listening to them and hear people guffaw on stuff that evoked chuckles in the 70s. 2) over the top scenes which were just not required- Rancho taking a bath in the garden(!) in front of everyone? In most good institutes even walking on the grass is frowned upon\u0085n here this chap doesn't mind spoiling the soil with his soapy water. (This is what annoys me about characters portrayed as non-conformists. They confuse it with plain indecency and ludicrousness, like when Patch Adams bared his bottom after getting his degree); n driving the scooter into the hospital itself\u0085why couldn't he just stop at the doorway n make it a genuinely good shot??? 3) The timeline was all wrong; did no one do math at primary school? Farhan says they hadn't seen rancho for 5 yrs\u0085ramalingam returns after 10 yrs to keep the bet\u0085no one saw rancho after college finished\u0085engineering is 4 yrs\u0085the bet could not have been made before the second semester as they already have had at least one semester exams!!! Simple math will tell you its all goofed up. Kareena kapoor was engaged when these guys were in 1st-2nd year\u0085so she waited 8 years to get married??? If that banker guy was so considerate and patient, he is the real hero 4) Anybody who has lived in hostel with room mates will tell you that in 4 yrs together, you get to know every minute detail about you buddies; these guys didn't even know rancho's hometown! 5) And these supposedly bright engineers and the doctor Kareena don't have even enough brains to look up the college records to find Rancho's address? They could have at least asked Boman Irani, who would have certainly known it considering he knew Chachad's monthly income! 6) Even with that lame, copied joke 'Do you know who I am', they are just ridiculing their own film; is it so difficult for a professor to find three students of a class whose faces he has seen from the college records? A cheeky antic like that would have meant instant suspension in a real IIT. 7) Hirani's idea of ragging is based on the fairy tales boys brag to wide-eyed fifth-graders; you just cant survive in a hostel if you electrocute a senior's winkie on you first day. I'd have loved it had they shown Rancho getting a beating from seniors in return for his actions\u0085it would have truly highlighted the ragging problem. Instead they showed the whole bunch of seniors running scared on seeing a baby-faced fresher with a live wire. 8) And oh, they took the peeing joke too far, too many times\u0085its disgusting. Ramalingam, a VP of some MNC peeing on a school building? Come on\u0085 9) I understand that the ridiculous arrangement barred Rancho from keeping in touch with any student from ICS\u0085but what about Kareena? Was his love so shallow he didn't give a damn about her just to honor some crazy vow which didn't even involve her? How are they showing Indian women? She has no self-respect? She runs away from her wedding, betraying a guy who waited 10 years for her to a guy who left her in a heartbeat? And is it unnatural or materialistic to scream if someone spoils your 2 lac wedding dress or loses a 3 lac watch??? Again the problem with execution of an idea; there were a thousand better ways to expose that guy's shallowness\u0085but all what rancho and his pals did was irritate him by damaging his property. 10) And the law breaking, which when done with timing looks good was just taken too far\u0085getting an international flight stopped, fooling a taxi driver who'd probably lose his job, leaking university paper- they are criminal offenses-why do you need to portray new age thinking with a disdain for the law? 11) And finally even if we forget the fact that any decent college has a medical attendant, a health centre and generators always present to accord a movie a spicy climax, hirani spoilt it with the all-is-well clich\u00e9. Cant just one thing be normal?",

I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani.

But 3 idiots is intriguing enough to shatter my bias. Character building is successful enough to make the three idiots, Pia, Virus and even Chatur seems authentic and attractive to me. I love the bright, joyful color of a school comedy that lightens up the mood before the characters even appears. Twists and turns in this movie is so cleverly arranged that the excitement they creates are perfectly maintained by the next. Rancho, the legendary guy, happens to leak his whereabouts when Chatur declares victory over the other 2 idiots, and they happen to seize the opportunity to make the real Rancho spill the shameful truth, and Pia happens to get married at the same day, so they can restore the poetic justice for Rancho/Wangdo and embrace the perfect ending. Along with the genius student character that challenge the virus and seniors and get away with it, the audience's expectation for this older Rancho climbs to the peak when the car reaches his school, so that the final enlightenment of his true identity push the satisfaction to a climax. The screenplay writer must be a genius.Actors for the the main roles are also outstanding. There lively expression break the leash of staid Indian faces in our perception. Also I was a little disappointed by the first appearance of Rancho, this extraordinary actor present the image of a genius student and a successful scientist. The one point that touches me the most is their tears, which cooperate with their sincere glittering eyes and pretty smiles. Every time when I am about to leap out of the drama because of the \"I will stay here until your dad gets well\"clich\u00e9, I am pulled back by their facial expressions. Pia is beautiful and attractive all right, also I don't understand why she attempted to married the price tag after dumping him once. Is it really that important for a Indian woman to get married? Virus is ugly and ridiculous with his huge big belly, I started to like him after he offered Rancho his pen unwillingly after he saved his daughter. He was an ossified elitism asshole until I detected his unyielding love for Mona and his deceased son.After all, it's a brilliant piece. Love it, 8 stars",

One student, Rancho, quickly makes a name for himself as the student who walks the other way and makes enemies of the schools head, Virus as he tries to enlighten his fellow students Raju and Farhan. While not familiar with Bollywood films, I am familiar with the genres staples, and they are here, including musical numbers, lots of melodrama, and lots of crying. Yes, there is cheese here, but it's a well done film. The characters are enjoyable and the story is wonderfully told. Behind it are issues that, while laid in an after school special kind of way, are very serious. Suicide is even covered here, and it is not handled in a comedic fashion. These issues are taken very seriously and it is the heart of the film. The acting is mostly responsible here for the success of this film, relying on the combined goofiness and drama of the three primaries. I can't say that the film isn't predictable, though there are several shocking moments. But, even with it's predictability, the cast is so charming that it's just something you can sit back and enjoy. I suppose I wasn't expecting much going in, and at a running time of almost 3 hrs. (something very a-typical for this kind of film), you might think you'd get worn down. But this is a very enjoyable film. Yes, it goes to some very silly places and even seems awkward at times, but by the end, you can't help but smile. Can say I am honestly pleased I took the journey.",

And I know I often watch a movie then rate it with a 5/10 , then rumble about it's flaws.. But, sometimes there is just something that you \"love\" and in it the flaws are minimized and overlooked. So it is with this movie for me. I love love love how inspiring it is. And how it can bring the emotions out of you. Make you connect and feel with the characters! This is simply amazing! Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special. A must watch. It starts a bit slow.. but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome! The cast in this movie is perfect! Amir, his friends, the teacher , the girl. Just perfect. And really the girl was an important role to cast and she is such a good choice! Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. It's not about how well you act, it's how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie! Different from Hollywood, very refreshing!Real rating: 9.35",

            "content": "Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots is generally a rather entertaining comedy, but as a film it is only partially successful. Though it does have its moments, it never really manages to completely deliver and lacks the power to enthrall. It mostly works as a senseless comic ride and only occasionally does it convince when it tries to convey a message. The film is quite messy in presentation, and it is a tiresome task to follow the proceedings as every now and then the story moves confusingly between past flashbacks and present developments. The movie is good in many ways, and at times it's very funny, but it is the overall product which is faulty. The dialogue is for the most part excellent, so is the visual style, but then, the script lacks focus. While Hirani's direction is quite smart and creative at times, he often tries to include too many elements, and, as a result, the movie often seems to go nowhere. The humour wavers between witty moments of hilarity and cheap, unoriginal gags. And then we also have poor sequences of overdone melodrama and manipulative sentimentality, which are incorporated rather forcibly into the movie and they really fall flat. The entire birth sequence, for one, is one hell of a clich\u00e9. So is the ending, which is sugarcoated to the max. Where acting goes, the one who does the best--and probably the only great--job is definitely Boman Irani, who is simply hilarious as the lisping, authoritarian college professor. Aamir Khan looks younger than his actual age but is still too old for his role. Acting-wise, he's just ordinary and offers nothing particularly impressive. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi are given little scope and only few short episodes here and there for themselves so that they don't end up unsatisfied from taking part in this film. They do reasonably well, but Joshi is made to cry far too much, and it really gets on one's nerves. Now who's left? Oh, Kareena Kapoor! Well, she is pretty but she is given a thankless blink-and-miss part which is neither significant nor demanding. That said, though she is hardly there, she does well when she is and her presence is pleasant. The songs are quite catchy and fun, but none of them is particularly memorable. \"Zuby Duby\", however, is superbly visualised and is enjoyable enough. Overall then, 3 idiots is an okay film at best which is flawed and terribly overrated, but in all fairness, it is reasonably enjoyable and may provide decent Hindi entertainment for the entire family. According to me, it is worth nothing more than a one-time watch.",

This being a Bollywood film, obviously has a smattering of romance and song and dance sequences.

Some cheeky guy this is! Unfortunately, all his antics and funny lines are as old as the college building he is in. You would have heard these jokes a hundred times over. Anyways, that is the best part of the film since it at least elicits a few laughs. The rest of the 3 hours is filled with stereotypes and melodramatic scenes which are ridiculous at best. It seems that these days in India, anyone who can make the audience cry can laugh all the way to the bank. Aamir has this knowledge and isn't afraid to use it.",

            "review_title": "Good, not outstanding",
            "content": "3 Idiots is definitely an over-hyped good movie. A lot of expectations were associated with the movie since it was going to come from Raju Hirani, the Munnabhai director and Aamir Khan, the perfectionist actor (and producer and director). Definitely the movie is a good one but it falls short of the pre-release expectations. It is a nice timepass as the entertainment value is quite high. The inherent message for the youth to pursue their passion instead of joining the rat race is also exemplary. However, giving a second look to the movie (after the laughters and the first time euphoria have calmed down), several flaws can be seen very easily in the storyline as well as the treatment. Loosely inspired by the novel Five Point Someone, the movie has shown the lead characters as black or white instead of grey, the real life ones. The director has played with the characters as puppets in his hands instead of allowing them to develop normally. The best example is of Chatur (played excellently by the hitherto less known actor Omi). The movie has exaggerated several things and the biggest drawback of the movie in my opinion is that the storyteller challenges the intelligence of the viewers at several places. There are several incidents in the movie totally indigestible for a sensible viewer. Perhaps Raju Hirani conveniently overlooked the fact that his audience is not the David Dhawan's audience who is expected to leave the brains at home before leaving for the theatre.3 Idiots (even the name is not appropriate), falters at many points and on many counts. However taking the plus points first, it is recommended as a good comedy successful in making you laugh. Further the music is good and hummable. The song about the character of Rancho played with the titles is quite meaningful and melodious. Choreography is quite good. The performances are excellent right from Aamir Khan to the actors getting the lowest footage in the movie. The message for the students to give precedence to knowledge over marks and follow their passion is definitely admirable. The movie impresses and moves the viewer deeply at certain places. It does not give you a chance to identify its loopholes and weaknesses while viewing it for the first time. Very entertaining and gripping indeed.But the minus points are too many to categorise the movie as an outstanding (which has been unjustifiably done by several established reviewers). It is necessary (and relatively easy too) to differentiate between an outstanding movie and a good movie. 3 Idiots is good, not outstanding. It is flawed, not flawless. Making fun of a dedicated student (even when he is a book-worm) is not proper, nor is it to blame the head of an institution for a pressurised student's suicide (and an ignorant father for his non-communicative son's suicide). Suicide cannot be given precedence over communication of your anguish and pains. It cannot be glamorised as well. Showing the head of the college as doing ridiculous things just to make fun of him or portray him in bad light is also not a commendable thing. A scientist with 400 patents being so unknown and unidentified and a girl not marrying for ten years, yet not making any meaningful (and successful) effort to search for her lost love, besides males playing midwives and managing childbirth with the help of a vacuum-cleaner are a few among several irritating things shown in the movie. Rancho's distorting the speech written in Roman for Chatur and making him a laughing stock just because of his lack of proper knowledge of Hindi language cannot be justified either.Even on the laughter dimension, the movie is not a perfect one. Showing the male students time and again in the toilet or pointing at their asses looks disgusting after the first time. The excessive use of the word - balatkar (rape) does not allow the movie to be watched comfortably with all the family members. Does the moviemaker want the children (because the movie has been given a U certificate by the Indian Censor Board) to know the meaning of balatkar (rape) before the proper age ?Raju Hirani had impressed the Indian audience with his close-to-heart Munnabhai movies. However in this movie, he has not succeeded in living upto his reputation and the pre-release hype of the movie. The movie is excellent in parts only. It's irritating at many places. Overall it is good. It could have been a better one by all means.",

            "content": "3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Rancho's dad's monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didn't they check the college register?Now for some serious ones.I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in \"Chak de India\" you couldn't find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, it's his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chatur's switched speech. Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Rancho's character. I think the writers mixed up Aamir's earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from \"Rang de Basanti\" would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a \"demo\". Rancho is pure, or at least that's what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.______________________Now, here's what I would have changed if I was in control.* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any \"pressure\" not to rag any more * Reconcile Rancho's character's fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chatur's speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshi's family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells \"No Pants\".This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html",

Heck, I'll even go so far as to say all the protagonists are pretty good. But good lord, what an awful script. Melodramatic clich\u00e9s galore, terrible humor (why so many pee and fart jokes?), simplistic messages, a hero who can absolutely do no wrong and villains for whom the phrase \"one-dimensional\" is generous. It's as if someone marathoned through the absolute worst Hollywood has to offer and took notes. The sad scenes are laughable, the comic scenes are painful, and all of it is predictable (except the final little twist, which I admit was kind of a nifty surprise). Much of the film resembles REAL GENIUS, from the unflappable, infallible hero to the evil professor and the suck-up rival. And that's not a movie you want to aspire to. And there's a scene I know I've seen somewhere else before, but I can't place it. Teacher tells student his exam/paper won't be accepted because it's late, student asks if the teacher knows his name, teacher says no, student stuffs paper/exam in the middle of the stack. It'd be a clever bit, if not for this nagging feeling it was lifted from something else. Even the songs aren't that great, although the accompanying spectacle is sometimes charming. In the end, it's the three leads (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and Madhavan) and the romantic interest (Kareena Kapoor) and their endearing performances despite the horrible material that save this from being a complete waste.

In the beginning Omi Vaidya had a pen that he would give to a student who would be outstanding. From the beginning you know that he will give it to Amir Khan. What teacher lives with his family at school, that when his daughter has to give birth to a child, a student called Rancho has to do the delivery? Omi Vaidya plays a man who has two daughters. Amir Khan plays a student that has no child at all. It is not obvious that Amir Khan did the delivery.I do not understand why this movie gets an eight on IMDb. It wasn't that great. It has moments where the dialogs were interesting, like the father of one of the idiots did not give his son the laptop, but suggested to buy him a camera instead. But there were moments where the movie was awkward, like the speech what was made and raped by Rancho. Rancho was laughing his ass off when the stupid student recited the speech. Why? He rewrote the speech by himself...I have higher expectations when it gets to movies from Amir Khan. Oh brother where art thou? This movie was a mixture of \"Patch Adams\" and \"Dead Poets Society\". Bollywood movies in general are not original. Mostly they are copies of Hollywood movies. This one is not original either.",

            "content": "First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.I'm a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but it's always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether it's you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chatur's hilarious \"Balatkaar speech\" Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singh's baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Rancho's real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Raju's interview - Just amazing moments.Flaws? I really don't see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. He's just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hirani's first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, there's a huge distinction in Boman's act. Shows the man's versatility.Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, he's just perfect in every frame. You don't really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. He's filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a \"jadho ki jhappi\" In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was \"Get well soon, mamu\" And now, it's - ALL IZZ WELL!",

I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was \"3 Idiots.\" I don't know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is \"3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood\". I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. It's a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.It's about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students' losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten.",

            "content": "Greetings from Lithuania.There are only 3 good things i can say about \"3 Idiots\" (2009): 1. It was a well-intentioned 2. It was not a bad movie 3. I FINALLY finished watching it.It got me one and half week to actually finish watching this highly overwritten, over acted, Uber-sentimental, highly predictable, over produced tear-jerker, not funny \"good feel\" / \"comedy\". The only reason why i even started to watching it was its high position in IMDb Top 250 movies. WHAT is this thing even doing in IMDb Top 250? This year i saw bunch of movies better by many, many, many (and did i said MANY?) moons and oceans then this... \"stuff\". To be honest, i think i know exactly what is this flick doing in IMDb Top 250 - but i will keep my opinion just to not offend anyone. Can't remember last time i had my eyes rolling like every 5-10 min during the whole \"experience\". That said, i don't watch Bollywood movies, this is my probably first one, so maybe here lies the reason why i didn't like it at all. Everything is just so \"offbeat\" - and not in a good way. Music is so over written and over used, comedy timing isn't good, although it got me couple of times smiling, this is not a funny movie, well unless... again, i will keep my opinion by myself. Overall, if you are like 10 years old and do like Bollywood movies, you will probably love it, but anyone else beyond that age or those who don't like movie production from that country - stay away, far away from this flick. And one more thing - i kinda doing marathon of movies from IMDb Top 250, and at the moment i saw like ~203 of them and was intended to see them all. Until this moment there wasn't a poor movie to say the least, and lowest score i gave in the past from any movie from IMDb Top 250 was 8. \"3 Idiots\" is the worst from anything i saw yet, and to think that there are more Bollywood production inside of this great list keeps my head spinning - i don't think i will be able to \"experience\" such a movie again, although i still considering to do the list...

Tears wasn't so far away to come for me. Really. I think I have never been so touched when watching a movie. And I'm not even very emotional person. (I think watching this alone with headphones contribute this fact.)Something also fascinates me about Indian culture also. I think the language is awesome! I have watched also the \"Slumdog Millionaire\" movie and must say that these are only two movies from India, which I have seen and jeez! Very good movies coming from Bollywood.All actor AMAZED me! Not to mention Aamir Khan definitely the most! What a talent. Of course, excellent directing was also very important! Such a clever screenplay. And I have also used to watch movies less than 2 hours but these three hours went in a flash when watching this.It's wonderful how this was actually comedy, but was also so instructive and emotional at same time.

            "content": "\"Chase excellence and success will follow\". This is what Rancho (Aamir Khan) preaches in 3 Idiots and Rajkumar Hirani delineates the ideology with such adroitness in every aspect that it marks a monumental event for Indian cinema. In terms of the sheer inspiration that it instigates, this film resembles the greats of 'Rang De Basanti', 'Taare Zameen Par' and the 'MunnaBhai' series while being the most entertaining film after 'Andaz Apna Apna'. After introducing simple but relevant concepts like 'jaadu Ki jhappi' and Gandhigiri to the population at large, Hirani now teaches us 2 more concepts:Consoling the heart by saying 'all is well' may not solve your problems but it will give you the courage to face them. Being an 'idiot' in an institution that chases grades and success is absolutely fine if you are in the pursuit of gaining knowledge and exploring your own talent to its potential. Our system needs to evolve in order to encourage us to pursue what we really want to do with our lives. As Rancho rightly criticizes the Director of the ICE about the college having produced numerous rankers but not a single student who has been creative enough to invent anything with what he has learned. 2 of the idiots, Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) leave everything they're up to and along with their dorky college buddy Chatur (Omi Vaidya) begin a journey in search of their long lost friend Rancho, who left them abruptly several years ago. This beautiful journey through Shimla, Manali and Ladakh sends Farhan down memory lane to reminisce the manner in which a free spirited 'Rancho' entered their lives and changed them forever. The non-conformist Rancho rightly questions authority that suppresses free thinking. Every class that he attends is a revelation of sorts for the professor and the students alike. Through outrageously funny incidents and scenes, Rancho gradually changes the way his friends run the relentless race. His influence even spreads to the director's daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor), leading to even more outrage for the Virus. Through all the hilarious series of events, Hirani also voices his ideologies in some deeply moving scenes to give us an insight into the flaws of the educational system. Its demands are severe on students who are forced by parents who dream for them on their behalf and families that live in sheer misery hoping for the son to become a money-making engine. The latter is humorously depicted as a typical 1950s family in black and white melodrama that makes you sympathize and laugh at the same time. Touch of genius there...Even after a shocking twist at the end of first half, the film continues its pace while never losing the steam of entertainment. The film's climax is shot in the spectacular landscapes of Ladakh. Speaking of which, the cinematography CK Muraleedharan is outstanding! After painstaking attempts to shoot at the heavenly location, he did manage to catch it in all its majestic splendor. His work overall gives a real, enriching look to the film. Shantanu Moitra's music WILL not sound like the most appealing when listened to prior to watching the film. It is the manner in which the songs are timed in the storyline and the relevance of the lyrics with the characters that enables the music to grow on you. Give me some sunshine and Behti hawa are the examples of this. All is well was a super-hit from the on-set itself with its catchy theme. As the usual case is with Hirani's films, the performances are impeccable. Boman Irani as the oppressive director must feel at home with his role as a dean but he still has the ability to impress us with his remarkable portrayal of Virus. Kareena Kapoor has proved her talent in a role that did not require her Kambaqt Ishq attire but rather her true self as a good actress who, when given the right role to work with can prove to be worthy. Omi Vaidya is a discovery here. His speech on stage is one of the most hilarious moments in movies and his inept Hindi and dorky behavior are aspects of his brilliant performance. R. Madhavan shows finesse and a lot of confidence in playing his character. His scene with his father, Parikshit Sahni is the epitome of his performance. Sharman Joshi has displayed his comfort with comedy before and it is a delight to watch him repeat his act from Rang De Basanti rather than that of his other films. Aamir Khan once again, shines light on a rich, well scripted character. His brilliance levels with his commitment as an actor. He proves yet again that true performances only come with understanding and studying the character that one has to portray. He frankly has too many noteworthy scenes but he is at his best while confronting the impregnable Virus. He is the voice of Hirani's ideas and creativity and an astounding personification of a character only he could've played with such virtuosity.But 3 Idiots is not all about how great Aamir was. This film is extraordinary because it gets the most rudimentary part of film making right - the screenplay and script. With the combined talents of Abhijat Joshi and himself (story, screenplay, dialogs), Hirani's basics in film making achieve overall perfection. There is something unique and entertaining happening in every scene and you would kick yourself if you take a restroom break.It would suffice to say that 3 Idiots is a landmark film and is set to become one of the biggest blockbusters by the virtues of Rajkumar Hirani and that of his immensely talented team including some of the finest actors. This film deserves multiple viewing and you know what?.... You'd still want to watch it again.9.505 on a scale of 1-10.",

            "content": "It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.The movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.The cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.The writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.And in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out.

            "review_title": "my take: at the least, you can't say you don't get a full-course meal of movies in one LARGE one",
            "content": "Unlike many who have commented here in the years since 3 Idiots was released in India and throughout the world, I am not well-versed with Bollywood movies - indeed, far as I can tell from his filmography, this may be my first Aamir Khan movie - so my take on this experience may be different from others. It's not even that I can't get into a cinematic whirlwind like this, as other filmmakers in other countries will (sometimes) go for BIG emotions and BIG turns like this one does (Love Exposure was something that came to mind during this, of all things). So if you read what I'm about to say and think I'm full of it or don't know what I'm talking about it, well, the latter may be about right, but I can still share my honest thoughts much as they are. And, as far as the most general impression, overall, this isn't too bad. Is it very good though, or as bad as certain IMDb message board posters might say since its ascension to the top 250 films of all time? In short, 3 Idiots is a full course meal of a movie, and it has so many types and moods of movie stuffed into one, like a Turducken or something: it's a broad college comedy, an Alvin and the Chipmunks farce (think about it, with Khan's Rancho as Alvin and the other two idiots variations of Simon and Theodore, sort of, plus the Chatur character as the 4th wheel), a soap opera about strict fathers and their children, a tragic tale about suicide meant to highlight a very real problem in Indian society, and of course for Bollywood a musical, not to mention a kind of moral story of what it means to be a teacher or a student and how to not be so uptight (another subtitle for this movie could be \"The System, They Just Don't Understand!\").It's even other things I'm sure, and the tones fluctuate and alter on a dime from one to the next. Case in point, there's a little more than mid-way through the film a very serious turn in the plot; nevermind how exactly it gets there, suffice it to say it's due to some late-night antics from Rancho with pals Raju and Farhan, with Raju most drunk the next morning in class and being forced to decide whether to be expelled or put it all on Rancho. Raju decides to jump out the window, though he doesn't die and he subsequently gets rushed to the hospital. Cue up the sad but (it can't be anything else) supremely heart-felt song that plays over as he is brought to stable condition. Then it becomes a rather crazy comedy of 'how do we wake up Raju' sequence as he is stuck in his, uh, comatose-sort of state and Rancho keeps saying wilder and wackier things to get Raju to wake up. And yet as broad as this is it's still serious... sort of.A lot of this happens throughout 3 Idiots; for a stretch of time the movie will take on something like a frat-house comedy (that's actually how the film seems like it will take shape early on, \"initiation\" sequence with butt-branding included!) but then it's (duh) also a romance with the headmaster/principal's daughter, Pia (Kapoor, pretty but also a very good actress) and Rancho since he not only is the cool/suave prankster but he also spots the phonies who try to have her hand as a significant other. But then it's also about Raju's sad (in black and white no less!) home life, and then it's also about how to function properly in an academic environment with Rancho sometimes like a, uh, RP McMurphy in Cuckoo's Nest turning the system upside down with the headmaster as the one-note headmaster. And then it gets into a musical number about things like \"All is Well\", which gets finished off by someone jumping off a ledge and to their death, which makes it uh... sad again, as it cuts to the pouring rain at a funeral.This may be de rigeur for those who are regulars for Bollywood cinema - for me, it was at times a startling experience, sometimes akin to getting whiplash on a roller-coaster. This is not to say it made the experience intolerable, however. It was surely made as a prestige/high-mainstream comedy/drama/musical-et-al, and it's the kind of movie that will have high-powered, super-slick musical set pieces (not quite as many as I expected, to be fair, and those that are here do stand out well and are the highlights of the movie aside from Khan's performance), and then for the regular musical score it will be some of the goofiest notes I've ever heard outside of a Disney channel show. And for as BIG as the actors go for this material - perhaps, you could argue, they don't have much of a choice - there are moments where there's something close to not subtlety but measured stuff; when Raju confronts his parents with what he actually wants to do with his life, it's a legitimately strong dramatic scene that pulls on the heartstrings just enough.In other words, it's probably not what will be the *best* Bollywood movie - some may put it high up there, and that's their prerogative - but if you are new to this style of movie-making (and I don't mean Slumdog Millionaire for the laymans that's basically Bollywood crossed with Danny Boyle), it's a good place to start. It's sometimes quite funny, and sometimes quite harrowing with its drama, and often it's much too much with the emotional manipulation (that delivery scene, my God). It is what it is.",

            "content": "I was eager to watch this movie as the only bollywood films i like are those of aamir khan. When i saw the trailer of the movie, i thought that this movie could be the best of all time in bollywood, but it considerably failed to be. The plot was somewhat interesting , the cast was very appropriate, the acting was superb, the dialogues were wonderful , but the director maybe oozing with overconfidence, tried to put just too much in it. He tried to put it in ALL the good and bad things a teenager should do while he is in college. It was hard to identify the real protagonist in this movie, and even in the end i was left wondering whether raju was the man in the spotlight or aamir. What i hate to watch and hear is a meaningless song with meaningless lyrics and meaningless dance. And thats just what was very prominent in the movie. I don't understand the purpose of such futile non-sense, is it because people like it ? OH REALLY??? or is it because the director finds it attractive? attractive like - cow dung over cake.!? Another flaw i noticed was the change in character of aamir - from when he was a small kid to his teenage years. He looked and behaved like the most innocent one and out-of-all-activities one and later he became the most notorious and daring guy in college. Let the movie be pathetic or super-hit , boman irani was as always at his peak. His character was very well presented and he did just fine enough to make him the funniest as well as the most brutal character in the movie. The movie also had a lot of dramatic, sensitive scenes, at the wrong times, which did at times bring tears in my eyes, and left the other brain-left-at-home audience sob while staring at the screen. I wont say anything about Kareena because there isn't any need to publicize her flaws, there's a need to look for the minimal positivity in her enacting of her cameo. Rest was very appeasing , it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless, and the film was worth watching. 7/10",

Acting wise Amir khan is best. sharman, r. madhavan , kareena,boman irani did fine job too. Now where i differ others is the whole idea of movie is adaptation of MUNNABHI MBBS on different background. After interval the movie is like munnabhai MBBS part 2. same situations and scenes. when i came out of the hall i felt like director decided the start and end of the movie first, and then wrote the script, created the situations, characters later. This is my opinion of the film, this may hurt others but when i think about it as Rajkumar hirani film. I don't expect the same tried and tested scenes in his movie. For me the second half of movie was weaker part. I hope Rajkumar hirani and abhijat joshi will work on better scripts next time. Overall the movie is timepass and watchable but not the masterpiece, we have seen better work from Rajkumar Hirani in his first two movies",

There's something here everyone can relate to.Incredibly, for a 3-hour long movie, my attention was glued to the screen the entire time. The humor was naturally funny instead of slapstick.

            "content": "I watched \"3 Idiots\" upon the recommendation of my cousin. I believe this is the first complete Bollywood film I have seen. \"3 Idiots\" is a film that goes from the present time, to flashbacks of the lead characters' college days in engineering school. Pals Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Fahran (Madhavan) are looking for their best friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) with whom they have lost contact since graduation. Amidst the juvenile school jokes and musical scenes in bathrooms, the story is sending a serious message that learning is more than just rote memorization. Life is about following your own dreams. It also tells us not to face life with fear, overly relying on religion and charms.There are so many over-the-top scenes in this film which runs more than 2 and a half hours! There was a long scene about a speech where the word \"served\" was switched with something considerably more vulgar. Funny but went on too long. This may be funnier for people who speak Hindi than those of us who rely on translation. There was a very long scene about a storm, a brownout and someone giving birth. Dramatic but again overstretched and unbelievable. There was also an unexpected sequence about suicide that did not sit well with me in this supposed comedy.I personally liked the simpler poignant scenes that deliver a bigger punch, like the scene with the Prof. Virus and the pen, the scene with Fahran and his dad, the final revelation scene at the end. There were also some nice scenes with Rancho and the young doctor Pia about her fianc\u00e9 who seemed to be more concerned about how expensive things were, than about her. \"3 Idiots\" is generally fun to watch, except when the jokes became too toilet or too mean for comfort. There was a lot of suspension of disbelief at the time sequences of a lot of what happened, sometimes not too logical. I could not believe that the actor who played Rancho, Aamir Khan, was actually already in his mid-40s, and yet there he was still credibly playing a college student. Overall though, I did enjoy this, my introduction to Bollywood film. Time to discover more about movies from this part of the world.",

I do not mind losing my 200 bugs, but surely mind losing my precious hair. This movie is very loosely based upon Five point some one and has done balatakar of it. you will feel sleepy after listening Aamir's boring lecture about, life and education. He makes extra efforts to look like a student which unfortunately failed miserably. In the first half in a scene Aamir goes to one of his room mate's home. That scene makes such a mockery of their poverty that i feel like slapping the director. If that scene is not enough to cause headache, than baby delivery scene in the second half surely does. And than comes the Aamir's great invention, making a inventor for the cars batteries, wow that will make even Einstein proud.

So are the melodramatic scenes. The acting is fine. Was impressed by Sharman Joshi. Aamir Khan (a bit old for the role) has always delivered. Omi has portrayed his character well.A few points. The plane scene is not a realistic one (then neither is Rambo or Air Force One). And, in this day and age, how can you not locate a rich guy who is making half a million dollar a month in small town India! The whole inverter idea with the baby delivery scene! Wow! The climax was a feel-gooder, but not appropriate as the message got lost. Boman Irani should have been a part of the climax and should have learned his lesson then.Oh, well. It is just a movie.

Then just move forward with a great pace & fantastic humor that everyone expects from any Rajkumar Hirani film. Moreover, the main content & message proves that surely it was another a very much needed film for the respected audience. And as usually Mr. RH delivered the package very well. But my only little disappointments goes with the final climax. The sequences of final climax are very much important to closing the main statement in a way that stays in the mind of the audience for an adequate amount of time. And that can then help to form a judgmental & thought provoking ideas. For example, MUNNA BHAI MBBS. The whole vacuum baby delivery idea may be new for the viewers with a little demonstration of usefulness of WEB CAM tech. Though I haven't get the chance to read the original novel but personally I think this climax sequence didn't quite fit in a proper way with the content of the story like the climax of MUNNA BHAI films were superbly coped with those stories. I think 3 Idiots deserved a better climax at the end rather than found them busy to have a successful delivery with the help of a vacuum machine. At least I didn't expect that coming.

            "content": "I saw this movie on the first day of it's release. My expectations were terribly high from this movie since the Rajkumar Hirani's last two outings were absolute rock solid products in Indian cinema. Somehow Rajkuamr Hirani managed to make 3 Idiots so damn good that he surpassed my expectations! First of all, the casting.. though we have seen Aamir, Sharman and Madhavan in Rang De Basanti together, they still look very fresh together, maybe it is because of the college factor and mainly because Aamir seriously looks like a student in this movie. Boman Irani just had to be part of this movie because he was also there in Raju's last two. Kareena is also there.The performances, Aamir has performed brilliantly. He is the total package in this movie! We all know how dedicated Aamir is towards his movies and roles. Aamir analysed the body language of the youth nowadays, the way they talk, and all the connecting details and he implemented them in his acting, which is very visible. He also manages to look 21 when he is actually 43 while shooting this movie! Aamir delivers a power performance, each time Aamir enters the screen you feel immense energy and know your either going to laugh really hard or enjoy the sequence that is going to come! R. Madhavan is very very impactful as Farhan and delivers a great performance, he is known for his impact in movies, even when he has a small role. Well in this one he has a big role, which is only better! Sharman Joshi is absolutely convincing as Raju, the guy that has so much pressure on him. His expressions and everything are marvelous and I thoroughly enjoyed him in this one.Boman Irani is fantastic yet again, he surpasses all his previous performances and sets a new milestone in his own career. He is just great! Kareena is there for a few minutes, and is effective, though she should have been there more! The concept of the movie is absolutely amazing, we all know Rajkumar Hirani makes movies with a great entertainment value, but at the same time an intelligent social message. He is able to do that again this time, and how! Rajkumar also sends a new hype into the population of India, with Munnabhai MBBS it was the \"Jaadu ki jhappi\", with Lage Raho Munnabhai it was \"Gandhigiri\", and with 3 Idiots it is \"Aaaaal izzz well!!\". I am already using this line on a daily basis, lol! The music of the movie is great, Shantanu Moitra's songs always grow on people slowly, after coming from the movie, all the tracks have been stuck on my head, plus point for sure! The cinematography is top notch again, they have shot at a real college, with real students around. Which creates a very convincing atmosphere in every sequence! The editing of the movie is very very good.All in all, 3 Idiots has impressed me so much, that I am willing to say this is the best Bollywood movie I have seen YET! A true milestone in the history of Indian Cinema.GO WATCH IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN! P.S. There are some ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS sequences in the movie that are going to make you cry because of laughter for sure! 100/10",

            "content": "When did the last time you had the feeling while watching a Bollywood movie that you are watching the best film ever and then suddenly after the movie gets over you start to get mixed feelings about the movie you saw. Admit it; it has frequently been this way. And then what do you do, you go to watch the movie repeatedly to reinstate your earlier feeling about the movie. The hysteria and invincibility that Bollywood makers manage to create in their storytelling, is what makes it so special. '3 Idiots' is the latest of such hysterical movie with such aura around it.Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering is based on a popular cult novel '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat'. So, it's easy to have lot of expectations for this film right? Wrong! See, this is not Chetan Bhagat's first novel adaptation to the big screen, it's his second. The first one was a disaster called 'Hello' based on his book 'One night at a Call Center'. Hence, there were lots of apprehensions about his latest book to screen adaptation. But hopes were there for the creative team for the film production and the star of the film Aamir Khan. Both Rajkumar and Aamir have impeccable record and status in the industry. Hence, the opening they got for this film was not surprising, even with the steep Ticket prices. But, when the word of mouth began that this is the best bollywood movie ever made, the expectations crossed the limits. And the film about three engineering students in Imperial College of Engineering (a.k.a. a reference to Indian Institute of Technology) does not disappoint. The story is with difference, but the characters are clich\u00e9d and true stereotypes of their species. Even the several of the movie sequences that make us laugh in the movie are far beyond being original. But the story is new and relevant to today's youth. Engineering and medical fields of study has started to take a toll on today's youth and the more than half a dozen student suicides that you would witness and hear in the movie is not at all a overreaction. It is turning into an epidemic; hence this film is definitely important. The young India is lapping up the support this film provides to their cause with great hysteria and is enjoying the many jokes and potshots the movie takes on the countries rigid educational system and social norms. The quirky and over the top turns that the lives of these idiots take is bringing joy and happiness to the young India. I should mention the best written character and surprisingly the best actor of the film 'Chatur'. Chatur is the typical Indian student that one sees around the campuses of Indian Colleges. Played by newcomer Omi Vaidya, it is the character the audience loved to see fail. Though he does not, his sequences have brought cheers across college campuses in India. The hysteria of '3 Idiots' becomes easy to decipher for the Indian audience and hence they are flocking the theater with large numbers and are cheerfully encouraging the next person to go watch the film.For rest of the world this film is irrelevant and has nothing new to offer in terms of the movie flow and character development. But if they are able to put that aside, they would too probably enjoy the funny moments that this movie provides and would end up saying that this is the best Bollywood film they have ever seen.",

The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents' demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it.

            "content": "Released around Christmas 2009 in over half a dozen countries '3 Idiots' , reportedly the highest grossing Bollywood movie of all time, earned $70 million worldwide within 18 days of entering theaters. It was also officially released early to YouTube, another first. In the US, where it's being being shown at AMC/Regal theaters, it made $5.5 million in its first 17 days, the highest US take for a Bollywood import.So what is this paragon? No 'Slumdog,' it's much more a standard commercial Indian film product. That means it's long, it's got tears, laughter, excitement, music and dance, and homilies about work and family. It's got romance, a beautiful girl who finds the hero in the end, and it's got running pee and fart and bum jokes. The screenplay of '3 Idiots' is drawn from Chetan Bhagat's 2004 bestseller Five Point Someone, a novel initially published in English and later reissued in Hindi. Bhagat's novel deals with the college exam angst and romance issues of three student buddies. But the film goes further afield, including childbirth during a blackout due to a monsoon flood, travels through gorgeous mountain landscapes of Ladakh seen from the air, trips back and forth over the period of a decade, one marvelous scene when a professor's mass of equations and symbols float off the blackboard up into the lecture hall, caressing the students. There are several full-dress Bollywood song-and-dance numbers, one in a hospital. The bright-colored cinematography is pleasant to look at. '3 Idiots' is virtually an epic of shared coming-of-age experiences with wholesome messages. These are: be true to yourself, live your dream. Be positive: the hero's mantra is \"Aal izz well.\" Don't cheat -- unless you have to in a good cause. Don't rely on memorizing stuff; think for yourself. Avoid obsessing about the price and value of things. Remember where you came from. Remember your friends. The pressures of school in India where it may be the only way out of poverty are made clear, including the high incidence of suicide among students.And learn Hindi. There's a sequence when a nerdy materialist who lived abroad and didn't study it much is chosen to give a public address in a high-falutin literary form of the language, ending up with some lines in Sanscrit, which he's even more ignorant of. The buddies inject naughty substitute homonyms like the equivalent of \"screw\" for \"serve\" and he becomes a laughing stock.It's this materialistic memorizer bloke, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya), who starts off the pre-title sequence by calling Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) to say he's located their engineering school pal \"Rancho\" (Aamir Khan) who disappeared after graduation. Farhan has to take the annoying and materialistic Chatur along as he rounds up best buddy Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) to drive from New Delhi up to the mountain town of Shimla to find Rahcho, the pal who influenced and inspired them so much. Much of the film consists of flashbacks along the trip of all the many incidents that happened in engineering school, many involving the annoying and sadistic school principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), AKA \"Virus,\" who has a beautiful daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).The mercurial and diminutive Khan is so talented he gets away with playing Rancho as a student even though he's forty-something. Rancho is a compelling character: he's the inspiration, the catalyst a young person needs to move beyond his origins and live his dreams. Farhan is from a middle class family and has a huge talent for nature photography; his dad has pushed him toward engineering but he hates it. Raju comes from a dirt poor family -- images of his sick father, unmarried sister, and failing mom are in old-movie black and white -- and the way the family's future is resting on his engineering degree so terrifies him that he continually panics and fails the school tests. But he's a tremendously decent, soulful fellow whose rigorous honesty ultimately wins over potential employers. Rancho, whose origins are as obscure as his brilliance is evident, bows to no one and gets away with all kinds of infringements of the rules because or his inventive mind and fundamental decency.This summary barely scratches the surface. '3 Idiots' moves with precipitous speed through a dizzying array of incidents. A puzzling surprise comes just before the mid-way \"Interval.\" And I said it was long. With that \"Interval,\" the movie keeps you in the theater for three full hours. That's a lot of Hindi, and only a little English. But this feels like a cleansing, warm bath after Judd Apatow and Eddie Murphy. This is good entertainment, and it's neither mindless nor nasty. But is it art? Is it groundbreaking? No, one couldn't say that. It's just a breath of good humor and good sense from a more innocent place.",

Seeing as how India makes twice as many movies as us (we're still at least in the Top 3 though), it really is something most people should watch. The basic story is that these two students are going on a road trip to find their friend, Rancho. As a three hour long comedy, it knows how to use its time. Of course, this can be said for most Bollywood films. For whatever reason, the version I saw occasionally had English in it.What's great about this movie is that so much is going on and they know how to experiment with so many different genres. We get great comedy, drama, and romance. You could even argue it gets scary near the end. It's a plot that goes everywhere and you're having fun every minute of the day. It's one of those movies where you have to pay close attention. Nearly every joke is alluded to or referenced again in the story. Maybe it can focus too much on drama, but working in different genres is always impressive. We even get some great lessons learned about serving our parents and how important college degrees can be. It helps that it's so much fun and we're glad to see standard Bollywood dance numbers. It's quite bright and colorful. I love the bits with the pencils in space too. Glad to know this has enough votes to be on the Top 250. ****",

            "content": "It does not really matter whether this is intentional on the part of the movie makers or just my own imagination \u2013 the three Indian leads, in order of their appearances, resemble Mark Ruffalo, Gael Garcia Bernal and Tony Curtis (some would say Tom Hanks). Whatever that is, it certainly doesn't hurt the movie at all, nor does the winsome eye-candy female lead.The plot outline and story detail combine familiar stuff with some innovations. Starting with \"ten-years-later\", it employs the proved structure of flashbacks to recount the days the three protagonists share at college day when they cemented a heart-warming friendship \u2013 a full entertainment package complete with comedy, romance, breathtaking scenery, mild poignancy and even some \"messages\" with respect to the nature of education. On the last score I won't get overboard although some critics may make a big thing out of it. I rarely look at a movie as anything beyond entertainment, and those who believe that a 2-hour movie can double up as a full semester of philosophy, sociology, political or whatever \"100\" course are welcomed to continue to indulge in their delusion. By the way, this is actually a 3-hour movie. Word-of-mouth recommendations I received unanimously agree that the 3 hours would fly by without one's noticing it. I generally agree, but not 100%. There are times in the middle when it drags on somewhat, although the last half hour of finale is redeeming. Knowing what Bollywood is like, one shouldn't complain too much about the song-and-dance sequences appropriately sparsely inserted. After all, they even have such things in Ozon (\"8 femmes\" 2002)), so what's the fuss? And I have to admit that the rhythmic tunes are quite enjoyable. The only downside is that the resultant length gave an excuse to the local cinema operators to hike the admission price \u2013 a bit of a rip off.All told, this is a good entertainment package, price hike notwithstanding.",

Another thing was It doesn't explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldn't express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesn't have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies.",

But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isn't all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.Aamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)The plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Rancho's dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher. The message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if it's summarized, \"Don't follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow you\"This could be the movie that would change my life one day.",

For those who look up to it as the beginning of a trend of quality satire movies in bollywood, I am afraid its a false dawn.I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed many zany comedies, but those movies are different because they don't try to simulate real world situations unlike a movie based on a serious subject like 3 Idiots. The seriousness of the movie's theme was not reflected in the storyline and/or direction of the movie. Having said that, it is enjoyable to watch, being full of lighthearted humour, which makes it worth a watch and I wonder had it stuck to a saner storyline, it could really have been the masterpiece that many have made it out to be anyways.Also, since its focused largely, if not entirely on Aamir Khan and the other two so called central characters don't play enough of a role, the movie doesn't seem to warrant the title 3 Idiots.Its kind of disappointing to see people adulating and hailing this movie as something which is class apart, if it is so, we can and will have to raise that class.",

The movie is so much diff. than book.Angst: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I could not find a single line giving credits to Chetan Bhagat for the idea at least.Question: Remember Taare Zamin Par? Now take Ishan Awasti from it, make him older enough to get into a college and make Amir Khan play the character, what do u get?? We get Taare Zamin Part-2 or 3 Idiots.This movie is a mix of Munnabhai MBBS and Taare Zamin Par (Painting vs. Photography; as if there is only one creative work in this world). Even the dialogs sound similar to Taare Zamin Par. I ask, what is the point in shouting same issue over and over, what is the point in proving same point everyday.Let me tell u, 3-Idiots has nothing new to deliver. This movie wanted to be in Munnabhai league but failed miserably. It lacks the fine tuning, light hearted situational comedy with subtle strong points. It lacks all Raju Hirani/VC effects.Yes, there are a few good comic scenes (the lecture is good but just drags and after a moment I was getting irritated by over-using of the words \"balatkar\" and \"stan\")And what should I talk about the screenplay, bakwas and weak, even most Imran Hasmi/Harman Baweja movies have good integrated script than this.Acting: Sharman Joshi is mentionable, Amir did overact, yes, I say it, just watch the scene when the dean drags him from his office to a classroom he acts like something funny is going on, scratches his head, a very loose body language and not at all matching to what a student might feel if he is dragged through corridor by the dean of a very renowned college of India. Amir just fails to portray a student.I can go on and on about its stupid loopholes, but lets stop here. Last but not the least, u have to bear some good but misplaced songs throughout the movie.Reading this far one can tell I hated this movie, then why u may watch it? 1>U will get some good laughs in a few good scenes 2>A good but repetitive theme 3>A feel good effect 4>Amir's only movie in this year (for Amir fans)",

There is no doubt this film is a quite entertaining one, but nearly nothing special is worth mentioning here, one can easily feel that the director exaggerate to stuff all kinds of popular elements in its 160 minutes (I like the songs though), universities' educational method, the genuine friendship, money is not the most important item in the world (don't marry an over-materialized man), a choice between what I want to do and what parents want me to do, blah blah blah....The film deals with a quite grand topic, the meaning of life, and luckily its scholastic didactics has not reached my threshold of intolerance, as a result I enjoyed most of its screen time, however, my absent-mindedness did come forth several times. Actually the general principles which the film tried so hard to convey are conventional, everybody knows, what the film achieved is to manifest it in a perfect cinematographic world where everything is too idealized to happen in our mundane world. Lack of empathy and a shoddy script makes the film fade like a forgettable fairytale.All the characters are stereotyped, the suspenses do not persist long enough and the whole film is skimpy of plausible explanations for most its plots. Still I give a 6/10, an eligible rate, thanks to Aamir Khan's lovable performance. I don't think the film represents the highest standard of contemporary Indian films, nevertheless the inconvenient truth is that it failed to encourage me to watch more Indian films at the same time, what else can I do? There are numerous films are waiting in lines for me to watch, I don't want to waste my very limited time.",

To me, a good film makes me forget that where I am, what I am doing and who I am for that 2 hours or so. I cry and laugh with the characters. The actors on screen personify their characters and I cannot imagine them in any other role. 3 Idiots is one film that did exactly this.At College, they cross paths with various characters. The Dean of the College, Professor Viru \"Virus\" Sahastrabuddhe is an overachiever, having taught himself to write with both hands to save time, among other skills. He has his own idea of the perfect student and routinely patronizes students who do not meet his criteria. This comes down to most of the students at the College. Fellow student, Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, provides the comedic element of the film. Chatur is ambitious and believes that textbook memorization of engineering concepts is the way to success. He considers himself superior to others at the university, taking shortcuts to impress the Dean. His efforts often make him the butt of jokes and pranks among the trio, one of which earns him the nickname \"Silencer\". Of course, no film is complete without romance, and this is provided by the appearance of Pia, Professor's Viru's beautiful and intelligent daughter, with whom Rancho falls in love.In the middle of all these, they crash a wedding, deliver a baby on a makeshift operating table, settle a bet, fall in love and have hopes and dreams broken, all in Bollywood style. The film draws on themes of filial piety, obedience, friendship and the importance of following your heart. It also subtly hints that perhaps while we study, not all of us learn. The trio live, laugh and love with each other while discovering more about themselves. As usual, there is dancing, music, drama, a catchy phrase and soaring breath-taking scenery. The film ends with several twists and leaves you inspired to take a closer look at your life.",

And the kinetic energy of some of the dance numbers is reminiscent of classics such as Singing in the Rain, etc.For various reasons, especially in the darker moments of this film, this is a film I needed to experience right now in this particular moment of my life.

And the only reason I still hold on to Indian Cinema is Aamir khan. His movies have been the cornerstone of generational behavior through the decades. Indians have experiences the best of reelistic emotions, vigor, love, comedy through the works of Aamir. He defines a supreme talent with an eye for every detail that could connect with the audience in the lightest and most deepest of senses. You will never know what hits you when you watch some of his best works.Moving forward, I went to see 3 idiots with the same expectations from an Aamir movie. Starting with the storyline, it was pretty well presented and starting was glitchy which was readily made up by Aamir's presence, which obviously was staged as such but does make a nice impact. His two sideburns namely Sharman and Maddy did a superb job in their own respective way and special mention to Maddy for his subtle way of bringing the best out of a sidekick role. Another special mention goes to a character names Chatur (dunno the real name) for adding superb comic zing to the movie. Gals were pass\u00e9 but were essential. Some of the scenes were long dragged and kinda unnecessary songs as such a repertoire of bollywood, nevertheless, weighing pros against cons which anyways outnumber the cons, I would like to assure the kind of essence movie brings out as a whole is meaningful and thematic in the most lighthearted and fun filled way.Some of the hilarious scenes were so funny that my friend mentioned it to be the best comic scene in Indians cinema. People might point it out as gross or amateurish but it does forms an essential part of college humor which still is gibberish and kindergarten grade compared to western comedies. Aamir does a fantastic job again maybe not that much as the role he portrays but as an overall feel he brings to any movie he forms a part of. Hirani does bring lot of experiences from his part ventures into this movie but they are well figured out and I must admit, he does belong to the best breed of directors in Indian cinema's current generation with the likes of Imtiaz Ali, Vishal Bhardwaj and Prakash jha, masters in their own genre.Overall movie does give you a fantastic feel as you walk out of the theater and is a perfect gift from Aamir to everyone for Christmas. A must watch for Indian cinema buffs and indeed figures as one of the best recent movies with no award winning stuff but just for the flow it controls the psyche of the audience and brings them through all simple emotions with laughter and grit.3.5/5",

There were a lot of funny scenes which had the audience in splits. The comic timing of all the actors Amir, Sharman Madhavan and Boman Irani was really good. Chatur is just remarkable, what a launch for him. And when I came out at the interval i was pretty happy. I thought the film would continue in the same way in the second half.But the second half was too filmy. I mean what was Javed Jaffry s character doing in the film? His character was most confusing and unbelievable. I felt that the romantic angle was totally unnecessary and a bit forced as if just introduced to put some masala in the flick. Had the writers stuck to the basic plot about fun in college and avoided romantic side-angles, it would have been more crisp and slick.I thought the film would focus also on all the fun in other years, college fests labs etc. But they missed out on all that. And, the pregnancy scene could have been avoided. That was too \"filmy\". But otherwise, good story with a nice social message about the lopsided educational system in India. Hope some teachers and people involved in the education industry watch this movie and try to do something to correct our outdated, one-sided education system.There is another thing that stands out in this movie- the cinematography. whether its the college ambiance at IIM Bangalore or Shimla or Ladakh etc. has been nicely captured. Music is also good and keeps you entertained.That said and done, this movie is just an entertainer.Just leave your brains at home while watching this, especially the in the second half.",

Bhagat's novels (especially \"2 States\") help me appreciate the land they came from, that schooled them, and is still attached to their souls.Both \"Five Point Someone\" and \"3 Idiots\" tell about students suffering through college and the transformation to adulthood. Both stories are engaging, cleverly constructed and funny as hell, but they show different things, at a different pace. Novels show internal transformation, while movies show the transformation of relationships. Neither story is biographical. Neither story depicts \"reality\". Both stories work as fiction and frivolous entertainment. Both are respectful of their characters.If you want great art, read Tolstoy. To learn How Things Work, read Darwin. If you like the Marx Brothers, and you want to laugh your ass off, watch \"3 Idiots\". This is not a movie to make you think (Of COURSE universities in developing countries are lethally competitive) but to bombard you with the unexpected. Which for this westerner included the jarring Bollywood \"let's stop the plot and dance\", though in this case it is \"let's use dance to fire-hose a different set of sight gags at the viewers\". One part of your laughing brain can rest while another takes over. This movie will definitely engage all your humor muscles, including engineer and college nostalgia humor muscles if you have them. If you enjoy \"funny machines\", there are plenty of those, too.Some parts were beyond me - Silencer's idiosyncratic Hindi becomes mere word-substitution jokes in subtitle, and I'm left to imagine how his non-standard pronunciation and mannerisms are 2/3 of the humor Still, even Silencer and Virus were treated with respect - all the characters were victims of a situation created by colonialism, poverty, desperation, and ambition displacing love. You can cry or you can laugh - choose your movies accordingly. If you want to cry about abused students, watch \"Dark Matter\" (2007). If you don't like fart jokes, don't watch this movie, or read Benjamin Franklin, either.India turns out a lot of films. I'm sure all the elements of this movie are borrowed from others, and if you've watched a thousand movies you won't see much new stuff here. Good artists plagiarize, great artists steal, and these artists robbed the entire film vault. They pasted their swag together pretty well, and in some surprising (to me) ways.IMHO, a 170 minute movie is too long, which is why I give it a 9. But if they edited it down to 90 minutes, and kept all the best humor, I might have died laughing. It was never plodding, though it slowed from manic to almost sane in places.I'm buying 4 copies for Christmas presents - I have some godchildren that need their humor centers stretched. This ought to do it.",

Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand what's all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, you're totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that you're lazy. And what's even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.That's why we love the film, it showed our mind, it's not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry.

            "content": "Chetan Bhagat's \"Five Point Someone\" may not be called a literary masterpiece, but it sure is entertaining with its guffaws and its Indianized English. I read the book a while back, and I was highly impressed by the author's straightforward and vitriolic views about the sagacious education system. Bhagat had introduced Ryan Oberoi to play the role of the rebel, an anarchist who wanted to do away with the grumpy system of education prevailing in India. Ryan was never his protagonist; he simply played the second fiddle in the book. It was Hari, the mundane narrator of the book who was the hero. But things turned topsy-turvy when Bollywood walked into the scene to dramatize the already dramatic story of Five Point Someone. And then when in the book everything went happily ever after with the three idiots, namely Ryan, Hari, and Alok, Bollywood begot its own idiots Farhaan (R. Madhavan), Raju (Sharmaan Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan)the great for its new cinematic endeavor 3 Idiots .3 Idiots can be summed up in one word as extremely majestic. It surely will make you laugh your guts out with its slapstick jokes, its funny sequences, its bathetically emotional scenes and make you to shed a tear or two in the emotional sequences. In short, 3 Idiots is a perfect desi dinner for your bulbous eyes which has all the spices in almost perfect proportion. The genetically modified melodrama has all it takes to hit the Indian audiences hard, and I see it topping the charts in no time. The movie definitely followed a major part of the book, only the incidents were either jumbled or heightened for greater effect.3 Idiot' is a laughter riot right from the first scene where Farhaan fakes a heart attack while onboard an Air India flight to the last scene where Chatur finds out that his role model Mr. Phunsuk Wangdu is none but his college rival Rancho. I especially loved the portrayal of Raju's glum family in black and white. Despite scenes of hilarity, 3 Idiots does suffer from backlogs of vague emotions which seem at some portions of the movie vaguely put on, unorganized and unneeded. Another thing that stuck me was the heroic character of Rancho. I know it doesn't look good for the perfect image of a movie if its hero fails to live up to the standard and flunks in exams or scores 5 point something, so Bollywood made Ryan Oberoi (of the book) alias Rancho become the class topper thus bringing forth the idea that we cannot still accept a flawed hero in our movies. In the long run, the act actually exemplified the character of Rancho and brought out the real essence of the movie. But the child delivery scene in the movie was definitely overtly exaggerated. I don't think Chetan Bhagat has ever imagined his Ryan to do a child delivery with the aid of his friends. Since everything is fair in Bollywood and war, such sacrileges add to the vivacity of the movie's plot.3 Idiots is a star studded affair which presents us with the grand acting skills of stars like Boman Irani as Professor.Viru Sahastrabuddhe or Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam. But Kareena Kapoor seemed a little unwanted as Pia, she didn't add to the character of the fashion designing student Neha of the book, instead she is here a smart would be doctor who falls for the charm of Rancho out of the blue. One thing that stuck me about the movie is the way the real ages of the stars have been camouflaged fruitlessly. Even though Aamir Khan is a perfectionist as an actor, he seemed a little too old to be an engineering student in his early twenties. Nevertheless, the movie is a first hand example of great filmatography and fabulous humor. Like all Rajkumar Hirani' movie, this one has treats for all its viewers. The peppy song \"Aal izz well\" reminds us of his Munna Bhai movies.The dialogues used in the movie will definitely come as eye openers to brainless muggers. 3 Idiots deftly bring out the very quintessence of Five Point Someone bringing to light the fatal flaws of the Indian education system. And though at some point Aamir Khan does look like a know-it-all holy spirit inculcating others with his words, he does reciprocate Chetan Bhagat's ideas that the Indian education system lacks creativity and spontaneous love for knowledge. I hope Aamir's words reach the generation next and come as a harbinger of a utopian vision of a new educational system in India. Movies with messages such as this one should be taken as ground breaking attempts to change society.The movie is an absolute delight when it comes to music. It features a galaxy of beautiful songs shot in great locations. I personally loved \"Behti hawa\" and \"Zoobie doobie\". Overall, 3 Idiots is a wonderfully heartwarming movie that teaches us to stop being mentally troglodytes and introduce creativity in our minds.",

            "content": "Talking about unexpected\u0085 When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around \u2013 well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.The message is simple \u2013 follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character \u2013 Rancho \u2013 used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters \u2013 Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different \u2013 he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.As usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives \u2013 the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be \u2013 a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy \u2013 marriage \u2013 but that's another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma \u2013 he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned \u2013 son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a \"job\" in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.The movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics \u2013 well, eh\u0085 I think some things need to have a happy ending.P.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie",

            "content": "Pardon my ignorance.When an actor of Aamir's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.But instead what you get is 3 hours of absolute rubbish.The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Aamir, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything he signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even MANGAL PANDAY cashed in a lot in the first week. What mystifies me more is the way Aamir went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Aamir touring India as your everyday people.What mystifies me even more as to what made choose him this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering his previous performances.Lets start with his character Rancho, a college student . Lets be honest, he has played that in so many movies that he could now do that in his sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by his own rules and practicality. Funny why does Patch Adams just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Robin Williams and Rancho was that Robin was practising medicine in that movie and Rancho is practising engineering. There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Omi speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.It was like watching a blend of Patch Adams, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the first one because that too was inspired by Patch Adams), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the English song \" give me some sunshine\" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, \"Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti\", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which joy is shown hanging to his ceiling fan was a brilliant piece of direction. Its the way that it was shot in that amazed me.With Lage raho , Hirani stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Munnabhai series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an indianised version of Patch Adams. Mr, Hirani, move over the patch Adams hangover now. Its high time. I am sure you might find many other movies in Hollywood, that still haven't been indianised.And once again pardon my ignorance.",

Asthana's funny guffaws were character traits but Virus hasn't any he tries to be whatever is required.He is funny,he is ruthless but never as formidable as Asthana. 3I is not par stereotypes thus is predictable.It also delves in silliness and goes from melodramatic extremes to comic extremes in seconds.But all said the movie is just too funny.

            "content": "Based on the book Five Point Someone this is the story of three new friends trying to survive the universe and the university of information technology. The first half was quite entertaining with a series of flashbacks creating a college comedy where the rambunctious students clash with the strict and traditionalist teacher/school. Some of the messages about suicide, peer pressure, parental expectations and teaching methods were presented quite well, though possibly a bit heavy handedly, and generated some of the genuinely heartfelt moments. The second half relied on a clunky and forced mystery plot device that undermined the previously laid platform and required a character to act completely and unrealistically out of character. It also became more manipulative, corny and overwrought in excessively turning on the tears and trying to wrench the audiences hearts every second minute.The romance was all right, though it took too much of centre stage too late. A couple of generally well known adages were passed off as original dialogue which detracts from the credibility of the rest of the script. Specifically these were anecdotes about the million dollar American space pen being trumped by the Russian pencil and the toothpaste that's unable to be put back in the tube. The actors were all on cue with the comedy even if they weren't really age appropriately cast. I found the 44 years old Aamir Khan to play it a bit over the top with his attempts at boy genius mannerisms (putting his finger to his mouth) offputting.The songs were certainly catchy, though the lyrics tended to be rather simplistic eg: \"Give me some sunshine, Give me some rain, Give me another chance, I want to grow up once again\". However, the dance scenes were excellent with the highlight the main romantic to and fro which was only let down by the inclusion of the chicken dance. I still don't understand whether these dance scenes are fantasy or real especially when they are included in a character's real flashback memories. I will continue to presume they are fantasy despite cinematic liberties being taken.The Indian locations provided some beautiful scenery and were well shot and served the scenes well. The total running time of three hours was unnecessarily long and some needless scenes (eg the birth scene) could have been significantly shortened. Overall it was an enjoyable film, but it was only good and not as great as it is being touted by some.",

Will make u tear from laughing as well as in other moments. One second you'll be laughing, and the next second you'll feel their pains. Lots of ups and downs. awesome movie........must watch for everyone.Amir khan has always been great. Old classic movies to all the new ones. He has broadened his horizon. Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.Again, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more..

They find Chatur instead who have worked hard to brag about his success since his challenge 10 years ago. They go off in search for Rancho but there's a secret. In flashbacks, they are freshmen as mechanical engineering students. Rancho refuses to submit to hazing from upperclassmen and the dictatorial teaching methods of Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe. Rancho's rebellious nature win over Farhan and Raju. He rails against Virus' pressure after a student's suicide. He falls for Virus' daughter Pia.I don't think Rancho works completely. He's too perfect like a mythical creature. He's a magical nerd. The movie needs to build up this high pressure world a lot better before it can tear it down. I can guess at what this movie is striving for but I don't see it as funny or compelling. There is also a great twist in the middle and one at the end which is easily foreseeable from a mile away. The middle twist should be a better exposition. There should be a better story and a better journey to find Rancho. Ultimately, I don't think this speaks to me although it might be lost in translation.",

            "content": "It certainly is all over town. Aamir's next has been hyped immensely and it's not surprising if you are not able to find a movie ticket this weekend. But at the end it all boils down to the question - is the movie worth all the hype ?? After watching it, I can say that the answer (quite disappointingly) is no.Two college friends - Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) embark on a journey to find the third friend / Idiot Rancho (Aamir Khan) who mysteriously disappeared after college five years ago. The film's story is told through flashbacks as the characters journey to Shimla in search of Rancho - the person who managed to change their outlook towards life.The problem with 3 Idiots according to me is that although it tackles a very complex issue, it chooses to do so in a light-hearted way which essentially converts this movie into a comedy (something present in abundance in B-Town). No doubt the humor is top-notch and keeps you rolling in laughter but the movie simple fails to connect you emotionally with the characters as opposed to, for example, Taare Zameen Par (2007) which I feel, after watching this, is far more superior in terms of characterization and emotional depth. By the time it reaches the climax, you can well anticipate almost everything that would happen.As for the performances, they are top-notch. Undeniably, Aamir is one of the finest and this movie reaffirms this. However, what most people seem to be forgetting is that there are two more actors in this movie who, given the opportunity, are as capable as Aamir themselves. First R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi is simply brilliant. Watch the scene wherein he tries to explain his point of view to his parents. Next, Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi really shines not just in the comic sequences but in the more serious ones (which the movie has very few). Revealing the sequence in which he shines may act as a potential spoiler but watch out for a scene in the principal's office in which the principal asks him to type a rustication letter. Kareena Kapoor is really a thorn in this movie and her romance with Aamir is something that should have been either toned down or chopped off. Omi as the ideal geek is impressive (more so than Kareena).The cinematography is good and breathtaking in the opening song where the lush greenery of Shimla is captured with such finesse that it induces a sense of wonder. The music is good but the songs have not been used that effectively. For instance, \"Give Me Some Sunshine\" not only has weak choreography, but it comes at a moment which severely reduces its impact. The promo featuring that song was far superior (in fact that was what fooled me into believing that this movie could end up as a masterful lesson in life). Some of the sequences could have been trimmed down.On the whole, although 3 Idiots is a good movie, it is hard to understand people calling a masterpiece or a breakthrough in cinema. Movies like Taare Zameen Par (2007) or even Hirani's own Lage Raho Munnabhai (2006) are better movies as compared to this. Nevertheless, the movie does provide some really good entertainment so if you're looking forward to just relax and chill out, go for this. For those however seeking some serious depth and a perspective in the life of an engineer, I'd say the movie tries and succeeds in parts but an engineer's life and the pressures s/he faces are a different game altogether. Although the movie it enjoyable, it is far from authentic. And this comes from an Engineer (although an Idiotic one). Now I may get a lot of sore thumbs down on this one but this in my opinion on this movie written in all earnestness. Don't enter this movie with high expectations and you may perhaps find that All Izz (Indeed) Well !!!Score: 7.0/10.0 !!",

The best part about India is that everything has a following and Aamir Khan with his histrionics and verbal spats is in the midst of a great purple patch. Everything he is touching is turning into gold and it takes a modern day genius to do that. He is more like a good salesman then an actor. If you can sell the same college song after 21 years, you sure have to be awarded the best salesman in your industry. Well, the real disappointment is not Aamir, as he frequently makes bad movies...Fana and Ghajini to name just the latest 2 but he also carves out little gems like Taare Zameen Par every now and then. And the disappointment is also not from the fact that he is still playing the college Romeo. The disappointment is with Raj Kumar Hirani who in trying to accommodate Aamir's star power did what Shubhash Ghai did in Yaadein. The Box office verdict has been starkly different for both the movies because young India connects to the message of 3 idiots well. Critics with a few exceptions did not speak their mind because they knew that this movie was going to do colossal business. But the fact remains a fact....the ending was manufactured and seriously pretending. It was like that the script writer was superficially trying to make everybody smile while walking out. It is the first time Hirani has erred and hope that he does not slip again, as he has given 2 most memorable movies in recent memory. This does not even come close. The point of view was excellent, the treatment not.",

Some sequences are absurd. 3 idiots can take a old patient to Hospital but cannot take a pregnant woman and applies their engineering knowledge to deliver a baby. They can gather the whole college but not a single girl to deliver a baby. Like I said...its a good bollywood masala movie but nothing great. I don't know why some people are surprised about Aaamir's acting as a college boy. His face is still boyish and suits these kind of roles. May I ask in which film he looked like a Man? Arshad Warsi could have done better job in this movie. Now the good things. There were some good dialogues and good acting from Sharman Joshi(Raju) and Omi Vaidya(Ramalingam). This movie is Chatur Ramalingam's. The producers are clever to market the movie like Ghazni and make their money. After few days we audiences will look back and think how they made fool of us.

But 3 idiots lacked such substance. The movie's theme is good. The educational system of India is rotten. I perfectly agree to it. Even more the perspective of the common man to their children's education is pathetic, in my eyes. The movie really conveyed that idea. But let me ask you a question. Didn't Aamir Khan act in a movie called Taare Zameen Par, which sort of conveyed the same idea. That movie was good. It had heart. 3 Idiots is old wine in new bottle. The wine still tastes good.You can buy it, no problem. But don't b fooled. Don't think its new imported wine. Its still the old one.If only the director was a little bit more realistic, I think I would have liked the movie much better.

Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, Kareena Kapoor,Boman Irani.Is loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone.And this time Rajkumar Hirani failed. Munnabhai series was much better than his 3 idiots. Nothing fresh, contents are outdated and its a shame to five point someone.Film is about the story of Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancho (Aamir Khan) are three engineering students who all share the same room in a hostel at one of the best colleges in India. Farhan and Raju are from modest backgrounds, Rancho is a wealthy genius who studies for joy(So weird). Threatened by Rancho's talent, ViruS(Boman irani) labels him an \"idiot\" and attempts on a number of occasions to destroy his friendship with Farhan and Raju. Meanwhile, Rancho falls in love with ViruS' daughter Pia. Farhan and Raju dare Rancho to tell Pia he loves her, and when they go to her house, Raju gets drunk and makes sure the mailbox says \"ViruS\" and peeing on it. ViruS sees Raju and they are caught in class, he tells Raju that either him or Rancho gets rusticated, unable to make a decision, Raju attempts suicide, only to be saved by Rancho, Farhan, and Pia. Finally, dramatically Farhan's dad lets him become a wild life photographer, and Raju gets a job.The story is framed as a flashback from the present day, Farhan fakes a heart attack to abort a plane because he gets a call from Chatur(Silencer) saying Rancho has come. Raju leaves in a hurry without any pants getting the same call.All three of them search for Rancho. They come to a village and find out that Rancho was actually a gardener's son and when his father died, a rich man took him in. The real Rancho is Javed Jaffrey and their Rancho's real name is Chhote. When Rancho couldn't pass his exams, his father not wanting him to fail in life sent Chhotte as Rancho to get his son a degree and leave. Farhan and Raju interrupt Pia's wedding and take her along to find Rancho. They find he is a teacher. Also, chatur be more richer when he signs a deal with Phunsukh Wangdu, a world famous scientist. But everyone realizes that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wangdu himself.This movie offers nothing new, a typical bollywood film with no creativity, u will get irritated when Boman Irani speaks, also in Pia's sisters delivery scene. Engineering students with the help of a webcam and vacuum cleaner they take out kid from her stomach. What a disaster.Only during first half of the movie you can enjoy, Raju Hirani's dialogs are excellent and Shantanu Moitra's music cool.Performance wise, Madhavan and Kareena Kapoor did a justice to their role. Both Aamir and Sharman overacted. In every scene you can find Aamir khan crying. Aamir didn't even tried to deliver 5% of Lagaan or DCH, very badly imitated walking style of college boys. I give 5 out of 10 for Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots.",

            "content": "This blast of a Bollywood movie tells about two friends travelling with their old enemy in search of their college roommate, who they have not seen since graduation day. During their travel they reminiscence about their college days, and let's just say that those days did not suffer from a lack of excitement.The film is very much a comedy, but it has undertones of satire when it comes to India's school system and the way students are so pushed to excel, to get good grades, to get a good jobs, to provide for their families through success, that it often leads to self-destructive throughts and behaviour.Nevertheless, for the most part the focus of the film is on these three friends and their individual ways to get through college. And in that aspect the film absolutely shines. These are three great characters, each played masterfully by their respective actors. Their ordeals during college are pretty unbelievable, but in a good way. I also like that the film can be serious and solemn when the situation calls for it. There are touching scenes in this film, which almost made me teary-eyed.If I had to name a flaw, I would say that the film is a bit on the long side. I did find myself checking the clock once or twice towards the end. The film has enough content to keep you interested until the very end, but some could definitely be trimmed.Still, this is a great film. Great dialogues, amazing characters, clever plot twists and enough energy to keep you going for days. Heavily recommended.",

It was a uproarious comedy mixed with poignant drama to shed some truth on the absurd pressures of academia. I feel like any grad student in any country would get a ton out of this film's spirit and message. All is, indeed, well when you put your friends first.The film is close to 3 hours long but with so much warmth, laughs and visual flair the time just flies by. It is amazing how much of life is packed into its run time. I loved every second of this film. I think Khan's charisma and gravity as a the offbeat, wise Ranco is the key to the film. So much of the film is about his viewpoint that it is really hard to not fall in love this guy.For western audiences this films reminds me of Animal House mixed with Dead Poet's Society. Plus Bollywood epic visuals and musical. The combination is quite intoxicating.",

I appreciated that it wasn't linear, which actually helped setting up some mystery and revealing surprises that caught me off guard. The amazing story itself also helped. Although some of what the main character said about teaching was a bit too philosophical, the idea behind it in the movie were still impactful and relevant. Stress in school is a real deal, not only back in when the movie is made. I think that some better execution and writing could make the theme more impactful and profound, but this is still relatable enough.Another great achievement was the mixing of serious theme with light-weight comedy. Despite how much I laughed at the funny jokes or goofy characters, this doesn't undermine the message that the movie was going for. That was not an easy thing to do, considering how usual Bollywood movies like to accommodate comedy.Even though I have problems with the movie, they don't bother me as much as others. The runtime was still long, as I think a good 15-20 minutes can be easily cut off. One part is to get rid of the musicals. All the musicals and dancings in the movie only occurred near the beginning, and most of them were not necessary, except the one that transitioned into a very dark scene.I said that the storytelling was solid, but the scenes where the characters got rewarded felt cheesy and not as satisfying as I wanted.Overall, I definitely see why this is one of the classics. 8-8.5/10.",

The trailer looked silly and I didn't really have a reason to watch this other than the fact that it was highly rated. But man was I wrong about this movie. When I decided to start watching it, I had little to no patience and was looking for the first reason to just stop watching it. As the movie progressed, I couldn't stop watching it! It sucked me into a world of comedy, romance, and drama in a way I've never seen used before. It was so unique in the way it was used; it wasn't a typical Hollywood film with every clich\u00e9 scene being used. I quickly found myself become attached to these \"3 idiots\" through great acting and character development. This movie was stuffed with life lessons and ultimately very enlightening. It was all a slam dunk. a 10 out of 10. However, don't get me wrong. This movie wasn't perfect. There was a few scenes where they would break out into song for about 10 minutes which was a little annoying but I could see how it fit into the movie. I just sorta thought it was a bit childish and a little abrupt. But all in all, a very well developed movie. I highly recommend this.",

            "review_title": "3 hours of joy.",
            "content": "Looking for a silly comedy? This has you covered. I guess the title suggests an element of farce and it sure delivers. Farhan (R. Madhavan) fakes a heart attack to get off a plane that's just about to leave Delhi, to pick up his mate Raju (Sharman Joshi), after getting a call that their mate Rancho (Aamir Khan) is on his way. We don't know why, but this news creates a lot of excitement. Unnecessarily it seems as Rancho isn't really on his way. Chatur (Omi) has brought them to a meeting at their old college campus, the setting were 10 years earlier, he'd challenged Rancho to a bet to see who'd be the more successful on their return. Fahran and Raju's excitement is because they've not seen Rancho in 5 years, he's disappeared, he's not at the meeting, but Chatur says he knows where he is. First though we'll travel back to how the friends met. At university, where Rancho instantly proves himself a bit of a maverick. He's the smart unconventional one. The others don't know what to make of him, but admire him. He's apparently from a wealthy family, the others far less so. But Rancho sees the world from an idyllic viewpoint, seeing the possibility and promise in everything and everyone. It's all a bit light and fluffy, like a teen movie, just translated from California to India. It's playful, even employing a few Bollywood style dance numbers, which I'll confess I really enjoyed. Blasts of colour, sweeping cameras, beautiful synced choreography, it really is a lot of fun to watch. For all it's joy, it's not scared to hit the darker side too. The school for engineers they study at is highly revered and the pressure immense. From themselves, perhaps their families, certainly the teachers. The tyrannical head of the school, nicknamed Virus, doesn't like them either, especially Rancho. Mainly down to the fact that in Rancho he's found a nemesis. Smarter, younger, much more likeable. Here again it echoes those 80s American high school movies. Virus is Rooney from Ferris Bueller! I'm not laughing hysterically throughout, but it is funny. Rancho is fond of a joke to make his point, that work should be fun. But one such gaff pushes fellow student and teachers pet Chatur over the edge, ridiculing him in front of the whole school. This is what brings us to the fateful scene, where the bet is made that he'll be more successful in 10 years time. This becomes the catalyst for a great twist, one that I'm loathed to spoil. Rancho is an inspiring fellow, but he's much more than what we see on the surface. It's a truly heartwarming story, overly sentimental yes, far too long yes, packed full of cliche yes, but it's so lovely. It's the silliest thing I've watched in ages, but it's infectious and all the characters are wonderful, you're rooting for everyone, not just the 3 Idiots. Even at its nearly 3 hour runtime, it rattles along at a decent pace. A tangle of characters, relationships, timelines and story arcs. It's not ground-breaking, but I'm not sure I've seen anything else quite like it.",

Watch this only after watching and appreciating the movie :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXRZcJI9yx8*spoiler end*Watch 3 Idiots if you have not read Chethan Bhagath prior to it. Read the book after if you haven't already...because that was 1 of his books worth appreciating. Watch 'The Paper Chase' also afterwards.

Fantastic screen play with crisp dialogs and ultimate cast selection made this as one of my all time best. And what to say about Amir Khan? He surpasses my expectation level one more time. DCH, RDB, TZP and now this one!! He is such a refreshing feeling in movie that you can't come out of, ever after two days. This is the youngest he is looking in last fifteen years. If I was too surprised with young and charming Brad Pitt in Curious case of Benjamin Button, then Amir on top of that added mischievous of youth too. Look at his curious eyes, his ever swinging body, his quick repartees.. ooh boy he is incomparable.Best part of movie is that, even with such a powerful casting, I was so much engrossed with Rancho, Farhan, Hari, Pia, Virus, Chatur that no one not even Amir was able to overshadow movie. Boman Irani, Madhavan, Sharman, Kareena all played their part superbly. This new guy Mr Chatur also did a great comedy performance and reason for lots of hilarious moment in movie. All in all it was a complete entertainment package. I am giving only 9 out of 10 and saving last one; because I am sure Mr Hirani and Amir will surpass their own record soon.",

            "content": "In few words, \"3 Idiots\" fulfills every promise it made and entertains the viewer completely with its engrossing and enlightening content based upon some real life happenings. Loosely inspired from Chetan Bhagat's novel, \"Five Point Someone\", it starts with a phone call to Madhavan, about their lost friend and then keeps shifting between the present & the past, majorly talking about the days they all spent together in the college.The first half is full of highly enjoyable moments which have a distinctive Hirani flavor and are sure going to be liked by everyone of any age or gender. The pants dropping humor may be a bit weird for some but the youngsters would not mind it at all for a change. The entertaining first half ends on a mystery note, which straight away gets solved post intermission and then the story moves on towards the search of the third lost idiot,Aamir. Though the second half has got some dragging moments in the mid but overall, it makes a good impact on the viewer with a masterstroke used towards the climax having a pleasant surprise twist.Director Rajkumar Hirani brilliantly writes all his scenes along with the talented Abhijat Joshi and the experienced Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The ease with which he showcases serious issues like Suicides by Students, Ragging in Colleges, Faulty Education System based on memorization and the unnecessary competition creating tension is simply commendable. He humbly goes on to remind you that Are you doing the job you always wished for\u0085? To be straight, \"3 Idiots\" is a director's movie completely. Though it has been more publicized and awaited as an Aamir Khan project, but significant contribution coming from every big and small character in \"3 Idiots\", simply restrains anybody from calling it an Aamir Khan movie alone. Having said that, I would also like to add that with \"3 Idiots\" Aamir once again proves his unmatchable understanding of the medium and willingness to work better with a team spirit. He consistently delivers another flawless performance of his shining career under the expert direction of Raj Kumar Hirani.After Aamir, the next best act comes from Sharman Joshi who very convincingly portrays a complex character of a student caught in a dilemma. It's unarguably the toughest role and Sharman's the best performance of his career till date. The third idiot, Madhavan equally impresses in the role of an engineering student, wishing to become a wild life photographer from heart. Madhavan, never makes you feel his huge star status in the south and impressively plays his part with a quite conviction. Boman Irani is superb as earlier seen in the similar role a University professor and looks great in his messy get up in the movie.Kareena Kapoor hasn't got a big role in the script, but she still manages to catch your attention through her new look with the glasses. Mona Singh is cool in her few scenes but Javed Jaffery is wasted in a two scene role. The actor playing the studious friend of the 3 Idiots is first rate and Parikshit Sahni thankfully is there with a controlled act. Cinematography is worth mentioning especially in the scenes where the three friends meet at the top of a high rise structure, the beautiful roads in the mountains and the climax scene of Ladakh. Shantanu Moitra's music is not worth buying as an album, but it impresses and leaves a mark after you have watched the movie in the theater.Summing up, there is no doubt that \"3 Idiots\" is one of the finest movies of 2009 and will be a great success at the box office, but at the same time I would like to share a few points I have in mind about the movie : Firstly, the basic format of the movie remains very close to Hirani's debut venture \"Munnabhai MBBS\". It has many similar (not identical) scenes of college classrooms, lectures and exams (though the subjects are different). The interaction between Boman and Aamir is on the similar lines of Boman and Sanjay Dutt. There is also a Hospital Sequence of Sharman getting paralyzed and Aamir curing him with his miraculous ways (quite identical to Carrom Board Sequence in Munna Bhai). And lastly as there was \"Jaadoo Ki Jhappi\" in Munna Bhai and \"Gandhigiri\" in \"Lage Raho\", similarly here we have a new phrase \"All Izz Well\" used in 3 Idiots to woo the audiences. So I somewhere felt the basic framework of the movie written around the same commercial elements used in Munna Bhai.Secondly the pregnancy sequence of Mona Singh, where Aamir has to perform as a doctor on the online guidance of Kareena, was a kind of deliberate, filmy and quite far from reality.And thirdly, I couldn't appreciate the way, Hirani hilariously treated the poor family of Sharman Joshi and the character of his paralyzed father. He mercilessly used the poor character as a comedian and made the audience laugh at his helpless situation which I didn't find very amusing. This particular part was not as per the standards set by Hirani himself through his earlier two masterpieces and was an avoidable patch on an otherwise brilliant and highly entertaining flick from the master craftsman.Incidentally, as seen in his previous blockbusters, the master director continues to give you a glimpse of his western influences by using the animated scene of millions of sperms racing towards becoming a baby, which is highly inspired from Woody Allen's \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex\".But despite of the above mentioned points, the talented trio, Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra have a sure shot winner in their hands, which will be unanimously liked by all the section of the viewers together.",

It also happens to be the most commercially successful Bollywood feature ever released in India. Go figure.The story centers around a trio of promising but mischievous young engineering students who rebel against the high-pressured rigidity - both academic and personal - of the exclusive school they're attending.\"3 Idiots\" has two things going for it: its cranked-up energy level and its appealing actors, especially Aamir Khan, who portrays the ringleader of the group. These alone are enough to compensate for the silliness of much of the action, the corniness of the jokes (with irritating cue music in case we couldn't pick up on the corn on our own) and the stickiness of the sentimentality. And, in its own playful way, the movie makes some important points about the intense pressure placed on Indian children to achieve beyond their parents' wildest expectations, and about the need to pursue the path that will make one most happy in life.It's a pretty entertaining feature, overall; I just wish it didn't take so darn long to play itself out.",

Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike anyone I've ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce. 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.",

            "content": "I have a bunch of Indian and Pakistani friends and they were all going over the moon with this movie so I decided to watch it. There is one way to describe this movie and that is different.The story revolves around three engineering students who bond with each other. Rancho is a brilliant student who prefers to have fun and makes it his duty to help people in any way he can. Farhan is a student who loves photography and was forced to go to the top engineering school by his dad. Raju is a religious student from a poor family that tries to excel in the school. THroughout the movie, they have their little adventures and even a couple of surprises or two in the school they are studying in. While the movie is different from most Indian Movies, the movie is a little long and a little dragged on. While it is primarily a comedy movie and there are many jokes in the movie, most of them aren't that funny and there were some very babyish jokes (people pulling their pants down randomly and people talking to each other while on the toilets). Like most Hindi Movies, there were also some good songs, but one was a nonsensical song that sounded unusually similar to zipadee doo daa. Towards the end (last 45 minutes) the movie also became painfully predictable and did not match the explosive first hour that had me captivated. The message however was very well understood and very well put in the movie.Aamir Khan is an outstanding movie star and he shines in this movie and as I heard he also produced this movie, it greatly resembles his other movie, Taare Zameen Par, in which a kid that is dyslexic rises above the standard and traditional South Asian view that a child must learn a certain way. It parallels the moral of this story in which South Asian communities must broaden their views and be more flexible instead of forcing their children to becomes either doctors or engineers and to not put pressure on their children by asking high demands in education.Overall, its a movie to watch because of its message.",

            "content": "Alright. I know the title sucks. The first image it brings to one's mind is three cross-eyed, bald men with fingers shoved up their noses or something, which wouldn't be a lot off the mark from what the real picture is - three college-brats scratching fake, shiny, resplendent buttocks. But Shakespeare said 'what's in a name?' and let us assume that the great bard was not being rhetorical and delve further into the movie.Inspired from the book '5 Point Someone' by Chetan Bhagat, or as some critics call him, Satan Bhagat, or the IIT-IIM-douche bag, the movie is about three college students in Imperial College of Engineering, the best fictitious Engineering college of India. Each has a history of his own, and while the past of two of them is open in front of us like a book, the life of the third is barely revealed in the first half. Raju (Sharman Joshi) is the stereotypical nerd, haunted by poverty and has a paralysed father and a mother with a total disregard for hygiene, while Farhan (R. Madhavan) is the dilemma-stricken, schizophrenic (not literally) who is studying to be an engineer but his alter-ego (not literally) wants to be a wildlife photographer.Much through the initial half, the movie focuses on the trio's life in college. There is fun, frolic and all the other juvenile stuff with occasional mentions of suicide, pressure and the sort. The film tries to accomplish too much in too little only leaving behind a residue of laughter and a feeling of nostalgia for people past their 'my-college- life-was-so-awesome' stage.Rancho (Aamir Khan) is the protagonist of the film. The smartest among the three, he is also the most gregarious and wild. He is a philosopher, experimentalist and conducts innovations in his room or drifts into monologues about success, how-to-study and other inspirational things. Though not a geek, he trumps the obnoxious mega-nerd, Chatur Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) in their results, which marks the inception of a long- lasting rivalry, which soon boils over after Rancho plays a particularly nasty prank on the latter. The rest of the story, as Bollywood cinema goes, is about a ghastly principal with a lisp (Boman Irani), friendship, love, pregnant women giving birth using a vacuum cleaner and other pea-brained escapades.The twist comes mid-way through the movie, thoroughly inappropriate and mistimed. After this point the movies seems to drag on. The humour turns more contrived than nonchalant. The emotions become mawkish instead of touching. There are things that are absolutely implausible in any universe. The movie splashes water onto the sand castle it had built in the first half. The end is hypothetical at its best and this only worsens the case. It manages to leave a 'what the hell just happened?!' taste in your mouth, and I am pretty sure that the movie director, Rajkumar Hirani, wasn't trying to accomplish that.However, the three lead characters play a grace-saving role; Aamir Khan in particular. It is difficult to find chinks in the acting armour. The then forty four year old Khan brilliantly morphs into the twenty- something Rancho. Giving a flawless performance, he makes you happy when he laughs, sad when he cries and sway-along when he dances. There is an innocuous air about him which is highly appealing, with some members of the female contingent even defining it as 'cute.' Sharman Joshi, one of the most underrated actors of Indian cinema, dons the clothes of Raju Rastogi seamlessly. He looks tailor-made for the role; right from being the economically-challenged superstitious nerd, to getting inebriated and imitating the working of an induction motor, his acting is like a breath of fresh air. Though Madhavan appears slightly sidelined as Farhan, he manages to hold onto the boat well. He is overshadowed by the other two, who are more distinctly characterized, but this is covered by the fact that he is also the narrator of the tale. He entertains us with his antics (which involves stopping an airplane on the runway), his affable nature and always being Rancho's faithful sidekick. Boman Irani does a commendable job as the uncanny principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe, a part similar in ways to the evil Dr. Asthana is Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. The others too meander through; Kareena Kapoor, Javed Jaffrey, Mona Singh and so on, each well placed in their shoes, but none leaving a lasting impression.Comparisons with the book are inevitable and the film deserves due credit for being one of those rare books that outdoes its paperback version. But then again, comparisons to a wad of used toilet paper are hardly a standard to go by. Most songs are better than the other blockbusters Bollywood has churned out in recent history. They aid the emotional segment of the film. Yipee for that. While the first half of 3 Idiots is certainly worth a watch, but the latter makes you wish that you'd left the theatre in the intermission.",

I didn't expect to like it based on the beginning. The advertising made it seem like a comedy, when it's actually a coming of age drama, and nearly all of the comedy is extremely immature potty jokes. Plus a lot of Rancho's initial challenges to the establishment (and the entirety of the director's character) seemed childish and/or unrealistic. However, once the story turned serious (about 45-60 minutes into the movie), there were several scenes that had me on the verge of tears in powerfully joyful moments.If I were in charge of this film, the biggest change I would make is to entirely cut the present day story. In the first half, it's practically the only interesting part of the movie. But in the second half, it only serves as a distraction, never presenting anything remotely as entertaining or moving as the past storyline. My second biggest issue is the music, which is usually jarringly strong and over-exaggerated.All in all, I'm certainly glad I watched it, though it has too much fluff and such a lengthy runtime that I probably won't ever rewatch it. Oh, and as a surprising bonus, it only has 2 of the ridiculously absurd musical sequences that Bollywood is so strangely infatuated with, and one of the songs is actually halfway related to the plot.",

            "content": "Once in a while there comes a film that people, critics...everyone praise sky high....but when you watch the movie, you really wonder whether you saw the same movie as everyone else. 3 idiots is one of those movie.The film begins well...but just turns into typical Bollywood movie where Hero is above God, jokes are lame and logic is thrown out of the window...and the window is shut, leaving no room for logic to enter back.The story starts well with Chatur calling Farhan and Raju that \"Rancho\" has been found and the trio, along with Kareena, (who runs away from her wedding, when she finds that Rancho has been found) start a journey to meet him. Chatur is also keen to meet \"Phunsuk Wangdu\", his hero who has multiple patents in his name. During the journey starts the back story of how Rancho was exceptionally good in studies and always topped, always gave out of the box solutions, was wayyy above his teachers...etc. Back to present, when they finally meet Rancho after a gap of 10 years...they find that this Rancho has no resemblance to the Rancho they knew. Then later in the story they learn that Phunsukh Wangdu was the Rancho with them during College, earning a degree for the real Rancho, as Rancho.Let me not dive deeper into the story, but let me sum up where the movie falters.1. Aamir Khan's character is shown to be too larger than life...than what is actually possible....he is far more mature than teachers, more intelligent....and holds more than 100 patents?? REALLY?????2. The movie is keen to criticize Chatur's character, who only mugs up to succeed in examinations. 10 yrs later he shown to have 1 patent in his name. Now let's get real....in a way, aren't they promoting \"mug up to succeed\"...coz getting even a single patent is not easy.3. Kareena-Aamir love story - Aamir's char (Rancho) and Kareena's char(Pia) meet once during the wedding and later, when Raju's father gets a heart attack and they carry him to the hospital. Just these 2 incidents and Rancho and Pia are supposedly in 'love'. So deeply in love that Rancho stealthily visits her home at midnight to confess. 4. Can't take it either seriously nor with a light heart - The jokes in the movie are too lame to call it a funny movie and the seriousness of topics, such as suicides, pressure of education, etc is diluted by the cardboard characters and execution. Nothing seems realistic. 5. Too many WTF moments - There are just too many WTF moments that totally ruins the movie. Pia gets her father office room keys so that Rancho and his buddies can steal the question paper, when she learns that her father is planning set a very tough question paper to ensure that Raju fails. 6. The Chetan Bhagat episode - I can't believe the trio actually didn't even bother to give him a credit at beginning or just after the movie. I have read the book and seen the movie....and every major incident is used in the movie in one form as the other....such as lead falls for the professor's daughter, Raju's suicide attempt, Pia's brother's suicide, attempt to steal the question paper, Raju's family and lunch at his home (which is done very badly in the movie). It's just like you buy a dress from a designer, add your own elements and pass it of as your original. If you compare the book and the movie....the book is much better coz it conveys the boyish charms and their messed up brains (hence their action is believable). The movie is neither funny, nor serious, nor entertaining.",

The frumpy girlfriend with glasses was as dreary as his two student buddies. There is no one to compete with him here. Other than Dil Chahta Hai, I've never seen him act in an ensemble. For the most part it is the Aamir show all the way. Yes, he's a fabulous actor but having him take center stage with zero competition does him no favors and makes for a boring 3 hours.Nope, sorry.

Engineering and Medicine are like religion. Although idealism shown in favor of innovation and out-of-box thinking is certainly need of the hour. Boman Irani may be getting typed in \"Director/Professor\" cast; but then you always feel like a breath of fresh air whenever he is on screen. Sharman joshi had done good justice to his role. Madhvan could have done more justice to his role, but i feel his passion for photography was not aptly portrayed either; in order to have a convincing concluding scene.

            "content": "As I was approaching the end of the movie, I wished I had a scissor to clip off the last 45 minutes or so from the reel, so that I could leave the movie with a positive note. I fail to understand why would the film maker after delivering successfully the definitive message of \"Follow your heart, not the crowd\", try to show some impractical happenstance of 'vacuum-cleaner delivering a baby' or 'fresh-born-baby responding to Aal-is-well zingle' or 'a runaway bride'. Is it just to cater to the Indian audiences who could only settle for their heroes nothing less than supermen and always believe that miracles do happen in ordinary circumstances? This attitude of ours of seeing geniuses in our heroes had earlier given us before heroes who can sing like Kishore Kumar, fight like Dara Singh and dance like Michael Jackson simultaneously. Now our sensible directors settle only for heroes who can make a model of helicopter, top the class without studying, woo the professor's beautiful daughter, and .....hold your breathe....deliver a baby on a pool table.I don't agree that the movie has ridiculed that much the professors or the educational system. Quite obviously, all that were shown, were clearly for fun. In my engineering career I had never seen a single professor emphasizing in the lectures more on 'bookish definition' than 'understanding'. I don't also believe that a single professor of mechanical engineering would encourage his student to score high grades so that he could get job in an IT firm.Having said all that, I must admit that the director Mr Rajkumar Hirani knows how to move his audiences. With his theme of \"Niceties above rest\", he has always given movies that we can cherish and sometimes show to others to justify our actions (I doubt anyone would actually change his way after seeing any movie). One thing I have noticed that Aamir Khan is always good at these preachy-roles where he is smarter than the rest of the folks on screen and delivers his explanations of your-way-is-wrong-and-my-way-is-divine. Don't get me wrong. He is still my favourite actor and in this movie he has done really well to pass for 20 year old engineering genius. Honestly I have not seen a single movie where Boman Irani has done even an average job. He is excellent as always. From the remaining cast my favourite would be the guy who has played the geek. Music was good especially the 'Behti Hawa sa tha woh' song.I can understand why the Indian youth love this movie. It is the same reason for why people love Five Point Someone on which the movie is based. The 'I- can -so- relate- to- the- story- and- when- I-watched- it-I- relived-my- college -days' argument. I won't rate the movie Highly though I would consider it as a good one-time-watch.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)",

            "content": "Three Idiots' is a remarkable ahead of its time Bollywood blockbuster. This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.The producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.Overall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth.",

            "content": "The prospect of a knockabout comedy that lasts for over 160 minutes isn't an enticing one, but luckily the title \"3 Idiots\" is something of a misnomer. There's some broad humour, \"comedy\" characters and lots of scatological references, but also depictions of suicide and reflections on the human condition. Western audiences may find this tonal inconsistency hard to take, as an onscreen suicide by hanging is followed by one of many songs.The fifth Aamir Khan movie I've seen, he's an always likeable and engaging presence, but one criticism is that his characters never seem realistically flawed (Save for Dangal). Always the wisest person in the room, his \"think outside the box\" method of living embodies many of his portrayals and his passing of philosophy to his fellow students borders on preaching. Khan has the likeability and charisma to pull this off and prevent it from being too cloying, but in a movie where he becomes a famous scientist, redevises an entire system of learning and delivers a baby, it's something of a surprise to see him near a mass of water at the end of the movie and not start walking on it.Currently on Netflix in the UK, there is some issue with the meaning of words and phrases being changed when translated: I know enough to realise that the subtitled \"ass\" said around an hour into the movie is really \"dog\", but I wasn't aware that balatkar (rape) was said throughout the doctored speech scene, with it changed to a more benign \"screwed\" for the UK audience. An interesting article on how the difference in ratings between men and women could be divided (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-if-online-movie-ratings-werent-based-almost-entirely-on-what-men-think/) shows that this film would be over a hundred places lower if only the votes from women were taken. All, it seems, is not well.",

            "review_title": "An American POV: Very good movie, but longer than needs to be",
            "content": "First off, take note of the length of the movie (IMDb here says 170 minutes). You got that right, just shy of 3 hours. But don't let that scare you from watching the movie - it is a really emotional movie which will grip you for the full 3 hours.Second, it probably does not need to be 3 hours. I hear there is an American remake in the works. I am anxious to see how it will be done, and what will be cut because there is a lot of stuff in this movie which probably can get the boot. We Americans generally believe that all Indian movies have dance numbers, and this movie doesn't disappoint, with several useless numbers (useless in my opinion).Third, the IMDb synopsis, while accurate, refers to like...one quarter of the actual movie. In other words, it is a lot like \"Forest Gump\" in that the \"present\" that is initially presented (which involves Forest finding Jenny and his son, and then moving to Alabama, etc. etc.) is setup through the telling of the whole back story, which takes up the majority. Same deal here with \"3 Idiots\". The IMDb synopsis covers the present, in that three guys are on a journey to find their lost friend, but the real meat of this movie is the whole back story which is not mentioned in the least. So just keep that in mind before starting the movie. I say that because when I read the synopsis I came in with this mentality that this was going to be an Indian version of \"Road Trip\" or something, just based on the title, the cover and the synopsis (it really isn't).Fourth, this movie is nothing like your vulgar/sexual American comedies involving some good buddies and their adventures. There really are some useful messages in this movie, especially some that will really touch home with anyone who has gone through engineering studies (like myself).With that aside, the movie was great. The emotions are really powerful, the acting is really good - a very touching story. The dean (Viru Sahastrabudhhe, played by Boman Irani) really touched home with me. I had a teacher exactly (Yes, EXACTLY!) like this guy in my engineering studies. Thankfully for me he was just a teacher of a couple classes and not the dean of the school (whew!).The three hours really flies by because the advancements in the \"present\" story (the three guys on the journey to find their friend) are made after finding out the back story. For example, the movie starts out with a guy feigning a heart ailment to get a plane to turn home, rushing to a friend's house, waking him and rushing his good buddy out of his house (so fast that he forgets to put on his pants) all to arrive at this random location where they meet the third buddy. The third buddy tells them that they all made a promise to meet there 10 years prior. The next (very long) segment of the movie goes back to square zero to introduce everyone and educate (pun intended) as to the significance of the location. After that, the \"present\" advances to the next location. In my opinion, if the movie just focused on the \"present\" without giving any life to the characters, it would be very hollow. I mean just think if \"Forest Gump\" just started with him talking to that lady who tells him that Jenny's address is around the corner and he just runs off - you would never learn of Jenny's issues, Forest's history with Jenny, etc.My only complaint is that the movie is just too damn long, and there are things that probably don't need to be elaborated multiple times. I get it, Rancho is different from everyone else, and will excel at everything. I don't need it to be reiterated 10 times. I also don't need the dance numbers, they provided nothing to the story. If you have seen the movie \"Men of Honor\" I think you can understand of what I speak (Cuba Gooding's character keeps pushing through the barriers to achieve his successes over and over to the point where the movie is longer than it needs to be. OK, he beat the racist general. OK he beat everyone else in their times underwater. OK he beat the racist who cut his tool bag. OK OK OK OK...heh).All that aside, it has some really powerful messages that you can really take home as a future (or current) parent. I'd say that if you are current or prospective engineering student, this is a *MUST* watch. No joke. For graduates of engineering studies, I'd say you should definitely check this out to get a few chuckles, reminiscing about your days in engineering and to gather an idea of the Indian culture with engineering (if what they portray is true, I'd say it is eye-opening).If it was more to the point, and not as dragged out, I'd give it a 9 or a 10.",

            "content": "After some really bad experiences with Hindi Movies especially Mangal Pandey, I stopped watching any Hindi movie during first 3 days of its release and normally downloads them from internet except Aamir's movies. Though I have been eagerly waiting to watch 3 Idiots but still I read some 6-7 reviews on different websites before going to the movie. All of the reviews were positive so I decided to spend my money this time on theatre on first day first show.Pros1. Lots of hilarious scenes a. The Teacher's Day speech By Omi: Even if I give you the whole script of the scene, I can bet that you will definitely burst out laughing while watching this scene (an aged sardar had to go out of theatre because he couldn't handle so much laughter in the scene) . b. Scene at Sharman's house where these 3 had dinnerc. Kareena's Sister wedding scened. And lots of one liners too2. Awesome acting by Aamir After watching Ghajini, you will be amazed to see how this guy managed to transform himself into a 20+ college going student and actually looks like one. The spontaneity especially in the scene when he talked to Boman Irani during the cremation of a student makes him the best actor bollywood has ever produced 3. Camaraderie between Aamir, Sharman and MadhvanAfter RDB, this triplet has done it yet again!! See the scene where they are drinking on stairs and Sharman and Madhvan challenge Aamir4. Chemistry between Aamir & Kareena All efforts goes to Aamir for this who manages to look so young that this pair never looks odd and chemistry between them was also amazing5. Realizations in the characters All the characters except Rancho (Simply because I haven't find or heard of such a genius till now) in the film seems real and you can relate them to one or other in your real life. This brings the film all the more close to your heart6. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student (including myself who followed the blind race of Engineering & MBA without knowing what I really want to do) 7. Finally, each and every character in the movie fits in his/her role and has gone their true potential. There are many scenes to see that too like Sharman's dilemma and breakdown during one of his interaction with Boman, The way Boman's carries himself as an intelligent but cynic principal, Omi's character etc.8. SongsHonestly telling, before watching the movie I didn't like the songs very much but after the movie I am in love with them especially Give me some sunshine, All Izz well and Zoobi DoobiCons1. Kareena eloping from her marriageThis seems a little bit dramatic in an otherwise realistic movie but considering the whole movie I can bear with this five minutes part and in fact going by the reaction of other audiences, you will love this scene also. 2. Mona Singh Delivery SceneAgain, the thing which was indigestible for me was how a person can manage to create a suction device via a vacuum cleaner in such a short time and that makes Rancho an unrealistic person but I guess this is Indian Cinema and no movie can be a complete reality (this applies to Munna Bhai Series, Aamir's all movies, in fact I should not be talking about realism in Shahrukh's movie) Overall, this movie is worth every single penny of your ticket and you won't regret spending even 300 bucks on this movie. This is guaranteed!!",

One of the Idiot is actually a Genius, And he was not able to adjust with formal and usual education system rather he prefer to learn from around the world.The Movie slaps our Education system, this movie raises many questions which are reasonable. The Movie is a look back to our own College life. You will feel that you want to be in the college again, one more time or else you wish, at least the movie should have released when you were in College. You will enjoy with the 3 Idiots, cry with them and and will laugh with them. You will enjoy every moment of the movie. Its a blessing to have friends like that and a look back to our own Happy Days. The film starts from 'Good' and Ends at 'Superb'. Rajkumar Hirani, yes he did it again. and This is a Movie every Student and parents should see before going to a School.Aamir Khan is out there and shines bright. Yet again, he had come up with very impressive performance and the film shows his Dedication. Madhavan - Very Convincing and have good Screen space where he did well with his natural Comic One Liner so as Sharmaan Joshi. Kareena Kapoor is beautiful and very good in a Girl with small brain.Negatives: Yes the movies has many, though not as many as pluses. The Delivery scene was too much to accept and adjust. - Only unwanted scene in the movie. And in Direction / Screenplay point of view, This time Director had compromised a lot more than he does for Munnabhai Series. Comedy is very enjoyable but looses reality in few scenes and the Most laughable scene (Chatur's Hindi Speech) is more like a Comic and little lengthy. And Have you ever heard or seen a Dean of the College coming in a Cycle?@, that too 'A College which ranks the Highest for Higher Studies' as mentioned in the movie.At the End - the Movie is very Entertaining and can be rated as the most enjoyable Hindi movie of the Decade or 2 Decades or can increase few more.",

            "content": "An experience to behold. This movie evoked the extremities of my emotions. Most here on IMDb have appropriately lauded this flick, so any more appreciation on my part will simply turn out to be quite monotonous. I have penned this review to ponder aloud on the narrow lives of those who hated this flick enough to give it a one star rating.Frankly, I did not find more than one or two of the one-star reviews genuine. There is this one guy that compares this movie to the other top 250 movies on IMDb. How lame is that! I mean I have known only professional critics juxtapose movies just so that they could rank them; they are simply forced to compare movies. And judging by that particular person's command over the language and his lack of technical knowledge, he was not even remotely associated with any major critic; why then that absurd comparison? This same guy also cited something about the movie liked by 'mainstream dumb folk'. This comment in itself is dumb. Did he know that Shawshank Redemption was a mainstream flick, and that it was rated highly by the same 'mainstream dumb folks'? You are on IMDb for Satan's sake; this is the place where people other than professional critics rate movies. If I was forced to think like critics, I would say that there are more than a couple of movies better than 'Shawshank..'; Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, City of God, The Godfather, to name a few. Hope you get the point.There were a couple of other guys who actually slammed the acting. I wonder, do they even know anything about acting? Being an actor of a small repute myself, I would have no qualms against the acting prowess of the performers, apart from a negligible few areas that needed improvement. And from a consumer's eyes, they made me believe, and there is no higher praise than that.Well, if they are hard-to-please enough to rate the movie a one, why didn't any of them comment on the direction? That is because either there were hardly any points in regards with direction that they could criticize, or they are not literate enough to even know anything about direction.There was this other guy that liked 'Five Point Someone' more. He felt that the movie didn't do justice to the novella. I can only say that the person's list of favorite books would most certainly not be to my taste. I obviously won't say this unless I had read the book, and I wonder how it was successful commercially. The movie is way better than the book. Hell, I shouldn't even be comparing the two.Some other guys claimed that the movie wasn't realistic. Now, since when has the Dark Knight, The Lord of the Rings, The Godfather, Shawshank, Psycho, or Casablanca - I could go on and on - been realistic. Some of them may have been based on a real phenomenon, but they certainly were not out-and-out realistic. We watch and appreciate these movies just for the cinematic experience they offer. So don't give that realism crap. Movies are meant to be a figment of someone's imagination depicted artistically.Some even quoted the movie's similarity to Munnabhai MBBS. Wow, I don't see where that has come from. It's like 'Django Unchained' is 'Reservoir Dogs' all over again. Wake up call! They are two entirely different movies.Don't even get me started on other haphazard criticisms. There were only 2 or 3 people in the one-two star club that convinced me in regards to their rating. Others seemed more like wannabes or trolls, or simply sad souls. I gave this film 8 stars, and dropped 2 stars primarily because of the songs, and its unnecessary larger-than-life portrayal. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.",

            "content": "Fine movie but over rated due to 2 main reasons. 1. It's a Amir Khan movie(assuming the country has a huge Amir Khan fan following). 2. It's supposed to be adapted from one of the India's top selling Author's book. The movie has a very pathetic head start. I never seen a taken off plane landing just because of a stupid Chest Pain\u0085 I thought Airlines were supposed to have Emergency Trauma Treatment and other First Aid services. Well neglecting that point since it's a bollywood movie its quiet fair. As the movie takes off almost till its mid section you may find certain Kicks but not a perfect comedy material yet. I didn surely notice that movie dictates some social values Even though I could see a good script building up only if the characters could have stood by it. The character of Chatur seems totally illogical, from his acting and presentation point of view it looks total waste of Reel time, I personally didn like it may be some mature actor might have Sufficed for it. Amir is OK as ever not a big deal to his role but had done pretty well till now. On with d latter section of the movie there is quiet a story. Boman Irani has been a perfectionist as always\u0085actually he was the only character performing queit a Role.As the climax approaches one can be certain that the movie actually deals with a major issue of student suicides in India but has been presented in a very immature way. Franly being a student of such a big and top notch institute in the country you can get kicked out for all the stupidity they play around in the movie. Climax is quiet predictable and artificial just as a numb bollywood fan would expect. All sets well in the end, those 3 stupid characters turn out to be quiet successful, Amir being the most among them. Actually I think that it could have been enough justice to such a fine move and it being provided with a satisfactory ending. Summing up the major pro' & con's in the movie are\u0085Pro's1. few scenes with quiet mature and good humour. 2. Message of the film A well-deserved strike on the existing education system where rot learning has become part of the life of every student's life. 3. And lots of one liners too 4. Boman Irani quiet well as expected.Con's1. As told before a dumb plane landing scene which actually makes me hate the movie. 2. Kareena eloping from her marriage.3. And lot of other minor dramatic and directorial flaws. 4. Getting in a hospital Ward in a \"Scooty\"\u0085I mean are we nuts to take that\u0085??? they were supposed to be shot by the security at the gate of the hospital at least audiences would have been spared of the further stupidity in the movie.Movie is fine for once time watch. Not a milestone or masterpiece at all. I can say that standard of Vidhu V Chopra is constantly falling when compared to his other movies.My rating : 6.9 / 10.",

Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since \"3 Idiots\" is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isn't really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and it's also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.",

Yes, if you look away for one moment, you may find yourself thrown into a plotline that involves a woman giving birth on a ping pong table--but that's all part of the movie's charm! If you're looking for a movie that will keep you hooked and singing along, look no further. This movie is the solution--for a whole three hours!!!On the other hand, this movie gives you a feeling strangely equivalent to whiplash, one moment cruising in the clarity of one storyline and then the next-- motoring towards insanity in a Bollywood cinematic experience of death. Furthermore, after three hours of gut-wrenching chaos, viewers can feel empty, lost and confused as a result of riding a (perhaps unwanted) rollercoaster of emotion. If half naked men in bubbly-bathtubs weren't surprising enough, be sure to stay tuned for attempted suicides, aggressive blinking (you'll know it when you see it), and downright disgust as men relieve themselves on dormitory doors. During its grueling three hours, Three Idiots managed to create in me each and every emotion on the human spectrum, but none were asked for or enjoyed. My best advice for you, dear reader, is this: \"Proceed at your own risk.\"",

            "content": "I generally avoid commercial Hindi films but I watched 3 Idiots because I was told that it does things differently. For the most part, I found that to be true.Story: While the theme of the story is quite valid it's hard not to notice that it was discussed by a very similar Hindi film starring Aarmir Khan recently (Taare Zameen Par). In both films Aarmir Khan plays a similar stand out role which create a continuous sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu. The main story line of 3 Idiots oscillates between being simple, heart-warming and humorous to outrageous and silly. This makes things pretty awkward. One moment you would be engrossed watching a story of two troubled students being helped by benignant idealist and the next moment the idealist starts acting like Jesus himself with infinite wisdom. The story never hits a good balance. Personally, wise cracking Aarmir Khan's character got under my nerves far too often.Acting: Acting for the most part was quite solid with the exception Kareena Kapoor. Either all Hindi film directors want her to act the same role in every film or she has been copy/pasted from another film. Most scenes involving her were predictable resulting all attempts at humor to fall flat. Direction/Editing etc: The film is pretty long which made me feel that editing was not great. There were a few scenes that were quite irrelevant and overdone. But 3 Idiots packed enough comedy and charming sketches to keep me interested until the end. The characters are skewed so much to black/white and right/wrong; the film gave me the sensation that the director wants me to enjoy the film in one particular way. There was very little to think about after watching. Visuals: Most of the scenery and visual elements used to drive the story along was quite good and well thought out.All in all, 3 Idiots is enjoyable and there are lot of things to like. It's still aimed at the core Hindi film fans but it's accessible enough for others too.",

It is so colourful and beautifully filmed, the storytelling is really captivating and unusual. I loved the musical bits here and there. The characters are lovable and hilarious (Rancho, The professor at ICE, Silencer). The cliches somehow seem fresh (escaping the wedding with the bride). But more than this, it has a really powerful message about love, true friendship, family and dreams.I asked a waiter at an Indian restaurant to recommend me an Indian movie and he wrote this and 2 other names on a piece of paper.

Wonderful direction, absolutely wonderful performances, lovely cinematography, the gorgeous Kareena and other wonderful actors make it all worthwhile.

IMDb editors need to look at the worldwide gross as well in case of non-US blockbusters like this one and not only the US domestic gross which states it as US$6 million plus here for this movie.

Kareena looks whimsical as a doctor and beloved of rancho, she does a good job. Omi Vaidya is just magical as Chatur and makes you laugh your ass off with his BALATKAAR speech. Boman Irani as VIRUS is fantastic as always.Although it is based on Chetan Bhagat's \"Five Point Someone\" but the movie has its own implication and character set up.

It is a very good film, which tells a bit about the pressure that students suffer in universities, pressure from teachers and family, the movie does it very well, arises every time the question should I do what I want or what society wants me to do, it really is a film that makes us think about it. Who's student will identify much with the film. The main actors are fantastic and do very well its role, giving emphasis to the 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad played by Aamir Khan, the film revolves a lot around this character and it just improves the value of the film. The soundtrack is incredible, and are sometimes accompanied by funny scenes and very sad too. Definitely the best Indian film to date.

However, that time passes by quickly, filled by a series of \"mini\" movies contributing to the overarching storyline of this film. But that's all beside the point.I went into this movie having not seen much Bollywood before, and thinking this was a twist on the 3 stooges. Boy was I in for a rollercoaster. I could tackle this movie as I usually do, dialogue, cinematography, set design, acting, and quality. If I did that, however, this movie would have a much lower rating. If I based my score off of how many people peed on a wall though... I want to acknowledge that this movie is old, many of the cuts and transitions are cheesy to the western world, most storylines were just there for the surprise, and some of the dialogue... \"not it chief.\"But,that's not this movie. If you go in expecting Christopher Nolan you will surely leave disappointed. What makes this movie worth watching in my opinion, are the heavy topics, themes, that it covers in a comedic yet straightforward, not pulling punches, way. I don't want to give any spoilers but to name a view of the themes, the robotic flawed nature of the educational system, the issue of suicide caused by stress, parents pushing their dreams on their children, and pursuing things that make you happy. Just by that alone, Woah, this movie is gold. And the comedy, it's fun, keeps it a very enjoyable watch!Major props to the Indian filmmaking culture for making this gem.\"All is well!\"",

The use of comedic flavor and serious drama complement each other perfectly to develop the central theme of the movie (which applies to a lot of people studying in countries where rote memorization is the primary approach used to study). Omi Vaidya is the actor that I felt really stood out in this movie. Aamir Khan and the rest of the core actors did a wonderful job in their roles, but Vaidya presented the perfect impressions of someone who has been corrupted by the flawed educational systems of these Asian countries.As for the rest of the components, they were absolutely outstanding. Hats off to Hirani and Chopra for meticulously developing a very realistic script and conveying a strong, profound message at the end. I felt that the inclusion of some of the songs was unnecessary, but that's just my opinion. This movie does span almost 3 hours, but the 3 hours will pass by like water roaring down from a waterfall.Whenever you get a chance, watch this movie. Not only will you laugh and cry, but you will also be able to take back a very valuable life lesson.10+/10",

Screenplay, Acting is superb. Aamir Khan is as usual brilliant but we also see noticeable performance from Madhvan, Sharman Joshi and Kareena Kappor. The person who has impressed me most is Boman Irani. He had been brilliant in this movie. Definitely worth a watch. Giving it 9 out of 10 only because Rang De Basanti was better than this.",

It's not like the movie is awful, but the its another Bollywood movie where protagonist is really really nice and talented guy and almost everybody else is his subordinate. Good masala, pinch of comedy and memorable characters makes this movie very popular but it bugs me why it is \"3 IDIOTS\" when only one idiot has all the attention. When the movie was released, I was expecting what was there in the book. A story about engineering life, how things get out of control throughout 4 years. This movie ruins book and it's essence. The movie talks about and engineering and somehow story turns to a cruel teacher and a rebellious student (I said a student not 3 students, because opinion and existence of other 2 is just there to fill up the space) . Somehow, our education system is culprit of suicides and creating trained monkeys. That topic was good too but they drop it in the middle of the movie and make it a love story. I will give a plus to acting though, characters portrayed by Amir Khan and Sherman Joshi are fantastic. Even Boman Irani is great in the movie. In the end, good guy wins and bad guy suffers humiliation we laugh , be happy and leave the theater amused. But I would suggest just think what you watched and is it really different from other movies you watched?",

This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.The producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.Overall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds. I mainly recommend this film to anyone who is unsure of watching a Bollywood film, yet I also recommend this film to every other person in the entirety of the earth.",

This film was released in 2009 and became a success as it became one of the most popular films worldwide at that time.3 Idiots tells us a story of three buddies named Rancho, Farhan, and Raju who attend the Imperial College of Engineering, an elite college in India. This film conveys and judges the educational system of India. Aamir Khan played Rancho in the role of a genius and motivational student. Ranganathan Madhayan played Farhan who was forced by his strict father to pursue engineering but has a dream to become a wildlife photographer. Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering to get his family out of poverty but is struggling to keep up with uni-life. Another character who played a big role in this film is their extremely-strict dean, Viru Sahastrabuddhe who was played by Boman Irani.I don't find myself watching Bollywood films that much. Especially comedy. I was kinda doubtful before watching this film even though my friend said it's one of the best films she has ever watched. A long 3 hours of comedy just didn't sit right with me- That was before I gave it a try to watch this. Never thought that this could turn out so good. It didn't start that well for me- but getting into the film for an hour, it was starting to get so entertaining and interesting. 3 idiots had success to make these 3 hours feel like nothing for me. The film; no doubt- leaves a great impression on me. I love how smooth the storyline goes. I never get confused when the timeline changes from ten years ago to the present. I experienced such a roller coaster of emotion watching this film. . Maybe because it is a Bollywood film, I didn't expect any particular scenes so the storyline for me wasn't predictable. All the humorous situations are present but then the story pulls back with a serious situation; poignant moments which could get you on nerves or even cry. This film was so nicely made; thanks to the wonderful script and the outstanding acting of the cast.This film surely tells you about the meaning of life; also a wholesome and meaningful friendship between these 3 'idiots'. The message in this film- I don't find anything new, I've been hearing from here and there that big grades don't mean success. You gotta believe in yourself, do your passion, and don't let others choose your life path. I'm always on the same page with this quote-unquote life advice. But this film opened my eyes wider and wider. It was because of the twist at the end of the film. Revealing the identity of Rancho. He proves that all he's saying to his friends and teacher throughout the story is right; don't chase success. Achieve excellence and it will come to you itself. He\nproved it in a way that I didn't expect, I was shocked in fact. I'm not going to say the details and spoils each scene that was memorable for me. You better watch this film for yourself at least once. Just throw yourself to watch it. I bet you'll have a great time with all the comedies and twists that you'll never expect.",

As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurises the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to \"Five Point Someone\", blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualisations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writer's liberty and the episode of Mona's delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that \"chase excellence and success will follow\".. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009, perhaps the decade!... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...one of the best movies of the decade... a must watch!",

Some director just don't know where to draw the line. Maybe a Farhan Akhtar was needed for a final editing touch :-)But the movie overall manages to fully entertain and keep you in splits or at times tears during the entire time. Would be a 9.999/10 without the turnoffs - exactly where it falls half a point below \"Dil Chahta Hain\", though personally it is funnier!Extremely well cast. Aamir manages to look younger than \"Rang De Basanti\" or any other recent movie - nice acting too from everyone! Even the LA based Omi Vaidya has done a great job in his first Bollywood movie, as a geeky irritant.Do not miss it for anything!!!",

            "content": "Coming from the director of the \u201cMunnabhai\u201d series, on the face of it, 3 idiots is a complete 'paisa vasool' (value for money) comedy. As with his earlier flicks, it has benign intentions at heart, and some lessons for the system. Vis-\u00e0-vis a goon do-gooder there, you have an enigmatic genius here who seems turn everything that he touches into gold; which includes smiles, encouragement, healing, love, creativity, tears and some hard lessons.The system under attack here is similar to that in Aamir\u2019s previous masterpiece \u201cTare Zameen Par\u201d: Education as he steps up his ire from schools to professional colleges that emphasize on cramming and bagging ranks. One of the gags says: \u201cif you don't run, you'll be like a broken anda (egg)\u201d. Facing the attack is the fictional Imperial College of Engineering, modeled on the famed IITs and shot on campus at IIM Bangalore.Drawing inspiration from Chetan Bhagat\u2019s \u20185 point someone\u2019, it tracks the lives of its 3 protagonists Ranchhoddas Chanchad or Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) through their college days, their battles with the dictatorial Director Viru Sahasrabuddhe or ViruS (Boman Irani) and a dabbles into Rancho\u2019s love interest and ViruS\u2019 daughter and a doctor, Pia (Kareena Kapoor).3 Idiots also tackles issues such as pursuing a stream of education against one\u2019s own creative interests or heart\u2019s calling, teaching a hard lesson to ragging seniors and an odd lesson to slimy nerds. While he goes about things, he gets Pia to fall for him too. Rancho\u2019s bold methods irk ViruS, the similar antagonist from Hirani\u2019s Munnabhai. Of course, as must all movies end, Rancho opens up ViruS\u2019 eyes towards the end.The funniest scene in undoubtedly is the one involving Rancho modifying Chatur\u2019s speech. While it had to praise ViruS for his \u2018chamatkar\u2019 (miracles) in the college, the modified \u2018balatkar\u2019 (rape) brings out the reality. With Omi Vaidya delivering it to rote perfection, you\u2019d be rolling on the floor laughing. Here, don\u2019t also miss Hirani\u2019s lesson that mugging up without understanding is \u2018balatkar\u2019 of knowledge.While it\u2019s not all perfect, there are times when the drama is overdone, especially the delivery scene on a TT table! But considering its other goodies, overlooking this is quite easy. The best goodie comes in the form of editing wherein it weaves the past and present events as Farhan and Raju accompanied by a vengeful Chatur try to unearth the whereabouts of the \u2018real\u2019 Rancho who disappeared during the convocation.Aamir Khan is synonymous with quality films. It\u2019s another thing though that I found last year\u2019s \"Ghajini\u201d purely average and it turned out to be a hit. But, with 3 Iditots, his sole release for this year, Aamir, in my reckoning is back to his glory days of \u201cTare Zameen Par\u201d. If the rave reviews and BO collections are to be believed, 3 idiots is a Smash-Hit. If you have still not seen this meaningful laugh riot, rush now for a bite of its 'gyaan' (wisdom).",

How many times do we have to put the pissing scenes ?!!\n2. Unrealistic. India streets are not clean and out of traffic like in the motorcycle scene.\n3. Too long with empty content.\n4. Too many stereotypes.\n5. Highly overrated, when you watch it based on IMDB score you expect much much more.\n6. Wrong messagesSome persons point out its positive messages !! Well ... I don't think that justifying \"achieving your dreams\" message should be justified through Bullying, falsifying identities, lack of respect to professors, or recovering after suicide. In fact, I think the messages are very disappointing.Some of the acting is good, the main song is catchy and colours look nice. But I do not see any other positives.It can probably deserve a 4 or 5, but I will just give it a 3 because I really don't understand how can this movie be so high in the top 250.I think the top 250 should give some weight to the credibility of the voters.",

No way. My gut feeling didn't go away. I've never seen a Bollywood production before, and it will take me a while until I decide to see another one. I got the impression for what I read from other comments that Indian people reacted very favorably towards this movie, laughed at its humor and somebody even said that he had a good cry with some of the scenes... Very probable, my total lack of knowledge of the language has a lot to do with my reaction while watching this movie, and it didn't help either the English spoken here and there interspersed with the Indian language, an English accented quite differently from the British or American accents my ear is accustomed to.It's obvious that different cultures cultivate different approaches towards humor, drama or whatever. I found the \"humor\" broad, simplistic, old fashioned --terribly old fashioned-- and as direct as a third rate circus clown doing his number for the illiterate villagers.I only watched a few minutes of the film because I found it unbearable, and only kept me in front of the screen the outstanding beauty of nature in that part of India. Fabulous landscapes! I do not mean to offend the Indian spectators that delighted on this film, I merely say that my western mentality is not prepared for this kind of humor, that's all.",

Its a hilarious movie, laugh-out-loud funny, and some scenes leave the tummy hurting. There's enough zing for mainstream cinema - which probably explains its amazing business in a couple of weeks of release. While Aamir is fantastic and totally believable as an engineering student (Defying his real age) and everything else about the movie is great, it's the attention to detail that got me hooked enough to decide giving it a second viewing. The plot is reasonably well thought out while originally \"adapted\" from Chetan's book. There are a lot of great things going for the movie - but i was sort of surprised to not see Chetan Bhagat's name anywhere on the credits. After getting out of the screening, got online to figure out what the deal was - and got wind of the huge controversy brewing. As nice a movie as this adaptation is - it is still an adaptation, and having seen the movie, and given the book a second read to get my facts right - i can honestly state that a lot more than half the movie is a lift from the book, so the claim that the screenplay is original does take something away from the whole experience (The film makers claim that the end rolling credits have Chetan Bhagat's name is pretty funny - because frankly, how many stick around to watch the rolling credits!?) Note: I am in no way related to or have any affiliations with Chetan Bhagat. This is just my opinion after having read the book, and watched the movie - to make sense of the lack of credit where its due.",

A story of three very different young men during their college days and ten years later, the film is intelligent in its direction, editing and chronology.I never thought I would like Bollywood films, but this is now the third that I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed. My only distraction and down point is the subtitles which are hard to read in such a fast paced film, especially during the upbeat musical numbers. It really takes away from the viewing experience. I also didn't like that some of it was in English, as I lost track of the titles whilst thinking it was safe to just listen.On a side note, I am now in love with Aamir Khan, who comes across very well as the lead character.A fun story with a valid point.",

The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token 'love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite 'feel good' film that the whole family will enjoy.

They have made a perfect hero and a perfect villain which itself a trait of poor film-making. A really good film should not tell clearly \"hey this is the 'good guy' and look that one is the 'bad guy'\". It should be able to see some good in the 'bad guy' and also some bad in the 'good guy'. Real life does never have perfect heroes and perfect villains, all people are imperfect. This film has has stooped to that cheap superficiality of a crowd-puller. From the beginning till the end they have gone with a motive, there has been no spontaneity. Only redeeming feature has been probably the pleasing musicals. My rating : 4/10 - rotten",

I think the story was very well played out and that the story and ideas fit in very well together.The performances were splendid. As always, Aamir Khan never fails to impress. He played Rancho to the finest of his abilities. He had everything- from perfect comic timing to perfect emotions for serious scenes. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan also impressed and did their roles well. Kareena Kapoor was exceptional in her role; she fit it well. Omi Vaidya really impressed me, even though he can't speak Hindi he was still hilarious. And Boman Irani gave perhaps one of his finest performances. The accent, the style, the lisp, he did everything well.Rajkumar Hirani, the director, is one of the finest film makers ever in Hindi Cinema. He makes good, thoughtful films which aren't mindless and are worth your time, and this film is definitely worth your time. His direction was superb.Overall, if you are looking for an entertaining, relatable, heartfelt, emotional, romantic, and serious film, watch 3 Idiots. Especially if you are in college or school, as you will then enjoy it even more. This is one of the best Indian films ever made.",

            "content": "3 idiots i a great film, that portrays 3 boys in college and the funny antics they get up to while in this process. The film shows how learning can be made fun, and as long as you love what you do, you will succeed in it. but the film isn't all fun and games, the movie portrays the flaws that India currently have in their educational system, it also shows that not everyone can do what they love as the pressure put upon them by their families can be an argument to persuade anyone, the movie shows a suicide, this really shocks the viewers, and the fact is that the film isn't a fictional one and when a person fails, they do commit suicide, I'm not saying all do but quite a few. They also show the hypocrisy of class and how though everyone thought the main character was a wealthy heir he was no more than a servant posing for the heir who could not even understand engineering. The birth of the headmasters grandchild makes the viewer see that the educational system can change, along with the people running it, and the stereotype of a woman being a doctor and a man becoming an engineer becomes to deteriorate. All in all a great film, and worthy for its position in the top 250 films",

So let me relieve the stress by stating that this is not the greatest Hindi movie ever - it however is a very good movie. Raju Hirani shows again that some pretty serious issues can be delivered in the most rib-ticklingly funny way.This movie has raised all kinds of fundamental questions - but at it heart it talks about all of us living our lives doing something we love rather than what is expected by society alone. It also talks about a failed education system where our best institutes do not churn out innovation. That is real and true. We as a country put too much emphasis on academics - rather than on learning. Back to the movie - it has some of the best written characters I have seen in a while - Rancho, Virus, Silencer and Farhan... It also has some of the funniest scenes - the wedding gate crashers, the valedictory speech and of course the ragging scene at the start. All the raucous humour takes away from some the spectacular screenplay - as the friends undertake a roadtrip to find rancho.Few inconsistencies - that these two chaps would wake up 5 odd years later to find out about their friend (as also his lady love)...but overall it is a memorable film. Will it remain a cult film like Dil Chahta Hai or Lagaan (or even Lage Raho Munnabhai) - one that stands the test of time - not sure.",

The film suffers from over sentimentalism and also its a abit impractical if u have a pragmatic look at it, however not every 1 wants a realistic movie.Few funny moments but not much in it especially if we compare it to earlier 2 big successes of Rajkumar hirani, i.e the 'munna bhai' series.The theme is nothing new as it emphasizes on doing in your life what is your natural talent, this reminds me of 'taare zameen par', & can u guess what is strikingly common?...Yes Amir khan. The 'ace' khan as few may call him does a comedy flick after sometime. He looks abit too old for teenage character but then again this detail is overlooked when that supposed teenager is a good actor like he is.The score of the film is good especially 2 dance numbers.In the end its an over the top comedy flick, average fan of commercial Indian movies & teenagers should love it.

My only problem with the movie is ---1) Unoriginal - I understand that the original concept was developed by Mr Hirani himself, but nonetheless, its not fresh. Might as well call it \"Munnabhai BSc - THE DEJA VU\". I guess since the west has the 3 stooges, and 3 musketeers, we need something too right? 2) Old Jokes - the common urban legend of spending millions of dollars on a space pen instead of using a pencil, and \"how does a motor start\", and the fact that indians only want their children to be engineers or doctors (we do have actors, cricketers, and politicians, don't we?), just too old. 3) Unrealistic - I don't even feel the need to explain this one. (I think Bollywood directors firmly believe in an old adage- \"Everything is possible\" and they follow it religiously in every movie. Be it bringing a dead to life by saying \"AAL IZZ WELL\" or stopping a wedding at the last second (how does this not get boring, i can name 10 movies that have already done this and i don't even watch too many bollywood movies) on a bright note, it is very funny (yes the jokes are old, but they are executed pretty well), please watch it and i apologize for being such a hater. I am just giving my 2 cents. Plus, I think everyone did a great job in the movie. I laughed my ass off on few occasions, but so did I while watching American Pie...and so I strongly disagree with those who think this movie is a masterpiece. it is not. 6.5/10.",

So the day this movie featured on TV, I watched it. And I have seen it every single time it comes on TV. And afterwards I began laughing at them because I had seen it more number of times than them. But well, immaturity aside, let's review this movie.The film talks about the rat race that everyone goes through, that we have been brainwashed into believing ever since we were teenagers. They always tell us that we need to get into a good engineering college if we want to have a good job irrespective of which field we work in, then that will play out when we have to get married, then we will have children and then the cycle will go on for them. We don't dare to think otherwise, because the elders always have a sense of insecurity about us and also because they always resort to shouting and scolding whenever we dare to question their authority.The film has become something of a synonym with engineering life. Everyone learnt about the various things that happen in the top engineering college, because I think this is one of the first commercially successful Bollywood films to talk about the environment. There are three protagonists, each being a stereotype of an engineering student we all can relate to - Rancho the brilliant guy who doesn't study much but still gets good marks because he loves what he's doing, Raju who is a superstitious and cowardly guy coming from a poor household, and Farhan, a student who really has a passion for photography but his parents are forcing him to do engineering. Basically the three types of engineering students we all know.Together they spend their college life in fun ways, teaching each other the meaning of life and the points of views of each person. And then after they leave college, they all decide to meet each other because of a \"challenge\" that Chatur, a teacher's pet had given them. Chatur wasn't exactly wrong from his point of view, since he came from Uganda, a country where Indians were being persecuted back in the late 20th century. He had learnt early in life that one has to take all means possible in order to achieve success, and that's exactly what he was going with.Every time I watch this film I end up managing to find a new detail that I had previously missed. I watch it every time it comes on TV because of that reason. It was only later that I got to know this is actually a book adaptation of Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, and those friends of mine who laughed at me for not having seen this film are the same people who ridicule Chetan Bhagat for his terrible books. And to be honest they are kind of right, since this is his only good book adaptation. And by good I mean absolutely flawless.",

Ever if you go and watch this film, just watch it as an mindless (supposed to be) hilarious ride, with almost every joke that you may have heard of. Movie loosely based on the spiced book '5 point someone' by Chetan Bhagat, makes you realize that book was cent percent a better read than the movie. Too long, predictable and TOO LOUD on being 'Ever Joyful Enthusiast Loving Caring' personality. Performances to be acknowledged are of 'Boman Irani' playing the Dean of the Institute & of 'Omi Vaidya' playing Chatur Ramalingam aka 'Silencer'. Best and most humorous scenes are filmed with them. In whole I am going with 6/10 for this one because, it did make me laugh out loud in some of the scenes.",

            "content": "The film is a classic work of the famous Indian actor Amir Khan. It criticizes the cramming education of India by rote and emphasizes the importance of interest education, diligent thinking and breaking conventional thinking. The protagonist of the story is Lancher. Because of the need to complete his studies for a noble son, he came to the famous Imperial University of Technology. This university is a dream place for everyone. The students in it have excellent grades, the principal is very strict, and also a very accomplished. However, the principal 's teaching method is grade-only theory, which may be similar to the Chinese saying \"only reading is high\".Lancher had just arrived at the school and said he was going to have a newcomer's gift. The other freshmen took off their pants to reveal their ass. When it was Lancher's turn, he wisely used the principle of urine conduction to tease the teacher who forced him to take off his pants. Everyone understands this physics principle, but few people apply it. The so-called theory seems to stay in the textbook or in the brain. At the opening ceremony, when the principal held an aviation pen to tell its origins, Lancher asked why the astronauts did not use a pencil. This question left the principal speechless. It can be seen that the stereotypes will not only limit the students ' Imagination, even the principal who has made a name for himself is no exception. Lancher's unique thinking gradually attracted everyone's attention and began to affect the entire school.Lancher soon met two friends, Fahan and Raja. The two agreed with Lancher's thoughts. The three of them have a unique style of work and often sing the phrase \"Everything will be fine.\" Their lives It is full of freedom. However, it is precisely because the three people are doing things uniquely, which violates the traditional education of this university, making the university full of enthusiasm. How much do their methods differ from school education? Among the students was a Chartu who studied hard, and he worked hard. Every time before the exam, he would recite a lot of knowledge. Of course, there is no harm in memorizing the textbook knowledge, but Chartu does not understand whether he is learning for interest, and I do n't know what this knowledge means to his life. He delays thinking, and book knowledge becomes his mindset, divergence and innovation. Thinking is severely restricted, and knowledge can not be used to learn and use. No matter whether the problem in reality is simple or difficult, he can memorize a concept in the book proficiently, and then the teacher will praise him for his intelligence. This is what the university advocates. Educational model. I remember that during a class, the teacher asked the students to answer what the concept of machinery was. Chartu stood up and recited a large section and was recognized by the teacher. When Lancher answered, he only said that the machine was a convenient device and used the pants door. The front zipper made a demonstration, saying that the zipper is a simple machine. Because his answer did not correspond to the concept of the textbook, the students all laughed. The teacher also criticized Lancher and asked him to answer in \"terms\". Then he said a large number of The mechanical theory, the teacher did not understand, asked him how to say so complicated, he replied, just tried to use a simple method to explain, and it did not work. Another time, the headmaster of Lancher got angry and was asked to give a lecture on the podium. Lancher wrote an English word on the blackboard and let everyone sitting in the dictionary look up in the dictionary. Who can find who wins first can be imagined. It 's time, and everyone did n't find the word. Lancher explained that this was a combination of the names of his two friends. Everyone was busy looking up the word, but they did n't think about why they wanted to check it, or whether they had a passion for knowledge. And longing to check. Obviously, everyone's mindset limits their enthusiasm for knowledge.The education of Imperial College of Technology is a one-color education, and everyone uses the same set of standards to investigate. I remember a student who liked to make airplane models very much, but when he was about to succeed, the principal discovered that he was angrily throwing away his airplane model, and also called his elderly father to tell him to drop the student. The student spent everything at home for the children to study, but was eventually ordered to drop out because he was interested in flying. The family members could not bear it, and the student could not accept it. As a result, he chose to hang himself. The pressure killed the student, but the principal felt confident that he was innocent. Lancher 's two friends also had their own interests. Lagar wanted to be an engineer, and Fahan liked photography. Their interest was not understood by the school and family. Their family conditions were not good. When Lagar was ordered to drop out of school, He also chose to commit suicide. Fortunately, the encouragement of Rancher, Fahhan and his family made Raga wake up. This time he no longer chose to escape, he dared to face himself and pursue his own life, and finally succeeded; Fahrenheid This time he asked his parents to study photography, but they were all opposed voices. After the events in Laga, Fahan once again expressed his determination to learn photography. This time, his parents softened and understood his son. In the end, Fahan became a famous photographer. The principal's children used to commit suicide because of the huge learning pressure. Lancher always insisted on his interest. That is why he chose his major. His thinking was flexible and he would not be constrained by the rigid system. Therefore, he always achieved the first major and finally became a scientist, with more than 400 invention. The principal's change of concept occurred when his daughter had a difficult birth, when it was raining heavily. At the moment of life, Lancher used his knowledge and reality to quickly come up with a way to save the mother and son. The principal held the newborn grandson , Saying \"Do you want to be a football star in the future?\" This sentence breaks the headmaster's way of thinking in the past. He believes that interest education is the most important thing. He also sent his treasured pen to Rancher, indicating that Lancher was the best student he met.Lancher chose a major according to his own interests. He had a sincere love for knowledge, flexible thinking, and opposed duck-feeding education. He was able to link knowledge and real life, and achieved world-renowned achievements in the scientific community. Lancher also influenced other students, enabling them to pursue their dreams courageously, and he also influenced the entire school education system. In contrast, China's education system actually has a lot of disadvantages. It is basically the same as the exam-oriented education, lack of interest education, and insufficient innovation ability of students. Perhaps China should carry out education reform, cultivate talents in all directions, and reserve a new generation of troops for the country. However, the environment we live in is more difficult to change or slower. At this time, we may need to make changes ourselves, so that we can start with a passion for knowledge and a strong desire to choose the direction we are interested in and remain flexible. The way of thinking connects knowledge and practice well, keeps thinking and innovating, and finally realizes our dream.",

The movie takes you in a ride of different feelings. It starts maybe as a common University comedy, but soon reveals to be much more.The whole educating system is put under question, behind what is a maybe not so reasonable argument, cause even if there are loads of people that are GREAT for their profession and don't get GREAT grades, the system evaluates only how a person adapts to a standard system to measure knowledge. All the same we can see a very different culture and values. Even in religion.The movie is all the time mixing deep feelings and thoughts, with a laugh and a joke. The songs also give the movie a pleasant touch.All in all, a movie to watch with A LOT of time, but a great movie to see, even with children to give them something to think about.",

This was nothing like I expected and it does not deserve more than 5/10 rating if not less. I usually don't review movies but this just made me so p****d off.Lets start off of acting: It was mostly overacted, especially Boman Irani and Omi Vaidya (aka 'Silencer'). Boman Irani was too bizarre and on the other hand, Omi Vaidya, who was supposed to have a good English accent (or did I get it wrong?) had an accent of a typical South Indian person. In fact, South Indians usually have a better accent from my experience. Aamir, Kareena, Sharman and Madhavan were OK (almost overacted), nothing special.Screenplay/script? Bad. Very bad. Repeats the old boring jokes and offers nothing unique. Looking at the fact they had an advantage of getting the idea off a novel, makes the movie even worse. The whole movie was a combination of stupid jokes which didn't make me laugh one bit (maybe hardly 2 seconds). It almost made me asleep.And about people actually rating this movie high, clearly they don't have much sense about how to judge a movie. Its a shame to see a movie like this getting so much attention while there are many others which are WAY better don't get what the deserve.May be I'm not looking this from a Indian-movie point of view. When you compare to other Indian movies, its actually not bad. But seriously though, if you're gonna include your brain while watching this movie, don't bother.I guess I'm off to watch some good movies now, if you're gonna watch this, good luck getting p****d off.",

It has all the ingredients of an entertaining cinema, however it just goes overboard with so many clich\u00e9s that by the time you are 30 minutes into the movie, you can predict the next turn of events that will happen. Heck! you could even predict the jokes! The most annoying parts were the supposedly funny moments - something which you have seen hundreds of time previously. Many of them seems to have been taken from email forwards that we regularly receive (remember the scene with mixing the examination papers, then pencil-pen astronaut scene, etc etc). Talk of originality .. !(the Five point someone controversy) The movie goes to extremes with emotions - why can't the story be slightly subtle? Everything had to be so loud, including the funny scenes - we are not in the Johnny-Lever/Govinda era anymore. Remember Khosla ka Ghosla anyone - that is funny and original.\"All izz Well\" seems just an extension of \"Jadu ki Jhappi\" - no originality here as well..! Hirani must have thought if something worked so well earlier why not reuse it. Boman Irani disappoints too with a very a very annoying accent which I suppose the filmmakers thought it would add to the film's humor. Why couldn't we have some \"fresh\" face - choice of Boman as the professor was obvious.Only good and refreshing was Omi's role as Chatur's - he did really well. Amir did pass off doing a 20 something college student - however his antics to play an overtly honest guy was really overdone in most parts.Just an overall average movie - how it managed to do such business, I will never understand ! May be the hype helped. Again.",

Kareena looks good but would get a 3 out of 5 for acting. The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high- pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference. So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non- conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.This would easily get a 9.5 out of 10.

I mean I don't have any right to dictate as to who should like which movie but after reading the reviews I felt a little nauseatic because almost all of them were steeped in vindictive propaganda and were not by any means not genuine critical appraisals.O.K. the humour sometimes did touch on the cheap side of things. But let me assure you this movie was in no way any more deplorable or depraved or Low than DEV -D or Kaminey , if that is what these gung-ho critics want to say.A sweet aberration from the novel, the movie has been well made. Individual performances vary like maxima -minima . While Aamir is ordinary , the supporting cast is exceptionally good. Sharman Joshi is a good actor who is being ignored . Omi Vaidya and his dialogues are great. The guy was suited to the role and he performed it well. Boman Irani is always entrusted with difficult parts. I say this because in many movies he has been asked to play the role of a real life eccentric with reel life eccentricities.Kareena is a big disappointment ( always has been ).The music is ordinary . I hate the song Zoobie Doobie . It is monotonous , boring and shabby.In the totality of things a great movie with some great defining moments. Even if you leave real;ism and social messages aside as also Aamir's hyped image , this movie is by all means a remarkable one and deserves to be watched once if not twice or more.",

Full of emotions and ups and down.It brings smile to my face, and tears to my eyes. A great movie.",

I hate art-sy movies that depend their own existence on some hidden fundamental meaning of how human existence is badly guided and the directors (artists know nothing about sociology, as much as they want to think otherwise) simply hand out the answers in a silver plate.The main character seems like the run-of-the-mill politically correct guy that thinks \"being yourself\" is one of the best pieces of advice you could ever grant someone with. As the movie flows his complete lack of respect for authority gets more coherent with what he preaches. Basically you have a few students that are graduating in engineering while having to cope with an extremely perfectionist professor. While the protagonist believes that the imagination of the students is as much an education problem as studying hours upon hours immersed in technical books. Their world views collide when Poncho, the main guy, falls in love with the professor's daughter. This is a funny movie while maintaining a strong message of not having to choose a high-pay job to be successful. Contradictions are bound to arrive, like family problems and old ways that always seem to die hard.Just forget that the film is desperately trying to output some kind of universal happiness through doing whatever you feel like doing in your life, getting ever closer to a modern day fairy-tale than the cheesy foreign comedy.",

There are a heavy amount of unreal situations, but still gives a few message. The message of freedom from frustration. Like- Listen to heart and be free, Be able and success will follow you and so on. The storyline is immaturedly developed. Some songs were also not necessary I think. If you take the movie seriously there are many questionable things. Mostly the movie is fake. The movie is well suited for those who thinks that movies are made to be unrealistic and a joke.There are few things I didn't like in the movie for example - Rancho is a great liar who lied about his identity throughout. Another one is that, does toppers resemble like Rancho in real life ? I think they don't and very tricky manipulations have been done to suit some irrational minds. The situations are unrealistic including the love story. The funny parts are not funny, rather seem very nuetral to me. I feel strange when entire nation laughs at that. Some funny things are actually horrible but are displayed as funny. The idiots are shown to be heroes sarcastically. The movie should have shown the dangers the idiots deliver to society but it didn't. Didn't still understood why this is so highly rated. Mostly because of sarcasm I believe.From education perspective I would recommend Taare zameen par(TZP) higher than 3 idiots. In TZP it also mentions well about the individual talent that should be preferenced in opposition to societal race. 3 idiots is an attempt-to-be comical movie within that similar theme of education. Finally I will rate it 1 to balance the original rating but it deserves a max of 5/10. And it should be out of IMDb top 250.",

            "content": "\"All is well,\" the three \"idiot\" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.\nOur title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of life's greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his father's expensive health bills, his mother's fragile core, and his sister's inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesn't feel like work. If you're passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.\nThe film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesn't feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.\n3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I can't believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet I'm sure millions have been lead through this same life. It's the worst way of \"living through a person\" that I can imagine.\nThrough every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies I've ever seen.",

Give me another chance; I want to be critical on 3 idiots at least once.Unfortunately, I couldn't get a Rancho to fulfill this dream of mine.If only someone else would have played Rancho other than Aamir Khan, this movie would have been some what mediocre. Its class of Aamir's acting and timing which makes 3 idiots a special movie.Mind you it's not a path breaking movie like Taare Zameen Par neither a ground breaking revolutionary movie like Rang De Basanti, its actually a mild reminders to those who have lived their entire life for something they never wanted to do. It says out loud \"Give them another chance; so that they can grow up once gain\".Aamir as Rancho enters to lives of people who always had a dream ready to erupt in their heart but unfortunately their social and moral responsibilities were holding their hands from long. Not only Rancho teaches his friends to live up to their dreams but also teaches lesson of moral responsibility to people like Viru (The principal), this all comes with a brisk smile and amazingly casual attitude.The storyline has been loosely based on five point someone of Chetan Bhagat but there has been many alteration for good. It's not the story though which keeps you alive but the small bits and pieces which sometimes brings a broad smile (When Aamir & company says \"All izz Well\") and at times keeps your heart overwhelmed (Especially when Raju's father gets admitted to hospital). It has got some moments which makes you crave to give a tight slap to Virus (The principal) when he is at his best, harassing students. There are some laugh out loud moments special mention for the speech at Teacher's Day celebration. This is a complete masala movie with class of its own, some where in league of Munna bhai, No wonder it's coming from the same director Raju Hirani.What I like about Aamir Khan's movies is although he has central character but all other characters have their fair share of work. You would not see Aamir overloaded on each reel but still he will leave the best footprint. He excels and every time proves why he is known as \"The Perfectionist\". One more feather to his cap, way to go t Other than Aamir, Bomen Irani has played a remarkable role. As a cruel and heart less educationist, he played his role at par to anyone. You will love to hate him till the end.Sharman Joshi is one man who connects to audience effortlessly. He has played his lower middle class son's role impeccable. Kareena is her short but effective role of Pia is very impressive. She comes as a fresh breeze, every time with her scintillating charm mesmerizing the audience. The role of a jealous and self-centered geek Chatur ramalingam is one of the best portrayal of a non-protagonist in recent time. Only disappointment was Madhavan, with an actor of his caliber this was a very low profile character.Music is also very nice, specially \"Give me some sunshine\"; it surely took me back to my days at college. All izz well is surely a new anthem for young generation. Zubi Dubi is also a nice viewing. Director must be given most of the credit for making such a young movie with lads way above their projected age in movie. Excellent thought process and characterization; he surely is one of the most creative directors we have. Cinematography is also exotic especially when lense captured best of Shimla and Ladakh.The movie also gives an important message of how growing pressure on performance is driving young generation into depression and makes them to take wrong decisions in life. It also tell you not to run behind success but work for excellence and success will follow. As always Raju Hirani has gone with a message.Although their are some unnecessary instances towards end which prolongs the end but still It's a must must watch for all moviegoers and special watch for those who doesn't see movies as well.",

            "content": "I just found out that Aamir Khan has played in every indian film I have reviewed this far! Wow, he must be super famous in India and stuff.Anyway, 3 Idiots is an Indian comedy/drama, and it has two plots - the main one, which is told through flashbacks, is about 3 guys that learn together engineering, and their fight against the pressure-inducing, toxic system. The outer plot follows two of these guys as they drive to meet the third guy, years after graduation - since then, he just disappeared. So yeah, that's the best way to sum it up, I think.This film has so much stuff going on (3 hours, yeah, every Indian film that I've seen 'til now is super long), to a point that it makes me think that it could work as a mini-series, too. But, anyway, I wouldn't say that this film is boring - the plot has a fine pacing, most of the things going on are at least mildly entertaining. I do think that the ideas behind the film are mostly good and well-intended, so, it has pretty decent (though not that special) messages - be who you are, follow your dreams, pressure may lead to mental issues and stuff like that.Problems I had with this film:\nIt's kinda cringy in a lot of points. Yeah. Whether it's because of the dialogue, or because of a corny way that the movie chose to communicate an idea through, it just turns out to be cringy in a lot of points.Also, the music - why are so many songs here mixed in such a bad way? I mean...*sigh*. I know that the songs are not the main focus of the film, but they're there and at times they're quite redundant or irritating. (I'm talking about the music, the visuals are mostly cute)\nThe humor on this film wasn't that great imo as well, and yeah, it can get corny too from time to time, but it's not horrible or anything. Just not my cup of tea, I guess. It's okay most of the time.So, this film is...fine, I guess? It's overall enjoyable, tho it has a lot of corny moments and it never really blew my mind or anything, and a lot of plotlines were extremely predictable. But, again, not a bad film, it's just not really a good one either. I'm feeling a 6.2 on this one.",

            "content": "The movie starts of well with excellent wit and moves along a pretty good pace that sets up the rest of the movie. 3 Idiots is all about 3 friends \u2013 Rancho, Raju and Farhan (Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R Madhavan respectively) who have been accepted into a prestigious institute and set about to pursue their dreams.The three lead actors share excellent chemistry, along with the authoritarian principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) and the ever competing bookworm Chatur Ramalingam (portrayed by Omi Vaidya) in an excellent role that gives life to the movie. The humor is pretty good in the movie. And the way the director has managed to intertwine both comedy and sentiments subtly is applaudable.Going to the negative aspects, I felt that some of the humor has been taken up shrewdly from the internet, the scenes which include Rancho pawning the campus director after his speech about his acclaimed astronaut pen, and then there's the scene where Rancho mixes up their exam papers among the pile of papers of other students. These jokes have been doing rounds on the internet for years now.Then there's the need to insert a love story into the movie in the most conventional way possible. The usual bollywood type love story, the girl (Pia played by Kareena Kapoor) doesn't like the guy at first. And then the hero manages to weave magic (Chamatkaar or Balatkaar, choose for yourself) around her which leaves her intoxicated enough to fall for our irresistible Rancho.Hirani also manages to push the limits a li'l far with some scenes, there is a scene wherein Rancho tries to extract a baby using a vacuum cleaner which he manages to assemble all and well within a few mins when our woman is in deep pain (literally), and then there is the succeeding scene where the baby isn't breathing. However, it comes to life when everyone starts chanting the tagline 'Aal izz well'\u0085 (really???) The rest of the movie is well done which still makes it a full paisa vasool movie despite the flaws. Well written and most importantly surpassed by better acting by the actors who make up the movie. It would have been awesome if the the writer had managed to come up with some more original ideas. But still 3 idiots is one of the better Hindi cinemas this year. This is definitely not Hirani's best work, but one of the better one's indeed!!! There will always be talk about how movies aren't supposed to be taken too seriously, which is absolutely true. But in the end, its the feeling that you walk out with, that will define your contentment. If you read this review, you will find most of it is filled with negative aspects. The reason being, the rest of the movie is truly excellent, laced with sentiment and humor, which is a definite watch. Watch it!!",

But, yes, there's no denying that Aamir makes you forget all his past achievements as you watch the amazing actor play Rancho. To state that this ranks angst his finest works would be an understatement. Madhavan is incredible, especially in the sequence when he explains his point of view to his father. Sharman is outstanding from start to end. This was a difficult role to portray and only an actor of Clare could've pulled it off. Boman is superb as the vicious head of the institute. The scenes between Aamir and Boman are extra-ordinary and it's a treat to watch these two powerful actors clash on the big screen, without getting over dramatic. Boman's appearance, mannerisms and dialogue delivery are exemplary. The length of Kareena's role may not be as much as Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman, but she registers a strong impact nonetheless. Omi is excellent and the viewers are sure to love his acidic tongue and gestures in the movie. Mona Singh doesn't get much scope. Jaaved Jaffery is competent. Pareekshit Sahani is decent. On the whole, 3 IDIOTS easily ranks angst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favors: Watch 3 IDIOTS.

It doesn't envy anyone. He is not jealous of anyone. He doesn't hold a grudge on anyone. He doesn't intrigue anyone. He's simple and straightforward. The man's problem is to learn, to internalize what he has learned, and to teach others. His concern is to show the truth, to produce, to support, to facilitate, to beautify, to improve. While watching, every person feels the need to organize themselves. The movie also achieves its purpose.The movie is legend, but I want to draw attention to a few things. When Aamir Khan turned this movie, he was 44 years old. You look at Ran\u00e7o in the movie and you cannot believe he is 44 years old. In Hollywood, the actors are getting into shape for the movie, but Aamir Khan has overcome this issue. My education system in India was very similar to our education system, we saw this.\nThe 3-hour movie passes so much that you laugh, you grieve, the movie ends. But you don't want the movie to end, you want more. This movie should definitely be watched.",

They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them \"idiots\" The film gives us the opportunity to learn what life means,to stop believing that life is a race and shows that if we want to do something,nobody can stop us from doing it!I liked some quotes from the movie like \"Al is Well\" or \"Pursue experience and success will follow,pants down!\". Moreover,it includes jokes that make the whole movie lovely and really entertaining!The actors play really well,allowing anyone who is watching the film to become a part of it!.Furthermore,the funny songs and the wonderful images traveled me in India and in the Indian culture!There are not specific disadvantages!Although,the title could have been either \"Life of Idiots\" or \"Life of Rancho!\" These three hours that I spent to watch this movie where the best three hours of my entire life!Maybe this movie isn't the most famous one,but for me is it is the best!In this movie \"All is Well!!!\"",

Serious issues like students committing suicide under the pressure of performing well in the academics make you sad, concerned and angry at the same time. Another point to be noted is, Rajkumar Hirani has done an exceptional job in getting a college student out of all 3 actors (Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman)I strongly recommend watching this movie.

The movie was an excellent piece of cinema and also one of the best films of the decade in bollywood. Aamir Khan has made me his fan! He is the best and the most versatile actor in the world! This guy looked the most young in the movie, being 44 he played the role of a 23yr old! Madhavan looked a little old for his role but his acting was tremendous, Sharman Joshi was mind blowing! Boman Irani was excellent as usual! Kareena was fine! The screenplay & dialogues by Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi were hilarious at times (sometimes it made my jaw hurt), but were also eye opening in parts! The movie was a train ride, and the stops were emotion, drama, comedy, suspense (for a while), and much more. The direction was an absolute delight and the cinematography was refreshing and great (especially the aerial shot of the car going to shimla). The music was also excellent.Points.AAMIR KHAN 20/10.DIALOGUES 20/10.DIRECTION 20/10. STORY 20/10. SCREENPLAY 20/10. ENTERTAINMENT 100/10.

And they meet Rancho. Unlike them, Rancho is outstanding. He always defies authority, questions convention, and invents his own way. He encourages Farhan and Raju to live their own life. The three become best friends.I like every character in the film. Rancho, played by Aamir Khan, has piercing eyes that show his genius. But he is not arrogant and always loyal to his friends. Farhan and Raju each have their weakness, and later we see their strong development. The antagonists Virus and Chatur are not really antagonized. They are funny and I like them too.The screenplay is sophisticated and every scene is cheerful. Plot devices are precisely arranged. Some objects, lines, and events reappear later to show a certain meaning. The current timeline is set in ten years later when Farhan, Raju, and Chatur travel looing for missing Rancho. This road trip part is very exhilarating in the beautiful rural landscape.The dance scene, which is a fixture for a Bollywood film, is not of women wearing a sari in a palace. Instead, it is of college boys in the bathroom wielding colorful buckets under the shower. The 'Aal Izz Well' song is such an uplifting earworm.As for the theme, it deals with issues in the education system. I don't know about the Indian situation, but it's not uncommon anywhere that education is so focused on competition that students lose their true interest and curiosity. You will see a lot of Rancho's good quotes about the issue, like \"Pursue excellence, and success will follow\".",

Kareena, sadly, has been relegated to a corner but makes her presence felt in a few well-enacted sequences, but it's Boman Irani who comes up with the best performance in the ensemble with his brilliant portrayal of an eccentric professor.

Are we teaching our kids weakness, that if they face difficulties in life the way out is suicide??? Instead of showing will power strength when faced with difficulties, the movie went with over simplifications. Instead of telling \"when the going gets tough, the tough get going\" (The movie portrayed exactly the opposite, just to sensationalize and get raw emotional response from the audience, they used suicides). It is a very difficult even to try to understand why a person takes his life, what his emotional state must be, what his physiological balance must be.... and to over simplify the way they did in the movie is just plain irresponsible, sensationalism and poor poor poor story writing. Moreover the theme was repeated throughout the movie 3 times if I am not mistaken. The difference is, in our movies we like to portray weakness as a virtue.... and that is with our society too. That is what the movie wanted to fight: The social weakness Clich\u00e9--Become an engineer or else everything in life will fail. They did fight that point, but justified character weakness, will power weakness.The other point of the movie that bothered me was, are we trying to condone misbehavior. If we insult someone, are we not responsible for our actions? Should they be forgiven for misbehaving at someones house the way they did (peeing in front of the house, destroying property), just because they were drunk or whatever? Everyone is responsible for his actions and has to face the consequences. That is what justifies a civilized society from primitives. Forgiving misbehavior, is telling kids its okay to misbehave and steal. So what was so wrong when the professor showed them every action has consequences? He was trying to build character. But instead the movie glorifies the character weakness of the kids.I know that Aamir khan tries to make movies with a socially conscious message, he is probably the only one who is trying in the industry. I wish he puts more thought into his movie next time cause he might be capable of making an intelligent movie, instead of falling short.",

Lan Qiu does not agree with the high-pressure and hierarchical education system, so he repeatedly challenged the system. When he challenged the school system, he also helped other friends. Like helping Joey make an aerial camera just want to give him a surprise, although Joey had committed suicide when he finished the aerial camera. Lan Qiu also gives his Fahan an advice which is following Fahan's mind because Fahan was afraid of the pressure of his father and family, so he chose mechanical engineering that he didn't like. Lan Qiu told his friend Raga to release the pressure. In order to release stress, Raga turned it into the awe of the gods. But when it was about to graduate, Lan Qiu suddenly disappeared, so Fahan and Raja embarked on a journey to find Lan Qiu. This movie creates glorious, but it does not forget to expose the darkness.",

This film is a comedy movie with strong acting, memorable characters, a perplexing storyline and most importantly, highly motivational movie to choose the right path in your life.The producers of the movie expressed some amazing scenery of the mountainous landscape of Ladakh. These scenes were taken with various different camera angles such as high angle, crane and parallax shots. These colourful scenes were ingeniously used to infer that a happy and exiting moment was to come. I felt as though the film was very educational in the way that it tries to spread awareness and teach the viewers of the increasing risk of the school system related suicides in India. The mood of this film changes rapidly from joyous to depressing to comedic etc. In doing so, it made the film more exiting as I was always at the edge of my seat unknowing what fascinating event will take place. I used to think all Bollywood films are low budget with atrocious actors, but now I realised how incredibly convincing some of their actors are, even for Hollywood standards! These acting capabilities I have witnessed set a great example to me of how extraordinary Bollywood films can be and it intrigues me to watch more.Overall, 'Three Idiots' was an amazing film that really impressed me of how good Bollywood films can be. My emotions throughout the film was like a roller coaster, going from sad to jubilant in a matter of seconds.

QUALITY ! 3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride. It is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema. 3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens the audience. First Bollywood film to reach 100 Crore Club. The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line. Much more can still be summarized about the film. Lovely!",

            "content": "Don't know where to start or rather who to start with! It has been 3 years since we had the bombshell called \"Lage Raho Munnabhai\" from Rajkumar Hirani Factory and had been waiting for another movie which can exceed the previous two movie masterpieces. While we were still waiting for \"Munnabhai Chale Amerika\", Hirani dropped a nuclear bomb this time.Yes, this movie is no less than a nuclear bomb, in every terms, every aspect of it. Its a simple story about 3 students who refused to give up their dreams against the conventional norms of contemporary Indian Educational System, where marks and the degree certificate are all that is used to judge a student, where individual and unconventional thoughts are not welcome and suppressed every day, every hour, every minute. Its simple, if you do not go along the system, it will break you down to the point where you either lose your identity for the rest of your life....or just quit (read suicide).Yes, this may seem over dramatic to people, but student who suicide after facing the immense pressure of traditional grading system, expectation are not just in fiction. I myself had a friend, who stood before the Rajdhani Express train one day, because his parents expected him to always achieve distinction marks in every exam, which he could never do and on failing every time, his parents lied to everybody they know saying that he achieved 80% in the exams. Imagine the guilt and inferiority complex inside the kid, who didn't try to move away from the tracks when a Superfast Train ran towards him to crush him over.I am not trying to give away the story or post a spoiler, as almost every Indian College student has read Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, which is the base of this movie. Yes, Rajkumar Hirani has modified the story except for some key incidents and inserted the moral messages wherever he could.Result - the film has turned into a laugh-riot and tear-jerker at the same time. You will never feel over-melodramatic in a single scene of the movie, neither will you feel that some buffoonery is going on any of the comedy scenes. This is a movie which will keep poking you every single second with innocent heartfelt emotions and make you laugh, make you cry, make you clap, make you whistle.Coming to the actors, let's not comment on Aamir Khan's capability. He is just brilliant as an Engineering Student who doesn't care about scoring in an exam, but loves acquiring knowledge whichever way he can. R. Madhavan is fantastic and excellent as the narrator of the movie and a friend everybody dreams of. Sherman Joshi rocks with his highly expressive acting as the hesitating student, who keeps stumbling trying to follow the road his other two friends have taken. Kareena is looking very pretty and natural as the unconventionally strong girl who knows how to stand up against the wrong. Boman Irani is funny and brilliant as he smoothly carries the role of a Einstein-lookalike strict College Director, one of whom we have in every colleges in India. Omi Vaidya is the surprise package, who enacts the Hindi-learning highly-competitive student who can make a Parrot ashamed with his ability to mug up.Realizing how big the review is turning, I will sum up all the other small actor's work as \"Brilliant\"! Hats off to Shantonu Moitra and Swanand Kirkire for meshing the songs in the story so beautifully, that we don't feel them as forced. And salute Rajkumar Hirani for giving us another highly commercial movie which has more dosage of social and moral messages than any of his previous films.So basically, as far as I think, only stupids will not like this movie...and I am not a stupid, I am an Idiot. But that's just me. So go find out, whether you are an \"Idiot\"! The Idiots rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "3 Idiots is Rajkumar Hirani's latest offering after his previous socially-relevant Munnabhai series films. This time, he doesn't have Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi. So, this time we have Aamir Khan, Sharman Joshi and R. Madhavan playing college students. The hype is tremendous. But what about the movie? Our heroes enter a top engineering college with shining eyes full of dreams, and hopes for a better future. Life gives them a reality check in the shape of Viru Sahastrabuddhe, their dominating principal who believes that life is a race, and that is the only way it has to be lived. Rancho, (Aamir Khan, looking surprisingly youthful, but still older than an engineering student) keeps motivating his friends to learn rather than mug the subjects. While most people refuse to take the path less traveled, Rancho continues to excel on this path, and even beat those who take the conventional track. The frequent run-ins with the Principal, what happens to the friends in college is what forms the crux of the story.Loosely based on Five Point Someone, the story has been reworked and actually improved upon; but the screenplay loses some of the Raju Hirani charm. To make things understood in simple terms, he sometimes takes the help of measures that are not only over the top, but sometimes unbelievable. Why a principal would not rusticate a student after so many insubordinations and misdemeanors is beyond measure. The delivery scene looks incredulous as well. Some things can be termed cinematic liberties, but others leave you confused.Raju Hirani the director is in top form again. His affection for socially-relevant comedies sees him unveiling a new phrase 'All eez well' to follow in the footsteps of 'Jaadu ki jhappi' and 'Gandhigiri'. In my opinion, 'Lage Raho Munnabhai' was his best effort to date, and even though he doesn't reach those peaks with Idiots, it is very good work indeed. He is the star of the show.Aamir Khan as Rancho does extremely well, considering he is the most out of age in this movie. With constantly widened eyes and loose clothes, he gets into the skin of the tireless learner-cum-inventor. Though things he does look incredulous, he mostly makes them feel real. Sharman Joshi and Madhavan as his friends who are on the rote path only to be 'enlightened' by Khan are competent. Joshi is especially good in the principal's office scene. Kareena Kapoor is good in a brief, albeit important role. The real scene-stealer though, has to be Omi Vaidya. The actor steals the show as the stereotypical opposite of Rancho, Chatur. Note his expressions in the speech scene. Hilarious! Boman Irani as the principal is good, but the unnecessary lisp in his voice could have been avoided.Shantanu Moitra's compositions are situational and complement the narration. Zoobi Doobi sticks out like a sore thumb though, and seems more like an item song. Jaane Nahi Denge Tujhe tides over a tough period in the story, while Behti Hawa serves as an excellent introduction. The background score serves its purpose.Binod Pradhan's cinematography is commendable. I spent half an hour dissecting the introduction scene with a friend and we still could not figure out how it was done. The set design is good. The special effects, though minimal, are well executed.Final Verdict: With 3 idiots, Raju Hirani stays in the Munnabhai franchise, albeit with different actors. The story has its heart in the right place, but the execution is far from perfect. Still, I'm going with 3.5 out of 5 for this look at the education system.",

A drama about a severe dads and their youngsters, exceptionally educational in the way, it looks to bring issues to light and teach watchers about the rising risk of suicides in educational system.3 idiots recount such a kinship , among 3 college mates Madhavan as Farhan, Sharman as Raju and Amir khan as Rancho. Two standard understudies who simply scratch through and the one tremendous impact in their lives expert understudy Rancho, the livewire of the threesome who disturb the Dean of Imperial College of Engineering when tested, every one of them seeking after the field of designing when the one in particular who appears to have an energy for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father to become and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his fathers expensive health bills, his mothers fragile core and his sisters failure to wed all on the table.3 idiots is a brilliant, priceless endeavor in the realm of movies. Its actors are perfectly fitting for their jobs, helped by a content so human and valid for life that it is really difficult to accept and caught through delightfully alive cinematography to all things considered give us an excellent bundle not simply in the non-literal sense.It is a back rub to the guardians of youth and that is to quit applying strain to an all around worried segment. A thought that numerous youngsters are determined what to become in life early and are deterred from investigations or even close to home aspiration.This is perhaps the best satire I have at any point seen. I will rate this 10/10 and would recommend it to everybody.This is Khadija Urooj, enrolled in an undergraduate program at IPP Bahria University.

Under this intense emotional pressure from parents, students commits suicide when they failed to get good grades because they are not made to be an engineer.Once audience settles down from choking laughters, they are silently told college is not about pleasing your professors and getting good grades. One should really focus on earning knowledge. Even last grade person managed to get job.MBAs might not be happy to see this. When you spend every breath of your teen life to become an engineer and love technology and suddenly you do MBA and start working in bank. Whats the point? Leaves all of us thinking.Overall, movie is awesome with laughters and emotions well spunned together. Must watch for all youngsters.",

All is well! 2. These engineers are very smart sir, they didn't invent a machine which can measure the pressure on the brain. If they had, we would have come to know that this was not a suicide but a Murder. 3. Grades create divide. A=Masters, C=Slaves... 4. make your passion Ur profession and work will become a play/game 5. Life begins with murder. If you don't compete, you will die. 6. Life is a race, if you don't run fast you'll get trampled. In the conclusion, it is a film to watch then watch it again and again",

Lemme tell you why:-1)Aamir Khan's performance in itself is the highlight of the movie,nobody can carry off such a bubbly,upbeat yet so since student as amir khan portrayed,so if you really wanna admire one good piece of acting then you souldn't miss Aamir Khans role in 3 idiots.2)Laughter,more laughter and more laughter..there were barely scenes where you couldn't laugh and for the rest of the movie,or for the most of the part i had a big smile on my face cos it is that kind of light movie which never relies on sick jokes but natural comedy.3)The acting of the Professor aka Virus or Boman Irani in real..well that has to be for me a performance of a lifetime,this man has surpassed himself and many stalwarts of acting by portraying a hyper professor who wants to win at any cost.4)Beautiful songs,if your a music.bug no matter if you cant understand Hindi,even the instrumentals don't fail to touch your heart.but there are some minor cons with movie specially in the second half,the pregnancy scene of Kreena's sister has been too stretcched and the movie just did'not let the audience guessing..coming to the end..i had already figured out whats going to happen?cons are pretty minor.so if you have not seen this movie you must book a ticket now...or surely must a rent a DVD.after watching the movie you would surely say ALL IZZ well!",

Agreed some of the humor was a bit corny but still it keeps you glued to the screen until the end. Amir Khan was a class apart. Almost each of his scenes had some message in it, in a straightforward or comical way. Madhavan & Sharman were the perfect supporting casts. Boman Irani made up a truly memorable performance & Omi Vaidya was hilariously & annoyingly brilliant as Chatur. Kareena Kapoor too did good. Rajkumar Hirani has another movie etched into Bollywood's hall of fame.

Students at ICE all strive to become the best of the best, by following the norms & and endless repetition of the trivia in traditional engineering.Rancho comes to the college as a free spirit, his mind always searching for alternative solutions, and his heart always thinking of others before himself; and from the very moment he steps in the door things start to change.on their journey, Farhad & Raju are both reminded of the countless times where Rancho helped them to improve their lives, even if they did not realize it at the moment: like when his quick thinking saved the life of Raju's father, and when he after-wards would rather miss his exams than leave his friend in the hospital alone, or in his constant challenges against the \"system\".His alternative ways and desire to help everybody ultimately wins over even his old nemesis, the college director Dr. Viru: by also saving the life of his daughter and newborn grandchild.The title, the picture on the promotional posters, and the description of the movie made me expect a, perhaps forgettable, goofy comedy; something like the \"American Pie\" movies (no offense meant). But boy were I in for a surprise!The story is very well told, the music is beautifully composed, and even though I didn't understand half of the lyrics; some of the songs are still imprinted in my long-term memory.There are certain comedic aspects to consider, but what really stands out as my main impression of this movie; is how deep it manages to touch the subjects of social acceptance & friendship.Well thought, deep & moving.(The thing holding me back from rating this 10/10, are primarily some of the more goofy scenes, where you, for a moment, are ripped away from the thoughtfulness of the movie, and forced to watch an e.g. \"highschool-musical\" shower song) But still: Aal Izz Well.",

Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) who miss their old friend from college, Rancho (Aamir Khan) that disappeared after graduating. None of them knows where he is for five years until one day, Chatur (Omi Vaidya) contacted both of them and stated that he knows where Rancho is. And so their exciting journey started to find their missing friend. This story shows a huge criticism of the Indian educational system and the pressure parents give their kids to follow what 'they' think is best.This movie serves you a wrap of an outstanding storyline that would leave you holding your breath thinking about what would happen as the story goes by. Living up to its comedy, drama, and romantic genre, it is easy to find yourself laughing over the jokes and contemplating the characters' decisions in just a few minutes throughout the movie. The musical aspect of the movie is also delivered suitably in every scene, with each song varying from cheesy melodies to melancholic ones. The cinematic aspect of it gives a sense of reality, mostly accurate to the situations portrayed in the movie. It truly is a nice balance of refreshing and insightful, bringing up several heavy themes such as students' mental health, bonds of a family, and even the crooked reality that one can find in an education system.There are many interesting scenes but the part when the cheerful vibe just dropped and the scene where Joy Lobo commits suicide is shown, that scene just hits hard. Another favorite scene of mine is when Farhan and Raju found out that Rancho's real name is not Rancho, and he's just the son of the real Rancho's gardener. This movie is just so interesting with many surprising plots.Overall, this movie has been a wild ride. It successfully conveys the inspiring message of the movie through festive scenes and thrilling plot, in a way that is especially relatable to teenagers and young adults. Even to those of senior age, the message of the movie is applicable to almost every age group, making it truly recommendable if you're hosting a movie night that is supposed to be entertaining and leave a good impression to the audience.",

Those involved in the film have certainly chased excellence- they've made a great movie that entertains with humor and emotion, all while teaching some valuable lessons to students, their parents, and their teachers.If you don't know already, 3 Idiots tells the story of 3 friends in college.Two of them are mediocre students, who's lives are changed when they meet Rancho, an eccentric, but brilliant student with an unorthodox way of learning and leading his life. The story is told in a flashback as Raju, Farhan, and their college nemesis Chatur (nicknamed Silencer) journey to find Rancho, who has been missing for the past 10 years.I'll start off with the most appealing aspect of the film. It is hilarious! I watch both Bollywood and Hollywood films, and I can't remember the last time I saw a film from either that made me laugh this hard. I saw the film 2 days ago, and I'm still laughing just thinking about some of the scenes. And this is everything from the jokes, the comedic scenes, to the really funny and cool characters. But what's even better, is that rather than giving us yet another forgettable comedy, Rajkumar Hirani has managed to find an almost perfect balance between the comedy and the emotion, much like he did in the Munnabhai films. Similar to those, Hirani has put in some strong messages into the film. One, as I've mentioned, is the importance of pursuing excellence, rather than success. Another is the simple, \"all izz well,\" idea-- that you should try and keep calm, rather than worry all the time. As a college student, I could relate a lot to both of those. But that's not all-- The film also provides a good lesson to parents, that you should let your children decide for themselves about a career, rather than force them into one. Further still, it shows us the problems with the typical methods of learning-- the mindless memorization of facts-- which is much less important than learning to apply concepts. Next, let's talk about the characters. Right from the time I heard Aamir Khan and Madhavan were signed on for this movie, I've been hearing complaints that they were too old. I won't lie- neither of them look like they can pass for a 20 year old, but once I saw them on screen, I stopped worrying. Both give such wonderful and natural performances that I didn't even think about ages. This is especially true for Aamir, who just seemed like he was having so much fun with the role of Rancho that I just couldn't help but love him. Sharman Joshi also did a nice job with his role, especially in some of his more emotional scenes. Kareena's role was a bit small, but she still makes her mark. I really liked her character, and wished she had been in the film a bit more. The film of course, isn't perfect. There were definitely a few moments that I thought were overly dramatic, and one even a bit tacky. Also, the love story, although it wasn't meant to be the focus, was a bit under developed. Overall, though, the film is really heart warming and inspiring enough for me to overlook the flaws.I'd happily recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great comedy that both entertains and teaches. Looking at other comments on the IMDb boards and stuff, I'm reading a lot of complaints about how the film is unrealistic, characters are exaggerated, etc. Here's what I say to you folks- if you expected some kind of masterful art film, you came looking in the wrong place. This is a feel good commercial film through and through. So yes, Rancho comes off as unrealistically perfect, and the headmaster is a caricature. If this kind of stuff tends to bother you, I'd stay away from this film. BUT, if you're looking for a commercial, unrealistic yet relatable feel-good entertainer with some nice messages, I highly recommend 3 Idiots to you.",

            "content": "When I heard that Raju Hirani, Abhijat Joshi and Aamir khan were working on a project together, I expected something good. I was wrong, because 'good' is a gross understatement of a project as brilliant as '3 idiots'. Yes, I call it a project because surely it goes beyond the realms of just being a movie. I say so because this movie stirs a dormant chord in our hearts, a chord that was always there but never found voice at the right time. If in TZP Aamir Khan made you cry and understand, in 3 idiots he will make you laugh tears but make sure you get the point. I sincerely hope that this movie can bring about a social change that is urgently required in our country today. Yes, the story is loosely based on Chetan Bhagats novel but it's far from being a theatrical adaptation. It has a story which will keep you fairly intrigued, humor that you will love and a message that surely has a lot of depth. Three friends stuck in an engineering college where none of them like the way things are run. Only one of them, has the courage to take things into his own hands- that's your protagonist Aamir Khan. You'll like him from his first appearance on screen and end up loving him. In his 40's he looks supremely convincing as a cool dude in college with a kind heart. Throughout the journey,he manages to capture your hearts with a perfect combination of humor and heart. If in TZP we saw Aamir Khan the director, here we are privileged to see Aamir- the actor take centre stage. He is phenomenal in his role and leaves adjectives inadequate for his performance. Kareena, the daughter of the head of the college is his love interest. She does justice to her given screen space and surely gets a few hearts beating fast during \"Zoobi Doobi\". Moving on from the love angle to the larger picture. Contrary to what you have heard or might hear, this movie not only challenges the Indian Education System, it decisively rubbishes it on every front. More than that, it challenges us to question our way of learning, of questioning, of thinking. Here, Madhvan and Sharman Joshi deserve an ovation for being splendid throughout the film. The friendship you saw in Rang De Basanti among a larger group was easily matched if not bettered by Maddy, Sharman and Aamir. Boman Irani picks off from where he left in Munnabhai playing the comic bad guy of sorts to perfection. The direction is flawless in terms of plot, setting and casting as each character justifies his/her role to the hilt. Also credit to the director for a climax which is sure to catch you by surprise! If I was coerced to point out flaws in this movie, I would say that Aamir's fake name concept, continuity of the film(which is more than 10 yrs) was a shade unrealistic. Also, the music is good, but as I said earlier, good is an understatement for this film. The epicenter of this earthquake called 3idiots ( I call it earthquake because that's what it will causeat the box office!!) is \"Always do what you love!!\" All I can say is that the entire cast and crew of this project definitely love what they do because their work gives us ample proof. If you'v watched it, go watch it again, if u haven't then I don't know what you are waiting for!! Go watch it, enjoy it, feel it but most important understand it. My Rating:- 9/10",

First of all creativity is not something originating out of your own brain. That's not the right way. Ideas are always the same, just like the sun rising in the East. Its up to you how to view the sunrise and take it. There doesn't need any creativity in finding new ways to cheat, kill, lie, crime, f**k or bad things. That's not creativity. That's, in fact, very much evil. If you want such creativity then you are not a man you are a devil or daemon.That's what Rancho also speaks in the movie. Try to catch what Rancho speaks. He speaks about life, about philosophy, about aspirations and dreams. Creativity, in your sense as I just mentioned, is never helpful in making you a good and efficient man. It only pushes you more towards crime and evil. That's way too bad. A man doesn't need such creativity. Rancho speaks the same. We don't need something which is not productive. We need to follow our excellence, not success.Real creativity lies in telling the same story again and again but with different new touch every time. Just like you experience and enjoy sun. We can't enjoy everyday, but love it whenever we experience. Nature doesn't change, but our perspective and mood change. Try to get into good mood by forgetting everything, bluffing your mind.that everything is alright and no need to worry. That's the success formula for Ranchod das Chanchad. I love his formula. Frame your own formula, but don't try to waste your intelligence and excellence for the sake of \"creativity\" which is unproductive neither to you nor to the society.Education system is not in one person's hand. If any other country is as populated as India or China then they would experience the difficulties faced in Education system and Government. Try to express your sympathy at it, and try to help it - if possible. But, don't show your teeth at it or baffle it. That's the dignity of a homo sapein towards his race.

A movie like 3 Idiots often seems predictable, but predictable it is definitely not. Hirani's movies try to deliver strong social statements, and 3 Idiots is no exception, but in doing so, it never gets preachy. Just when the seriousness is about to border on being uncomfortable, they drop a joke that really works.At the end of it all, the movie makes you want to tell everyone to watch it. It makes you feel good. It connects with you, tickles you, but at the same time, makes you think, without making you think too much. How Hirani does it, only he knows, but AAL IZ WELL!",

Obviously, the first thought that comes to mind is, will the movie be up to snuff with the expectations it has created? Will i be happy with the comedy or is it going to be the few lines shown in the premiere? Is the movie going to be a typical Hindi film or something more?If i may?,i would like to stick my neck out and say that the movie was good. In that it satisfied my senses for the three hours that i was in the theater. As my friend put it, there was never a moment that our attention veered away from the screen. We never felt disconnected from the plot, never uninterested. The direction was beautiful, it was as if some brilliant student from college wanted to try something new and had brought in that fresh outlook. Also it was like a college graduate, as there was hardly an extra scene, the songs also told a tale and meant something. Cinematography, rarely do you see movies paying so much attention to detail. The lighting, the angles and the backdrop shots were great. I especially like the Pandong Lake scene, the tourism department could do with using shots like that and getting people to go to Ladakh. I am going in 2010. The acting in the movie was very free flowing, it didn't seem like there were any plastics in any of the scenes which is very refreshing. Boman Irani seemed a little repetitive with the whole Dr. Asthana acting in the movie but he kicked ass as an emotional dad. Kareena, Madhavan, Sharmaan were good in their supporting roles. Personally loved that Madhavan was the narrator.Aamir Khan - GeniusThe real hero in this movie is the well thought out plot and dialogue. The plot is going somewhere, has a direction and up to the last 20 minutes you do not really know where that is. Highlighting the current education system was worthwhile. Unfortunately the last 20 were a lot like a typical Hindi film, which is not always such a bad thing.All said and done, is this movie going to be viewed and appreciated by future generations?

But this movie made me really like the Indian film. The music in the movie is really cute and suited to the situation of the film, it honors the film a lot.The film talks about what each person thinks about what the university really does for each person. What are we looking for in college? We learn rote and seek knowledge to get a degree that makes ours get a job with a high salary and then worry about rice rice money things. And here Shadon is different, he's against mechanical thinking, he's looking for a simple explanation for the definitions. He really learns to love the industry, he wants to learn it. He did not pursue knowledge, he did not pursue money, he did not pursue success. Simply everything he does because he wants to know more, because he is curious, he doesn't wants to race with anyone in the race of knowledge, money, or success.I really learned a lot from this movie. I was very touched in the scene that Shadon send his dad's friend to hospital, as well as when the friend suicide, then also when the delivering baby scene. A movie worth watching.",

            "content": "Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example).Rajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met!Finally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid.Watch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me.",

I do believe that I'm allowed to comment on my experience with the movie.Before watching this film, I lumped it in with movies I call \"message movies\": movies that make it a point to shove whatever message it brings down our throats. I decided to give it a chance and I was surprised at how much I liked this film. It certainly helps that it's also a comedy. I have some small issues with the film and I did feel it could do a lot better, but it didn't prevent me from laughing and crying throughout the movie. What I liked the most about this movie is that it's not like those other \"message movies\". There are times when it does get a bit melodramatic and times when the humor comes off as forced. But when the movie is funny, it's really funny and it's easy to root for the titular 3 idiots. It doesn't play like an infomercial on the education system; it plays off like an experience, as a good movie should.I like to think the movie is a lot like its main character: fun, good-natured and, as Rancho would say, never leaves its students behind. All in all, it is a tad bit overrated, but it's a charming movie with a relevant message. People who don't like how the message was presented should just realize that it was presented so that the masses can relate and, in turn, get something from it.All is well. All is well. 8/10",

The 10 years later stuff especially was good and should have taken up half the film rather than just one third.All the suicides and suicide attempts were a bit too melodramatic and unbelievable. It'd be fine if it were really a reasonably accurate portrayal of school life in India---suppose say the average person attending one of these top schools is likely to be acquainted with at least one person who has attempted suicide primarily because of such matters.

Madhvan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani and Mona Singh too strikes the chord with the word Go. After watching the movie everyone will have a new theory in their lives of Aal Izz Well.The story begins with Farhan and Raju on a journey in the search of their friend Rancho (Aamir Khan) in the exclusive locales of Simla and Ladak. While their journey continues, the movie takes a flashback and unwinds the story of the three idiots of their college days- Ranchodas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhvan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).Rancho, Raju and Farhan are the students of the premier IIT College. Rancho is a different than rest of the students; he can't live the way others live. He is an overpowering thinker and also has the capability to change the people views. He leads his mates all the way through this irrational, high-pressure, rote-heavy and malicious education system and teaches them the way to overcome the stupid ideologies. And above all he tutors and guides them as to how to deal with the baddie of the college- the Dean himself, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani).On one hand, Rancho is a sensible thinker and on the other he is a true lover of the sweet girl Pia (Kareena Kapoor). But to make his life difficult and more complicated Pia is the daughter of Rancho's arch adversary Mr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.Above all the trio manages to handle their each problem and lead their lives happily as well as have fun to the core. The movie takes the viewer through a roller-coaster ride fill with loads of witty one liner and keeps tickling the bone as the film proceeds. The movie's classic humour gives no time to rest and one dies laughing; until one fine day when Rancho suddenly disappears from everyone's life. Post interval the movie exposes the emotional side of the story. The disappearing act of Rancho leaves people flabbergasted as the person who changed the people's ideology for life and thought them reasoning was lost.Rajkumar Hirani really deserves a standing ovation for the film. Like his previous films this movie to carries the message- A message as to how a student is pressurised and burdened under the parent's expectations to make it big in this world; and one who fails as well as is unable to bear this laden commits suicide. The movie is for all ages and makes everyone think.The script by Hirani and Joshi is perfect. Muraleedharan C.K's cinematography is excellent. The dialogues are humours and hard-hitting. Shantanu Moitra's music is average. The lyrics are catchy yet sensible.The actors are just impeccable and everyone delivers their best. Aamir Khan is rocking and this is his one of the finest work till date. Sharman Joshi and R. Madhvan are immaculate and unstoppable. Boman Irani is like other films totally flawless and Kareena Kapoor is superb.All in all, a must watch flick and one of the finest movies of the year. Go grab it!!! But the real hero of Three Idiots is the guy who gave us jaadu ki jhappi and Gandhigiri. Raju Hirani, you are the man! After all the terrible films and flops this year, you have ensured that in the end, Aall Izz Well.",

Omi Vaidya did an amazing debut to the B-Town portraying the character of Chatur (Silencer)...

'Virus' stood out in every criteria of shades of acting n impressed the audience most...IMO, the character of Javed Jaffrey went impractial sometimes...! 10/10 ... * MUSIC: This film shines with it's melodious n lovely Music composed by Shantanu Mukherjee... 'Jaane Nahin Denge Tujhe', 'Behti Hawa Sa Tha Woh' n 'Zoobi Doobi' are my personal favorites... 10/10 ... In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living...& this is the significance of the film...But, the message \"Success nahi,Excellence k piche bhago\" did not seem realistic at all n unable to accommodate with our modern Education system as well as our daily life...! .... Anyway, Kudos to the whole team of the film for giving us a gripping,entertaining,humorous Comedy film with some good messages...A movie to be cherished for refreshing everyone's mind... Good one n treat to watch it! ..... Rating: 8/10 Must watch!",

So Farhan gives up his dream. One day, an genius boy enters this college and made friends with Farhan and another main character, Raju. He is Rancho. His pet phrase is 'Aal izz well'. He is very good at engineeing and does not hesitate to say his thoughts or opinions to anybody who has wrong ideas. Both Farhan and Raju gradually trust him. As this is a Bollywood film, the scenes of musical are shown. Their dancing is very cheerful and energetic. This film teaches us what learning is. Some people thinks entering a great school is a goal. Some people thinks they have to be an ideal man or woman as the parents wish you to be. But Rancho has doubts about them. He thinks it is most important to cherish your dream. So he helps Farhan to make himself to be honest to his father, and Farhan can manage to tell his true feelings and becomes a photographer at last. I love Raju's attitude for leaning. He does not care about the grade in test or academic background at all. He purely loves to learn. I could not stand crying at his sincerity. This film is not only serious but also hilarious, so makes me laugh often. The ending is very very great. I want to watch this film again and again. And I try to keep the phrase in mind 'Aal Izz Well'.",

Considering that fact that most of the population in India is young and further that most of them pursue sciences as their degree and compete with a gargantuan mass of peers to stand where they are right now, the story just aims to get some saneness in our society, which the old wise men argue and the younger ones forget. Think and learn things for the love of knowledge, rather than the desire of success. It highlights the essential flaw in our system, that the person studying in IIT's and IIM's is not because of his passion for technology/managing skills but because of his academic abilities.A contemporary theme executed with contemporary brilliance and carefully dramatized masala to keep the audience entertained. If the medium budget films did well last year, mainly because of the realism in them, big budget like this has all the ingredients for a blockbuster. The plot focuses of inventive thinking, engineering design which, I , personally well relate to and share similar opinions. The plot is like any Masala movie, with a protagonist which desires a change in opinions and a climax which shatters the mindset of the pessimist, a love story, a friendship packed with chirps of comic relief. The strong theme just completes the movie and drives the message straight to the eye. Aamir deserves most of the credits for his acting while Vidhu Vinod Chopra and his team have done a commendable job with the sets, locales and editing and lighting.

            "content": "Aal iz not well\u0085education systemRajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra coupled with Aamir Khan have come out with an ingenious film. The film exposes the fact that the Indian Education System needs to be revamped and how well they do it. Picturized in trademark Hirani style, the film is a must watch for every student and parent. The current scenario where teachers feel that whatever has been taught in class is the only thing that the student needs to learn and a scientific or questioning mind is not welcome in the classrooms is shown in good humour. The student too gets conditioned to this rote learning or falling in line syndrome for earning favours from the teachers. The setting is in a premier engineering college of the country ICE where three students are thrown into the situation because their parents wanted them to do so. This is so true of innumerable students who are just following their parents diktat in opting for engineering. Madhavan wants to get into wildlife photography but is forced into ICE. Sharman has to do it because he has to succeed and support his family which is struggling for survival with an ailing father and a working mother and an unmarried sister of marriageable age.Aamir Khan is the odd man out in the trio with a penchant for technology and a sharp and questioning mind. But these threesome are found unfit by the college director (Boman Irani) . In the leadership of Aamir Khan they thwart the college's efforts to punish their waywardness but to no avail . By the time they reach the final year there are two groups \u2013 one the studious , loyal types and the other is the threesome who are mischievous and non-conforming. Time and again they pester the college authorities with their pranks .Aamir is not the serious study variety but is successful in topping the exams . This point drives home the issue that if you have the passion you can do it \u2013 you don't need to cram.After being rustigated from college, Boman changes his heart and takes them back because their ingenuity saves his daughter as they help her deliver her child in extraordinary circumstances and with the help of Kareena , who is a doctor and also Boman's daughter. Aamir disappears after his college only to be traced by his friends in what is the ultimate goal of his passion. The gags, jokes, ragging scenes, classroom sequences, romantic scenes, gatecrashing into marriages and all such bits in the movie are so realistic that all of us would have done the same in the colleges. Aamir is superb and looks the college student. He fails to surprise because each time he surpasses himself and has the uncanny knack of choosing the right films.Madhavan and Sharman support him to the hilt as true friends who are ready to crashland flights, gag car owners and ditch the college authorities to support each other. The light-heartedness is there but there are some touching family scenes too which makes the movie one of the best in recent times. Raju Hirani proves to be a master storyteller again. Swanand Kirkire's lyrics are youthful and meaningful. Shantanu Moitra's music is adequate but is the only mediocre thing in an otherwise brilliant film.Boman is his usual hilarious with grey shades . Kareena is beautiful .",

But this movie totally are beyond my expectations and also it has some common things with the current Japanese society.\nIt is no spoiler but this movie deals with the current problems in Indian society where one's academic career decides his/her life. And there are some scenes that I have experienced in my daily lives in Japan.\nFor example, there is a scene a the father of one of the 3 idiots denies his dream to be a photographer because the father gave everything to send him into a good college. It is of course that academic records matter but it should not be \"EVERYTHING\" in one's life. \nJapanese society still tends to put the most great value on academic careers and our university exams stress us a lot. Maybe all the students have to watch it to reflect on what they have done and will do (but only after the exams are over!).",

Aamir's introduction itself is a great start. I'll go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. He's got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. He's just first rate.

The cinematography was very clean and smooth. The story was amazing and inspiring. The musical parts are fantastic. For me, it is a perfect film. I liked every thing about it. The TRT was approximately 3 hours, yet every seconds and minutes of it was perfection. At first I thought it was just like the same \"common\" type of comedy film. But I was wrong, it was different. It was unique in many ways. The mixture, chemistry and transitions of comedy and drama of this film was done perfectly. This is the kind of film that all people should watch. This is the kind of film that will teach you a lot of moral lessons in life. This film will help enlighten people and I promise to all that this film will change your life.",

            "review_title": "A fresh coming of age tale with a big heart!",
            "content": "I just finished watching 3 Idiots and was rather glad I gave it a chance! The high rating on IMDb roused my attention to its existence, however the title seemed to suggest some slapstick tale (of which I am also partial too from time to time), though as I read the synopsis I became intrigued with the premise of a comedy/drama/Bollywood/musical set mostly in a college campus. I couldn't think of anything I'd ever seen before falling into all of these categories simultaneously and I also felt I needed to give Bollywood a bit more of a chance as my repertoire is quite slim in this department to date! I won't say much about the plot (my summary is about as much as I'd like to give away), as I watched the movie pretty blind of what was to unfold and I really felt swept away in what at times felt like an epic journey of twists and turns; nothing too ridiculous to prompt a 'WTF?!' response, I felt the pace of the film moved really nicely along with realistic and believable scenarios interjected not for shock value but to aid the storytelling. The characters were well fleshed out and I really came to feel a sort of camaraderie with this not altogether hapless but lovable bunch with the main character Rancho, especially likable despite his bad-boy status with the Director of the college 'Virus'. Sometimes I felt a few scenes played out a little like a spoof, feeling slightly cheesy, however I have a feeling some of this vibe came from the cultural gully you often find with having to rely on subtitles (though as another reviewer said, pidgin English is used throughout the film so sometimes you don't need the subtitles). If musicals make you cringe then I guess you may feel a bit like the scenes with sporadic bursting into song are unnecessary, but you have to not only expect this from Bollywood films but also value it as an important part of the storytelling in its own right; plus, the songs in this film are catchy, well crafted and appropriate for the mood attempting to be set. As a final note, if someone was to ask me 'what makes a great movie?', I'd probably answer something like this; It should make me laugh and maybe cry, then come away thinking more about the film and its underlying meanings. Characters should be well formed enabling me to fall in love with them (or even begin to hate them) so, caring if they live or die; to feel their pain and joy and be able to absorb myself into their adventure as though just one of the gang. The look of a film should make me want to make screen-shots just so I could take a closer look at the subtle fleeting beauty that is a single frame, and together, the mosaic of images creating a flow so appealing to the eye that it lends a resonance to the script and plot without distracting you from the deeper message. With that in mind I'd say '3 Idiots' succeeded on many levels and left me feeling satisfied, unlike many highly praised blockbusters of late which have left me feeling jaded and apathetic. There are a couple of scenes where, should I dare say it, 'The Sound of Music' came to mind, though I won't say why other than perhaps the beautiful scenery and the innocent feel to the actions of the characters in comparison to the overly sassy and promiscuous teenager of many Hollywood films these days. Overall, I think my score of 8 is fair given how the movie made me feel, it's lasting impression on me and the fact that I could easily watch it again- perhaps even adding it to my favorites list. I would recommend others to give it a go, even if you're not partial to musicals or Bollywood, or subtitles- so what?! You can always be surprised and I have a feeling you might be!",

Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's speech, the three some's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track. Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching. music looks OK",

Besides the funny parts - expected from a self described comedian movie - the movie was disappointing me... until it started the second part. This final part added the drama needed for a perfect movie: it showed us real human problems. Even more: it showed how to solve it. All in a funny way. The main problem of the movie was: should we follow our heart to do what we like in our professional choice or just do what our parents \"suggests\"? Other secundary problems - but not less important - were showed as well and all the adventure to solve it made the movie simply beautiful. Highly recommended.",

It's not only a comedy about three idiots' life at college, but about friendship, love, respect and life.The movie is told in two timelines. One is in the present, where Raju and Farhan are looking for their missed friend Rensho. The other one is in the past and tells us the story of Raju, Farhan and Renshos life at college, their problems with director Virus, their individual familiar problems, their problems in college and their problems in themselves.While too having typical sequences like the \"All izz well\"-Song the 165-minute-long movie takes it's time to introduce their characters and make us care for them. We feel with them in their crisis. We laugh with them, when they prank Virus and we laugh with them when they get in another unfortunate situation and Rensho saves them.Aamir Khan is a comedic master, his facial impressions and his acting was really great and I really enjoyed him, being the smartest of them all, while also not caring about being the best. His role is so humble, yet so smart, that he always finds a solution.Another point I have to look at, are the details. There are many details, many things that connected the two timelines with each other. There are insider jokes that are used more than once and you only understand them, if you have seen the movie and for that the writers must have been working on the script for a very long time.This was my first indian movie I watched and I hope, that other installments I will watch, will be as great as this one.

But time to think the Rajkumar Hirani & Bidhu Binod Chopra duo is also the same. This is their 3rd consecutive wonder, first without Munnabhai. I must say their movies remind me of the works of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, simplicity is their similarity.Every scene was so complete & flawless, one would agree that they didn't left any field related to the scene unresearch. The mix of comedy and emotion with reality was awesome. The characters never looked like superstars; but they were so prominent, so natural, their acts were so funny but realistic. Boman, Sarman, Madhaban thumps up to them. Omi Vaidya (silencer) will be a memorable character.The movie is around 3 hours long, but not lengthy at all.

About the myth of spending millions on a pen that could write in space, while they could've used a pencil. The people that work in NASA are not stupid. They wanted to invent such pen because the pencils were flammable and were made of graphite that can easily break off. And they only spent 1 million on research.",

The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.My vote : 10 !",

            "review_title": "\"A for Apple, B for Ball...\" - 3 Idiots Review",
            "content": "Since watching many Bollywood films at a very young age, I can confidently say that '3 idiots' is one of the best of all time. With the astonishing 19 wins and 10 nominations, 3 idiots has been a huge success all over the world, especially in India. Director Rajkumar Hirani has amazingly created this comedy drama, which manifests stomach aching humour to an arousal of common, emotional issues.\"Pursue excellence, and success will follow\u0085\" - RanchoThe film focuses on the lives of three main protagonists: 'Rancho' Shamaldas Chanchad (Amir Khan), Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi). The narrative sums up the stereotypical norms and values of how the Indian parents in India have traditional aspirations for their sons at a very young age, wanting them to become Lawyers, Doctors and in this case Engineers! It cleverly questions the education system of which grades and points are rewarded whereas knowledge and understanding is forgotten. The film begins with the two friends; Farhan and Raju searching for their long lost friend Rancho. A non-linear theme is present throughout the film, going forwards and backwards to the present and past, whilst explaining the story so clearly and explicitly allows us to feel part of their journey.\"Today my respect for that idiot shot up. Most of us went to college just for a degree. No degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife, no credit card, no social status. But none of this mattered to him, he was in college for the joy of learning, he never cared if he was first or last.\" - FarhanAmir Khan's character Rancho is played out extremely well. His persona of this happy, intelligent, moral character is easily recognised through his dialogue and actions. For example looking at Rancho's facial expressions and body language, his character is reinforced by; scratching his head, hands in his pockets, playing the Rubix cube etc. Amir Khan brilliantly perpetuates Rancho's character, allowing us to fully believe in him. Rancho is an unforgettable character, a friend everyone aspires to have and a person who will believe in you. Rancho heavily goes against the dominant ideology of how his friends' fates are decided by their parents, the unfair education system and the traditional beliefs. His charismatic, inspiring soul pushes his friends to follow their dreams, for example convincing Raju to follow his ambitions of becoming a wildlife photographer. \"All iz well\" \u2013 his famous quote is constantly repeated throughout the film, providing a sense of encouragement and a speck of hope. Apart from enjoying Bollywood films, I am not very fond of the gleeful songs in between lengthy scenes. However, having said that the music used in 3 Idiots was incredibly perfect in portraying the emotion, meaning and plot. One of my favourite songs used in this film is \"Give me some sunshine\". The song ideally sums up exactly what the protagonist is going through, allowing the audience to empathise with him. The scene provides a shock, where a young student commits suicide due to the pressure and stress of exam deadlines. The song builds up, which made me sit on the edge of my seat, preparing for something pessimistic to occur. I have to say, that the cinematography here was gratifying. In particular, the long shot of the protagonists' legs in the air along with the scribbled writing by him stating \"I QUIT!\" is one of my favourite shots.The songs lyrics \"Give me some sunshine, give me some rain, give me another chance I want to grow up once again\" precisely fits with the ambiance, emphasising the hardcore reality. I believe that this scene is very moving, as it allows the audience to realise the seriousness of these issues, which can lead to death.I have to admit, that even though I have watched this film several times, where I even know when the comedy is coming, I still laugh. I believe that this is what you call a film, allowing the audience to never get fed up, arouse emotion, relate to characters and most of all enjoy the humour. The concepts and issues, such as; the difficulty in gaining a degree, parental pressure, financial problems are definitely relatable to mass audiences, thus increasing the viewer-ship. 3 Idiots has to be one of the best Bollywood films. I cannot express how great this film is, which you must watch.",

Movie revolves around Ranchordas(Amir Khan) and his two friends Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi).Ranchordas(Amir Khan)as a Engineering Student denied to bound by traditional teaching practices and tried to convey,teaching is at it's best when it is served with simplicity and fun. Boman Irani as Professor Viru Sahastrabudhhe (ViruS) was the only piece in the movie who achieved it's purpose and he was so factual that he could make you, to thank God, to not to cast you in his class-room. Film editor has made a wonderful job to montage all sequences in a self-explainory manner and it was non other but Rajkumar only. Like Amir Khan's other movies he looked here stiffed too, he has failed make any appeal to audience but still his quick clear with perfectly synchronized mover made this movies alive and he had perfect timing for humor punches too. Cinematography is not the thing for director as observed from \"munna bhai MBBS\" and \"Lage raho munna bhai\" but his movies are justified as soon as these are kept in commercial cinema. All I personally liked in this movie was it's script which is soul of the movie but when conspiracy evolved from the all time best seller writer Chetan Bhagat for the story plot nothing was left in the movie. When you personally read his famous book Five Point someone you will also have the sympathy for him. Overall for a film critic there is nothing wonderful to write about but still is a enjoyable movie and in the country like India where dream sells, commercial movie flies",

            "content": "As an englishman I seem to have stumbled across '3 Idiots' the same way as many others working their way through the top 250, and out of the three Indian movies I have seen it is by far the worst. Female wrestling exercise 'Danghal' was passable, and the emotionally manipulative dyslexia film 'Like Stars On Earth' was barely passable, but alas I still had hope that '3 Idiots' would surpass them both. I was sorely mistaken.The titular 3 idiots are played by men clearly in their 30s and 40s despite supposedly being college age, with the main character being an embarrassing Aamir Khan. Like the previous two Indian movies I have seen, the 2 hour 50 minute runtime is an undeserved slog to get through, this length inflated by having a fourth-wall smashing music video every other scene. It doesn't particularly matter whether a song is appropriate for the mood of a scene, as shown by the song 'All is well', an awful pop song that ends with a tasteless reveal of a student having hung himself to death in his room. The plot of the film is difficult to follow, but luckily isn't particularly worth following either, with characters such as the antagonist being one-dimesional charicatures of 'authourity'. And that's not mentioning the female love interest, who turns up halfway through the film out of necessity just so the audience can be bored once again with shmaltzy 'romantic' ballads. The social commentary is unoriginal and obvious, with the main moral seemingly being to 'follow your dreams', although the characters and their actions are so unrealistic that this message barely gets through.'3 Idiots' also fails to earn it's tag as a comedy, and I didn't laugh once throughout the entire runtime - other than out of pure amazement at how awful some scenes were. This film's idea of humour is somebody getting electrocuted by urinating on an electric wire, something that made me unintentionally uncomfortable, all acted with melodramatic facial experssions that reminded me of children's entertainment.All things considered this is a really awful film, and my 2/10 rating isn't to bring the ludicrous overall score down, but is an accurate representation of my hatred for this film.",

He believe in cramp the books as long.It was a moral message too like we should not impose any occupation on our children's. I have watched this movie 10 times.",

Highly recommend this movie to any individual currently stuck in their life situation. This movie sure did also reiterate to myself - \" Chase Happiness and Fulfillment in life, not money and greed\".I honestly don't know if this movie received an Oscar; but it's sure ticked all the right boxes on mine!

            "content": "Well to start off, 3 idiots itself starts of brilliantly by introducing Farhan Qureshi (Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi). Boman Irani is once again at his best playing the Principal of the college Viru Sahastra Buddhe (VIRUS).Both of those friends are informed that their dearest friend Ranchoddas Chanchad (Aamir Khan) is returning. Shocked by the sudden disappearance long ago, both these friends come to the place where they have been called for, desperate to meet their Best Friend. But something else is waiting for them at that place.The movie has been wonderfully directed with scenes continuously revolving around the past and present at perfect intervals of time. The story revolves on how Ranchoddas witnesses the scenes of depression and sadness among students who are often dejected due to lack of scoring grades and supporting family pressures. In the mid time, Ranchoddas falls in love with the Principal's daughter Pia (kareena kapoor) very fine acting by her too.Well, not revealing anything more, the three characters have been wonderfully played by Madhavan, Sharman and Aamir. The movie has loads of comedy at many times but also delivers a strong and subtle message to all its viewers. Even the supporting characters have done their role exceptionally well which adds more to the fun quotient. All credits go to Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijit Joshi for plotting this script and directing it perfectly.The music can be rated 10/10 as it creates such a high emotion while watching the movie. Well to round it up, get a ticket for yourself now, no matter how high the price is !!! You ll definitely enjoy the movie though it turns out to be lengthy. (2 hours 50 minutes).Watch it now. It is a total family entertainer. Enjoyable for all ages. A Blockbuster soon to be.",

            "content": "It's absolutely true. When I first sat to watch the movie I knew I was going to be thoroughly enjoyed. There was a, very high level of expectation. And is absolutely natural though. Why? The answer is very simple. There is a name associated with the movie. ------------------------------AMIR KHAN--------------------------------- Being a avid movie goer I am fan of a whole lot of actors. But whether you have a favourite actor or not,you got to love this man. Specially to those who regularly follows Hindi movies I mean Bollywood movies. He always stands out in every aspects in which he steps into.However the character of RANCHO is his one of the best creation ever.I saw a huge lot of films - Hindi,Tamil,Bengali,Telegu,French,Korean,Chinese,Japanese,Turkish and mostly English. But, nothing ever prompt me or rather touches me so deeply as this to right a review on IMDb.The most precious part of the movie is it's acting crew. It is simply heart taking & heart breaking during the sad part as well. I am not getting into any particular actor's work but the main 3 leads are invincible so as to say in one word. Some may think that Amir is looking confused and over elaborative in some part of the movie but I think it's the need of the character to make it believable, not like another contemporary Hero who is king of his college and can't be disposed of. The direction of the film is very different from other Rajkumar Hirani's other film and mature too,of course.The music is simply awesome:melodious, sweet and is absolutely fitting with the movie. The movie is not great for all the above of these. It's only because the message for the contemporary and outdated educational system & the so-called social patterns in which the poor and lower middle class families are still running on the hope of their son's burdened shoulders and unblossomed futures. The things are so purely shown that you can't deny it. And that's the best part::Acceptance to the audience. So,if you are still reading this then don't just go and watch the movie otherwise you won't know what you are going to miss. As I said earlier It can change your thoughts about your life and future.",

Director Rajkumar Hirani has shown his brilliance and lead actor Aamir Khan displays his amazing acting talents. The movie's base concept is taken from the Indian novel 'Five Point Someone' by Chetan Bhagat, which in itself is quite noteworthy.The plot of the movie is very unique and sets itself apart from hordes of other, generic Bollywood movies releasing today. I actually do not prefer to watch a lot of Bollywood movies but when something as brilliant as this comes along, I don't have a choice! The plot grabs you and keeps you tuned till the last minute. It's full of suspense too and has two time lines running in parallel.The main climax of the movie will definitely surprise you but the standout points of the movie are it's comic scenes and dialogs and the message it gives out. The comic scenes are actually funny and will make you laugh out loud while not being stale and generic. The message it gives out about the education system pertaining in India today is spot on and accurate! And everyone wonders why it is a favorite amongst us students! The acting is top notch too and surprisingly even Kareena Kapoor acts decently! The standout actors are Aamir Khan for his role as Rancho and Boman Irani for his role as the crazy director of the college, Viru Sahashtra Buddhdev. He is one of the main reasons to see this movie! So there you have it folks. A movie which achieves great heights of success and is popular too. You don't have a lot of stuff which is qualitatively good and quantitatively known! Superb direction, plot, dialogs and acting. This movie is worth more than just a single watch!",

There are lot of motivational quote also in this film which you can use and motivate yourself in day to day life and working.

He assists his two friends, Farhan and Raju, by feeding inspirational advice to alter their way of thinking. The film begins when the two friends get together because Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) calls Farhan and claims that he has found out where Rancho is. All three of them get together and travel to Shimla to find Rancho, who has disappeared since graduation. While on the car to Shimla, a flashback story is painted which shows Farhan and Raju starting their college year in the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. Rancho has a conviction that hands on learning is the best and goes to class to learn, rather than achieve good grades. Farhan and Raju have their own personal dilemmas which is why they end up at ICE. The institution's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani) is also a professor known as \"Virus\" in the ICE community. Virus's traditional philosophies on education contrast heavenly to Rancho's carefree and easygoing love for learning. Rancho and Virus's daughter, Pia (Kareena Kapoor), fall for each other but things start to fall apart when the influence of friends is embraced which leads to bad choices  When I watched this film It was in 2014, it was a cold windy Saturday morning. My first impression was, \"here we go again, another boring film!\" Because after reading the title, my brain instantly thought this movie was a flop. But I kept watching because it starred the talented, Aamir khan, who is one of the best actors of Bollywood. The film was hysterically funny and inspirational. The song, Give me some sunshine, is very powerful as it relates to most college students' life. The lyrics, \"give me some sunshine, give me some rain...Give me another chance I wanna grow up once again...\", gives me flashbacks about my childhood and want to relive those moments again where the sun was shining bright; where the clouds would spit out heavy rain which would swell the plants and create loud intimidating drops that simply calms your soul. We are all tired and need a little rain and a little sunshine in our foreheads sometimes. The climax of the film is when Rancho and his friends are caught asleep behind the back seats of the class by Virus. They were all drunk, but Rancho and Raju were awake from it and up sitting down with their blurry faces. Virus walks in and calls, Raju's name and he awkwardly replies, \"present sir!\" The bottle rolls on the floor and goes down to the front row where Silencer picks it up confidently and takes a sniff. Raju is called to Virus's office and is forced into an extreme scenario: He is forced to choose between Rancho or himself to be rusticated from ICE. Raju is stuck between sacrificing his poor family or his best friend. At the end, he jumps from the window and is immediately rushed to the hospital. I think this scene sums up what college experience really is: it is about the decisions you make as you mature. It is really a heart touching scene for the audience. It creates the pathos appeal as the it kicks in with the lyrics, \"We won't let go of you. We won't let you go!\" It is hard to translate it to English, but the second sentence is inversed from the first sentence; this is done to paint an even picture in the audiences' minds because the meaning is same, but it is said in a different order.",

People are in fact like chatur.. Not all.. But at least 99% of them.. Who just go to college on the basis of the placements.... Everyone aspires for a settled future like Chatur Ramalingam... A good post in some big organization.. A beautiful wife / handsome husband.... A house of our own... Hefty fat salary... But hardly all of us get to see that dreamworld...

It is the story of 3 friends Farhan,Raju and Rancho. When three student enter the engineering college they faced ragging session but today we are enough lucky that their is no more ragging session and it is an illegal act. \" What is machine ? \" The definition of machine everyone in his class memorized the definition but they never thought that it can be said in very easy way only we have to know the concept and utilize it now in the movie Rancho said the answer \" Anything that simplifies work and saves time is a machine. In a warm day, press a button and you get a blast of air-a fan, that's a machine. Speak to a friend miles away - the telephone, that's a machine. Compute millions in seconds - a calculator, a machine. We are surrounded with machines, from a pen's nib to a pants zip, all machines \" . It is exactly the machine means. He guided his friends not only in educational way but also he gave some life mantras which is useful to live a live. \" All izz well \" - the song it doesn't mean everything will be well but from inside it gave a courage and strength to fight back in bad situation . Raju when he started to fight back against his fear he had reached his destiny that means dedication,hard work and if we control our fear and nervousness then we can reach out goal. Farhan was interested in photography but he was study engineering which doesn't give any interest to him from this we can say if you are interested in that course then only join otherwise not don't choose any option which is not make you interest and don't pressure your child choose according to you please give them chance to choose his or her(child) own interest course which he/she want. Rancho had an innovative mind he doesn't believe in only getting degree but he believed in getting lots of knowledge and applying them in real life. Practical knowledge so that we can apply in future.He always want to give answer in logical way . Another song give me some sunshine this song means lot I can relate every line.Once we grow up we want to have those childhood days where we enjoy our life happily without stress.Every parents want his or her child should score 90%marks then parent will gift watch otherwise stick but in reality marks are needed but if you can't score 90%then it doesn't mean you are useless we should always target 90%and we should also deep clear concept about the subject and have practical knowledge to utilize it in real life .It is an amazing movie it gave lots of message.

Absolutely fantastic movie which I believe is going to be one of the classics like Andaz Apna Apna was - an all time favorite movie you could watch any time and any number of times.Raju Hirani comes back with a masterpiece and it has perfection written all over it. Nice story, nice narration, superb acting and great direction. I was hoping the movie wasn't a remake of the book and was glad to see that the basic characters and storyline were picked up and everything else was original. The actors were very believable in their roles - not for once did they look any older than students barely out of their teens and blended really well into their characters. The movie keeps you so into itself and had so much to offer that when interval came, I started wondering what could they come up with for the second half but they came back with something even better!The story is of 3 guys - Aamir Khan as Rancho, Sherman Joshi as Raju and R. Madhavan as Farhan going through their 4 years in an engineering college and beyond. All throughout the movie they were their characters and not actors. The movies is beautifully presented and is a laugh riot and has some very emotional moments. It all fits together and you can totally relate to the characters whether or not you went through those 4 years of engineering college like I did. The storytelling is brilliant and it doesn't have second which I found boring or felt like forwarding.Music is nice - not great but it fits with the movie. The movie also has a message about the education system in India and is very true.10/10 :)",

Many a times, heart touching music and lyrics prepare a mindset to go for the show as it is released. Such was the case, at least for me, with 3 Idiots -I truly did't find a single song extra ordinary to compel me. But once i watched, it felt like each and every song is 100 percent situational. It really makes you believe that the songs collection is nearly perfect. Each song included has powerful meaning ... in simple words -Aal iz well.3-idiots is undoubtedly the best work of Aamir Khan so far. This movie has lessons and i believe it has contributed to many people alter their way of thinking. The best I believe is that you go for excellence, success will follow you.Considering this a masterpiece of Aamir Khan, I can't deduct a single from my vote.",

Maybe that's why it's one of the reasons we can bid 2009 a warm farewell with a smile..Rajkumar Hirani is the guy with the magic touch. After the enormous success of Munnabhai series, he takes another chance and delivers, and surely he delivers well, winning the heart of his audience again. He's definitely the \"Undisputed King of Comedy\".. Shortly following him is our Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad. No Spoilers please. Yes, I will follow the advice and proceed. Music is not extraordinary but it fits the movie and situation perfectly to the limit that you may even start enjoying it. Plot, loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's 5 point someone which I have not read and I do not really intend to read. For me as a viewer, it's Hirani's and Abjhijat's Joshi's screenplay that made me enjoy the movie and I would like to keep it that way.I don't enjoy bollywood cinema a lot. 10% of movies which gain commercial success and amidst all the hype can be 'in real terms' can be said good, one of this kind is 3 Idiots. You will enjoy 170 minutes of this movie that I can assure you. And 70% of the time, you'll be laughing. If you enjoyed Munnabhai's humor, this movie is definitely your cuppa coffee. Don't miss it but if you've got small kids, enjoy the movie at home. Yes I'm venting out my frustration at this point. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this.I give this movie a 8. I hope Bollywood delivers more such movies which we can enjoy and understand at the same time.",

            "content": "Rest assured, all ye Desi cinema buffs, Aal Izz Well in apna Bollywood. If 2009 can begin with Dev D and end with 3 Idiots, it is indeed time to sound the seetis and taalis for one of the most exciting years of contemporary Indian cinema. Truly, this has been the year of the I.d.i.o.t in movie lore: the Intrinsically intelligent, Downright smart, Inimitable, Original and Talented film maker, actor, story teller, musician, lyricist, dialogue writer and producer.3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communal ism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less traveled by.The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and cramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.So, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duh in real life and non-conformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.The high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humor and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially the child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.Amongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule length of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well.

Kareena as the independent-minded medical student is winsome; debutant Omi has a refreshing flair for comedy and Boman Irani doesn't ham or go over the top even once.Story: Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi script a warm and humanist indictment of India's rude-crude education system that prepares rats for a rat race rather than thinkers for a new world.Dialogue: Witty and wild, the film walks away with the best comic scene of the year citation with its uproarious 'balatkar' speech.Music: Shantanu Moitra may not have forced you to pick up the music album of the film but the songs do come alive on screen, specially Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well.Choreography: Avit Diaz has the threesome -- Aamir, Madhavan, Sharman -- kick up some wild fun in Aal Izz Well, while Bosco-Caesar rightly go retro with Zoobie-Doobie.Cinematography: The streets of Delhi and the picture postcard beauty of Ladakh are captured in riveting images by Muraleedharan CK.Styling: Designers Manish Mehrotra, Sheena Parekh and Raghuveer Shetty create the pucca campus look for our rumbustious kids on the block, complete with ganjis and capris. Kareena too is an archetypal Dilli gal with her trendy, not flashy ensemble.Inspiration: Chetan Bhagat's Five Point Someone literally comes alive on screen, although the film does not kowtow the book verbatim.",

It is loosely adapted from the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat.The film starts some years after the trio have graduated, but Rancho has somehow vanished along the way. In the exciting opening sequences, word emerges of Rancho's whereabouts. Raju runs around pants-less and Farhan pulls a stunt worthy of Hollywood on an airplane as they charge off hot on the trail of their missing friend.The film then follows the three friends from when they first met at the residences of the Imperial College of Engineering. In between, they get up to the usual mischief. The film explains that each of the trio is studying engineering for different reasons. Farhan is studying engineering to fulfil his family's wishes; Raju comes from a poor family and being an engineer will pull his family from poverty; and Rancho is studying because he is passionate about engineering. This sets the stage for the plot later on.\n:At College, they cross paths with various characters. The Dean of the College, Professor Viru \"Virus\" Sahastrabuddhe is an overachiever, having taught himself to write with both hands to save time, among other skills. He has his own idea of the perfect student and routinely patronizes students who do not meet his criteria. This comes down to most of the students at the College. Fellow student, Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, provides the comedic element of the film. Chatur is ambitious and believes that textbook memorization of engineering concepts is the way to success. He considers himself superior to others at the university, taking shortcuts to impress the Dean. His efforts often make him the lot of jokes and pranks among the trio, one of which earns him the nickname \"Silencer\". Of course, no film is complete without romance, and this is provided by the appearance of Pia, Professor's Virus beautiful and intelligent daughter, with whom Rancho falls in love.In the middle of all these, they crash a wedding, deliver a baby on a makeshift operating table, settle a bet, fall in love and have hopes and dreams broken, all in Bollywood style. The film draws on themes of filial piety, obedience, friendship and the importance of following your heart. It also subtly hints that perhaps while we study, not all of us learn. The trio live, laugh and love with each other while discovering more about themselves. As usual, there is dancing, music, drama, a catchy phrase and soaring breath-taking scenery. The film ends with several twists and leaves you inspired to take a closer look at your life.",

            "content": "Before I start heaping praise for the movie, let me point out to a few,very few average points of the film. The movie at several points turned too obvious , so obvious that I bet half the audience in the theatre could guess what was coming next . I don't imply the director always has to pull out a rabbit out of the hat or do the unobvious ,but I strongly feel not letting the audience see through the curtain is the best way to keep them glued to their seats . Also I feel there was a bit of Munnabhai hangover casting its shadow on the direction of the movie.There seems to be a certain monotonicity in the three films Hirani has to his name, but this is still pardonable.I would have to say a few scenes like \"the Baby Delivery scene\" were a bit off the hook .. nevertheless the audience loved it. Well enough of biting now let me write something good , very good about the movie .Rajkumar Hirani Take a Bow !!!! You did it once again you gem of an artist ,you in fact ended up bettering the Novel.The most beautiful aspect of his direction here is the perfect blend of portrayal of Humour and Emotions he achieved. One moment you are fighting hard to keep those pearls grilled in your eyes and the other you actually spill them out laughing . The movie comes up with a beautiful message , I mean what more can the audience ask for ? Another very beautiful aspect of his direction was the ease with which he geared in & out of present and flashback.The screenplay of the movie (which is a combined effort of Hirani ,Bhagat and Joshi(Mission Kashmir & Lage Raho Munnabhai Fame) ) is top notch. The music by Shantanu Moitra though might not appear to have hit the bull's eye initially but goes very well with the Movie.Watch out for the track \" Gimme Some Sunshine \". Sharman Joshi was just the perfect cast in the role of Raju and did complete justice to the role, but as one of my friends pointed out the character resembled the character of Sukhi from RDB. But still here is one guy who has a perfect timing for comedy and still shoulders emotional scenes with similar ease.The duration of role Kareena got might not be long but the character leaves her effect well.Madhavan too does complete justice to the role. Boman Irani is one of those people who just doesn't stop getting praises every time enters the screen , he does a marvellous job portraying Virus, The Director. In the end I must admit this movie belongs to Aamir Khan. Hats of to you sir!!! May be its his Incapability to do bad that always works for him . Not a moment in the whole movie would you feel that here is a 44 year old man playing a 21 year old boy..... and has looked younger than ever . I bet he would have made the odd 30's and 40's feel like being 20 again ... No doubt he in response to Shahrukh's King status Claims to be the Ekka (Ace) of Bollywood.Time for rating , As a critic I'd rate it 4/5 , as i thought the editing could have been better , and for the few momentary lapses here and there in the direction .But as a viewer who wants entertainment I'd rate it a 4.5/5 . Amazing movie , go watch it , you'll laugh , you'll cry and will in the end, end up walking out of the theatre with a message. A Must watch for every age group :)",

            "content": "3 Idiots is a comedy-drama Bollywood film with a bit of a musical genre. The story starts with two friends, Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman), who misses their lost friend from college, Rancho (Aamir Khan). They have been searching for him since they graduated, but no one knows where he is. And one day, Chatur (Omi), a guy who hates Rancho in college, contacted them and stated that he knows where Rancho is. So the three of them set out on a journey to find their lost friend. The story is about a beautiful friendship of the 'three idiots' and a satire about the Indian education system at that time.My favorite scene of the film was when Farhan successfully convinced his father that he wanted to quit engineering and start his career as a photographer. At first, his father was angry at his decision. But after all the emotional conversations, he finally decides to support his son. And also the scene when Raju did his job interview. He answered all the questions straightforwardly. Then the interviewers stated that they would accept him if he changed his straightforward attitude. But Raju declined the offer. He said that he doesn't want to change himself. However, the interviewers found him interesting and unique, so he got accepted for the job. I found both scenes interesting because it's the start of their new journey. Raju finally comes out of his fear, and Farhan finally does what he loves. And after the scenes, they both pay respect to Rancho, which is very emotional and heart-warming.For me, this movie is like a full-course meal. You could get all types of emotions with this film. I could feel happiness, sadness, anger, and other emotions just by watching it. I also love how they brought up serious issues, such as social pressure, depression, mental illness, suicide, the education system, etc. Rajkumar Hirani, the director of this film, did an amazing job by covering all of those issues in one film. This movie has two timelines in the plot. But you never really get confused by it because it is very organized. The movie is also very well-paced and entertaining. Although it is an almost-3 hours long movie, it didn't feel so long and was not boring at all. The actor and actresses also did a great job nailing their roles. The soundtrack in the film suits well in each of the scenes.3 Idiots is such a 10/10 film for me, because of the story itself. All the details in the movie successfully complemented the story. The message they were trying to give us is delivered very well. This movie told us to follow our passion, fight our fears, to remember our friends who fought with us from the beginning, and also to cherish every moment of our life because it all will become memories.",

Rajkumar Hirani once again leaves the audience spellbound with his amazing screen play and direction.The movie is a first class entertainer. Films like these are sure to be appreciated over the years to come. The first half of the movie is really good and Boman's performance is exceptional. The second half is good,but slightly drags in some scenes but it doesn't hurt the film much. 3 idiots is not only an exceptional film, it is arguably the film of the year. Hirani once again proves his caliber in handling serious matters in a funny way.the film tackles the minus points of the Indian educational system.the movie delivers a strong message and it tries to avoid melodramatic scenes as far as possible, which was the minor and only drawback of the \"Munna bhai\" series.I can't recommend the movie enough.Frankly, it is one of the movies which is worth watching with your family.Three cheers for Aamir,Boman and Hirani.

            "content": "3 Idiots directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The story of the film is about India's education system, which does not encourage students to choose their destination by their wish, rather than it forces us to follow the regular rules of the system to race.\nIn this film, we see a lot of characters Rancho(Aamir Khan), Farhan(R Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) are the main leading characters. They got admitted to the city's elite college, where they meet their principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe(Boman Irani). Who was very strict with his rules. For that everyone in the college was afraid of him but in behind everyone call him VIRUS.\nRancho was joyful and limitless who always gives challenges to the difficulties of life, takes it very lightly. Raju and Farhan were different. They were afraid of parents, teachers, and also exams. Both of them have their different family problems. In this movie, we see how Rancho changes their life and also their way of thinking. Here we also can see an interesting character Chatur (Omi), Who always follows the race and want to become the winner. Presence of Priya( Kareena Kapoor) makes it quite romantic and emotional. And the small argues with VIRUS entertaining the audience, especially the Chamatkar/Balatkar speech. Music & Choreography were really awesome. By watching this movie I personally enjoyed it a lot, and also inspired too. I will recommend everyone to see this movie at least once in your life.",

Just when you think he broke the Bollywood records with Ghajini, he does it again with 3 Idiots by a mildstone.

There was a period of time where I would watch this movie, or at least parts of the movie, multiple times in the week. Yet, it never got old. I still cried at the sad scenes and laughed just as much at the happy parts. This is because the events in the movie are just so touching and can cause anyone watching to connect with the characters. The movie deals with so many issues, such as the dichotomy between career and passion and the stresses and mental health of college students. It holds so many beautiful lessons while discussing these issues, such as what it means to have a true friendship, the love of learning, and the importance of resilience and optimism in life. The main character makes this movie what it is, and is such an amazing person that truly inspires me. He has such a passion for learning, is the best friend anyone could ask for, and is simply kind and loves life. He is grateful for life and his experiences in a way that is so inspiring - all he wants is to soak up as much knowledge as possible through life and have a positive attitude. That being said, the other 2 main characters also have wonderful backstories and their character development is so beautiful and inspiring to watch. I can say this is one of my favorite movies, and I will never get bored of it. The countless lessons this movie provides are worth the watch, and the comedy in the movie is very well-written. I struggle to put into words how wonderful this movie is. Enjoy!! :)",

He may not have as much as acting scope as in many previous movies like Mangal Pandey, Lagaan, Gajini and all. But still, He just turned out to be a teenage student in this movie.Watch his body language all over the film. See how we wears his dress. You just can't point his \"ACTUAL\" age. Before watching this movie, I had a doubt, how could a 44 year old \"MAN\" can act like a teen age \"GUY\". But he just proved that \"HE\" can. Being the oldest among the three leads, he makes feel like the youngest.The scene when he elaborates \"MACHINES\"; I just felt like watching Rowan Atkinson. How can a man act both like Rowan Atkinson in his latest movie and like an action hero like Al Pacino in his previous film (Ghajini). He's just irreplaceable.And the movie's screenplay, Wow!!!!! I should admit that There is still 20 minutes left to watch. But I just couldn't be patient to write a review for such a lovely movie. It is just Laugh Out Loud Movie. I am not Hindi guy and still I can laugh at many places. Watching with subtitles and still not every dialog's are loading. Still I am Rolling in floor. One thing that squeezes my mind is that, how can a commercial action hero do such a comical role without any care about his \"IMAGE\"? I agree, Akshay has already done it, but still, Isn't Aamir in a much more higher position than Akshay? (Am ignorant about Bollywood. So please adjust with it) Madhavan & Joshi had a very little scope in this movie I suppose. Yes, I still have 20 minutes left to watch. But I don't think that, this finishing 20 minutes will change my view from the previous 2:20 hours of the movie. This movie is planned to be remade in Tamil (my mother tongue). Sidharth of 'Striker' fame is doing Maddy's role. I don't think he would make some fortune with this character. But it IS sure, that Vijay of Tamil 'Pokiri' fame (which Salman remade in Hindi as \"Wanted\") who is doing Aamir's role, will hold back his Star value in Tamil Cinema after giving continuous flops.Joshi's role is going to be done by Jeeva who is really a promising upcoming artist. He will be outperformed by Vijay in this movie which can be guaranteed.Well, Its time for me to watch the remaining 20 minutes and enjoy.",

While none of the characters are portrayed as gay, the numerous references made to the male buttocks are enough to make one take note. It is referred to as a \"gift that is being requested for acceptance\" at the new students initiation ceremony, with many of the new students strutting and gyrating in just their underwear, including a scene with an underwear pulled down slightly to reveal a side of the buttock, with a stamp of approval on it, like it was certified A+ grade meat, or beef (gay male). In addition the name of the hero (Amir Khan) in the movie is too long to say at the initiation, and is considered to be \"quite a mouthful\". There is another scene in a song where all three lead actors are seated with their backs to the camera, on seats that have the shape of male buttocks, and then turn around while seated in them and rub the buttock shaped seats with their hands while smiling suggestively. There is also a song where the students are taking baths but that could be considered to be as communal shower although with the shorts covered with loin cloths. Other scenes include pants dropped to the ankles from time to time, with some scenes also involving turning of the person to the camera and whacking it to be accepted in defeat with the pants down. It might be overlooked as being funny, but these scenes are heavy in gay overtones. Otherwise just another Indian movie with a strong message of friendship.",

All the instances are selected on the basis of giving a message to us that we should live our life meaningfully rather than following the trends blindly.Though,it is difficult to count all the story. However, examples of presence of mind of the character is really appealing, e.g. producing electricity from batteries in the hour of crisis, explaining definition of a machine by rolling his pant zip. We must understand the subject rather than cramming whether it is educational or real application life.Our life is precious. We cannot destroy it under stress just because we cannot fulfill the aspiration of other.Missing ingredient is spirituality which must be inculcated to make a proper base for growth.In nutshell, it's a superb, must watch movie.",

A 3 hour long Animal House.But then we saw it was the highest grossing Indian movie ever when it came out. Courage returned.Then we saw the movie poster. And we really wondered what we were letting ourselves in for. Coming across Big in Bollywood, a documentary following the American-born Indian cast member, bolstered Tom and Rose's courage. I hadn't seen it but went along for the 3 Idiots ride.It was something like a cross between Animal House (without the extreme crudeness) and Dead Poet Society. With some song and dance numbers thrown in because it is Bollywood, so of course. And it was surprisingly charming a lot of the time. Uneven but we weren't sorry we watched it. We didn't expect it to tackle very serious themes (that's the Dead Poet Society part) but it was done quite sensitively.Overall enjoyable as long as you are willing to go along for the ride. And the dance number with the umbrellas is adorable.",

Most of the people that like this movie are individuals that have been forced into a profession they dislike (take a guess not all the engineers that are mass produced want to be engineers and like the fact that actors in a movie vocalized their emotions), guess what the few of us who dreamed of being engineers all our lives have nothing to despise, There's nothing else to the popularity of the movie.I must say though that some parts of the movie are funny, but none of the jokes are original.It does not look like anyone is even trying to act.......

            "content": "The whole nation is going gaga over 3 idiots..and heres my chance to do the same but in a more fair way. I would be totally honest with this review. Movie was very good. not excellent. if you are thinking whether to watch the film or not, I would say go watch it ASAP. but why did I say its not excellent? because I have read the book and I couldn't help but notice the scenes inspired from the book. The plot of the movie is different but many things have been restored from the book and that did not give me a fresh feeling about the movie. Also another point I would like to add is that movie was very very predictable. I was able to guess who Phun Suk is..I was able to guess what would happen with Joy and I was able to guess many other things which were supposedly twists in the story.Music: well it sounds just above ordinary in my car but in the movie the songs blended very well and there was no boring moment during the songs.Acting: Aamir was brilliant in most of the scenes, but in few scenes I felt he tried too hard to come out as a youngster. Madhavan and Sharman were equally good. Boman's character took some time to get accustomed to but he did a great job of convincing you with his accent and way of talking. Kareena did not have much to do in this movie but she did a decent job. The surprise package in the movie is Omi. His speech scene is going to be a landmark in 2009 for Hindi film industry.Movie on the whole: Story is pretty good and decent changes made by Script writers after taking off from the book. Direction is also very good with certain aspects coming out really well like the black and white scenes and the way it starts with madhavan getting out of flight etc etc. movie has a good amount of comedy instilled in it which makes the movie enjoyable all along. I personally felt some parts were ridiculous like baby kicking after hearing certain words and Sharman's jump from 3rd floor etc etc. But on the whole Movie is a must watch because of its fresh subject, different story and approach, comedy and good performances by all the cast. I give it 8/10. go watch and enjoy.",

            "content": "The actual scene of college education in India has now been exposed to the world. Pressures related to studies leading to wrong paths taken by people or suicides have been the major portion of the plot.The movie starts with the entry of 3 young students to the ICE (best engineering institute of the country ). The starting scene of the movie clearly points out the topic that is competition is so tough in India that students , instead of improving themselves , only look to getting good grades and even mug up for 18 hours a day for the achievement. Finally , what the director conveys through the movie is that one who wants to study will study by any means and not look to better grades but improving himself and he will finally turn out to be the ultimate winner.ACTING ---- Everybody is excellent, just the way the movie demanded. Aamir Khan , as always, weaves magic playing an 18 year old though he himself is 44. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, and Kareena Kapoor complemented extremely well by playing their parts. Boman Irani does a typical Engineering Institute Director mastering every bit of his part. Omi Vaidya was excellent in his role especially his dialogue delivery. He is one new actor in Bollywood with some hopes in acting.DIRECTION --- Good direction as what is expected by Raj Kumar Hirani but way too many flaws, the major flaws being : Calling Mona Singh's character Poonam in the first half and Mona in the second half. Also, when you steal from someone's office , you do not use their land-line to call someone -- A major flaw.Since it was a feel good movie, we can ignore scenes like the baby kicking when he listens to AAL IZZ WELL. On the whole , a good attempt on the topic , could have been better as what is expected by Aamir Khan. For me its a 7/10.In the end, i would love to repeat an excellent quote from the movie : \" Strive for Excellence and Success will follow \"",

            "content": "In 1999, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi are accepted into the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering at Delhi, but they struggle to compete within its cutthroat academic culture. Farhan is passionate about wildlife photography but reluctantly chose to join engineering in order to appease his father, while Raju is desperately in need of a career that will extricate his family from poverty. Their roommate, the eccentric and charismatic Ranchoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad, who is genuinely passionate about engineering, gives unorthodox answers in class and frequently clashes with the ICE director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe \"Virus\", since he believes that students should enjoy what they learn, despite their strict teaching model.When a student named Joy Lobo commits suicide after failing to meet a project deadline and being denied graduation by Virus, Rancho confronts Virus about the pressure placed on the students to succeed, but his rebellious behaviour puts a strain on Farhan and Raju's relationships with their own families. Raju attempts to distance himself from Rancho, but when Raju's paralysed father needs a medical emergency, Rancho saves his life by taking him to the hospital with the help of Virus' younger daughter Pia, who begins to fall in love with Rancho. At the end of the year, Rancho is shown to have topped the Dean's list despite his disdain for its education system, while Farhan and Raju are at the bottom of the rankings.Three years then pass as the three continue their college lives with Rancho consistently topping and Farhan and Raju consistently trailing behind. One night in their final year, while severely drunk, the trio have a discussion where Rancho chides Farhan for abandoning his passion for photography and Raju for having developed a fear of failure, but when the two bet Rancho to propose to Pia in exchange for giving up their own fears, they decide to break into Virus' house, where Rancho confesses his feelings to Pia and the other two urinate on his property. Virus spots Raju amidst their escape and tells him he will be thrown out of campus unless he helps him expel Rancho. A distraught Raju attempts suicide but gradually recovers due to committed care from his Rancho and his friends. With a newfound perspective on his life, Raju successfully applies for a job while Farhan receives an apprenticeship offer from his favourite photographer, Andre Istvan, and successfully gets his father's approval.An infuriated Virus attempts to sabotage Raju's chances of success by setting to hold an unfairly difficult exam. With Pia's help, Rancho and Farhan break into his office to steal the exam papers and though Raju refuses to cheat, Virus catches and expels them. Pia confronts her father over her brother's suicide, which was prompted by similar pressure placed on him by Virus to become an engineer at the expense of his own ambitions. That night, during a rainstorm that causes widespread flooding and power outrages, Virus' older daughter Mona, who is pregnant, goes into labour. Unable to drive to a hospital, Rancho and the other students use their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a vacuum cleaner into a ventouse and deliver the baby with the help of Pia through a webcam. A grateful Virus acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes the expulsions. On graduation day, Rancho promptly disappears and is never seen by his friends again.Five years later at present day, Raju, now a business executive, and Farhan, a photographer, are both successful in their chosen careers. Their former classmate and academic rival Chatur, now a wealthy executive in an American company, wants to meet Rancho again for settling a bet he had made ten years prior after being humiliated in a prank where Rancho sabotaged his Teacher's Day Hindi speech, stating that he would be more successful than him. He calls them, claiming to know Rancho's whereabouts in Shimla, and the three of them head out to find him. Upon arrival, they find a different man living by Rancho's name and degree. Upon confrontation, the man explains that the \"Rancho\" they knew was actually \"Chhote\", his family's orphaned servant boy, who was tasked with completing his entire education for him all the way through using his identity. He tells them Chhote was forced to cut off all contact with his friends as part of a deal he made with the Chanchad family, and gives them his actual address in Ladakh. Farhan and Raju then decide to bring Pia along with them. Chatur protests the detour, as it would jeopardise his planned meeting with his illustrious client, \"Phunsukh Wangdu,\" a renowned scientist, but the duo goes ahead with their decision and crashes Pia's soon-to-be wedding. With no love lost for Rancho and excitement in the hope of seeing him again, Pia flees from her own ceremony and joins them.In Ladakh, the group finds a thriving engineering school in the mountains for local children and encountered an older Millimetre who explains that Rancho has kept up to date with their careers. Soon after, they finally find and embrace him. Rancho admits he is still in love with Pia as well and the pair share a kiss. Chatur assumes that Rancho is a lowly schoolteacher, and gloats at having won his bet, but Rancho reveals his real name to be Phunsukh Wangdu, the successful client Chatur has been after. The friends happily celebrate their reunion and laugh as they run away from the bewildered Chatur.",

And one of the finest film of the year. after lagaan ,rang de basanthi ,fanaa ,tzp ,gajini ,aamir once again has come up with an excellent performance in 3 idiots .3 idiots is personally my favorite aamir film till now. aamir's role as 'rancho' is mind blowing, no one can fit this role as aamir did ,and proves us why he is called perfectionist.madhavan n sharman in supporting roles has helped the film to its expectation .though kareena has little to offer in this film ,but still she steals the limelight.though the film is filled with lot of emotions ,it is over shadowed by the hum our in the film.i think and wish 3 idiots to break all the current box office records and steal as many awards as possible.though this years Indian film has already sent to Oscars ,i feel they should see this film and rethink.overall 3 idiots is complete paisa vasool film.it has an excellent message for youth to offer and shows the dark sides of the current education system. my rating 9.5/10",

I remember watching this movie when it was first released in theaters. As an 11 year-old Indian- American my hindi was pretty bad and some of the comedic scenes such as the one where Chatur was giving the speech in front of his school and made a mess (which i consider one of the best comedic scenes in any movie) went right over my head. Even the central message of the film which was to not follow success, but to do what you love and that success would follow you, was something I had still yet to understand. But now, watching this movie as a 20 year-old college student, really resonated with me. The trials and tribulations of being successful to appease your parents while also still battling the true aspirations that reside within you. All I can end this review by saying is this movie is truly a masterpiece and sure it did have some ridicoulous moments and scenes which could have been done without. But it's essence is timeless and even 30 years later, kids and adults alike will connect with this film.",

Unlike usual college comedies, this movie presents a fresh perspective with a message. Pre-interval part is totally hilarious and I can bet the comedy would roll you all in your seats. Just like MunnaBhai(s), Mr. Hirani has sought to bring forward a message through this movie. Therefore, though some instances post interval might appear out of line (must say a bit un-realistic) but viewers would like the overall movie.Aamir, as one of the protagonist, has been phenomenal in this movie as a college going student. Sharman, Madhvan and Boman Irani have also made very good contributions in the movie. Kareena looks good but her role is limited. Direction is good and the movie is set in the backdrop of Delhi.Its certainly worth one time watch.Hope you all enjoy this movie.Regards, MaDdyMacD",

            "content": "The film was a great one, although it's long in duration, it has the flavor of a comedy at the same time we are learning in every scenario. It gave an impact to every college life, and on how learning is about.First thing first is the friendship they build together. As they took their first step being a freshmen student, they instantly find themselves a companion. The film taught us that real friends would really help you up in times of difficulties. Forced learning and learning with passion, these two are totally different. The film portrays the two possible sides of a student why they took up Engineering. Some students were forced to study Engineering because of the pressure from the family so they would end up being afraid to fail during a test and the worst case is they would commit suicide. On the other side, learning with passion students took up engineering because it's their own desire, no one is forcing them to do it and so they were mostly on top. This taught us that we should follow what we desire, what we want and what we love. Being forced to something that is not our dream is like depriving us to pursue the future we want. The three characters show us the different characteristics of a student. Farhan took up engineering because he was forced but in the end, he chose to be a wildlife photographer and it was a very touching scene how he confessed to his father and being accepted. Raju took up engineering because he has a purpose to help his poor family. Lastly, Rancho is the most optimistic one, he took engineering because the hit is his passion and his dream. Yet, the pressure is a murderer. Another scheme of the film which also strikes me is the pressure they gave towards the students. The system is obliged to focus on the excellence of students. College is supposed to mold the students to prepare for the future and not pressure them to get high grades. Then again, the other side shows positivity. In the film, Rancho keeps on developing his knowledge and uses his skills in helping other people in need. He contributes to saving people and inspired them to strive more. It was an inspiring one.When we feel that we are in a verge of failings on what we are doing, we should need to look back on why did we took up this program, look back to the people we want to lift up once we are done and look back to our desired dreams and use all of these to make us feel motivated again. Failure is not forever, we all need to be a failure before we condemn as a winner. So what if we fail? it doesn't make us less, Instead, it makes us be wiser in making such decisions in the future. The film clearly depicts the struggles and the pressure of college students. As an engineering student, the film serves us with what we need to understand. It's about choosing happiness at the same time pursuing your dreams. As it said, \"making your profession into a passion\". We may have different reasons why we are pursuing this as long as we find the bliss of learning not because we are forced to. Watch the film and you might learn more than what I learned.",

Coming back to the history of Bollywood, one can only say the names of classical hits like Mughal-e-azam,and flicks like Tare Zameen Par,Rang De Basanti and Chak De-India to feel extremely proud(this can be a bit too harsh) and here comes these 3-Idiots with their not so Idiotic rules and principles which can cause a rush of ADRENALINE in your body and tears in your EYES and you love it. This film also present the fact that we Indians seldomly select the education and profession which we like, we have to fulfill the dreams of others,we are all proud of this but still one can only imagine what we could have done if we would have done what we wanted to and this movie made that imagination true.Mr.Phunsukh Wangdu You stick to your seats till Intermission and gets stuck to it after that. When the end of the movie comes you simply will feel that why it has to end,why can't it continue. Acting- No-one could have replaced anyone in this movie.Kareena was the best selection made by Raju Hirani and a lot of things has been said for AMIR KHAN,so i don't have words to describe,just like KAREENA said in her interview, \"You have to work with AMIR KHAN to be a complete Actor\".

The movie has lots of things going on, so even if it is long it doesn't bore you at all (this is only the second Bollywood movie I watched and I was fine with the length). This is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched and I can't really think of anything to criticise it, in fact I wish there were more movies like these. It is incredible how it shows serious matters in a light manner as well. Great acting, interesting insight into Indian culture and schooling.",

            "content": "3 Idiots is an Indian comedy film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. This film was based on a novel called 'Five Point Someone' that was written by an Indian author, Chetan Bhagat. This film was released in 2009 and became a success as it became one of the most popular films worldwide at that time.3 Idiots tells us a story of three buddies named Rancho, Farhan, and Raju who attend the Imperial College of Engineering, an elite college in India. This film conveys and judges the educational system of India. Aamir Khan played Rancho in the role of a genius and motivational student. Ranganathan Madhayan played Farhan who was forced by his strict father to pursue engineering but has a dream to become a wildlife photographer. Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering to get his family out of poverty but is struggling to keep up with uni-life. Another character who played a big role in this film is their extremely-strict dean, Viru Sahastrabuddhe who was played by Boman Irani.I don't find myself watching Bollywood films that much. Especially comedy. I was kinda doubtful before watching this film even though my friend said it's one of the best films she has ever watched. A long 3 hours of comedy just didn't sit right with me- That was before I gave it a try to watch this. Never thought that this could turn out so good. It didn't start that well for me- but getting into the film for an hour, it was starting to get so entertaining and interesting. 3 idiots had success to make these 3 hours feel like nothing for me. The film; no doubt- leaves a great impression on me. I love how smooth the storyline goes. I never get confused when the timeline changes from ten years ago to the present. I experienced such a roller coaster of emotion watching this film. . Maybe because it is a Bollywood film, I didn't expect any particular scenes so the storyline for me wasn't predictable. All the humorous situations are present but then the story pulls back with a serious situation; poignant moments which could get you on nerves or even cry. This film was so nicely made; thanks to the wonderful script and the outstanding acting of the cast.This film surely tells you about the meaning of life; also a wholesome and meaningful friendship between these 3 'idiots'. The message in this film- I don't find anything new, I've been hearing from here and there that big grades don't mean success. You gotta believe in yourself, do your passion, and don't let others choose your life path. I'm always on the same page with this quote-unquote life advice. But this film opened my eyes wider and wider. It was because of the twist at the end of the film. Revealing the identity of Rancho. He proves that all he has been saying to his friends and teacher throughout the story is right; don't chase success. Achieve excellence and it will come to you itself. He proved it in a way that I didn't expect, I was shocked in fact. I'm not going to say the details and spoils each scene that was memorable for me so you better watch this film for yourself at least once. Just bring yourself to watch it. I bet you'll have a great time with all the comedies and twists that you'll hardly expect.",

The problems with the movie are the fact that it is too long, has no idea what it is trying to preach. But the big big problem being the fact that it is so so unfunny. Really. The Munnabhai films made you smile and chuckle in almost every scene, but there is such a lack of genuinity in this film, that it gets very hard to do the same here. Maybe it is the poor acting skills, maybe it is the fact that Aamir Khan cannot carry the film well at all, I dunno. Mostly, it must have been my expectations I guess. NOTHING iz well here, don't even bother easting precious time on this. Wish I could rate this even lower, like a negative, but alas....",

            "review_title": "After 'Jaadu ki jhappi' and 'Gandhigiri' its 'aal izz well'",
            "content": "In a late scene from the film, 2 of the 3 idiots zip down their pants and pat their bottoms facing the third idiot. Rather than feeling gross at that instant, you have a lump in throat. For the zillionth time in a Hindi film, a bride runs away from the pheras on her wedding day. But the scene still doesn't come across as clich\u00e9d. For a group of all-male engineering students, to 'deliver' means to literally carry out a delivery operation on a woman in labour pain. And when the motionless newborn responds to a goodwill chant of 'aal izz well' in true-blue Manmohan Desai mode, you fail to find a fault in the filmi formula. That's the golden touch of Rajkumar Hirani.So after successfully dispensing philosophies of 'Jaadu ki jhappi' in Munnabhai MBBS and 'Gandhigiri' in Lage Raho Munnabhai, Hirani incites a new philosophy of 'Aal izz well' in 3 Idiots. And like his doctrine, all is well in his helluva film.Loosely based on Chetan Bhagat's bestseller Five Point Someone, 3 Idiots takes the plot much beyond the campus confines and the target audience much above the youth, for universal appeal. The story starts a decade after the graduation of college companions Farhan (R Madhavan) and Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) who get a clue on the whereabouts of their missing third friend Rancho (Aamir Khan). As they set out on a road trip from Delhi to Shimla to Manali to Ladakh to find their friend, the narrative cuts to and fro into flashbacks as we are introduced to the three idiots in an engineering college.Rancho clearly is different from anyone else in the college with his individualistic thought-process and rebellious attitude, which invites the ire of the college principal (Boman Irani) and affection of his daughter Pia (Kareena Kapoor).Coming from Rajkumar Hirani, there was clearly a risk involved in the film's setting and characterizations for having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu effect with his first film. Boman Irani, as the principal, almost revives his disciplinarian dean characterization from Munnabhai MBBS which is more palpable with his disgust towards the rebellious protagonist, Rancho (akin to Sanjay Dutt) who is furthermore in love with his daughter (ala Gracy Singh). Nevertheless, Hirani's direction is so impeccable that without a conscious effort, the analogy never strikes your mind and the scenario never looks repetitive.In his trademark style, Hirani grabs your attention from scene one with an unconventional opening to the film. Thereafter every single scene written in the screenplay (by Hirani and Abhijat Joshi) is not just relevant but also has a clear set objective \u2013 to be funny or be deeply poignant. Which means it either makes you laugh or cry and at some superlative instances do both simultaneously (which is an achievement). The writers have kept absolutely no room for any intermediate option.",

The humor was tasteful,the character scripting was very clever and combined with the story and acting, this movie became the second highest grossing movie at least for today. But the only problem with this movie was trying too hard to make it a romantic film. It was a smart and humorous film, but it lacked romance and sensuality. Th directer tried too hard to make it look sexy, by giving us a Gross out lip lock moment at the end, I mean seriously, there is no chemistry between Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor and putting a kissing scene taking these two actors was not romantic at all. Chuck out the gross romance and this movie is delightful Kareena Kapoor acted really well, unexpectedly she made me laugh at her dialogs and comedy expressions. She really looked like a Science student.The other two actors were the reason why this film was a hit. Boman Irani, you are the best comedy actor of the decade in Hindi cinema. Even when he tried to look like a monster, he was a funny and hilarious monster. Sharman Joshi ! he's good looking, soft spoken and a great actor. And Madhavan though had a very different role in the movie confused me about his sexual orientation here. Madhavan 's movies as I have watched before where he was a power house as a lead role, this time din't really have much to do.",

Well, I know one should never judge by the collections but, sometimes when they cross a mark, indicates even the intellect audience is paying to watch it. The narration itself from Farhan's POV keeps you bonded with the movie. All the characters were so strong that you fall in love with them easily. You will only agree with me when you watch it. Simply, Raju Hirani + Aamir Khan = Masterpiece!!!\nIn one sentence - the best Bollywood movie ever! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and at the same time. Even the scenery is breath-taking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 idiots is a delight.\nIt is worth the watch! I laughed! And I'm giving this a 10!",

            "content": "It has to be the most idiotic start to such a fascinating movie. You wonder where the movie is heading to when an airplane returns to base after a passenger(R.Madhavan) suffers a heart attack in an infirm manner. But Rajkumar Hirani soon gets his act and cast together to deliver a stunning product. Education is not about success; it's about pursuing excellence and doing what you are passionate about. In the end, success will chase you. This oft-repeated dialogue is beautifully portrayed in the climax. I have never laughed so hard before leaving a theater and you surely don't feel as a fourth idiot in the theater. Take a bow Mr Hirani. 3 IDIOTS is a fantastic film, one that every parent, teacher and most importantly students will dig into.'All Is Well', will soon be a craze across the nation. Hirani this time looks at the education system. The respectable, mechanical ways in which education is imparted where students are like machines. The setting is a prestigious engineering college and at the center of it all is Aamir Khan, a genius student who likes to see some fun injected in the lectures. Hirani touches on student suicides; parents pushing students into a field they are not interested ; students silently trying to excel in something they are not passionate about and also human emotions of how when a friend fails, you feel sad but when the same friend tops in college, jealousy takes hold. All these aspects and more are beautifully woven into the screenplay.There is a twist too, to spice up things at the interval. To get to the story, Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan) Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) are three united buddies. The film starts with Farhan and Raju getting some info on Rancho who has gone missing after their graduation. It's been (5-10) years now. It then moves to flashback. Where did Rancho disappear? Who was he really and what is he up to now? These questions keep you intrigued throughout the movie. The music by Shantanu Moitra is excellent and dialogue's by Hirani and Abhijit Joshi very inspiring. Although Hirani does not take pains to establish the friendship between the three, you overlook that fact because there is lot of meat in the screenplay. The film has been inspired from Chetan Bhagat's novel Five Point Someone. To knock off almost 20 years and pass off as a 24-year-old is a herculean task, one, which the diminutive Khan does beautifully.I mean, you do not see any persona of the Aamir of old in any angle, in any shot, in any dialogue delivery. A complete, brand new Aamir. You look for flaws but find none. Truly, a mark of a genius. The odd way in which he walks with his feet slightly apart is a delight. Sharman Joshi is excellent too. Madhavan could have taken his role more seriously and tried to fit in as a college student. Kareena, though does not have much of a role makes an impact while Mona Singh who makes her big screen debut does not get enough scope to show her talent. The one who steals the show with Aamir is Omi, the over zealous student who mugs his way to the top. This character is simply hilarious. In fact, it's a serious focus on how most students actually are today. Boman Irani as the college head for once is not loud and over-the-top. A clever make-up and twist of the tongue is what sets him apart from his other roles, which have become monotonous. There are many scenes that will grip you and others that will have you laughing silly. Like the last scene and the scene at Teacher's Day when Rancho changes the script.",

You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept. film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.",

The main theme of the movie was a concept that the passion of person when matches with his profession, he achieves success. So the concept wise it is good. Screen play and Direction were good overall but not incredible. Now what I did not like about this movie. Full focus of this movie was Aamir. But I did not find Amir's acting as much appealing compared to others. He was energetic but acting wise, not that good. Secondly, the movie, as per the genre is concerned, is not a romantic movie. So overall, it is good movie. Good composition, good direction, but to my view it does not rank among the best movies of bollywood.",

Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances.

It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him. Rancho not only leads his friends through the maze of India's competitive, high-pressure, rote-heavy, illogical and almost cruel education system, he tutors them on several life mantras too. Like, running after excellence, not success; questioning not blindly accepting givens; inventing and experimenting in lieu of copying and\ncramming; and essentially following your heart's calling if you truly want to make a difference.\nSo, you have the threesome embroiled, time and again, in a confrontation with authority, as represented through the domineering figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), the unsmiling Principal who venerates the cuckoo because the bird's life begins with murder. Kill the competition, because there is only one place at the top, believes the Princi. Poor, mistaken Princi! Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-\nconformists (Rancho and Rocket Singh Inc), who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.\nThe high point of the film is the fact that director Rajkumar Hirani says so much, and more, without losing his sense of humour and the sheer lightness of being. The film is a laugh riot, despite being high on fundas. Certain sequences almost have you rolling in the aisle, like the ragging sequence, Omi's chamatkar/balatkar speech, the threesome's wedding crasher sequence, their mournful meal with Raju's mournful mum and Rancho's sundry demos to prove how Kareena has chosen the wrong guy for herself. Add to this, the strong emotional core of the film that makes gentle tugs, now and then, at your guts, and you have an almost perfect score. Hirani carries forward his simplistic 'humanism alone works' philosophy of the Lage Raho Munnabhai series in 3 Idiots too, making it a warm and vivacious signature tune to 2009. The second half of the film does falter in parts, specially\nthe child birth sequence, but it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\nAmongst the performances, Aamir Khan is stupendous as the rule-breaker Rancho. But the rest of the cast doesn't remain in the shadows. Both Sharman and Madhavan manage to carve their independent characters as lovable rebels too. Even Kareena shines out, despite the minuscule\nlength of her role. A special mention for Boman Irani who is impeccable as 'Virus', the vile Principal and newcomer Omi who perfectly slips into the stereotype of the best, albeit bakwas student. Shantanu Moitra's music score, which may have sounded pheeka in the audio version, comes alive on screen with lyricist Swanand Kirkire giving India its clarion call for 2010: Aal Izz Well.

            "content": "1. Never Try To Be Successful Success is the bye-product. Excellence always creates success. So, never run after the success, let it happen automatically in the life. 2.Freedom To Life Don't die before actual death. Live every moment to the fullest as you are going to die today night. Life is gifted to humankind to live, live & live @ happiness. 3. Passion Leads To Excellence When your hobby becomes your profession and passion becomes your profession. You will be able to lead up to excellence in the life. Satisfaction, pleasure, joy and love will be the outcome of following passion. Following your passion for years, you will surely become something one day. 4. Learning Is Very Simple Teachers do fail. Learners never fail. Learning is never complicated or Learning is always possible whatever rule you apply. 5.Pressure At Head Current education system is developing pressures on students' head. University intelligence is useful and making some impact in the life but it cannot be at the cost of the life.6.Life Is Emotion Management Not Intelligence Optimization Memory and regular study have definite value and it always helps you in leading a life. You are able to survive even if you can make some mark in the path of the life. With artificial intelligence, you can survive and win but you cannot prove yourself genius. Therefore, in this process genius dies in you. 7.Necessity Is The Mother Of Invention Necessity creates pressure and forces you to invent something or to make it happen or to use your potentiality. Aamir Khan in this film, 3 idiots, is able to prove in the film by using aqua guard pump at the last moment.8.Simplicity is Life Life is need base never want base. Desires have no ends. Simplicity is way of life and Indian culture highly stresses on simple living and high thinking, and this is the way of life: 'Legs down to earth and eyes looking beyond the sky' 9. Industrial Leadership Dean of the institute in 3 idiots is showing very typical leadership. He has his own principles, values and ideology, and he leads the whole institute accordingly. This is an example of current institutional leadership. In the present scenario, most of the institutes are fixed in a block or Squarish thinking. 10. Love Is Time & Space Free Love is not time bound and space bound. It is very well demonstrated this movie same love was demonstrated by Krishna and Meera. Love is border free, time free and space free. 11.Importance Of One Word In Communication If communication dies, everything dies. Each word has impact and value in communication. One word if used wrongly or emphasized wrongly or paused at a wrong place in communication what effect it creates and how is it affected is demonstrated very well in this movie. 12. Mediocrity Is Penalized Middle class family or average talent or average institute is going to suffer and has to pay maximum price in the life if they do not upgrade their living standards. To be born poor or as an average person is not a crime but to die as an average person with middle class talent is miserable and if you are unable to optimize your potentiality and die with unused potentiality then that is your shameful truth. One should not die as a mediocre. He/she has to bring out genius inside him/her and has to use his/her potentiality to the optimum level.",

Principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe is no help at all.Movie Review: 3 Idiots is the perfect end to an exciting year for India: the year when the aam aadmi voted in progress, liberalism, secularism and turned his back to corruption, communalism, regionalism. The three idiots, Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureshi (R Madhavan), are perfect archetypes of the new age Indian who is essentially a non-conformist, questioning outmoded givens, choosing to live life on his own terms and chartering new roads that consciously skirt the rat race. Of course, they begin on the beaten track -- due to societal/parental pressure -- but refuse to become cogs in the wheel. Naturally, they end up as the Frostian hero (Robert Frost's Road Not Taken) who made all the difference to his life, and the world, by taking the road less travelled by.The film begins with the entry of our threesome in the city's elite engineering college. It takes the first tryst with the mandatory ragging sessions which enunciate who the leader of the gang is going to be: new entrant Baba Rancchoddas, as his friends fondly call him.

In between them Farhan (R Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) & Rancho(Aamir Khan) are the main leading characters. They got admitted to the city's elite college, where they meet their principal Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). Who was very strict with his rules. For that everyone in the college was afraid of him. But in behind every one call him VIRUS.Then comes rancho with a joyful and limitless, free soul, Who always gives challenges to the difficulties of life, takes it very lightly.\nRaju and Farhan are different. They are afraid of parents, teachers, and also exams. Both of them have their different family problems.\nIn this movie, we see the coming of Rancho in their life changes the viewing angle of them and also their way of thinking. Here we also can see an interesting character Chatur (Omi), Who always follows the race and want to become the winner.\nThough it is a very thoughtful and enthusing film, presence of Priya(\nKareena Kapoor) makes it quite romantic and emotional. And the small argues with VIRUS entertaining the audience, especially the Chamatkar/Balatkar speech.\nMusic & Choreography are really awesome.

Madhavan), Raju (Sharman Joshi) and Rancho (Aamir Khan) and their journey of 4 years through an engineering college.\nThe film begins with Farhan and Raju going on a searching spree for Rancho after 10 years of their college life has ended. Over the whole of journey of road they keep on lamenting the memories of their elite college life. It takes the first trust with the mandatory ragging session which enunciates who the leader of the gang is going to be. At this point enters the ever charming Aamir Khan as Rancchodas. Rancho not only led his friends through all the mazes of peer pressure, illogical educational system but also taught them some excruciating exciting life mantras.\nThrough the journey of college life, the three musketeers came in a confrontation with the authority as represented through the dominating figure of Viru Sahastrabuddhe who's only principle to life is, to win the race of life you need to be fast or else \"you'll be like the broken egg of a cuckoo bird.\" Doesn't he know that competition is effete, model students like Chatur (Omi) end up as duhs in real life and non-conformists like Rancho who care tuppence about being on top, could end up as eventual winners. More importantly, they could be high not only in IQ (intelligence quotient) but in EQ (emotional quotient) too, never losing their humaneness and social networking skills.\nIn the process of travelling through the journey of college life, Rancho falls in love with Pia (Kareena Kapoor) who happens to be Viru Sahastrabuddhe's daughter and they inspite of all the odds in the path as destiny has carved out, Ranchho and Pia do end up together after a long wait of 10 years.\nThe second half of the movie holds special mention due to its sudden turn of events as of Raju's suicide attempt to the child birth sequence. But it doesn't take long for the film to jump back on track.\nThe best part of the film is that, this film is a factory of life lessons yet Hirani for not even once loses the humor essence of the movie. Certain sequences might even have you rolling on the floor, like the ragging sequence, Omi's \"chamatkar\" speech, the mournful meal with Raju's mom, attending Pia's sister's wedding, Ranchos sundry demo of how Pia has chosen the wrong guy for himself.\n3 idiots is a complete package watch from comedy to seriousness to life lessons to carry with yourself throughout. Along with the incredible acting of all the actors, Shantanu Moitra's music score gave the movie a whole new level of life.\nHaving being released in the year 2009, 3 idiots still now holds a good rank in our hearts when reminded of a Sunday Afternoon Movie Marathon with family!",

The movie is so boring and silly and the acting was a disaster and the events cannot be real and full of mistakes. For real I regret watching this movie.",

Aamir acted well , he was entirely focused as a protagonist in the movie. But the other two guys steal the show with their less but solid, emotional presence.Being a software engineer, i would like to tell you that the movie resembles with every Engineer of Indian colleges. Hostel life,masti with friends, exam tensions, every aspect of the students have been touched in the movie.Aamir , sharman, madhavan are Mechanical engineering student, you will laugh till your tummy aches in some scenes.In the end me,Pushkar says \"A fantastic Movie\".",

            "content": "My name is Sammy and I live in a city called Dhaka which is located in the heart of Bangladesh. I am really big fan of watching different types of movies such as English, Hindi and Bangla. Among of them, \"3 idiots\", a hindi movie that is my most favourite one that I have ever seen for several times. In the following paragraphs, I would like to write a review on this comedy movie.The name of the movie as represents that there are three major characters who individually played a vital role in each part of the movie. As Amir khan is the main actor of this movie; Madhavan and Sharman were also played outstanding role to make this movie more amusing for the audiences. I strongly relate my life with this movie.For example, Farhan wanted to study for wildlife photography as he was passionate on it, though his father forced him to be an engineer. Here I wanted to be a shooter and I have a wish to wine Olympic gold meddle. But it is matter of fact that my family sometimes encourages me to get married rather taking the shooting as profession. Moreover, Raju wants to be an engineer to end his family's poverty and often got fear of Poverty. I can relate this scenario with one of my friends who couldn't continue her study in a private University just because of poverty. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate about science and engineering. His unexpected answers in class made this movie funny as well as educative. To give an example, Rancho witnesses the effects of the school's hyper-competitive academic culture. when a student named Joy Lobo commits suicide after failing to meet a project deadline and being denied graduation by Virus. I think that our education culture in Bangladesh also going through an unexpected sick competition. Every year a few students used to commit suicidal attempt just because they couldn't get A+ in public exams.\"aal izz well\" is an unique line that used in this movie which has also a great impact in my life. This line used by Amir khan when he used to face any difficult situation. Actually, human beings often go through a number of problems in their life. Having problems doesn't mean that life is gone and give up the highest try to achieve the destination. This movie inspired me to try the level best to achieve the goal.To conclude my view regarding this movie, I can say that this is the best movie ever made that every age group of people should watch and should change their view of education, especially the parents group. To add more, this movie also important for the students who get frustrated and give up their try at early stage. The most important and lead character in the movie is Rancho. He is a perfect example of genuine wisdom. Hence, I will recommend the students to watch this movie if they want to be a future leader.",

Then I feel very happy watching the movie. I have seen some wonderfully entertaining movie but this movie is wonderful then other movie. I doesn't watch more movie to consider this when you read this review. Indian has many movies but this is a very long film almost three hour. \"3 Idiots\" is an excellent movie I loved to watch this movie many times. The beginning part is kind of with my expectation. Two idiots started to turn the world around them upside down by highly over the top actions they propagate an observatory of the Imperial College of Engineering aka ICE their Alma mater to meet a friend they have lost communication for six years. Then my feelings about this movie was different than any other comedies. It all started with a generous chant that opens the main story line. The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was include in ICE. However he was totally different than any other students. And he focused more on the efficient aspect of the knowledge. As a result he was capable to blow a pretty in the groin with electricity. There was another student he was very good and who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director/dean virus is a nick name of course wouldn't allow graduating. Rancho understands the education policy was extremely flawless. It publicized the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho determined to setup opposition to it. He concealed requisition his teachers and even director. Rancho made two friends Farhan and Raju to inspire his two friends and really inspired them. When I was watch the movie than I learn when I face any problem then I say all is well. This won't solve your problems but it will give the mettle to face it. Prey success will follow. Life is not about acquirement marks grades but chasing your dreams. 3 Idiots these are the golden rules which indoctrinate very light and all way. Now I enunciate ending of the movie was so touching that anybody and shed rheum from their eyes with a small yarn that would made everything entertaining once again. 3 Idiots is a fantastic movie. This movie covers everything in it love, friendship and a grave message of how to achieve your goals. The movie story is excellent and is really affecting because it's too close reality. Amir Khan Performance is brilliant and perfect. I doesn't watch movie but I watch 3 idiots 3 times. And even through every time it's diverting. Most movie of the genre it has its share of the customary singing and dancing so foreign to firms from other counties. You should know one thing is that destine the type of movie it is not verily easy. 3 Idiots is a comedy much but it also has many acute traces some existential moments where they pursue the meaning of life and work of life and it's also a loving movie in a relationship to friendship. We can say 3 idiots is a message to the parents of the youth and in this time that is time to stop actives pressure to an already throng out demographic. In brief the basic theme of the movie is that chase and superb and success will follow. 3 Idiots has the expectation to break all records and collect all awards.",

The movie budget was 550 million and it earned about 4.60 billion rupee. It is a super hit film all along the world.\nMovie starts with a scene of ragging as the supposed custom of these culture.

Yet, Rancho was never on the great book of the instructors. The educator called an infection never observed rancho as a decent understudy and he generally chides Raju and Farhan to leave him. This made weight on Farhan and Raju. Viru sent a letter to Farhan and Raju's folks about their performance. Raju got into deep depression and endeavored suicide.

A moms' affection can fix any issue of life.\nMeanwhile, Rancho and pia, the girl of Virus got into a relationship. Yet, rancho was consistently cognizant about his future objective and he showed pia exercise of her life and opened her eyes.

Raju got arrangement from grounds enlistment yet rancho didn't go after a position. He went to Ladhak and avoid everybody and took the 10-year challenge from Chattur. The test was they will meet following 10 years and look at who is more effective & successful. It's a puzzle that Raju, Farhan and Chattur meet 5sept following 10 years yet rancho showed up. Here is the dramatization they went to discover for Rancho and find that rancho is the best individual.The movie shows us what is friendship is, what frustration is and how people like us goes under depression and what we do and what we should not to do.

This is a very long film with a run time of almost three hours but I loved its length. That film makes me happy. You also see that movie with your family.\nYou recall your university life and friends. You think about the first day at university and classmates. You see an amazing view of India and its culture. Life is not about getting marks, grades. You just chasing the dreams that make you happy. Aamir Khan looks young in this film. He acts is amazing he always tries to act in different characters. The director of that movie he tries this level best. The songs in that film are quite good. I see an amazing Cinematography in this movie. It promises lots of laughs and also a heart-touching message. That movie changes the viewing angle of your life. The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would be next. I loved every moment of this movie and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. I have watched 3 idiots almost 10 times and every time it's entertaining. Every part of the movie will keep you entertaining and you won't like to miss anything. That film's climax is fantabulous and shocking. It takes everyone's surprise.\nI like that dialogue \"all is well\". If you afraid just say it and you feel relax. I think this movie breaks all the records. I would also give a lot of credit to the director Rajkumar Hirani, that movie ranks him top Bollywood director. If it is possible, I could give this movie a higher than 10 ratings. This movie is funny, charming, loving always unpredictable in every situation. You try to find what happened next. This movie teaches us how to learn in the class, how to handle the critical situation. This movie shows us the hard work of engineering students do.\nThat is one of the best favorite movie in Bollywood. Everyone must watch that movie and never lose your hope.

            "content": "Last Saturday, we watched an Indian movie entitled \"3 Idiots\". It is a great film and I must tell you that it is a great experience. At first, I actually taught that it is a typical comedy movie but I was wrong. There are so many lessons to be learned in the film. The first lesson is we should always follow our passion. Very often, we deceive ourselves by giving in to the demands of the people around us, rather than following what our minds dictate. We go by the set standards of the society and ignore our real passion.\nWe end up becoming average professionals in the field that we enter and on the other hand, the field that happens to be our real passion loses a potential talent. An example given in the movie is a person who has a passion for photography walks into an engineering college and ends up becoming an average engineer, while the fine arts industry loses a good photographer. The second lesson is do not learn to get success, learn for knowledge. When we strive hard to learn and improve our knowledge, we move ahead in life.\nNever run after success but let it automatically happen to your life. The third lesson is we should enjoy the present. We either lose ourselves in the maze of past success and failures, or worry ourselves sick about the future. We cannot change what has already happened and we cannot predict what happens in future. Instead, we should focus on doing our day to day work with eagerness and excitement, then we end up positively influencing the future.\nHelping others helps you grow mentally and easily associates you. A lasting relationship is created by helping others. In the film, Rancho helps Raju and Farhan in choosing right careers for them and follow their dreams. This creates an everlasting bond between friends, not only friends but with anyone whom we help. You grow as a person and never have to look back in life. This movie is an eye opener to each one of us. I recommend that every student should watch this film, they will not only apply it to their studies but to their everyday life.\nAamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father . Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan. The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall dipiction is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent. It is definitely a one-time watch.",

Indeed, I would be hard put to mention another that I found to be as entertaining and I definitely cannot remember one that I found more delightful. The movie succeeds in all fronts--storyline, humour, sheer fun, pathos, visualization, imaginative elements, sound, music, editing, sense of balance, and overall inspiration. And, the actors have done their best. It would be unfair to single out any of them besides others. However, I cannot resist naming Omi Vaidya and Boman Irani. Hats off!",

But after I try to open up my heart and watch this movie, it made me realize that Indian movies are just as good as other countries! Even though there are interrupted songs in the movie, I think this is a very good and catchy song. I must admire Aamir Khan who is both the director and the main actor. He was able to create a really good movie. It is a movie that has all tastes - happiness, sadness, funny, and also hidden with insights throughout the story. Which we can understand and feel into it, because it is a story that we can meet in real life such as competitive exams, the expectations of the people around you, and the goals that must be reached.\"All is well\" is my favorite phrase from this movie. It's a very powerful phrase! 'Whenever you become afraid or lack confidence in yourself, please tell yourself with this sentence.' This is one of the things I get from the movie. It is considered one of the most important scenes in the movie and the music (All Izz Well) of this scene is a song that many people like. I think that people, who have been prejudiced with the music of Indian movies, will changed their mind after watched this scene as I changed my mind.Aamir Khan is amazing person. He can create movies that make our emotions fell into the movie. Besides this movie, he also has a number of films that are equally excellent. It is worth watching!",

            "content": "Briefly, the films narrate the adventure of three engineering students or the three idiots consisting of Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Shaarman Joshi). Their reasons for attending the Imperial College of Engineering varies, for Rancho he always admired learning and studying since his is a child, while Farhan originally wanted to become a wildlife photographer, but instead he attends engineering school because of a pressure from his parents, and for Raju he wanted to become an engineer because he originally came from a destitute family and wanted to save his family from poverty. Despite all of their reasons, they actually quite have a wondrous adventure in their years of studying engineering in ICE, and they sure are going to make you laugh. Here are some examples of scenes that might put a smile on your face.\nIn the first night of being a college freshman, Farhan and Raju are being humiliated by the college senior as it's their first day tradition in their institution. All of the freshman in the institution including Farhan and Raju are forced to be naked only covered by their underwear and getting their buttocks stamped \"Chicken Ok\" to honor their senior as the tradition. While Farhan and Raju are being embarrass Rancho come in late and also forced by the senior to take off his outfit but Rancho disobey him, it's the first time Farhan and Raju met Rancho. Furthermore, as Rancho disobey him, he seems a bit confused and threated at the same time, the then calm himself by saying \"all is well\". And then when the senior is distracted by humiliating the others freshmen, he rushed into his dorm and locked the door, showing his bravery and fearlessness. As the sound of dashing wind and the sound of slammed door the senior noticed and count from one until ten and threatens to piss on his door for one semester. With his engineering mind he created a device with the supplies in his dorm, a device that can transmit electricity if water hit the device. After the count to ten is up, before the senior piss on his door he slides a tip of spoon that used for his device, and then the senior piss on it striking him with electricity. What a way to introduce the character, it's truly hilarious and surely will amuse the audience.\nAnother hilarious scene is when Rancho criticize the chancellor of the university's teaching methods. The chancellor Viru Sahastrebuddhe or commonly called Mr. Virus then fed up by anger dragging Rancho to a class, stopped the current teacher that teach in the class and angrily command Rancho to teach the class. A second of silence occurred, then he began grabbing a book and write the words \"Farhanitrate Preajulation\" on the chalkboard, he then asked the class including Mr. Virus to find the meaning of the words in 30 seconds. After all of the class skimmed through the books also Mr. Virus, they couldn't find any definition about the words. And it turns out that the words \"Farhanitrate Preajulation\" has no real meaning and it's only his friends name \"Farhan\" and Raju\", all of the class filled with laughter accept Mr. Virus which he is irritated and asked the class to shut up.\nTo sum, the movie is great and highly recommended to the one who really loves comedy / drama movies. Although it may be not as fun reading it, the movie scenes is more funnier when watching it directly by seeing the pictures, scenery and ambiance, It is surely worth the time to watch in leisure.",

All three of them attend the Institute of Civil Engineering in India. Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi went to school there because of parents' pressure and social conditions that forced Rastogi to look for high-paying jobs (engineers). This is the movie that will make you laugh a lot while also teaches us in a very entertaining and light way. It has so many morals that are very applicable in our own life. One of the meaningful scenes is when they get drunk after getting humiliated by their own rector-Viru Sahastrabudhhe (Boman Irani)In the middle of the night, after that embarrassing moment, they gather round in front of mushroom-look-alike-building, while Rastogi and Farhan cursed their own rector. They are mad at him for making themselves look dumb in front of many other students. It all begins when Farhan asks Rancho why he always gets the highest score every year, then he simply answers concisely, \"it because I love machines, while you guys go to this school because of the social pressure\", after he gives his concise answer, Rancho challenge both of them to show their pride and get out of their toxic zone, Farhan to reach his own dreams, and Rastogi to overcome his fear of his future. \"Why am I having such weird friends? one is too scared, the other is already dead!\" is one of the dialogue that Rancho says while sitting between them.The thing is, this is one of the meaningful scenes. It is because Rancho indirectly tells the watchers that we have to encourage ourselves to reach our dreams no matter what, even if we have to risk it all, so we don't regret our decision in the future.

            "content": "\"3 Idiots\", one of Bollywood's quirkiest movie that was written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, has been the highest grossing movie in India as well as the highest grossing Indian movie internationally. It keeps its consistency and popularity, gaining millions of viewers ever since its release year (2009) until today.To sum up the film's plot, the film's main appeal would be the lead actor, Aamir Khan, who played the role as what you can call as a mischievous hero a.k.a none other than Rancho, a young engineer full of optimism and advanced imagination that is proven from his quick thinking in many crucial moments. He continuously guides his best pals -- the duo of misfits consisting Farhan and Raju -- through various ups and downs of college, before he mysteriously disappears to thin air after graduation.Of course, what is a coming-of-age movie full of thrilling emotions without the apperance of a main villain? Viru Sahastrabuddhe (played by Boman Irani) or famously nicknamed as \"Virus\" in the movie is notorious for being a hard headed, ignorant headmaster of the ICE (Imperial College of Engineering). He is also the father of Pia, his poised, polar-opposite daughter who almost got caught in a disastrous \"price tag\" lifestyle with the avaricious foreigner Suhas (who later becomes irrelevant because Pia was eventually smitten with someone else, take a wild guess on who it is).\"3 Idiots\" portrays all sorts of valuable friendships and hardships, from the trio struggling through the corrupted college system to supporting each others' families. This is shown especially during the scene where Pia's older sister (Mona) was having contractions that night during her last moments of pregnancy, however a heavy downpour was going on as well, therefore no ambulance were able to help.Rancho, with his brilliant ideas out of the box, fully assisted Mona during her labour in one of the campus rooms. He dexterously created a ventouse using a standard vacuum cleaner as the base (along with other handy parts), accompanied by the help of Pia from a webcam and all his friends and acquaintances, while Virus stood in total shock and silence which eventually led him to fainting during the actual labour process. Alas, Rancho -- along with the others -- succeeded in vacuuming the baby out safely. However, the baby showed no signs of life after it got out so everyone panicked. Except Rancho. He kept calm, and uttered the magic words; \"Aal Izz Well\". The baby immediately moved, specifically kicking Rancho in the face, like the future soccer player he/she is. Everyone burst out full of joy, especially Virus, thanking Rancho in the form of giving him his \"astronaut pen\".In the end, \"3 Idiots\" puts out a strong message to the viewers about how valuable our friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own greatest potential, as well as being a great motivation to those who are currently grasping at straw; because every problem eventually has its own solution.",

His character, along with his two friends, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi, who are engineering students in one of the most prestigious university which forces students to earn high grades and pass exams while the way of teaching encourages them to race instead of learn. Rancho who has an extremely high will to learn does not fit well in this system, fueling him to change it for the better. But, alas, obstacles are in the way. Changing the mind of University Director, Viru Sastrabudhhe was not as easy as flipping one's palm. A series of unfortunate events followed the 3 idiots that helped them grow and made their friendship stronger.Even though some parts don't make sense, like how does someone crash a wedding without being caught? Not to mention the classic singing and dancing scenes in Indian films and the wedding runaway scene. The machine-making scene in the middle of labor was only adding salt to the wound. However, the other scenes are very much realistic. From suicidal tragedies, the unbearable pressure between parents and teachers' expectations, up to forcing the students to stick to the manual and abandon their passion. It was impressive how Rajkumar Hirani was able to portray a student's life bluntly without a facade. Mentions of test struggles, rivalry, and even the deteriorating parent-child relationships show how the characters are not merely fictional but based on real problems, happening in the real world. In the end, the 3 idiots managed to live up to what Rancho said, \"Pursue excellence, and success will follow.\"It is not questionable that this movie received several awards and is well known internationally. The ratings skyrocketed and the reviews were ecstatic. Pants down, this is one of those movies that are able to deliver the story quite accurately.",

            "content": "Three idiots is an Indian Hindi-language movie that has been released since 2009 and gets a 4.5/5 rating. This movie tells us about the story of Ranchoddas Chanchad and his friends named Farhan and Raju. The story is begined by the meeting between Farhan, Raju, and Chatur on the college's rooftop. Then, the story goes back to the past as Farhan tries to remember his past with his friends Raju and Rancho. During college in ICE, this trio were dissatisfied by the campus curriculum, especially Rancho who strives to learn differently from the others. Unfortunately, the characters Viru Sahastrabudhhe and Chatur Ramalingam were contradict to Rancho and his friends threatened them to be expelled from the college. After recalling his past with his friends, the story goes to the present time where Farhan, Raju, and Chatur are trying to find Rancho who has been missing for years after the graduation day.The advantages of this movie lie on many aspects, starting from the moral messages, the storyline, its language style, and the emotions within the movie. This movie teaches us to be ourselves, never give up, face all the obstacles as best as you can, and do your best at every task. All of these elements are packed in just one sentence, and it is \"Aal izz well\" which means all is well. This three word sentence has become like a charming spell in the movie. Moreover, its storyline which tells us about the present and then back to the past is incredibly amazing and it makes the movie not boring and not impressively monotonous. Lastly, the movie really plays on our emotions as there are some scenes that are sad, happy, and thrilling which makes the movie become incredible.Even so, behind the morals we get from the film, there are still some shortcomings that exist in the film. The film shows us some \"silly\" scenes like the opening ceremony where all the freshmen have to take off their shirts and pants in honor of the god. Of course this scene is very inappropriate to see and do, especially for children. What's worse, there is a suicide scene performed by the film's two characters, Joy and Raju because they feel burdened with the education system on campus. This is very dangerous of course because children and teenagers can follow the action in the film if they feel stressed in learning at school.In conclusion, we can take the lesson that one does not have to succeed in the same way. Follow your \"idiot\" friends who can make you successful their way. Do not ignore those who think you are crazy, because you can succeed in your own way, without having to follow into the existing education system, as if you are a \"robot\". Furthermore, one of the characters in the film, Farhan, teaches us that we don't have to be engineers to be the best. As long as you can enjoy your work happily, it's more than enough. In addition, from Rancho we also learned that do not be afraid to start the step. Throw away your fears as far as you can if you want to succeed. That's what Rancho taught Farhan and Raju when they hesitated to achieve their dreams.",

            "content": "Firstly, i will put trigger warning of $uicide and $uicide attempt. So proceed with caution. And secondly this will be a lengthy review with many subjective opinion added :)Everything in this movie is presented blatantly from the critics to the pure emotions. Making it a rollercoaster ride of explosive emotions. From my perspective, this is a unique characteristic to make the movie 3 Idiots a bit more appealing to the masses through empathy and inspiration as well as hard thinkers audience through its critique, I would say it is pretty messy due to the rollercoaster of emotions (and literally scenes) and might be too tiring for some.Now i compile 3 main messages I interpret from 3 Idiots:1. Unrealistic standards of academics generalized by the school/country are very harmful if not deadly.\nCritiques towards India education system is a center idea throughout the film. The unrealistic standard of academic generalized by the school nor country are binding kids only to focus and compete on academics instead of supporting and guiding them in their passion. This idea of \"good grades are mandatory practices of teaching kids to compete\" is very harmful mentally and physically. Like Farhan and Raju or even Chathur who study because they want to succeed and have good grades (for themselves and family) not for the sake of curiosity and knowledge. In extreme cases, as shown in the movie, pressure from strict teacher and lack of empathy in order to fulfill the curriculum and system can lead to suicide or suicide attempt of the students. Of course, parents can be the reason too2. A true friend would risk everything for the sake of them, much like a soulmate\nIf we were to say that friends are those who spare time with us, having fun, study together, sharing stories, etc. it's correct, but true friends are always by our side in every situation. Not only at the happy moments, just like when Farhan and Rancho always stand besides Raju in his suffering, vice versa. They would prioritize their friends who are in dire need with no hesitation and judgment nor payback.3. Parents should encourage their kid in order to pursue their passion, no matter if its not a known occupation for how well it pays\nThis a recurring pattern throughout the movie, parents enrolling their children in ICE without knowing what their passion is (Farhan for example) note that most of the parents abide the mindset that a good school and good grades will ensure in a well pay job, this is mostly correlated to the economic factor of the family itself4. Study because you want to learn, not to achieve success. The desire to learn and discover things is the main fuel for success internally and externally. Passion is important, more than judgments, money, nor power.\nRancho has boasted about this numerous times in order to enlighten the people around him. And fortunately it works wonders for Farhan, Raju, Pia and himself. Chathur did achieve great success and maybe being the smarty-pants is his style of doing things, he might not be as great as Rancho but he succeeded in his own way and that's what matters.Now to dive deeper into the main character way of thinking and overall personality and how he carried the whole movie plot. Rancho follows the path of idealism (study for knowledge and not success, chase your passion, and other ideal motto) which in a way works to his advantage and uplift others to be the best version of themselves. While in a lot of ways I agree to his principles to some extent, I believe his ways of proving so is harmfully excessive. In order to enlighten somebody Rancho almost always degrade others (which can be seen in many scenes involving Chathur and the professors) to a worrying extent. This includes stealing, manipulation, embarrassment, and many more.Rancho is someone I personally aspire to be. Although, people like me would not go as far, because unfortunately I am not gifted with such genius. Though his ways of doing things are highly questionable and unethical, he (literally) saves people's lives even those who are not close to him. His almost unrealistically positive personality that lights rooms, spun people into dancing, and a happy go lucky guy is sometimes balanced with his vulnerable side (which pop's up in a more emotional scene) towards people he cares for and that care for him. Though most of the time he looks and acts improper his genius mind is something not to be questioned, a few scenes will showcase just how quick-thinking and strong willed he is that is sure to 'wow!' our minds. Nevertheless, I aspire to be someone that becomes so proud of his friends achievements for their own benefits and not mine.",

            "content": "An Indian movie starring 3 Idiots that exploded people with laughter and tears from all over the world. This movie teaches a moral message and it strongly refers to parenting and friendship. The movie 3 Idiots starred Aamir Khan as the disguise of the character Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad in the movie who is a true studied just for the fun of it not for getting grades and scores and will later be known as Phunsukh Wangdu as his real name, Ranganathan Madhavan as Farhan Quresh who wants to be a wildlife photographer but his father has not to support his passion and wanted him to be an engineer, and Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi who sees engineering as a key to help his poor family. 3 best friends were accepted to the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of India's finest colleges where only the best are accepted.In the first twenty minutes of the movie, spices of friendship start to gradually increase from the moment Rancho showed up at the junior's first-day tradition on the campus. From then on their friendship started to grow even deeper and closer, giving emotional feelings to the audience. The element of friendship really is what made this movie that it is today, implying the meaning of what a friend really is. They laughed at each other, cried for each other, helped one another, fought, and were honest with their feelings and insecurities.Out of the 3 idiots from the movie, Rancho is the real definition of a best friend material. He helps his friend's father, he taught them so they can graduate, and he put trust his trust in them without any hesitation. Although most of the time they were laughing and goofing around, there are scenes where they help and support each other to the fullest no matter where they are, what happen, or if one of them is in a fight.There are lots of messages and punch lines in 3 Idiots that insinuate the learning system in India itself that only caused students to be depressed like in the one in the scene where Viru Sahastrabuddhe or most people know him as Computer Virus confronts Rancho for accusing him of Joy's death. Rancho clarified that he was not fully blaming Virus as the head of the campus but the educational system in India \"Sir, I don't blame you, actually, I blame the education system, sir. The statistic shows that India ranks first in suicidal cases. Every 90 minutes, a student attempts to commit suicide\".The movie also illustrates how teaching methods are still old-fashioned that also caused students to be depressed due to how the teachers deem their students not as human beings but as robot-like that is only being taught to attain good grades whereas what this world need is innovation and yet there is nothing new in the past 32 years.In the movie, the self-centered head of campus delivered a speech for the umpteenth time, even the boy called Centimeter was able to fluently mimic every word that he heard every year. Not only that, Virus only emphasizes himself who made the campus to be the number one in India. \"What is the point, sir? they only taught students how to get good grades, they never talk about new inventions or new ideas\" this statement proof that Rancho was the only one who has the audacity to speak up and see what is wrong with the system.Another punch line from Rancho: \"I wasn't teaching you engineering, sir, that you know better than me. I was teaching you how to teach.\"The famous quote from 3 Idiots is \"Aal Izz Well\", a phrase from Rancho's village meaning to stay positive. This phrase not only used by the 3 idiots when they became nervous or depressed but also what bound the audience together. Even the song they sang has its own message for people. \"No matter how big the problem is in your life, just tell your heart 'Aal Izz Well'. It won't solve the problem but you gain courage to face it\"",

All the actors have strong and natural acting that fitted in every scene.One of the best scenes that shows their natural acting was when Farhan, Rancho, and Raju were heavily drunk, and they entered Virus' house like thieves. Rancho entered Pia's room to express his feelings after previously he got teased by Farhan and Raju. Unfortunately, Rancho was wrong. He held Pia's sister hand that was pregnant instead of Pia's hand. On another side, the situation keeps getting precarious since Virus realised there was chaos in his house. Immediately, they ran away because scared of being caught, but Raju took time to urinate in Virus' yard, then Virus' saw who messed up his house. That scene really brought laughter to the audience. Not only because of their acting, but there were also still many strengths of this movie, such as:\nthis movie thaught us to stay calm when facing any problems, just like Rancho always said to his friends, \"ALL IS WELL,\"\nthis movie also pointed out the right educational system, that we must understand what we learn, not only memorise it.\nBesides all those strengths, there were a few values that may unacceptable to learn. For instance, when Farhan and Ranco broke into Virus' office and stole the exam sheets and give it to Raju, who in the manner of his new-found attitude, is unconcerned with the prospect of failing, and refuses to cheat and throws the paper away. So that the children that watch this movie still need guidance.\nFor me, the movie duration is too long which makes some people might get bored watching it.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie. Besides it has well-packaged which makes the audience not get bored, this movie also very inspiring and motivating. A lot of values can be learned from this movie, such as life, education, moral, and social. I rate 8/10 <3",

Of course, parents can be the reason too\n2. A true friend would risk everything for the sake of them, much like a soulmate\nIf we were to say that friends are those who spare time with us, having fun, study together, sharing stories, etc. it's correct, but true friends are always by our side in every situation. Not only at the happy moments, just like when Farhan and Rancho always stand besides Raju in his suffering, vice versa. They would prioritize their friends who are in dire need with no hesitation and judgment nor payback.\n3. Parents should encourage their kid in order to pursue their passion, no matter if its not a known occupation for how well it pays\nThis a recurring pattern throughout the movie, parents enrolling their children in ICE without knowing what their passion is (Farhan for example) note that most of the parents abide the mindset that a good school and good grades will ensure in a well pay job, this is mostly correlated to the economic factor of the family itself\n4. Study because you want to learn, not to achieve success. The desire to learn and discover things is the main fuel for success internally and externally. Passion is important, more than judgements, money, nor power.\nRancho has boasted about this numerous times in order to enlighten the people around him. And fortunately it works wonders for Farhan, Raju, Pia and himself. Chathur did achieve great success and maybe being the smarty-pants is his style of doing things, he might not be as great as Rancho but he succeeded in his own way and that's what matters.\nNow to dive deeper into the main character way of thinking and overall personality and how he carried the whole movie plot. Rancho follows the path of idealism (study for knowledge and not success, chase your passion, and other ideal motto) which in a way works to his advantage and uplift others to be the best version of themselves. While in a lot of ways I agree to his principles to some extent, I believe his ways of proving so is harmfully excessive. In order to enlighten somebody Rancho almost always degrade others (which can be seen in many scenes involving Chathur and the professors) to a worrying extent. This includes stealing, manipulation, embarrassment, and many more.\nRancho is someone I personally aspire to be. Although, people like me would not go as far, because unfortunately I am not gifted with such genius. Though his ways of doing things are highly questionable and unethical, he (literally) saves people's lives even those who are not close to him. His almost unrealistically positive personality that lights rooms, spun people into dancing, and a happy go lucky guy is sometimes balanced with his vulnerable side (which pop's up in a more emotional scene) towards people he cares for and that care for him. Though most of the time he looks and acts improper his genius mind is something not to be questioned, a few scenes will showcase just how quick-thinking and strong willed he is that is sure to 'wow!' our minds. Nevertheless, I aspire to be someone that becomes so proud of his friends achievements for their own benefits and not mine.",

            "content": "This movie was very light and entertaining with the humor they embedded in, yet to think more in-depth, the film was also inspirational and thought-provoking. The movie was a story of two idiots, Raju and Farhan, who embarked on a journey to find the third idiot, Rancho. The unconventional Rancho inspired the other two to change their lives, living their lives with their parent's desire and dependency hanging on, which has been a burden to their mind. The plot was back and forth. The first scenes were portraying the present, then progressively into flashbacks of their college years in Imperial College of Engineering which stated as the number one engineering school in the country, and then followed with some twists until the end of the movie.The portrayal of how the Asian educational system is running was entirely accurate and beautifully interpreted. The scene where the lecturer was not satisfied with Rancho's answer because he used simplified and applied terms, yet flattered by Chatur's book-based response, precisely illustrates how most Asian teachers only appreciate the book-smart kids since they acknowledged smart as getting high scores. This issue's satire could advise the system maker to evaluate and elevate this wrack system where students are taught, only to memorize, not actually to think.As a person who often enjoys Hollywood movies, the iconic Bollywood scenes of silly dancing and singing in this movie had felt corny, because I did not find relevant to the storyline. Other than that, this movie was greatly amusing and eye-opening about our life philosophically. Like when Rancho said about how Raju was too afraid towards what his future holds, he said that if we are always anxious about our end, we will never feel alive along the journey. The bond between these three idiots teaches us how a healthy friendship should be. It is about how we remind and lead them to positive developments.To conclude, overall, the movie was amazing. It held a very positive message to it. A lot of people, especially Asians, can relate to it. This movie can also send you into an emotional rollercoaster with its storyline.",

            "content": "The movie is titled three idiots, directed by Rajkumar Hirani released on the 25th of December 2009 has a perplexing storyline of interpreting the world of love, education, and friendship. It achieved success as the highest-grossing Indian film in 2009 and collected 4.60 billion rupees at the box office because it presents a story that is so memorable as it shows us different ways to live life from different perspectives. The characters beautifully created by Rajkumar Hirani and embodied by outstanding actors make the film convey the moral of the story perfectly. The most important message is that it remains in the hearts of the audience.\nThe genre of this film combines romance and comedy. It makes the film even more enjoyable to watch and does not get bored quickly because even though the film has a deep meaning, it packaged very lightly, and the love story between roles that makes the film not only revolves around comedy. Even the words used are in the form of a comedy but have a powerful meaning. It subconsciously makes the film easier to convey because it is in simple and engaging language.\nThe actor Aamir khan wraps his role as Rancho very well. Even though his actions seem trivial, it opens up perspectives that have never been seen before and connected in life. His performance stole the show in this film. Especially the appearance of Ranganathan Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi and Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi makes a magnificent combination. Without these two great supporting actors, this film would not have achieved such a spectacular result.\nThis film is full of scenes that are very memorable for the audience. There was a scene that is no less memorable and has a strong message when Rancho, Raju, and Farhan on the stairs are drunk. Farhan and Raju complain to Rancho about why they can't get good grades even though they have tried. Moreover, Rancho said to Farhan that Rancho knows that Farhan's passion is not as an engineer but as a photographer and forced himself to become an engineer because of his parents' coercion. Raju is now the one to ask why he does not get good grades, even though he aspires to be an engineer without pressure from anyone. Then, Rancho replied that Raju carries too many burdens about his parents and sister. Rancho wanted Raju to focus on enjoying learning without thinking about those burdens because all of that affects the quality of his study, and he finally realized and pondered it. This scene is delivered well even though with an atmosphere that is not tense. The tone of the voice tends to be joking, but the message is consequential and very memorable.\nIn conclusion, the producer, director, writer, and everyone involved did an outstanding work portraying the wonderous world of love, education, and friendship. This film has reached success since it struck the highest-grossing Hindi film in 2009 and raised over 4.60 billion rupees in the box office. It has touched so many souls because this film did not only talk about a relatable slice of life skit but also a meaningful message of love and friendship at the same time. Not only that, the film has many memorable and brilliant scenes. Hence, no wonder it achieves such an amount of success!. A must to watch bollywood film!.",

            "content": "The film tells the story of the friendship of 3 young men, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and Rancchoddas Shyamaldas Chanchad ( Aamir Khan). The story begins with the wish of Farhan and Raju to meet Rancho which was their friend during their study in Imperial College of Engineering, one of the elite school in India.Rancho were intelligent students who have high curiosity, understanding to the basics of things, but also high sensitivity and empathy in people. In contras, Farhan and Raju were classified as lower students. Farhan himself attended this lecture based on his father's wishes, even though he himself wanted to become a photographer. Raju has a different motivation that is to help his family to resolve poverty and backwardness in his family.Once I finished watching this movie, I discovered a bunch of lessons and boons from this movie. The groove back and forth storyline in this movie eventually showed me that every steps and phase in our lives greatly affect each other. For instance, Rancho (Aamir Khan) in the end of the movie became a successful person by owning his own company and got the professor degree. We can conclude that to achieve the goal we wanted needs to sacrifice the things we like and must get out of our comfort zone as shown in this movie. Also, we should not run behind the success, but achieve excellence first so the success will automatically come looking for us.Moreover, the beauty of friendship is one of the main point of this movie. The story of the \"3 idiots\" which were Rancho, Farhan (R. Madhavan), and Raju (Sharman Joshi) gave an important impact to me, that with friendship everything hinder our lives will be resolved easily as the closer the circles the more we support each other. For example,, in this movie Rancho acted as a motivator when Raju was running out of spirit while studying in the college as his father told him to enter the college when in the other hand Raju had interest in photography, so because Rancho gave advices to him Raju finally undergo his study comfortably.So, i do very recommend this movie to those who are reading my review . It is different from the typical indian movie you are thinking at the moment, and you can learn new things about life you have never known!. (Abyan and Fatah)",

            "content": "Sometimes life gets too heavy to bear. Dealing with social pressure, as people keep on having high expectations on grades, marks, and how society portrayed success as to be wealthy. The movie '3 Idiots' elucidates it all. It will make your eyes open on how to walk through a path of life with a greater perspective. This movie is wrapped with a peak of comedy and slice of life.'3 Idiots' is a story about three engineering college students who have a hard time struggling through college. Farhan, the one who takes engineering because of his father's demands. Raju, who takes engineering so he could help his family from poverty. On the other hand, Rancho likes engineering, and as he lives with a different and positive point of view on how life works. \"Life is not all about grades but chasing your real dream\". At the end of the movie, all three of them have their path, as they pursue their dream job.I was not expecting much from this movie, but instead, this movie gives me a new point of view of life. 3 Idiots is a simple movie yet entertaining to watch. The comedy and the meaning of this movie is extraordinary. Every scene from the movie captivates me with each of it turns despite the rather lengthy duration of the movie. As the ending credits roll, I can't help but to agree on the movie's claims towards nowaday's education system.This Movie satisfies its comedic, thoughtful, and touching purposes. They spice up the movie with in-between songs and peak comedy lines that keeps the audience alive and yearning to know more about these 3 idiots. Though the purpose is conveyed boldly of how Rancho views the education system as flawed, it is stated constantly and persistently throughout the movie. This engages the audience to actively think and criticize the system as well. They're very clever in hitting the audience's soft spot by providing depressing truths of the main character's life and therefore creating attachment between the audience and the main characters. As the character cries and mourns, the audience will certainly feel their heart ache in sync.Taking everything into account, 3 idiots is a versatile movie that any age group can enjoy, laugh, and relate to. They bravely announce the faults that we as humans struggle with, the education system, and wrap it up with the catchphrase \"All is well\". It is peculiar how every audience will certainly relate to 3 engineering students and have their views of life changed after watching their story. This movie is worth our 2 hours and 51 minutes as it is easily life changing.",

            "review_title": "Many values to handle, LOVE THIS!!!",
            "content": "The most precious value I got from this film is the statement that \"we learn to learn, not to get the certificate.\"The most devastating part was when the three idiots found that one of their friends was hanging himself to death because of his rejected project. This suicide moment addresses the scene where the professor who sadistically denies the project was debating with one of the three idiots who informally accused the professor as the perpetrator behind this suicide. This debate exposed how wrong the education system we have since most students' mindsets incite an erroneous ambition; every student learns to get certificates in order to get a job so the world will recognize them. Along with some inhumanity teachers' behaviors, this creates pressure on the students, which eventually \"all students get is solely pressure without understanding,\" said an Idiot.Another value I got is the importance of empathy and tolerance between teachers and students. This film visibly shows us that teachers' lack of understanding can suffer students as the difficulty students' have is not merely about school; home and family problems can also hurt students. \"I will never let go of my weak students' hands because I am a teacher\" is the clause the Idiot said when the professor was challenging him to act as the teacher. This scene reveals that being a teacher is a glory job, but it seems underrated nowadays. It reassures teachers to perform their jobs wholeheartedly.Lastly, the value I catch as a student is to follow my passion. It sounds cliche, but this film convinces me with the powerful scene where one of the idiots said to his father that he wants to be a photographer instead of an engineer right after his parents bought him an expensive laptop for him to work. His character makes me realize how crucial it is to chase our craved career, so we are not blaming our parents who compelled us to follow their desire. After his declaration and a heartwarming debate, his parents asked him the professional camera's price as a symbol of support from them. From this, I discern that communication is the solution, and as the main actor in our lives is ourselves, we need to take the guts to discuss our desires with our parents politely. Hence, we enjoyed the learning progress we make because we know our focus is what we want to take for granted. From understanding our passions, we can be educated people, not trained robots. There is also a scene that emphasized the difference between \"trained\" and \"educated.\" This scene is hilarious as one of the idiots attempted to answer the professor's question modestly with an understandable explanation about a machine. Yet, it turns out that the professor was looking at the \"text-book\" answer. This film chastises that most education systems glorify the people who want to be trained more than the people who want to be educated.Moreover, another side we can learn from this movie is about \"friendship\"The most thrilling and heartwarming scene was where Raju's father needed to go through a critical period and Rancho (Wandhu) immediately took Raju's father to the hospital despite using a scooter. Getting there, Raju came and scolded Rancho for taking his father on a scooter. At the same time, the friendship between Rancho and Raju was not good because Raju got a warning letter from the University. After all, 3 idiots were hitted by chaos caused by Rancho, when Rancho's intention from the beginning was to prove that the system at his university was not good.However, when Raju was scolding Rancho, there was a doctor and nurse who were walking and said that if his father Raju was not immediately taken to the hospital, then his life would not be saved. Raju cried and immediately hugged Rancho. He apologized and thanked Rancho.The second scene depicting the strength of their friendship is when Raju was called by the Professor of the University to help him write a letter. As it turned out, the Director dictated Raju to write Raju's dropout letter from the university. When Raju realized, he immediately grieved and protested the Director. Unfortunately, the response he got from the director was only a cunning statement declaring that Raju would not be expelled from the university if he changed his name into Rancho's name in the dropout letter.\nRaju was surprised and very distressed because he merely had 7 and a half minutes to think while the professor seemed to be flexing during his spa treatment. Eventually, Raju chose to kill himself by jumping out of his professor's room window instead of writing a dropout letter to his friend. Luckily, Raju was immediately rescued and taken to the hospital despite his critical times. During his critical time, Rancho and Farhan were always beside Raju and encouraged Raju to quickly regain consciousness and recover. Rancho and Farhan continued to try, until one day, when Rancho encouraged Raju by saying that Farhan will marry Raju's sister, Raju moved his hand and woke up.The last scene was when Raju, Farhan, and Chatur were about to find and meet Rancho. After arriving at Rancho's home address, they knew that their friend's name is not Rancho since Rancho was a lazy child and Rancho's real father decided to use Rancho's friend to disguise himself as his son in order to get a bachelor's degree. When it all came to light, the real Rancho gave the known Rancho's address to Farhan and Raju. At that moment, they rushed to the fake Rancho's residence.In advance, they picked the fake Rancho's ex-girlfriend, Pia, when she was going to hold a wedding. Farhan and Raju invited Pia to run away and Pia agreed. After a long journey, they finally got to one school. There, they saw children using fake Rancho's inventions. Then they all met fake Rancho, and Chatur underestimated the fake Rancho because he was just a teacher while Chatur was a businessman. Then, Chatur gave a letter to be signed by fake Rancho that fake Rancho was defeated and Chatur was the winner. At that time, they all knew Rancho's real name was Phunsukh Wangdu. Phunsukh Wangdu was the one that Chatur desired to be his future colleague. Chatur was surprised and immediately begged Wangdu to continue his cooperation.\nThe moral value that can be taken from this scene is never underestimate people and never be arrogant with the advantages that we have because everyone must have their advantages and disadvantages. Always remember that perfection belongs only to God.In conclusion, this film spotted the most important but underrated value in teaching and friendship, especially in teenagers and young people's life. It reminds us of the basic value that being purely nice is the best way to face a cruel world. The entire scenes are linking with one another creates a mesmerizing impression in my heart since this film is showing us the possible moments in our life, it feels overly real for us, it could have happened during our teenage or young period. Hence, the chaos trouble that followed by a relaxing ending builds a perfect pitch to leave a great image in the audiences' memories.",

Even for someone like me who is not a big fan of Indian movies with all of the dancing and singing, 3 Idiots are still enjoyable to a certain extent. There are few unrealistic scenes that I am baffled with, which unnerved me enough that I questioned why I even watch this movie, but once I braved it on, it's completely worth a couple cringy clips to watch the entirety of 3 Idiots.This film told the story of 3 engineering students (Rancho, Raju, Farhan) who looked stupid in front of their lecturers, even though they had potential. Rancho was a smart kid, but unfortunately, his university professors didn't realise his potential. The professor had a standard that where the only valid answers were from textbooks, and Rancho proved it otherwise. This taught us that if we only memorize the textbook but do not understand it, it will be the same as the case when Chatur was asked to appear as a student representative. He did not understand the difference between the words Chamatkar and Balatkar, which have very different meanings.Rancho also taught us that learning is everywhere. When he was expelled from the class, he would look for another class and listen carefully. Heavy spoiler alert, Rancho's plot twist was the fact that it was not even his real name. His real name was Phunsukh Wandu, the son of a gardener from Rancho who is the same age as him. His curiosity about students made him go to school wearing Rancho's uniform. This explained a lot of his behaviour from the early scenes, where he freely entered any class to study.Rancho's iconic quote 'all is well' is extremely catchy and excites us. Saying that sentence gives us the courage to face the problems we fear. Indeed, that sentence does not solve the problem but makes us think positively about things that have not occurred.However, the quote from the 3 Idiots that is most memorable is \"Do what you love, not do what you do\". Farhan's dream was to be a wildlife photographer, which was very different from the university he chose, namely engineering. In the beginning, his parents didn't allow him to follow his passion. His parents thought that being an engineer was better than a photographer. An engineer salary is more than a wildlife photographer. However, Farhan managed to convince his father that he wanted a wildlife photographer. His father supported his passion by asking how much a good photographer's camera is, is it worth the laptop he just bought. Parents will always support their children. Indeed, if there are some differences it will take a little time to deal with them, but the parents will understand, eventually.The scene that stood out to me the most amongst other quite memorable clips was when Rancho fixed Joy's innovative helicopter that he threw away after Viru Sahastrabudhhe, their notoriously stuck-up professor refused to give him more time to finish his project. Rancho took it out of the trash, and fixed it if only to cheer Joy up; never mind that he and his friends had tons of examinations and projects due as well. This theme carried over the next few minutes, to the point where they were all singing and dancing cheerfully when Rancho flew the mini helicopter up to Joy's room, where they discovered Joy's already stiff body. Joy could not take any more pressure, both from his professor and from his father who was extremely excited for his graduation that was canceled by phone by Viru. It was a tragedy, and I would not sugar coat it. The most heartbreaking thing was the moment when you realise that Joy had not even seen his invention working like he meant for it to be.Joy's suicide shocked me. It was without warning and almost completely unexpected if it weren't for the foreshadowing that you wouldn't completely understand until you watch it until that scene. This happens countless times every day in every country, as was evidenced by Rancho's confrontation with Viru where he brought up the statistic of suicide rate. This is real, even to this day and age. 3 Idiots managed to bring up this topic, not in the most sensitive way, but it represented the issue well enough.Overall, as I stated in the beginning, this movie is enjoyable. It's humorous, it's the Indian musical type that some people really enjoy, and it has wonderful moral value. The plot twists are amazing and unexpected, but the scenes before provided foreshadowing for those who really watch it. It is almost 3 hours long, though, so take that into account and grab some snacks before watching.",

            "content": "\"3 Idiots\", one of Bollywood's quirkiest movie that was written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, has been the highest grossing movie in India as well as the highest grossing Indian movie internationally. It keeps its consistency and popularity, gaining millions of viewers ever since its release year (2009) until today.To sum up the film's plot, the film's main appeal would be the lead actor, Aamir Khan, who played the role as what you can call as a mischievous hero a.k.a none other than Rancho, a young engineer full of optimism and advanced imagination that is proven from his quick thinking in many crucial moments. He continuously guides his best pals -- the duo of misfits consisting Farhan and Raju -- through various ups and downs of college, before he mysteriously disappears to thin air after graduation.Of course, what is a coming-of-age movie full of thrilling emotions without the apperance of a main villain? Viru Sahastrabuddhe (played by Boman Irani) or famously nicknamed as \"Virus\" in the movie is notorious for being a hard headed, ignorant headmaster of the ICE (Imperial College of Engineering). He is also the father of Pia, his poised, polar-opposite daughter who almost got caught in a disastrous \"price tag\" lifestyle with the avaricious foreigner Suhas (who later becomes irrelevant because Pia was eventually smitten with someone else, take a wild guess on who it is).\"3 Idiots\" portrays all sorts of valuable friendships and hardships, from the trio struggling through the corrupted college system to supporting each others' families. This is shown especially during the scene where Pia's older sister (Mona) was having contractions that night during her last moments of pregnancy, however a heavy downpour was going on as well, therefore no ambulance were able to help.Rancho, with his brilliant ideas out of the box, fully assisted Mona during her labour in one of the campus rooms. He dexterously created a ventouse using a standard vacuum cleaner as the base (along with other handy parts), accompanied by the help of Pia from a webcam and all his friends and acquaintances, while Virus stood in total shock and silence which eventually led him to fainting during the actual labour process. Alas, Rancho -- along with the others -- succeeded in vacuuming the baby out safely. However, the baby showed no signs of life after it got out so everyone panicked. Except Rancho. He kept calm, and uttered the magic words; \"Aal Izz Well\". The baby immediately moved, specifically kicking Rancho in the face, like the future soccer player he/she is. Everyone burst out full of joy, especially Virus, thanking Rancho in the form of giving him his \"astronaut pen\".In the end, \"3 Idiots\" puts out a strong message to the viewers about how valuable our friends can be when they push you toward reaching your own greatest potential, as well as being a great motivation to those who are currently grasping at straw; because every problem eventually has its own solution.",

            "content": "3 idiots' is a movie that has remarkable attractiveness, impressive, hilarious moments and heartwarming inside it using lots of clever conversation and contains a deep bright meaning. This movie is based on people's minds that have been implanted so far in the education system that emphasizes students' obsession to have high grades.3 people who were given the designation \"idiots\" by their lecturer have a strong bond with each other. Rancho with his unique character and his extraordinary thoughts is a brilliant student who can motivate his friends to pursue their passion and make a career out of it. Farhan, the photographer wannabe yet terrified with his 'Hitler' father's passion, and his other friend named Raju is a person who is completely lacking in economic terms. Being an engineer is the only goal that can revive his family.Overall this movie depicts an inspirational comedy with unexpected meaningful messages so people can take a lot of moral life in it. Like most other Indian movies, this movie has a very long duration, almost 3 hours of run time. However, the plot of the storyline does not make you bored at all. Aamir Khan as Rancho did a very good job in this movie, his character brought the movie alive. He succeeded to rock both the humor and emotional sentiment.The movie itself came with an unpredicted plot that would make you dumbfounded. As depicted in the scene when Raju has to choose between his family or Rancho given by his lecturer, who is already pissed off with them, he then drops his choice by jumping from the third floor from his lecturer's window. We would never predict that Raju would give up his life instead.There was tension because Raju's condition did not improve. Then the story goes with Farhan and Rancho doing all their best to make Raju conscious from his coma. Such an envious friendship they have. Farhan got his letter replied to by his favorite photographer and Rancho convinced him to talk with his father. Who knows that Rancho's words will be the savior of his both friends' careers? It ended up with Raju getting the job and Farhan getting his father's approval and it is such a heartwarming scene. What we try to point out is how impressive how the whole story naturally changed from comedy into sentimental very smoothly without ruining the plot.The scene where Mona is delivering a baby was very out of the box that it would not come to our mind. We are bound to feel the strain by only watching them from the screen and the tension felt real. Also when the baby is not crying we got to witness the miracle from their magic spell, \"Aal Izz Well\". This spell was conveyed by Rancho when his friends were feeling scared and anxious, meaning everything will be okay. Their hearts get a shot of courage to get back up and face the world. It implies a powerful message about how valuable your friends can be when they push yourself to your own highest potential. Even the baby always kicked every time he heard the words.After all, this movie was an all-rounder with any elements a film can have. The elected casts were doing a very good job in portraying their own character. There are so many things that we can learn from it. Starting from intelligence is not about how you can memorize all the contents of the book but how to apply the knowledge that has been obtained for the common welfare. 3 hours of this movie would not be wasting your time.",

            "content": "We will review a film called \"3 idiots\" with a duration of nearly three hours. The film tells the story of the friendship of three people who meet at the university named Farhan, Raju, and Rancho. At the beginning of the film, the stewardess' acting when Farhan fell was not deep enough in his role, it looked less natural. The film combined with the video clip makes it different from the usual films. Then, some scenes include comedy and funny things that make it less monotonous or boring. After that, many messages and implicit moral matters contained in the film were packaged with a relaxed and light disposition (comedy) which was also closely related to social life. The moral message is:\n1. Life will still go the way, must have a \"compete or die\" attitude.\nThe point is to live life with a competitive nature, because if not then other people will follow us more advanced and we will be left behind with them. But it must be according to the portion and ability of each individual.\n2. Respect time and be productive.\nMake the best use of the time you have and as much as possible. Furthermore, time assistance so that the activities or activities carried out are of quality and productive every day.\n3. An exam or academic system with a competitive attitude will make students depressed.\nWith so many assignments, projects, exams, it does not make students develop themselves but instead makes them stressed and depressed because they are like being turned into robots by the lecturers. Students must understand the lecturer, but on the one hand, the lecturer must also understand the position of the student. Not only physically tired, but mental problems are also very influential such as depression, fear, crisis, and others.\n4. Choosing a major and your goals must be following your own wishes.\nIf parents go to school and determine that their child should be a doctor, they have to get good grades, and so on, it will only make the child feel burdened and under pressure. Must be following the children's interests, abilities, and talents. Don't let them go to this department because their parents, during college, there will only be stress, depression, disappointment, and regret in the child's mind.\n5. Don't just want to graduate to work but to raise your soul.\nThe meaning of the sentence above is realistic. It is possible because everyone needs money but the goal of graduating from university is not only that but to make a wider perspective, think openly and critically, increase experience and insight.\nOverall the film was very insightful and thought-provoking to those who watched it. There are many positive values contained that we can implement and apply to our daily life.",

The main character supposedly represents the writer's voice who critics the system, but the interesting thing about it is that the story is told in a second person perspective by the main character's friend.\nThe progression of the story is also really good. The intro started with 2 of the \"idiots\" in a hurry after hearing news from an old colleague about the whereabouts of the third idiot \"Roncho\" who apparently has been missing. It made me wonder who is Roncho and why are they so excited to meet him again.\nThen it goes to a flashback to how 2 of these friends met Roncho, the story is told in a flashback-present type way. Turns out this Roncho guy is a likeable person, and so a concern emerges... How did he went missing? And basically that straps you in for the ride, and it made sure you stay strapped in for the rest of it.\nIt had funny moments and emotional moments mixed in there, very well-paced too. Although, there is one thing that I'm not a fan of, the musicals. I think it would've been better off without any musicals, it comes off more as fillers more than anything. There's one particular moment that fells off to me. The part when they finished that guy's drone project and started flying it to his room while singing, only to reveal he was dead... on a noose, then cut to full silent.\nOther than that the show is a 9/10 for me. Enjoyed the funny bits, Teared for the sad moments, Gasped for the twists. The moral of the story is clear, do not be bound by society, don't sweat too much about the future, and do what you love.",

            "content": "3 Idiots is an Indian comedy-drama film directed by Rajkumar Hirani, with a screenplay by Abhijat Joshi, and produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra. It was adapted from the best-seller novel Five Points Someone by Chetan Bhagat. The three essential roles of the 3 Idiots film are the most famous Indian actor Aamir Khan as Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad or Phunsukh Wangdu, R. Madhavan as Farhan Qureshi, and Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi. The other stars are Kareena Kapoor as Pia, Omi Vaidya as Chatur Ramalingam, and Boman Irani as Viru Sahastrebuddhe. The drama narrating the lives of three friends touched a chord with the audience when it was released in 2009. This movie gives the viewers highlights about the Indian educational system that emphasize to their students for getting good marks, if they get failed, they will commit suicide as we know India has the highest suicide rate in the world. Upon release, the film broke all box office records in India, and the film's worldwide lifetime gross was 459.96 crores (US$90 million), making it the highest-grossing Indian movie at the time, breaking the previous record held by Ghajini.The story begins with a scene in the hostel of Imperial College of Engineering. The Imperial College of Engineering is one of the best colleges to study engineering in India. This movie covers a story, which spans many years and follows the life of a group of friends, which are Ranchoddas, Farhan, and Raju, where they all met while studying engineering. Rancho is an excellent student who loves machines, at the same time, he disagrees entirely with the educational system at his school, which urges the student to have good memorizing by studying all material based on the book and pressuring them into giving up all their passions to obtain a good job and have a great future. Farhan has a dream to become a wild photographer, but his father is very stubborn and wants his son to become an engineer, and Raju is a religious person, he comes to study to change the fate of his low-income family.Viru Sahastrebuddhe, called by the short name ''Virus'' by the students, is the college director. He is strict with his students and his children, one of his children is suicide because of the emphasis by him. His younger daughter, Pia is a doctor and plays the role of Rancho's lover. Some of the stories portray ''Virus'' is pushing their students because of the pressure of succeeding and living up to everybody's expectations. Virus adores the students who have good memorization based on books. From this view, Chatur is being called \"Silencer\" by the other students, becomes the favorite student of \"Virus'' and is being picked by him to do a speech in the Hindi language at Education Speech Night on a Teacher day. As Chatur was preparing for the speech with the help of the college librarian, Rancho distracted both of them and changed the keywords that later affected its meaning. It was done by Rancho to prove to Raju that memorizing things without understanding them means nothing. Chatur was ashamed and embarrassed; he confronted Rancho and made a bet with three idiots for the next ten years, on September 5, prove who is more successful among them.Rancho always got the first position in each of his exams with his unique learning method compared to other students, while his two friends Raju and Farhan always got the last place in their exams. Virus made a bet with Rancho, if his two friends get a job despite being in the lowest rank, he will shave his mustache, which he has never done before. Rancho gives them the motivation to gain success in life which Farhan got a passion for photography and, Raju was a scared man when preparing for the exam. So, Raju and Farhan challenge Rancho to confess his feelings to Pia. While severely drunk, the three idiots went to Pia's house, where Rancho revealed while Raju and Farhan started peeing on the front door.Virus found out about last night's incident and summoned Raju into his office. Virus threatened Raju to put Rancho's name on the drop-out letter that was initially for him. Raju attempts suicide instead of betraying his friend or let his family down. He gradually recovers after several months and gets a good job after his recovery. On the other hand, Farhan persuades his father to give approval to do photography after getting a letter from his favorite photographer, Andre Istvan. Virus's assistant shaved his mustache as he said on the bet, but Virus did not accept it. Virus attempts to make a complex final examination for Raju to pass, and it seems like an unfair condition. Knowing this, Pia informed Rancho and gave him the duplicate key to her father's office and did their action. Raju refuses to cheat, throwing the paper away, and Virus catches them. The three idiots got expelled.It was a rainstorm when they left, and Pia's elder sister - Mona, will give birth. Rancho and his friends were not able to take Mona to the hospital because of heavy rain. Rancho and their friends try to help Mona deliver the baby with his unique mechanism and the help of Pia who is at the hospital via webcam. Succeed in delivering the baby, Virus gives Rancho his astronaut pen, the symbol of excellence, and canceled their drop-out. At the moment of graduation, Rancho became the best graduate of Imperial College of Engineering. From that second, Rancho disappeared and never to seen again.At present day, Farhan who became a photographer, Raju who is now a business executive, and Chatur who works in an American Company and is wealthy, search for Rancho to prove the bet he made ten years ago. During the journey to find their friend, they learn that Rancho's real identity is not who he really is; he is actually \"Chhote\" - an orphaned servant boy who is smart and task to complete his education under the name Ranchoddas. Farhan, Raju, and Pia along with Chatur find their idiot friend who is being a scientist where his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu, a renowned scientist that Chatur wants to cooperate with. Chatur feels defeated after knowing that all this time, Rancho is Phunsukh Wangdu.The film introduces these characters in the present time and narrates the story flashback from ten years ago. In these moments, the film tends to introduce a musical element. The songs are very catchy and still stuck in my head. This movie incredibly contains dramatic twists and events that make this film look incredible with a brilliant story. I highly recommend this fantastic movie for everyone to watch!",

            "content": "The movie centers around the story of a group of college students majoring in engineering.In college Farhan, Raju and Rancho have the best friendship due to unique and positive vibes that Rancho gave. After graduation Rancho went missing and never contacted them. Years after the bet was made they finally had a chance to start a quest for finding Rancho. In this quest they found unexpected things about him. The scene in which they first attended a class was the most unforgettable for me in this film. It all began when their professor (Viru) asked them what a computer was. Rancho provided his own concept in response to that question, but Viru favored Chatur's response instead which concluded the definition from the textbook. In this scene Rancho said \"Learning is not memorizing the exact words from the book. Learning is understanding it and being able to explain it in your own words.\" Which made him get expelled. This scene, I believe, reflects the current educational system, which turns us into robots. Rather than understanding the definitions in the book, educators tend to put pressure on us to memorize lessons. Some scenes also talk about the education system that occurs nowadays. Such as grades being respected and rewarded and knowledge or understanding are forgotten.The growth of each character in the film is riveting. They began by debating if they were overwhelmed by their enthusiasm for engineering or whether they were only compelled to continue studying engineering due to forced circumstances. Each begins to stand up for themselves and their passions as a result of Viru's torment and mostly, Rancho's influence. The film ended with a happy ending with a little bit of twist into it yet also left us questioning our place in this world, our passion and ambition, and lastly, our education system that has been implemented the same way for years.The film has that strong moral tone yet it's presented in a comedic way which makes it intriguing. I can say that it's a standout film because of the implicit meaning in each scene which ties the film together as a whole as a tale of friendship, life journey, and discovering one's true identity. The tension, suspense, script, pace, and dubious decisions taken by the \"three idiots\" are remarkable. Although it's packed in such a simple way it gives an immersive message. The makers of this film were unquestionably effective in conveying their message. Personally, there are many morals defined in this film but foremost it gives us the message how important maintaining a healthy friendship that can support and help us through thick and thin. It also encourages everyone to have a more positive outlook on life, as what Rancho's mantra says, 'All is well'. Despite life's challenges and tribulations, we must all stay true to our values, and avoid sinking into a position where there is no hope.",

Hence, Rancho revealed that those 2 words meant nothing and was just an exaggeration of his friends' names, Farhan and Raju. In conclusion, Rancho preached to the class that studying is not all about race and ambitions. If these were the fundamentals, then you'd have no point in studying but rather just harvesting more pressure for yourselves. Additionally, all the students who did not come first would be unrecognised of their perseverance, and the one who was to come first would get all the credits. But after all, what's the point of achieving first place anyway when you can't even accurately process what you have just studied. A wise teacher would never dishonor their own pupils publicly. This scene covertly criticises the education system that is applied throughout the majority of the world. The scene also teaches a lesson without humbling, because they convey a little touch of comedy to this scene.

This movie also has become one of the most impactful film in India by becoming the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend, gaining millions of viewers every year even though the movie has been released since 2009.The lead role of this movie, Aamir Khan did an outstanding job portraying Rancho as a young, full of optimism university student with his mischievous behavior and wild imagination. First time entering the university, Rancho become friends with two with another two misfits student consisting Farhan and Raju. A lot of things happened in their college years, they've been through lots of ups and downs. Until they finally able to finished their study. But right after the graduation, Rancho mysteriously disappear into nowhere. Nobody ever heard from him ever again.This movie will be really meaningful for everyone who struggled to find their own bliss. The scene where the trio are having a discussion at one night in their final year, with three of them are severely drunk, Rancho chides Farhan for abandoning his passion for photography and Raju for having developed a fear of failure, but when the two bet Rancho to propose to Pia, the daughter of Viru the headmaster of their college that Rancho has un-denying crush at.All of them decide to break into viru's house, where Rancho confesses his feelings to Pia and the other two urinate in front of the house.

With a help of Rancho, Raju and Farhan found perspective on his life, Raju successfully applies for a job while Farhan receives an apprenticeship offer from his favorite photographer, Andre Istvan, and successfully gets his father's approval.This movie teaches us many lessons, especially to those that been or being force to do what other people want and say about you. Only our own self that can define what we want to be, no one can define who we are. Rancho teaches us that failure is not the end of your own story, every failure will lead us to success if we keep trying. His personality teaches us to always be optimistic and live by the moment also have fun while it last. He also teaches us that always be there and help a friend in need. He always supports his best friends to pursue their dreams. His motives are always to help people, making sure that he made people happy, this shown in the scene where he plays with children at the beach. The movie also teaches us that we can't force someone to be something even if it's our own child. Us people as human beings have a right to choose what we want to be in the future even the present.",

            "content": "Let's start with the title. When I saw the title, the first thing I thought in my mind was that this movie will be bored and I am not interested at first. But I decided to watch this movie because it was the recommendation from my teacher at school.There were lots of scene taught me that life is not always about competition and compete. If there is a chance to study, we can learn from many things, not just from the book. There was a scene that made me realized: when Rancho gave advise to Raju that \"we'll study with all our hearts, not just for grades. Follow excellence and success will chase you\", It changed my point of view, because all this time I always push myself so hard to get a perfect grade, and sometimes I feel exhausted. So, I got a good lesson for build up my identity and my spirit of study.I really admire for Rancho, Farhan, and Raju's friendship. Through the good times and bad times, they have commitment to be loyal and care to each other. Although they separated for many years, but they get along with each other again.As for the plot, it's very long and involved and I could recount what occurs, but the plot was really entertaining and relate to our daily lives. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking.Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is really worth to watch! I would highly recommend this film to my friends and my family. For the end of this review, I sincere gave 9/10 points.",

First of all, I have zero interest once I saw the title even posters of the movie. Because I thought I will be bored, similarly to some movies that I had watched before that resemble this movie title. Then my teacher recommends me this movie, so I started to search for the synopsis of this film. My interest appeared little by little and I decided to watched this movie. Exceeded my expectations, this movie succeeds to change my point of view and give me plenty of moral stories that I could apply in my daily life. School, dream, friendship all packaged in an interesting musical comedy that doesn't disguise the moral values to be conveyed. One of the dialogs that memorable for me is when Rancho said, \"Never study to be successful, study for self-efficiency. Don't run behind success. Follow behind excellence, success will come all way behind you.\" Because so far, my goals and dreams have only been successful and I just tried to increase my grades. This movie also teaches us to maintain someone's trust, have big courage, to be sure what we want to do, always helping each other, and never be overbearing to other people. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family because it is worthy to watch and have a really exciting plot!",

In the beginning, we had low expectations about this movie. Especially, when we saw the duration of the movie, it seemed to take so long for a movie. We even thought that \"Is it worth it to spend 3 hours on this movie?\" But in the end, we decided to give it a shot. But once we press the play button, the movie defines that it is not like our expectations. Surprisingly, the plot was so interesting that it kept us watching until the end. The central timeline is located in the present time where Raju and Farhan are looking for Rancho who went missing right after their graduation. But, we also got a lot of scenes from the past when they were still studying at their college. One of the most eye-catching scenes from the movie is when Rancho taught and asked in the middle of an ongoing class about his thoughts on the university education system. He was asking a simple question about the definition of words. However, no one could find any definition of the words. It turns out that Rancho only tricked them. And try to express the truth. Hence of his courage, he successfully humiliated his lecturer.Another scene that I think is eye-catching is when one of Rancho's friends, Chatur who is also his all-time rival, is asked to give a speech on teacher's day. Chatur is used to memorizing entire lessons and books without understanding the meaning of them. Moreover, he also wants to deliver his speech in pure Indian which he doesn't know at all. Without Chatur's notice, Rancho replaced some of the words in the text of Chatur's speech to prove to Raju who previously made himself study Chatur's way to get good grades. Rancho wanted to tell him that learning is not only about memorizing but about understanding the lesson. This is also the part of the movie that made me laugh so hard because it turns out that Rancho changed some of the words into embarrassing words that are not appropriate or it could be said to be mocking both their Rector and the minister, who is their honored guest. The minister is enraged by Chatur's speech that's humiliating him and their rector is really angry and disappointed at him. This event has made the relationship between Rancho and Chatur worse than before. Nevertheless, Rancho did achieve his goal to open not only Raju's eyes but also the other students and yourself as well what will happen to someone who only memorizes without understanding something. He probably has no regrets about what he has done even though at some point We feel bad for Chatur.In the end, after a long and wonderful ride on a rollercoaster of emotion, we find that this movie isn't only about entertaining but also educating. This movie deserves to be appreciated as an insightful and fun-to-watch movie! A 9 out of 10!",

The movie have both positive and negative aspects:This is a very, very long film-with a run-time of almost three hours, but since \"3 Idiots\" is a very good film I loved its length.\nMovie Emphasis about education vs Job. It is shown in the movie all the students usually focuses on their job and want to collect money, but no body interested and seems love to study or in the concepts of knowledge.\nMy opinion is that if you're studying with the thought that ultimately you will get a job in future and possibility to earn through it, then this is wrong. It comes in the sense of greedy person.\n-Sexual seen(Pregnant women, kissing scenes) is not good for youngsters. It could have influence on the person's individual character and on their behavior.\n-Raju's suicide scene, when principal asked him to write a letter against Rancho and become witness in their expulsion, this act negative influence on a young generation, if individual person is in depression.\n-Acting and behavior of \"Farhan, Raju and Ranch\" shows disrespect towards teachers.\n-Although the whole story is on practical life of students, but I think that there is a huge difference between real life and the acting shown in the movie.' As \"Rancho\" did not work hard for achieving good grades, but he was able to score top marks in exams which is impossible in real life.Positve:\n-Story gives a message that we should alliance with friends, develop strong bond and strengthen our relationship.\n-Movie is a great motivational story for all youngsters, it is a message that student should clear his/her concepts and do not try to cramp the whole document or a book.\n\"Farhan, Raju and Ranch\", their acting, love, behavior, and different activity to each other is so interesting, emotional and lovable. Scenes are perfect, genuine, true and related to reality of student life.\n-Students should not be depressed and effect due to their studies and do not take influence and harm himself.",

            "content": "My first thought on this movie is mediocre due to the inconsistency at the first scene when they show a different plane for the same scene. This difference is quite visible because of the big difference in size of the two planes. As the story builds up and starts with the 3 character's first time meeting in the past at their old university. Keep in mind that this \"past\" is the memory of one of three main characters at the beginning. For a normal view, this is a good way to start a flashback in movies, novels, or other kinds of story. The memory is very good and precise.The plot that takes us back in time can make us forget that most of the film is just a memory of the character and his three best friends. The plot that immerses us in the really interesting stories of these three friends in their struggles in the world of lectures. This story has a solid plot and problems that are quite difficult to guess with the addition of comedy that makes us laugh and solving problems that can make us sad and moved. The emotions, reactions, and attitudes of these three idiot friends in dealing with the problems they face in unexpected ways are quite surprising and funny.The problems shown in 3 Idiots are real. Right from the parenting pressure part until the due-to-stress suicide part. The main characters depict all of the struggles they have met exquisitely. They criticized the strict education systems with their thought-provoking yet funny actions. Also, the bond between the main characters are pictured vividly throughout the main story.Overall this is a film that tells the friendship of these three characters very well with some very supportive little side stories added to the main one. This film shows the friendship and emotional side of each character which is very good. This film contains many comedy elements that we can relate to in real life, especially during college. The comedy in this film can make us laugh out loud when watching it. With comedy, there are many excellent moral messages in this film. So it can be concluded that overall this is a film with an interesting plot and story with very few flaws.",

His friends are Farhan who passionate about wildlife photography but reluctantly chose to join engineering in order to appease his father, and Raju who is pursuing engineering to get his family out of extreme poverty. The first half of the film includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor Viru, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home.The film depicts an acceptable blend of comedy, suspense and motivation. The film is set in two main locations that are university and the hills that gives it a very beautiful atmosphere. All the actors and co-actors done a praiseworthy job. The soundtrack of the film was great with a strong Indian vibe. The background music supports the film all through the movie.

            "content": "The movie '3 Idiots' tells a story about three individuals (Rancho, Farhan, and Raju) who constructed an unusual friendship in a university with tight competitions. This movie that was released in 2009 takes comedy to a next level with goofy singing in the bathroom, ingenious inventions that surely could not be made in real life, and dances to lighten up the mood. The plot would take you by surprise with how many twists it makes, making the viewer eager to find out what would happen next. Though a bit vulgar for younger viewers, this movie could leave a sense of motivation for those who are having doubts and tough times.The most enlightening scene throughout the movie was the part where the three friends had a drink on an abandoned building's staircase while having some serious talks about the future. Rancho told Farhan about having to chase his dreams and would regret on his deathbed if he does not do so. After speaking to Farhan about his views, he then went ahead and told Raju that one reason why he doesn't have great grades even though engineering is his passion is that he is 'too scared' and depended on his rings and prayers so he could pass. Because of this, he starts to have a taste of his own medicine when both Raju and Farhan stated the exact same words towards him. They all agreed to make a bet that if Rancho confessed his feelings for Phia (one of the professor's daughters), then the two would also do what Rancho told them. This scene clearly tells the importance of friend support and motivation. The best of friends are those who understand you and support you and will tell you what they think is the best for you. Rancho has a way with his words where he could lift his friends' spirit, even if his words are \"All is well\".Another scene that was very interesting was one where Rancho and Farhan changed the words of Chatur's speech to teach a lesson to their friend, Raju about the importance of understanding rather than memorising. The scene starts with Chatur, who was writing a speech for Teacher's Day using pure Hindi language. Although, due to his poor Hindi speaking skills and his will to impress the ICE director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe, Chatur had to ask the librarian for help. The librarian and Chatur were working on the speech, with the librarian telling him what to type and structures the right words for him to use while also trying to explain the meaning of the words. Unfortunately, this is where Chatur makes his first mistake. He didn't bother understanding the meaning of those words and said that he was just going to memorise them. One of the words that were used in the speech was \"chamatkar\" which means miracle. But of course, Chatur didn't bother understanding the word so he didn't know the meaning. In the middle of typing, Chatur supposedly got a call from someone, not knowing anything, he asked the librarian to print out the finished product and head down to receive the call. While Chatur was distracted, Rancho tricked the librarian into leaving and began changing a few words from the speech. One of the examples was the word \"chamatkar\" which he changed to \"balatkar\" which means obscene. On Teacher's day, as planned, Chatur went up to present his speech, exactly as he memorised it. Unbeknownst to him, the words had changed and so has the meaning. He continued his speech without fully understanding his own words, causing the whole class to laugh hysterically and enraged the ICE director. This was such a clever way of showing the importance of understanding and not memorising. Because we may be able to memorise our entire textbook but that doesn't mean we will understand it's contents. Just like Chatur with his speech.",

            "content": "This movie recounts the journey of those 3 college students, Rancho, Farhan, and Raju, who were struggling with their own problems. These 3 people were enrolled to this engineering college called Imperial College of Engineering by their personal intention and purpose. Three main characters in this movie are casted by Aamir Khan (Rancho; Phunsukh Wangdu), R. Madhavan (Farhan Qureshi), and Sharman Joshi (Raju Rastogi). The plot uses a mixed storyline that takes us back into the time where they are still attending university and the plot that shows today's fettle.Narrated by Farhan throughout the movie, he depicts the figure that he and Raju are looking for, his other best friend, Rancho who'll be later known as Phunsukh Wangdu. This movie is seasoned by the witty comedic scenario and adoring romance that were acted by Rancho and Pia (Kareena Kapoor), daughter of Viru S. (Boman Irani), ICE University rector. Instrument that the background music played really fits in every backdrop of the movie. The shot of the landscape genuinely impressed me, though. The scene where Mona (Mona Singh), Pia's sister, gave birth absolutely yielded tension to us, the watchers. And definitely, every Bollywood movie always included singing-dancing scenes to indicate its signature.Very clever move by the writer to have the movie's first act introducing us to what we assume to be the 3 idiots, with a cheeky little plot twist that one of the guy we have been shown is actually the antagonist. With the last main character still unknown.Remarkable acting by Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi. Especially the hospital part when Raju showed his sorrow and gratitude to Rancho (or Wangdu which revealed later on in the end of the movie) for saving his father. Such an overwhelming performance to show such an emotional scene.The score in the background is pretty well-used. The goofy, childish music to the gloomy violin. It's not that great I would say but good enough to fill up the scene.Bold move to show suicide. A dark scene was shown, with stress being the main problem in this conflict. This proved that although it is a comedy movie, it is not for everyone. Parents still have to step in and monitor their kids.Conclusion:\nThis movie made a good impression for us because it fulfilled and satisfied our expectations. This movie deserves appreciation by the tremendous work that the crew has put on. No wonder how this movie got a big recognition. We unfeignedly recommend this film for those who haven't watched it yet.",

            "content": "If anyone else had made '3 Idiots', there would have been an immediate outpouring of hosannahs, because the ability to wrap an engaging story around an important message is a forgotten skill in most Hindi cinema. But this is from Rajkumar Hirani who brought back joy and sparkle to the movies. Both his 'Munnabhai' films are superb entertainers that you can watch any and all the time: I would, if I could, put both on a continuous loop, and swoop in for a taste whenever I felt like a dose of upbeat.'3 Idiots' does not do as much for me. The emotional truth that shone through both the 'Munnabhai' movies doesn't come through strongly enough: the artifice caused by a forty-something playing a twenty- something colours the film. Are there no capable twenty year olds in B town?It's based, very loosely, on Chetan Bhagat's smash-hit 'Five Point Someone', which is about three friends who bond for life over shared blood, sweat and tears, in the way only those who go through professional colleges brimming with brutal deans and hellish exams, can. The kind of pressure-cooker college where kids who can't handle the heat leap out of high windows, or hang themselves from fans in their hostel rooms.Ranchodas Shyamaldas Chanchad aka Rancho (Aamir Khan), Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) and Farhan Qureishi (R Madhavan) meet on a freshers' night when new arrivals are being introduced to the ways of an elite engineering college.Undies are being yanked down when Rancho walks in, escapes to his room and devises a devilish way out of the humiliation about to be heaped upon him. From then on, Rancho becomes their lodestar, both as an official getter-into-trouble, as well as the guy who will get them out of it. And then one day, just like that, he's gone.Rancho's old mates set off on a quest, accompanied by another batchmate (Omi), whose extreme competitiveness and slyness many will recognize from their time at tech institutes. This throwing of the switch, from a coming of age flick to a road movie, unsettles the rhythm, and leads to an overstretched half. This, or that, or both?Somewhere along the way, almost like an after-thought, the ravishing Kareena Kapoor shows up, to execute a skilled-if-not-madly-novel song- and-dance number with Khan. And because she plays a doctor, she also gets to save lives. She's not a strong plot point, though, and you miss her effervescence when she's sent out to bide her time till her next scene.Hirani has never been afraid of tears, abundantly on display in both his earlier tours. Here, every single character, including the stone-hearted dean Viru Sahastrabuddhe, or more aptly, Virus (Boman Irani, more cipher than character) is given a wet-eyed moment.The result is a flood, literally, which leaves the second half awash. I happily cried along with Munna and Circuit; here, I caught myself waiting for the deluge to end. The laughter in some places is forced, as is the effort Khan puts into appearing half his age\u2014in the widening of the eyes, the shuffling of the gait, the loose, wrinkly jeans.Madhavan and Joshi come off better, especially the latter, who is absolutely first rate. But the one who really leaves a mark is the always-chasing-after-success Chatur, the southie nerd played by newcomer Omi.The film is meant to be a trenchant attack on an educational system which creates robots, and ambitious parents who insist their child do something they do not want to, even if it means losing the child to despair and death. It makes the point, but not as magically as it could have, given Hirani's unique gift of building extraordinary moments out of the ordinary.'3 Idiots' was good in parts, but it didn't blow me away.",

Honestly, the beginning of the movie is pretty boring but it will eventually get interesting as you watch it. One of the most iconic scenes in this scene where the professor got offended by one of the main characters, Rancho, for being rebellious. Rancho was a prodigal student, with contempt for the inhumanity of the college's system. For the reason of being a genius yet rebellious student, Rancho was asked by the professor to try to teach engineering in one of the classes. Instead of teaching, Rancho wrote \"Farhanitrate Perajulisation\" on the blackboard and asked the students and the professor, to define the terms of it in 30 seconds. 30 seconds have passed, but all of them still had no idea about what it actually means. Rancho then explained to the others that he only made up the words which means it did not actually exist. He said that it was taken from his friends' names, Farhan and Raju. The professor then asked him angrily why did he teach philosophy instead of engineering. Rancho then answered that he is teaching his professor how to teach, how to distribute knowledge to his students properly, not only concerning about this score and that score.\"Will your knowledge increase? No. Just the pressure.\"We can say that this movie is controversial. It shows the sad reality of India's poor education system. Well, not exactly \"India's\" because we believe that this also happens to some schools and universities in many different countries. This scene shows the fact that students tend to run after high marks, not knowledge. Moreover, it shows that the students are studying under pressure, for getting high marks instead of expanding the students' bits of knowledge. Frankly speaking, we, as high school students in Indonesia are able to relate at some points in this scene since the education system here is relatable, as what is depicted in this scene. The actors' acting was also amazing and so for the plot, in which we did not expect things to happen this way. This movie made us laugh out loud but also created sadness and sympathy for us at the same time.After watching this movie, mainly this scene, we learned that if we can't change the system, change our mindset.",

            "content": "Adapted from Chetan Bhagat's humour novel titled Five Point Someone, 3 Idiots made a big hit in the Bollywood world. After hit movies Taare Zameen Par and Ghajini, Aamir Khan made his appearance as the lead actor starring as Rancho. Also, R. Madhavan as Farhan and Sharman Josi as Raju. The friendship journey of three engineering college students tells a satire about the social pressures under Indian educational system. The three of them had a great chemistry and left as memorable characters with their strong acting. Their performance changed my perspective about 'usually cheap' Bollywood films. The acting abilities are mind-blown and it intrigues me to watch more. Produced by Vindu Vinod Chapre and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, this film is narrated through parallel drama, in the present and ten years in the past. 3 Idiots is breath-takingly amazing, containing the beautiful landscape of Ladakh through various different angles.This movie has a good plot that I really did not expect. Perhaps it is because there are lots of funny moments, so I did not think too much just laughing out loud. And the plot packed nicely, one by one the truth was revealed with a comedy interlude which is basically a comedy film that was unthinkable at all. This film serves various moods such as joyous funny comedy to depressing. The disposition of the characters is well-written, all the characters have their own iconic habits. This film taught us many valuable lessons. And also there were many things related to real life, like family problems, parenting problems, college student problems, educational problems, dreams, passion, friendship, and how to deal with those problems. This is a compilation of my personal favorite quote that I want to share: \"You don't need to be afraid to be yourself, what your heart likes to do just do it because life's opportunity doesn't come twice. The future is full of mystery, but you don't need to be afraid to face it, stay optimistic and positive thinking\"\nOverall, it is a must-watch and leaves a huge motivation to choose a path in life. It impressed me about how great a Bollywood film can be. Going from jubilant to sad in a split second, this film was such a roller-coaster experience. There were so many valuable scenes, that I even cried twice during the film. 3 idiots was just a perfect combination of educational and spreading awareness about academic related suicide risk in India covered with enough comedy. I can say that this is one of the best Bollywood film I have ever watched, 9/10 from me.",

Series of flashbacks lead us to the crux of the story, revealing the character exploitation and the urge of the film. Rancho is of the opinion that one should grab knowledge wherever it comes from ;so that success follows him pants down! Rancho outrages the Dean of the college on several occasions with his thesis and falls in love with his daughter Pia,who dismisses fer fianc\u00e9 Suhas ,a bank manager in USA and business minded Rancho tries to prove Raju about the necessity to get educated rather than cramming the entire course mindlessly.He along with Fahran develops a master plan to teach a lesson to Chatur and Raju,who changed his room on the advice of VIRUS(the Dean). Once Racho saves Raju's father,he becomes indebted. Raju is caught by the dean for urinating at his door,during the occasion of Rancho's proposal to Pia. Raju is given a choice either to betray Rancho or get himself rusticated from the college. Raju attempts suicide but later saved by Rancho and medicated. Raju gets a job in campus interview , whereas Fahran consoles his father to become a wildlife photographer.Thus both of Rancho's friends work on their passion. Rancho and Fahran steal the question paper from the Dean's cabin in order to save Raju from failing his exam. But the dean finds out instantly and rusticates all the three of them. Pia confronts her father revealing the suicide of her brother due to his 3 time failure in getting a seat in the college(of Virus). Pia's sister Mona labors ;later Rancho helps in her delivery. VIRUS understands the importance of the passion in life and lifts the rustication. Rancho decides to cut off all the relationships and leaves the college after graduation ceremony without informing anyone. Later we find that Rancho was not the landlord's son in Shimla and tampering of group photo at the college. After finding from real Rancho that ,their friend studied in his disguise Raju, Fahran and Chatur(Chatur actually aspires to meet Phunksukh Wangdu to sign a contract with his company and prove Rancho(disguise)that his principles were wrong) set out to Ladakh ,where their friend works as school teacher. At the climax it is revealed that Rancho(disguise) is Phunksukh Wangdu. Thus story exhorts that success chases a person who is well versed with knowledge",

Really Rajkumar Hirani put a lot off effort in making a modification. And he Represented the story into such a way we really thought for a second that if STUDIES are only meant for the marks, BUT Most important He Made us see What the Best students Can do for you. I will rate the story 4.5/5ACTING: Acting is one of the Strongest Criteria in 3 idiots. Lets start from the beginning. * In 3 idiots Sharman Joshi is at its best. Watch out his expression when the Virus tells that he will be suspended if he did not tell him who is with him last night so that he can suspend them.Madhavan does a decent job in playing as Farhan Quareshi.He is very very perfect at times, but sometimes got overboard as like in the scene when Virus spotted him in the wedding, he really did't know what to do at that time. BOMAN IRANI in his one of his finest performance ever. It is Enough to tell him about his performanceKareena Kapoor just plays himself. No special review for herSupporting Characters are really Good but the special mention goes to Omi Vaidya. He tops the Performance table in 3 idiots. Should i Add something more?AAMIR KHAN . H Really plays Rancho so perfectly we forgot Aamir khan is the 44 year superstar. But in some scenes he tries hard to be college boy. Like during the Song AAL IZZ WELL When he was Taking calculation of plane he sees up for 1 second like he was something revising. Thats the thing that a primary child do.I will rate it 4/5CINEMATOGRAPHY: Cinematography was really the best. You can see the The level of extent of cinematography During BEHKTI HAWA JAISE THA WOH song. rating it 4.0/5SCREENPLAY DIRECTION: I have no words to express the screenplay and direction. Just rating it 9/10SOME GOOFS: There are some Goofs that I would I like to share*One goof written in IMDb that They traveled from Delhi to Manali continuously for 12 hrs with no night scene*How many Colleges Have the direct Contact Between the Dean and students and especially in the No 1 college of India. By looking 3 idiots I started to feel that there is only one batch studying in the collegeBIGGEST GOOF * When Farhan Quareshi Sees the Group Photograph of BATCH. he sees that Javed Jaffery was sitting right to the Boman Irani. Didin\"t Boman Irani Have realized that The person sitting next to him was not rancho and that even so when ranch has got most popularity in the college. did\"t Someone realized that he is not the person in his session and why he was sitting in the place of rancho. VERDICT : MUST WATCH. Reducing it 1 mark for Somewhat Unrealism20.5/25 = 82%PERCENT = 8/10",

            "content": "Well, I guess my sub-heading sums out what I feel about this film! For those who do not know, this film is brought to you by those who gave you the Munnabhai series and for those who have not seen this, would definitely recommend. Once again this team of producers do not disappoint! Add in Aamir Khan to it and you have a masterpiece. Not because of the location of where the film is produced, or because they show every young actor wearing a branded designer garment or using technology (or how i refer to as Sugar coating)to cover up a poor story line, but they actually use a very serious topic that involves the flaws of their education system and tells a story in a unique and clever way that as a film lover you will enjoy, yet you will understand the message they are trying to portray. Not generally being a fan of Bollywood movies due to its unrealistic story lines and OTT (over the top) acting and agonisingly long movies, I must say two and a half hours for this movie was short as it was very entertaining. Not being fluent in Hindi, I was being reliant on the subtitles for this movie, so I guess I missed some classic jokes and their meanings, as when translated they probably are not as funny, but nevertheless, when i say that this movie is hilarious, I mean HILARIOUS! Ingenious comedy not slap-stick OTT things that Bollywood is branded for.Most of the other reviewers have all commented about the movie and the storyline and actors, so for me to repeat all of that wouldn't be wise. But on that note, I would like to mention one actor who of course is Aamir Khan, this guy is a legend! Please do not misinterpret me when I say that he was the only person who made this film a success because that would not be fair, the supporting cast did a very good job and many of the actors have definitely not done their careers any harm but the reality is people paid money to watch Aamir and not the other actors and once again he delivered. He is like the Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise of Bollywood (in their Prime)who is an actor or should I say an artist who always tries to better himself and raise the bar as high as he can, by trying different roles and not being type casted. Aamir has probably played most roles now through from comedy to historical and etc and in each one he grows as an actor.Similar to the marketing tool, the Maslow Hierarchy of needs, where it shows the stages of life a person has to go on before they are satisfied before moving to the next level, Aamir would be be near the top where the basics of acting and making a name for himself have been accomplished, also making money would now be his least of worries, but to change cinematography, tackle political problems of the country, make a difference to others and to be an innovator/ a pioneer rather then a follower is the steps he is taking.This film will surely be an epic in years to come and hopefully not just the directors but also fans should wake up and see that this is the sort of quality they should expect and support if they really want to be respected in worldwide cinema. Drop all these fancy locations, Western type of life styles, bad acting and repetition of story lines instead, concentrate on writing meaningful and an innovative story lines that will inspire and make India proud. And what is this with every film trying to be produced in different countries? India is a beautiful country with many riches, great locations, landscapes etc as showed in this film, as some scenery shots are magnificent and breath taking that you wonder what makes people want to film abroad when there is still so much to show of India?..TOURISM IN India..take note! this is your chance to show how beautiful your country is, use this to show the world how great we are.And with that I conclude, without giving the story away at all where just like the film Avatar, this is the making of a movie that will inspire others and change cinematography forever. WATCH THIS MOVIE on the big screen! To feel the real power of 3 idiots and other people's reactions to this classic!! ENJOY!!",

Wont spill out any spoilers here but would of course stamp Excellent Performance!on each and every actor of this movie Bows for Aamir ! Must add I had watched Avatar just yesterday and though it was fascinating it was not as influential and touching as 3 idiots. Theater response was too good , and that dhan-chamatkar scene was simply Way too Hilarious . For those whom it itches the fact of Aamir is playing a college kid, Aamir initially refused to act but later accepted this as a challenge improvised it an crafted role to Perfection. Sharman's scenes were also amazing few were tear jerking while while few were Hilarious , Maddy especially excelled in His Father Son argument scene . Also length wise it is perfect; and choreography , hostel scenes and few emotional scenes were executed with perfection .",

An upbeat music starts to play, everything that she sees like her own father, the presenter, the character in a movie, all becomes Rancho's face. That's really represent lovesick that Phia's felt. The music is really catchy and the choreo's are crazy, just like them. Therefore, there's so much happened on that scene. They were jumping from scene to scene. For me personally, it's really hard to follow every scene that's happened. Overall, that scene is really stand out from other scenes, for me, their costumes and the background are really suitable with each other and also, they put a lot different concept and that what it's makes them really catchy and pretty hard to follow.",

Everyone played their parts exceptionally well in this must see blockbuster comedy. Aamir Khan has now become an actor who chooses his films and roles with perfection. Boman Irani (the only actor who has appeared in all of Rajkumar's films) failed to disappoint once again.There were side-splitting scenes that I will remember for life, but I do not want to give these away. They will have to be seen before they can be believed! With every good story, there is always an underlying and important message. In this film, it is the following: \"Every person in this world is born with a gift and a passion, which cannot morally be forced upon that person.\" An inability by Indian families to recognise this fact of life is leading to tragic consequences, which can tear such families apart.For me, 3 Idiots has made the end of 2009 an ever-lasting memory.

            "content": "3 Idiots is a comedy-drama Bollywood film with a bit of a musical genre. The story starts with two friends, Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman), who misses their lost friend from college, Rancho (Aamir Khan). They have been searching for him since they graduated, but no one knows where he is. And one day, Chatur (Omi), a guy who hates Rancho in college, contacted them and stated that he knows where Rancho is. So the three of them set out on a journey to find their lost friend. The story is about a beautiful friendship of the 'three idiots' and a satire about the Indian education system at that time.There are many meaningful scenes from this film, but there are some scenes that caught my attention. It was when Farhan decided not to show up for his job interview, while his father was waiting for his son at home who would become an engineer. When he came home, Farhan told the truth that he wanted to be a photographer. Farhan said that he'd rather curse his poor life but live it happily. Instead of being rich but cursing his dad every day because he lives in torment. He responds to his father with tears in his eyes. This is a highly significant and emotional scene. His father has silently approved of his son's life decisions and backs him up in anything he does. And also when Raju did his job interview, answering all the questions straightforwardly then got accepted. I found both scenes interesting because it's the start of their new journey. Raju finally comes out of his fear, and Farhan finally does what he loves. And after the scenes, they both pay respect to Rancho, which is very emotional and heart-warming.For me, this movie is like a full-course meal. You could get all types of emotions by watching it. I love how this film teaches people about life and facing your fears, it's both encouraging and powerful. I also love how they brought up serious issues, such as social pressure, depression, mental illness, suicide, the education system, etc. Rajkumar Hirani, the director of this film, did an amazing job by covering all of those issues in one film. The plot of this film is very interesting with the background of the past and also the present. Presents an unpredictable plot with comedy but is heart- warming. The movie is also very well-paced and entertaining. Although it is an almost-3 hours long movie, it didn't feel so long and was not boring at all. There is no doubt about the very well-played character by several well-known and charming actors and actresses. This film was also supported by original soundtracks which are certainly very suitable in bringing some sing-along scenes typical of Bollywood films.This film, in my opinion, is such an incredible film. It has such a fantastic uplifting message. It is to always do well despite a variety of academic constraints. We can fight but don't forget about your friends that are fighting beside you. This film teaches us to be human again, rather than machines that can perform work indefinitely. This film is equally sarcastic, focusing on the hectic environment of college life.",

            "content": "We get to follow the journey of the '3 Idiots' as they overcome their challenges in college and learn what comes after it. Rancho, Raju, and Farhan, the three major characters, portray many important messages in this great film. The plot unfolds in a novel comic manner, enthralling the audience as it progresses. This film is an excellent introduction to Bollywood filmmaking.Not only does this slow-paced picture contain comedy, but it also contains a range of instructional messages. It's simple to draw conclusions from the many hardships depicted, one of which being the educational system's struggles. In one incident, a student named Joy attempted suicide as a result of the high expectations placed on him. Students at the school were expected to perform flawlessly because the administration exclusively valued high scores and numbers, leaving no room or value for learning. It also resulted in a great deal of stress, which prompted Joy to take his own life. Rancho claims that \"This is not a suicide, but a murder,\" and that the suicide was a result of the education system's emphasis on test results, which he believes was the cause of the lack of sufficient care towards students. This demonstrates how the educational system can be tainted because progress is rarely appreciated and decisions are made solely on numbers and grades rather than the actual learning process.The film was also extremely warm. What made the film so moving was the intimacy and cooperation between the characters. There was a lot of cooperation among the characters in a few of the scenes. It was inspiring to witness how they worked as a team to help Pia give birth, devoting so much time and effort to finding solutions to the issues they faced. The moments seemed really motivational and motivating after seeing their hard work as a group.There was this iconic line from the movie, it's none other than \"Aal izz wel\". It might sounds very strange but the meaning, \"No matter how critical your condition is, be sure that everything will be fine\" is just very perfect. This word was said by Rancho when he or his friends were feeling afraid or anxious. And this odd looking word acted as a savior for Pia's sister. When she gave birth and the baby didn't move, Rancho started to recite this 'magic' word and boom! The baby started to move all of a sudden.Putting aside everything else, the film was a fantastic satire. As the very first few Bollywood movies we watched, it successfully filled us with smiles and laughter. It was an incredibly powerful piece since it was not just humorous but also musical and informative. With such a long duration, the film felt quite comprehensive. The story was well-told, with a lot of depth and detail. Not to mention conveying a great lesson to the audience, reminding us not to be concerned about what the future holds, as stated in one of our favorite lines, \"Pursue excellence, and success will follow.\"",

However, to remain subjective, I will base this on if as if I'm reviewing any other movie.'3 Idiots', is a story about 3 college students. Two of them are idiots, Qureshi and Raju. While the other is smart. Rancho. These 3 characters provide a unique dynamic relationship that gives an impression to the audience that any form of friend group can work. From a glance, it's quite hard to make these 3 characters make sense in a way. Most of the time it results in the smarter character carrying a burden from these 2 giving a pity and sympathetic feeling towards the audience. That may be good if the author is trying to convey that feeling. However, in regards to '3 Idiots', tis obvious the author is not.The tone of this movie is quite a shamble. Although labeled as a comedic movie. It also tackles very emotionally, dark subjects that are found in emotional, drama genres. However, it also inserts musical dances periodically as a form of a break for the audience to process the prior dark plot. Or even, setting a light, happy mood for the audience before presenting them with a dark plot twist. The contrast of this scene gives an emotional shock and will change the audience's mindset throughout the movie.I particularly like this one character over its roots and inspiration. The headmaster. The headmaster's inspiration can be traced to student frustration with their orthodox, conservative teacher. By expressing his character with exaggeration, the author has made it where the audience finds ironic comedy coming from said character. Turning to some, a traumatic and loathed part of their life, into a character the audience can laugh at and enjoy.",

The CGI isn't excellent, but it is impressive considering the budget as well as the time the movie was made. The camera work was satisfying, but the editing wasn't as good. The transition between the past and the present, however, was better than most modern film. There were a lot of heartfelt moments such as the scene when our protagonists try to cheer up their friend to get a reaction from them, which eventually led to their friend regaining consciousness from a coma. I like our protagonists' take on the school system and their personalities. All of the characters have a well written story and it doesn't feel as if one is getting more time with the audience than the other.While I have positive things to say about this film, I must admit there are things about this movie I dislike. The movie felt very rushed at the beginning, as if there was a prequel to this one that I haven't yet watched. At certain points in the movie, the mood changes in a sudden and unexpected matter, such as after the \"all is well\" song ended. That would usually be a good thing, but this movie is seemingly directed to a younger audience and I personally feel that scene was too inappropriate for the film's PG-13 rating. I also dislike in general, emotional scenes being disrupted to make the audience laugh with a joke, such as the scene in the bathroom once two of our protagonists finished their meeting with the university director. There we're a few scenes that seem too unrealistic, such as the time our protagonists crash a wedding, and then the second time.8/10 would watch again.",

At first, I didn't expect too much from this movie as the first few scenes were quite shocking, I didn't expect to see guys in boxers and men peeing outdoor, but it did contain many good messages about struggles that actually happened in people's daily life and the movie was pretty successful in delivering the messages and was able to touch my heart as well. Although, the first quarter of the movie made me think that it was going to be a general story of a genius rebel student trying to change the education system for the better. Well, it was actually true, but the movie actually conveyed deep messages rather than only delivering comedies. The comedy itself was actually out of pocket and rather cringy, but I love cringe comedies so I did enjoy the movie.The casting is great, the actors and actresses played their role well and the movie is great when it comes to making personal branding for each character. We might remember Rancho as the idiotic-genius risk-loving person, Raju as the dumb, kind, a hardworker and a more normal friend, while Farhan is the kind of person who always prioritizes others over himself. These characters also show growth in their personalities as they were able to go out of their comfort zones and achieve a better life. My favourite part of the movie was probably the scene where Farhan finally told his parents that he actually wanted to pursue wildlife photography. I love how his father still cares for him and actually lets him do what he wants to do and continue to be happy.A few issues I have with this movie was probably the plot. Since the plot was going back and forth between the flashbacks and the present, it was kinda hard for me to differentiate as there were no difference in colour, cinematography, or anything between the scenes in the past and present. Also sometimes, the characters went overboard when trying to deliver the messages, an example is when Chatur delivered his speech and some of the words in the text are changed by Rancho into inappropriate words. The message that is being conveyed in the scene was actually great, but the way it was delivered was too much and actually disrespectful given those kinds of actions were not necessary to convey the message. I'm afraid some people were not going to catch the message and only focused on the excessive joke.But overall, it was a good movie that contained more than just comedies. I recommend it to students and people of older ages because some scenes may not be suitable for kids or if you are not in the mood to see people peeing every now and then.",

In the end of college, he was able to convince his father that his real love is photography and he will never be able to become a good engineer.

He didn't fear anymore. Neither death nor poverty.Since I made a generalized comment on mothers let me dig deep into it. Mothers are different kind of creatures. Usually one finds fear and greed in people. Like greedy people are always more fearful also and vice versa.

While convincing Kareena that Suhaas is not the right guy for her, Rancho explains how to know when one is in love. There is a pleasant air, whispering light music and everything happens in slow motion. It's like time has stopped. We do find people like Suhaas in our life who only talk about the price tag.When the librarian told the meaning of \"chamatkar\", chatur immediately replied that he doesn't want to know the meaning of every word in speech. He will just cram it up and then deliver on the function day. The most common attitude of people on campus. Nobody changes with time but people get to know themselves with time. And that is how, they improve. Chatur remained the same in more than 10 years. He crammed, he farted, he conspired. Later on he became successful. He has a beautiful wife, a $ 3.5 m mansion, a Lamborghini and what not. He boasts it all.Rancho expressed his disappointment over the system. He had some ideas. Like bookish knowledge should not the measure of learning. Grades should not be displayed in public view. Innovation and experiments should be encouraged and failure should not be frowned upon.",

However, knowing he went to a top university without his real identity, kind of hit me because it means that he did not study for \"success', he just wanted to learn as much as he can. It opened my eyes that the true purpose of studying something is not just for us to graduate, we also gotta feed the brain. I honestly didn't think that this movie would be this amazing, i have set my expectations to the lowest, but it's surprisingly so good !!",

This is about three students in India's top engineering college. Amir teaches us through this movie that one can attain all the satiable success and glory in this world as long as he chases his dreams. It is YOUR life so care less about what others have to say and believe in your own heart's voice. At times the movie is emotionally intense, for instance, when Raju (Sharman) tries to commit suicide, and it is also full of LOL moments, for example, almost all encounters of Rancho (Amir Khan) with the principal aka VIrus(Boman). To conclude, the movie is a complete package, arguably the best movie in the history of modern Bollywood. It earned over 200 crores in India alone, the first ever.",

Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of 'Rancho' in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person who's not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, it's Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamir's ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009.

All the cast in the movie played their roles superbly, especially Amir Khan was outstanding in his role.

The main theme of the movie states that we the students can excel or achieve anything in life which if he/she has interest in it.3-idiots not only entertains, but it also gives us lesson. This movie teaches us forward-thinking and give us hope and courage.\nMovie contains many positive aspects of life like it said in the movie that \"we should learn but first by understanding it not by memorizing it.The most positive message that was given in this movie was \"to join that career which you like the most\". The golden rule which 3 IDIOTS teaches us in a light and entertaining way is that \"Whatever the problem in life is, just say to yourself \"All is Well\". This won't solve your problems, but it will give the courage to face it. \"Chase Excellence and success will follow \"and also \"life is not about getting good grades but chasing your dreams\".\nBut still the movie contains some negative aspects as they have showed some serious content which is effecting our society. They remembered the message of \"following your heart's desire\", but they forgot that only hard work and persistence are the key for success.\"3 Idiots\" was passed with U/A ( Under Adult) certificate by Censor board. Still, there are some scenes which should not shown to children and many audiences. Attempted & Suicide scenes by the students in movie giving wrong message. Baby delivery scene was also not appropriate for children. Chatur 's speech may be funny, but it showed negative effects in children. The speech also contains explicit Hindi words, which should not be shown like this. Ragging scenes is promoting ragging in universities which is an serious crime. Kissing Scene by the actors at the end was also not appropriate for children.\nBut in short, this is must watch movie as it teaches great lesson for the students and also for the teachers as well. I hope everyone who will watch this movie and will enjoy it.\nI am giving it 10/10.\nThanks!",

            "content": "The movie '3 idiots' is a masterpiece directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The movie revolves around the lives of three engineering students of Imperial college of Engineering. Rancho, who is gifted, Farhan, who possesses the passion of photography and Raju, who wants to help his poor family by getting a good corporate job. The movie tries to draw special attention to the pressure the Indian education system and the Indian society puts on students. While the engineering discipline is highly glorified by the society as depicted in the movie; disciplines such as photography are degraded.The movie tries to depict the struggle those students face who are forced into the discipline of engineering. It is a story of almost every student in South Asia who is passionate about something in life however due to family and societal pressure cannot pursue their career choice. They, then lose the battle against the tough, impossible and cruel system and in result lose their life by committing suicide.The movie shows the unbreakable bond of the \"idiots\" trio. The head of the institute, Dr Viru Sahastrabuddhe also called Virus by his students, tries to break the friendship of the trio by distancing Farhan and Raju from the rebellious Rancho as Rancho becomes a challenge for him. However, he fails to do so as Rancho helps Farhan to follow his passion and saves Raju's father from dying with the help of Pia, younger daughter of Virus.The character of Rancho is played by the versatile actor Amir Khan who never fails to do justice to the characters he plays. Rancho is a character to amaze people through his thoughts, his ideas, his unusual ways of understanding and expressing knowledge, his innovative inventions, his passion for achieving something in life not through copying and cheating but experimenting and exploring. He builds strong emotional bond with Farhan and Raju. He encourages Farhan to give his passion of photography a chance and try to convince his father to allow him to pursue photography. On one hand, we see Rancho, who believes in understanding, simplifying knowledge, enjoying his passion for science and engineering and implementing his knowledge practically. On the other hand, we see Chatur, often called 'Silencer' by the trio, who Is obsessed with memorizing books and topping the exams. These two types of characters are portrayed in the movie to show contrast to the audience between the two different techniques that the students follow.The way the director shot the movie is to the point. It is full of fun and lessons. All the actors played their part brilliantly and contributed to the success of the film. The audience of the movie may be anyone. Adults, kids and students particularly those who belong to engineering as they can easily relate themselves to the movie. The good thing about the movie is that it focuses on the issues which are ignored in the society. However, one negative point I noticed in the movie was that it portrayed suicides. Suicidal scenes may affect the younger audience in a negative way.Conclusively, the lessons that can be learned from the movie are that memorizing the curriculum word to word is not the aim of education however understanding is. Topping the batch does not declare you to be successful. Additionally, the main aim of education should be understanding and to convey meaningful knowledge to the students rather than forcing and pressurizing them to follow a strict, exhausting and punishing curriculum. The movie throws light on the way teachers do injustice to their students and how the pressure that they put on students forces them to commit suicide. The movie emphasizes the need to develop passion for learning in students. Moreover, the students should be given choice to choose their career path and not forced into science and engineering disciplines just because they are thought to be the most successful career choices. Being an engineering student myself, I would rate the movie 10/10 because it perfectly shows the life of students and what they go through.",

Aamir Khan as Rancho plays the role of a very bright student who motivates his friends pursue their passion and make a career out of it. R.Madhavan as Farhan who wants to become a wildlife photographer but was forced to pursue engineering because of his strict father . Sharman Joshi as Raju who is pursuing engineering with the goal of getting his family out of extreme poverty. Boman Irani as virus who plays the role of a strict college director who is highly competitive. Kareena Kapoor as Pia who plays the role of virus's daughter and falls in love with Aamir khan . The film goes very smooth. The film's first half includes ragging scene, confrontations with the professor, Chatur's speech and mournful meal at Raju's home. Overall the film depicts a very nice mingle of comedy, suspense and motivational. All the actors and co-actors done a commendable job. The music of the film was very soothing. The back ground music supports the film all through the movie. Overall depiction is fine. Some of the scenes are really emotional. Overall rating is excellent.Its definitely a one time watch.",

            "content": "Buckle up audience and get ready to be entertained, as the brilliant mind behind the Munnabhai Series (Rajkumar Hirani) and Mr. Perfectionist (Aamir Khan) are coming together for the first time. The marketing strategies followed have hit the right chord, especially the 'alternate reality gaming' which has become quite a rage. Will the sky rocketing expectation of the most awaited movie of the year be met? Can Mr. Perfectionist give his second Christmas blockbuster in a row? 3 Idiots does prove a worthy follow-up to the Munnabhai series for the Vinod Chopra- Rajkumar Hirani duo, and a sure-shot extension to the successful streak of Aamir Khan. This might not be '5 point someone' as Hirani promised, but it has all the ingredients to be 'Munnabhai 3' with several sequences, reminding us the classic tale of Laxmi Prasad Sharma.The film won 40 accolades; among these are six Filmfare Awards including best film and best director, ten Star Screen Awards, sixteen IIFA awards and three National Film Awards. In January 2014, it was nominated in the Best Outstanding Foreign Language Film category for 37th Japanese Academy Awards.",

People mainly memories the whole book but actually they don't understand the meaning, just like how Silencer being tricked. Besides, if you want to watch a film as leisure, well, this isn't a bad choice either! There are jokes (funny ones, not The Interview 2014 jokes) that make you laugh, like Rancho pretended to be a sheriff and warned Silencer that his life is in danger...if he don't aware the traffic while crossing the road. For me, my favorite part of the film is the ending, while Silencer discovered that Rancho is indeed Professor Wangdu. It is really nice to end a movie and it is really meaningful. So I strongly recommended this movie!",

Direction: Rajkumar Hirani Music: Shantanu Moitra Production: Vidhu Vinod Chopra ProductionsThe story is about two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) who on getting a clue on the whereabouts of their college friend, Rancho (Aamir), start a quest to find him. Rancho in his college days was an exceptional, but 3 idiotsThe movie is a joyful ride from start to finish with the pace tilting downwards only in the middle of the second half. Few good twists and the non-linear style of storytelling help the proceedings in a big way too. But Rajkumar Hirani borrows most of his jokes from the net and also does go filmy in a few scenes like the Sharman interview sequence or Aamir crying for every little thing that his friend does, or the scene where Mona Singh is having a baby and the scene after that. But scenes like the speech by Omi for teacher's day, or the first time Rancho visits Raju's house or Mona Singh's marriage, helps in bringing down the entire theater with laughter. Initially, getting to believe Madhavan or Aamir as college students might be quite tough, but as the screenplay moves, we just start enjoying the movie and their acting. Aamir Khan is spectacular as Rancho and age aside, we can't think of a better Rancho after seeing the movie. Madhavan might not be looking as a college student but he brings a new dimension to his acting repertoire - a brilliant act. Sharman shows his excellence in a role which seems to be written for him. Kareena looks cute and does her role with equal cuteness. Boman Irani is brilliant, but what's new in it? Mona Singh is good in a small part. The actor enacting the role Omi is easily the find of the season; he is exceptional in almost all his scenes and is a riot to watch. It's been quite a while since we saw the entire theater clapping, laughing aloud and whistling with you. It's a complete theater going experience. 3 Idiots is easily going to be the number one movie for quite a while at the box-office and can very well be the number one movie of the year. Hirani manages to give an excellent entertainer with a subtle message one more time.",

            "content": "Cast: Amir Khan, Madhaan, Sharman Joshi, Karena Kapoor Khan, Omi Vaidya and Boman Irani\nDirector: Rajkumar Hirani\nSynopsis: One of my favorite movie, which is funny, emotional and educational. A story of three funny best friends of an engineering college in India, whose family background was totally different from each other. Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam give a call to his college mates Raju Rastogi and Farhan Qureshi for a reunion with Rancho after ten years of their graduation. Chatur finds a rarer picture of Rancho who was not in connection with them since their graduation day did not have any information about him. Now, Raju, Farhan, and Chatur started their journey to meet Rancho in Shimla, India. In a journey to meet Rancho, Farhan is recalling all of the memories from their first - last day of college. Their college experience was challenging in every step but also Rancho challenges his college dean Viru Sahastrabudhhe \"Virus\" every day. Review: First time I have watched this movie, I think it was confusing, worthless and timewasting until I watch the movie at home with my parents. I had watched the first day, first show with my best friends and we critic whole movie worthless. We used to like action, dramatic and documentaries movies until we have watched this movie for the second time. Since then this is one of my favorite movies forever. One of the take of way from this movie was Rancho dialogue \" All is well\" meaning when ever you have to deal with difficulties movement in your life, forget everything, place right hand in left chest and say \"All is well\" to decrease your heartbeat. One of my favorite sense from the movie is when that Chatur gives the speech in teacher day in front of the minister, principle, dean of college including teacher and students. Virus advised Farhan and Raju to be aware of Rancho and start their new life along with Chatur. Farhan ignored Virus advice but Raju thinks it was turning point for him so he started a friendship with Chatur. Now, Farhan and Rancho want to give Chatur hard time and lesson to Raju by changing scripts. Since Chatur was born in Uganda and studying in English, he Hindi was very weak. So, Farhan and Rancho take this opportunity to changed teacher day scripts using slang words in the middle of a paragraph. Now, when Chatur started speech, the whole auditorium laughs because scripts were not only funny, however, every word gives negative sense to insulting teachers and minster.The movie contains the good quality of sounds, mixing, color contraction and animation. They have used animation of human sperms to emphasize Farhan birth and Raju critical condition in hospital. They have used silence as a sound effect in Raju sense where he jumped from the terrace committed suicide after meeting with Virus. The contrast sensitivity of Raju, Rancho, and Farhan drinking alcohol under moonlight looks pure and natural. Finally, the title of the movie intended to be funny, but also, I viewed the movie as educational, dramatic and emotional. Every character of movie contributes a lot to be one of the best films including the director himself play a varied role including editing and writing. This is one of best movie for college students, parents, and teachers. This movie was rated 8.3 out of 10 which is pretty impressive and I think this movie deserve it.",
