            "content": "S\u00e9verine (Catherine Deneuve) is a bored, affluent housewife. We meet her first when she is forced to dismount from a carriage. Her husband Pierre ties her to a tree, whips her, then leaves her to be raped by the two carriage drivers.S\u00e9verine is prone to fantasies. She is in a conventional marriage. Pierre is a handsome young surgeon. They sleep in separate beds. An older friend, Henri, keeps hitting on her, but she tells him to keep his compliments for himself. He is attracted by her blonde perfection, her virtue and her icy disdain.Taking fantasy a stage further, S\u00e9verine gets a daytime job at a high class brothel. At first she is prudish and wants to pick her clients. Then she is shown 'a firm hand' - which the masochistic side of her nature relishes.Re-released almost forty years after its original cinema exhibition, Belle de Jour still has the power to shock. Not through explicit nudity (it is a highly erotic work without being titillating) but by the shocking images, and the superb performances that contrast the aloofness of the bourgeoisie to the practicality of sex, of elegance to depravity. Scenes of S\u00e9verine having mud thrown at her stick in the mind no less than the tentativeness with which she approaches the brothel for the first time, dressed in black, and ready to take flight at any moment. Couture by Yves Saint Laurent and lush photography drown us in luxurious chic. The stylish settings arouse our aesthetic senses, and the languorous pacing and emotional complexity keep us trying to figure it all out long before we realise just how difficult that is going to be. Analysing it in Freudian or purely sexual terms is less than satisfying. The characters are convincing - the posh conservative elite, the matter-of-fact but certainly not coarse madame, the pervs who visit the brothel, and the psychologically conflicted S\u00e9verine through them all. It is hardly a plea for sexual liberation - the men, even one that S\u00e9verine takes a fancy to, are pretty lowlife. Their strange fantasy requirements mete out the most fascinating tableau of perversions but even more fascinating is what we don't see: such as what is in the box brought by the Chinaman. We are forced to identify with S\u00e9verine - she is the most normal character - and yet the most convincing way to approach the film is one suggested by Bu\u00f1uel himself, as a parable attacking the decadence of the bourgeoisie. On a more elevated level, it is a forceful artistic statement that viewers addicted to linear storytelling may find hard to accept. It seems to anticipate Eyes Wide Shut in its treatment of hidden sexuality, but cinematically it is more linked to the surreal Mulholland Drive. Bu\u00f1uel's friend from University and at one point collaborator, Salvador Dali, could be similarly perplexing when it came to alternate realities. He said, \"People love mystery, and that is why they love my paintings.\" The mind is drawn to interpret a piece of art in a specific concrete way, but the artist may wish to express a concept that transcends specific examples. In Belle de Jour, Bu\u00f1uel claims that there are not two endings, just one ambiguous ending. When you have finished watching the film it is not hard to decide which scenes are reality and which are fantasy, but when you run it through your mind again it is equally possible to make alterations. Do we want to know what is in the box, or do we love the mystery?The name Belle de Jour can be read as a pun on 'lady of the night', since S\u00e9verine only worked in the day; everything becomes plain. This is maybe why it becomes her as her name at the brothel. But enter S\u00e9verine's feverish imagination and you might see something else.",

            "content": "The premise of BELLE DU JOUR is well known. A young, beautiful, and slightly frigid doctor's wife (Catherine Deneuve) secretly harbors fantasies of being dominated, humiliated, and abused by her husband (Jean Sorel.) When these fantasies can no longer be denied, she becomes a prostitute under the sponsorship of a possibly lesbian madam (Genevi\u00e8ve Page), working during the afternoons while her husband is at his own work. Her sexuality is awakened by the sometimes brutish clients, who soon discover that \"she likes it rough,\" and she is ultimately caught up a relationship with a truly dangerous client (Pierre Cl\u00e9menti) whose possessiveness threatens to destroy both her and her husband.Throughout the film Deneuve slips in and out of memory and fantasy, sometimes recalling herself as a possibly molested child, sometimes imagining herself as the victim in a series of sexual assault fantasies. Director Bunuel, whose masterpiece this is, so blurs the line between memory, reality, and fantasy that by the film's conclusion one cannot be sure if some, most, or everything about the film has been Deneuve's fantasy.Although it includes a number of impressive performances (particularly by Genevi\u00e8ve Page, her girls, and their clients), BELLE is essentially Deneuve's film from start to finish, and she gives an astonishing performance that cannot be easily described. Like the film itself, it is a balancing act between fantasy and a plausible reality that may actually be nothing of the kind. Bunuel presents both her and the film as a whole in an almost clinical manner, and is less interested in gaining our sympathy for the character than in presenting her as an object for intellectual observation.Ultimately, BELLE DU JOUR seems to be about a lot of things, some of them obvious and some of them extremely subtle. And yet, given the way in which it undercuts its realities by blurring them with fantasy, it is also entirely possible that the film is not actually \"about\" anything except itself. Individuals who insist on clear-cut meanings and neatly wrapped conclusions will probably loathe it--but those prepared to accept the film on its own terms will find it a fascinating experience.

            "review_title": "One of Bunuel's more well-known works; an interesting morality story with Deneuve",
            "content": "Luis Bunuel, notorious for his use of simple, striking, yet un-cannily affecting surrealism in movies, keeps it down to a lower (yet still imaginative) key for Belle Du Jour. This works though because un-like a film like Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie where surrealism was like another character amidst the other character's dreams and nightmares, this one only keeps in surrealism for the sake of the lead character's inner demons poking up through the every-day malaise. This lead, Severine, is played in one of Catherine Deneuve's key career performances, that finds that two-sided-ness she feels while married to her husband Pierre. She loves him, but there's something that she's not getting out of the marriage that's leaving her empty, aimless, and her fantasies- however in the realm of (dark) fantasy- go to show she needs to do something during the day. She then finds out about a high-class brothel with only a couple of workers already employed. At first reluctant, she gives in to her temptations, serving the odder types of Paris looking for a good time, with one of them, Marcel (Pierre Clementi) falling head over heels for her. What seemed most intriguing about the film was how Bunuel dealt with the themes- the two crucial ones being morality and sexuality. His imagery is direct, maybe too direct, but it gets its points across with a realism that is alluring and far & away (almost like a satire of such a life). She can't stop what she's started, and she doesn't really know how to end it unless she gets caught. Then with the sexuality, it's never over-emphasized (i.e. no nudity, outside of a quick couple of shots of nudity), and no one is shown having sex on screen. What comes out is the emotional tally of Severine, the other girls, and the supporting characters that come in and out of the brothel. It may seem dated at moments, and the observatory notes go to making the film seem a tad longer than it is. But never-the-less, Belle de Jour is a worthwhile, memorable effort of the 1960's cinema. And, at many times, it's quite funny. More than that, a laugh riot.",

            "review_title": "Great exercise in surrealism",
            "content": "\"Belle de Jour\" is generally considered to be director Luis Bunuel's masterpiece; a surprisingly revealing and seemingly personal venture into the world of eroticism and its deviances. It's a truly surrealistic exercise in ambiguity, fantasy, and reality. The line that separates them is blurred so much that the famously mysterious ending has had critics arguing for decades over its meaning.The fantasy sequences are usually signalled by the sound of carriage bells, but by the end of the film the viewer is no longer able to differentiate between what is another one of Severine's fantasies and what is reality. Even Bunuel admitted to not knowing himself. He said that \"by the end, the real and imaginary fuse; for me they form the same thing.\" The gorgeous Catherine Deneuve, resplendent in her icy prime, portrays Severine Sevigny, the middle-class wife of Pierre, a doctor. She is frigid, virginal, yet seemingly happy enough in her bourgeoisie life and its trappings. However, upon hearing about a local clandestine brothel from a friend, she pays a visit to the madame, and becomes a prostitute, going by the name of \"Belle de Jour\", as she can only work in the afternoons. She apparently fully realizes and enjoys her sexuality, despite her guilty conscience, exclaiming that she \"can't help it\". She certainly doesn't need the money. She's bored with her life and her marriage, needing a \"firm hand\" to lead her; a need which the madame, Anais, who is obviously attracted to her, almost immediately recognizes. Her sweet and conventional husband is unaware, treating her much like a child, and the audience cannot help but believe that even if he knew of her true nature, he would not understand or empathize. She keeps her two worlds neatly separate until a patron of hers (whom she herself enjoys) becomes obsessed with her, and all is threatened.That Alfred Hithcock in particular admired this film comes as no surprise to me; Deneuve would have been the perfect Hitchcock heroine: an icy blonde who becomes \"a whore in the bedroom\", as Hitchock was fond of saying he preferred in his leading ladies. But this remark is not meant to simplify the story, its telling, or Deneuve's remarkable performance, which is what truly draws the viewer into the film.\"Belle de Jour\" was Bunuel's first foray into the use of color, and he employed it to great effect. From the fall colors displayed in the landscape scenes, to the subtle shades in Deneuve's clothing, the contrasts are set. While the world around her explodes in glorious hues, Deneuve's character is defined by her couture, if staid, wardrobe of tan, black, and white.\"Belle de Jour\" was unreleased for many years due to copyright problems, but finally re-released in 1995 through the efforts of director Martin Scorcese, and released on DVD in 2003. I've watched it twice in the past week and am still at a loss to describe it very well; suffice to say that I am in awe. It's an amazingly erotic film without any explicitness, and one that I expect hasn't lost any of its effect over the years. As the subject matter is handled very tactfully and without any actual sex scenes; a great deal is left to the viewer's imagination - which only serves the heighten the mysteries inherent at every turn in the film. The viewer is however drawn into the sense of feeling to be a voyeur into Severine's secret life; the careful choreography of scenes and camera angles contribute to the uncomfortable sense of intrusion by us, the viewers.There are many sub-stories and small mysteries in the film; for instance one of the most widely debated upon by critics is the mystery of \"what is in the Asian client's little box?\" that he presents first to one prostitute, who quickly refuses, then to Severine, who tentatively agrees. All the audience know is that it's something with a insect-like noise, and when the client leaves, Severine is sprawled face-down upon the bed, the sheets thrown about, and obviously pleased with whatever took place in the interim.\"Belle de Jour\" was awarded the Golden Lion at the 1967 Venice Film Festival, as well as the award for Best Foreign Film in 1968 from the New York Film Critics Circle.Interesting side notes: Bunuel himself had a shoe fetish, which helps explain the numerous shots of Deneuve's beautifully clad feet throughout the film, and the fact that every time she goes shopping, she buys shoes. He also appears in the film in a cameo as a cafe patron, and in another scene his hands are shown loading a gun.",

Just about everything here--especially the shocking conclusion--is open to interpretation, from impulse to rationalization, and it's to Bunuel's genius that he is able to stand back, letting his audience fill in the gaps in their imagination and, if necessary, implicate themselves. And in Deneuve, Bunuel has found a brilliant blank canvas for the audience to express themselves upon; never fully clear on her motivations (though some tantalizing flashbacks offer hints), she alternates between classic French coldness and classic French passion and though she's intentionally unreachable, she's always fully aware of how to manipulate the spell she's cast over you. A great example of a master of cinema in deep collaboration with a master actress--their exploration of the female psyche runs the gamut of every possible emotion while never being crass or lowering themselves to merely reducing and simplifying.",

            "review_title": "Towards a better understanding of Belle de jour...",
            "content": "Severine is a beautiful young lady belonging to the bourgeoisie society, married to a doctor, Pierre. Though she loves her husband, something stops her from going to bed with him. She is apparently troubled, and has erotic fantasies, with her husband always playing the bad guy - tormenting her. The director is very cunning in sprinkling some scenes from Severine's childhood which actually give a lot of clue regarding her troubled life. One such scene depicts her being abused by an elderly man (probably her father). This in my opinion is very revealing and makes our understanding of Severine's other actions/imaginations even better. She always considered herself impure, and was ashamed of letting her husband know that. This can be seen in one such sprinkler scenes where the girl Severine refuses to accept the holy offerings from the Father in the Church. And this scene is very aptly placed while Severine is found going up the stairs of the brothel to take up the job as a prostitute.Having been abused by an elderly man in her childhood, Severine, justifiably doesn't enjoy an young man's company in the bed (her husband). And she has erotic fantasies about going to bed with elderly clients at the brothel....again taking a job at the brothel is a fantasy and NOT real. This is very evident from the very funny, illogical incidents that take place in the brothel.Into her fantasies walks a young man and she had to please him on the bed at the brothel. While she lay on the bed, the young man notices a mark on her and queries her about it. When Severine says its just a birth mark (remember...this is analogous to the impurity she is carrying with her from her childhood), the young man initially rejects her (she thinks her husband would similarly reject her for her impurity) but finally gives in and enjoys her. Only then she realises that, the young man also bears a scar on his back, which he says is from a knife stab. She realises, everyone has a scar to be reconciled with in life. This gives her a great sense of relief and her attitude towards her husband slowly changes. In her fantasies, however, Severine sees a conflict between the young client and her husband, and that the young man kills her husband in a fit of rage, only to be killed in turn by the policeman. She ends the life of the young client in her fantasies. She confides in a family friend (who is actually shown as one more client at the brothel) and she is relieved that the husband knows the truth. This leads to a better understanding of her husband and a new relationship blossoms. Now, the husband, whom Severine thought was nothing but a crippled man, blind, and unyielding,she realises that she had in fact only imagined all that and puts an end to her fantasies, symbolised by the empty coach driven in the last scene.",

            "review_title": "Intentionally ambiguous Bu\u00f1uel drama proves to have a lot more style than substance",
            "content": "After reading countless reviews on the internet about 'Belle de Jour', I'm still not sure what famed surrealistic director Luis Bu\u00f1uel was trying to say. And if you asked Bu\u00f1uel what the meaning of the film was, he probably would have told you 'it is, what you want it to be'. I have come to conclude that in making a film such as 'Belle de Jour', Bu\u00f1uel is more interested in playing the provocateur than exploring any of the moral issues raised by the film's often cryptic narrative.Bu\u00f1uel as provocateur is evident in the film's opening sequence. In a matter of a few moments, an idyllic carriage-ride (seemingly a scene influenced by a 19th century romantic novel) morphs into a nightmare sequence of domestic depravity as Bu\u00f1uel's protagonist, S\u00e9verine (Catherine Deneuve) is viciously whipped by the menservants of her husband, Pierre. But in a blink of an eye, Bu\u00f1uel has the last laugh (or should I say the first laugh?) when we see that the assault on S\u00e9verine is a figment of her imagination. In reality, she is married to Pierre who is a respectable Parisian surgeon in the present day of 1967.But just as soon as we're introduced to this new 'idyllic' situation, Bu\u00f1uel is committed to shocking us again. S\u00e9verine and Pierre's situation is anything but idyllic as S\u00e9verine is plagued by nightmares of being sexually abused as a child and resorts to fantasies of sadomasochistic pleasure. As a result, they perversely sleep in separate beds and Pierre patiently tries to understand why his wife won't engage in any sexual relations.In reality, nothing is normal for S\u00e9verine--she must endure Husson, the boyfriend of the couple's friend, Ren\u00e9e, who has no guilt feelings about hitting on her and freely admits that he's a frequent visitor to a high-class whorehouse. This is how S\u00e9verine finds out about Madame Ana\u00efs' establishment, which she at first hesitantly applies for a job at, as a high-class call girl.While her motive for taking a job as a prostitute may have had to do with her unfortunate sexual experiences as a child, Bu\u00f1uel is more interested in contrasting S\u00e9verine's life as an unhappy, chaste housewife with her newfound enjoyment as aggressive sexual neophyte. None of this is shown explicitly and Bu\u00f1uel takes great pleasure in emphasizing S\u00e9verine's lack of guilt as she plies her trade amongst a group of decidedly tawdry clients. The clients include a vulgar businessmen who virtually rapes her and a man who resembles 'Odd Job' from the film 'Goldfinger', who leaves her on the bed smiling with her pants pulled down (implying that she's taken pleasure in indulging in anal sex). S\u00e9verine also expresses disgust to Madame Ana\u00efs. regarding a client who enjoys having his face stepped on, but can't help staring through a peephole, confirming that she's not immune to voyeuristic tendencies.Bu\u00f1uel will turn things on a head once again, when he introduces us to bad boy criminal, Marcel, a lout with metal teeth, who S\u00e9verine is immensely attracted to. Things go bad when Marcel becomes obsessed with S\u00e9verine and tracks her to her apartment after she tells him she can't see him anymore. His solution is to shoot Pierre who ends up in a coma. Marcel is soon afterward gunned down by the police but they fail to uncover his motive.Bu\u00f1uel comes full circle playing with his audience. If S\u00e9verine is repulsive in enjoying sex with the perverts back at the whorehouse, she's even more repulsive for being responsible for Pierre ending up paralyzed. After all, had she not decided to work at the brothel, Marcel wouldn't have ended up shooting Pierre. But things may not what they seem to be. Recall that S\u00e9verine refers to Pierre's \"accident\" as he sits in his wheelchair. An \"accident\" seems like an odd word to describe the shooting. Was it an euphemism or did Pierre actually have an \"accident\" (not the shooting) which caused him to become paralyzed? If so, the entire brothel sequence also may have been another figment of S\u00e9verine's imagination.The film ends with another seeming fantasy sequence, where Pierre suddenly emerges from his wheelchair and he and S\u00e9verine are happy together again. Is this another way in which Bu\u00f1uel seeks to laugh at our expense? Now S\u00e9verine is no longer the villain but perhaps the caregiver responsible for restoring her husband's health. Or is it simply 'wishful thinking' on S\u00e9verine's part? Recall the shot of Pierre's 'clutched' hand while he's in the wheelchair, suggesting death.For those who enjoy intentional ambiguity where you can read a multiplicity of meanings into a film, 'Belle de Jour' is for you. Others (including myself) seek narratives with a more clear-cut meaning. The best I can say for 'Belle' is that it has a distinctive style. It's also a film that engenders quite a bit of thought and discussion. Nonetheless, in the end, this is a film with a lot more style than substance.",

            "content": "'Belle de Jour' is Bu\u00f1uel at his weirdest: the Spanish master builds this movie on the relationship between the fantasy of conscious and unconscious dreams and reality. The dreamer is the beautiful S\u00e9verine (the magnificent Catherine Deneuve) a petite bourgeois woman trapped in a dull marriage which leads her to strive for something else, first in fantasy, and then in outright real life. S\u00e9verine's dreams are vividly sexual: the opening scene marks the tone of the movie and the character as she dreams with being raped, spanked and humiliated while her angered husband watches. Throughout the rest of the movie, S\u00e9verine will be trying to make these fantasies come true in a brothel she starts working at\u0085 or is she? This is what's fun in Bu\u00f1uel's movie: it's impossible to tell fiction from fact.S\u00e9verine is the heart and soul of 'Belle de Jour:' her journey through her own sexuality is riveting; she starts with as a repressed woman who's having marital problems, probably due to sex. As a way to get out of her dull life she starts working at a brothel during daytime, hence her nickname 'beautiful by day.' Some of the episodes at the brothel are funny: her first attempt at playing a dominatrix is an embarrassing experience for the poor S\u00e9verine who's not accustomed to the relationship between dominator/dominated; her experience with a creepy Asian client is highly enigmatic, mainly because of the famous and mysterious box the client brings\u0085 whatever it is, it seems to bring S\u00e9verine a lot of pleasure. Her she participates in a role-playing situation with a rich enigmatic man who asks her to perform a dead woman in a bizarre ritual/funeral scene\u0085 the level of insinuations this scene creates in one's mind is outstanding! Meanwhile, amidst all the pleasure, S\u00e9verine is haunted with a sense of guilt and shame as she keeps imagining herself being punished by her husband and his best friend. She ponders leaving the brothel until a new client, arrives and she's immediately attracted to him.Pierre Clem\u00e9nti was an outstanding revelation: although I had unknowingly seen him once before in Bertolucci's 'The Comformist' as the homosexual driver Lino, I certainly noticed him in this movie: he's a fascinating combination of style and substance with his amazing performance, playing the sophisticated, leather-wearing, cane-wielding, gold-toothed young criminal, Marcel, meeting S\u00e9verine when celebrating a successful bank heist. His obsession for her grows to fantastic proportions culminating in the unexpected tragedy of the third act. The end of the movie is perhaps the weirdest part of the narrative, the one where all interpretations become valid; it's also a great send-up on happy endings, and a fine conclusion to a thriller if this movie were a thriller\u0085 Bu\u00f1uel is just genius! \"Belle de Jour\" is a funny, tragic, and ultimately unique movie. I had the opportunity to watch it at a theatre room last year and obviously I felt the pleasure of seeing this bizarre masterpiece as all movies should be seen: on the big screen. I'll certainly feel the lack when I have to watch it on TV one day.",

In her other movies she is similarly \"detached\", i.e. unable to act. I guess this kind of underacting, or \"non-acting\" was suitable here, but that's not to say she's brilliant as some people think. The movie is again about kinkiness, Bunuel's favourite theme. Sex and sexual perversion, the hallmarks of European cinema. Bunuel was just a dirty old man, living out his own fantasies on screen, and yet film critics would have us believe that it's a \"master at work\". Well, even if he were a master \u2013 which he's not (he is merely a solid director) \u2013 the fact remains that he's a dirty old man. Isn't this obvious? Or is this ARTIST above such \"low\" human qualities\u0085 Film students and movie critics ought to stop regarding some film-makers as gods, i.e. stop worshipping them blindly and regard them as the mere humans that they are. Some of the dialogue in the early parts of the movie is absurd, and I don't mean weird, but unrealistic and just badly written. I have a distinct impression Bunuel wrote his scripts within days, hours maybe even; there is also very little perfectionism in the way he sets up scenes. The movie is okay, nothing more. It isn't dull, and it keeps one's attention: but why shouldn't it? Anything that goes on in a brothel is easy to watch without getting bored. Does one need to be a \"master of cinema\" to create an interest in watching the daily goings-on in a brothel?Watching some of Bunuel's sex-themed films, I am often reminded of Germany's \"Der Schulmaedchenreport\" films, which is a cheap soft-porn movie series filled with humorous and sometimes perverse anecdotes. Why are those films considered junk compared to Bunuel's \"masterpieces\"? Let's face it, his movies are solid, but were he not a left-winger he would not have had nearly this much admiration from the film world which is so infested by Marxists.Roger Ebert, that genius, is particularly mesmerized by the scene with the Chinaman. This happens to be the most badly acted scene in the movie - but to Ebert the mystery surrounding what's in the Chinaman's box seems to be of prime importance. \"What's in the box?\" writes Roger in his pretentious review. WHO CARES?! That guy probably had some metal balls in there which he wanted Deneuve to insert you-know-where. Big deal! What was Ebert expecting to be in the box? Litte green men? Diamonds shaped like elephants? Letters he wrote to his first girlfriend? Amazing... Denueve is sexually not attracted to her \"dull\" fianc\u00e9e. What she really craves is excitement, beatings, sexual perversion, submission and what-not. So what? Is this supposed to be \"deep\"? Believe me, I understood this movie - what's there not to understand? However, I do not see what's supposed to be so brilliant about this overrated little movie about sexual fantasies.",

            "content": "In Paris, the bored and frigid upper-class housewife S\u00e9verine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve) is married with the handsome doctor Pierre Serizy (Jean Sorel), and she fantasizes kink sex with strangers every now and then. Pierre's friend Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli) and his wife Renee (Macha M\u00e9ril) are frequently meeting Pierre and S\u00e9verine and after having lunch together, Renee tells to S\u00e9verine that their acquaintance Henriette is working in a whorehouse and Husson gives the address of a high-class brothel in Paris. S\u00e9verine visits Madam Anais (Genevi\u00e8ve Page) in her brothel and is hired to work from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM with the nickname \"Belle de Jour\". The young client Marcel (Pierre Cl\u00e9menti) has a crush on S\u00e9verine and becomes her prime client. However, when Husson discovers that S\u00e9verine is working in the whorehouse, she decides to quit the job. But Marcel does not intend to loose her. Today I have watched \"Belle de Jour\" maybe for the fifth or sixth time, now on DVD, and I still am not sure about what are S\u00e9verine's erotic daydreams and reality. My point of view is that the whole brothel thing is a fantasy of this repressed woman in her empty afternoons. Her erotic dream, entwined with her boring reality, ends with her husband paralyzed, Marcel dead and Husson telling the truth to Pierre. Now that her fantasy is complete, she begins another dream with the stagecoach in the park in the last scene. This is another fascinating film of the great Luis Bu\u00f1uel, one of my favorite directors ever, and the beauty of Catherine Deneuve is mesmerizing. Last time I had seen this film was on 22 October 2000, on VHS. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"A Bela da Tarde\" (\"The Gorgeous of the Afternoon\")",

            "content": "The always provocative Luis Bu\u00f1uel directed (and co-wrote with Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re) this adaptation of Joseph Kessel's 1928 novel, about the beautiful, apparently frigid 23 year-old wife (Catherine Deneuve) of a surgeon (Jean Sorel) who decides to live her fantasies at a brothel in the afternoons.Here, as in several of his films, Bu\u00f1uel makes a sharp, often disturbing, sometimes darkly funny, and always provocative meditation on the lifelessness of the French bourgeoisie, focusing on the boredom and private rebellion of a young woman so absorbed in her own fantasies that we don't know if what we are seeing is actually happening or only taking place in Severine's mind. Deneuve, gorgeous as ever, flawlessly plays Severine with a cold distance which is nothing short of intriguing. A character which could have easily been turned into a caricature, Deneuve makes Severine come alive in flesh and quiet desperation.Although more discreetly than in some of his other films, here Bu\u00f1uel also criticizes - with symbols, allegories, some subtler than others - the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church as an institution. His hand of surrealism, social and religious provocation make for a film that, over four decades after its release, remains strange, somewhat disturbing, and energetic. Severine is not a heroine or an activist for anything, but her rebellion is about her own deathly bourgeois condition. Prostitution here is never glamorized (even though, unlike the other prostitutes in the film, Severine is not doing it for the money - she doesn't need it); the clients are hideous-looking, quite often creepy and violent. Severine needs an escape from her suffocating life, and in her fantasies, the rougher, the better. If being a rebel is defying some sort of establishment (for whatever reason), then Severine is definitely a rebel figure; she defied not only society's moral grounds of decency (albeit slyly), but also her own inner demons. The answers to whether Severine's rebellion was worth anything is for the spectator to decide - and there lies the richness of Bu\u00f1uel's surrealist creation. 10/10.",

She decides to go to work in a whorehouse, where turning a few tricks in the afternoon is just the therapy she needs, especially since all her customers are kinky and twisted. Of course, their perversions are only artificial movie perversions, not the sort of thing a prostitute would be likely to encounter on a daily basis in real life.Her husband still doesn't get any sex, though, because that just is not the way she loves him. One of her jealous customers shoots her husband anyway, leaving him mute, blind, crippled, and incapable of having sex. Now she has the perfect husband. But not for long. A friend of the family decides her husband will feel as though he is a burden on his virtuous wife, so he tells him that she is a prostitute. That way he won't feel so guilty.But wait.

Don't watch it expecting psychedelic camera tricks and Freudian dream sequences - Bunuel is much too controlled for trickery, and much too tricky to allow you to calmly map out what is real and what is not. And don't expect to know exactly what has happened at the end or even to remember the film clearly later. Each time I see it again I discovered that that the film has somehow reassembled itself in my memory, so each viewing is fresh and surprising. Even if you don't give a tinker's melted watch about surrealism, and don't care to puzzle out reality from fantasy, there's still much to like here: frequent droll humor, a little bit of titillation, and a good performance from an incredibly beautiful young Catherine Deneuve.

To start with, there is no emotional honesty in this film, it's instead antiseptic and superficial. Deneuve's acting is poor, displaying all the range of a mannequin. Director Luis Bu\u00f1el weaves fantasies directly into the plot, but not in ways that hadn't been done before in 1967, and far from \"surreal\". There is nothing erotic at all here, and the fantasies seem suspiciously like male fantasies, not female. I did like how Bu\u00f1el avoided using a soundtrack, and the creepiness of the husband's friend (Michel Piccoli), but that's about it, otherwise it was a snooze. It's a little mystifying to me as to how this film is a masterpiece, but I guess to each his or her own.",

Oh give me Tarkovsky, Greenaway, Welles or Kurosawa; these men know the visual mind and weave something worth spending time with. Bunuel, Ken Russell, even John Waters go together as a single type, obvious minds way low on my `to watch' list.Here, we have a simple construction: dream and reality generating each other, each as a performance shaped by the unsettling marriage of natural yearning and artificial social convention. We the viewers and often the characters are voyeurs. Bluntly, heavily, exclusively symbolic. Minimal and skillful storytelling within this primitive form. Except for the international pedigree, that fits Ken Russell, and any number of preachers who use film as a vehicle rather than an art.The construction is so simplistic, even childish that the commentary on the DVD is a hoot. It features a woman with a southern accent reading the symbols for us: `now she drops the vase, symbolizing ....,' `now she walks through the frosted glass doors, symbolizing...' as if we were petulant Alabama schoolchildren. The whole enterprise strikes me as a comfortable, bourgeois intellectualism, but there is scant pleasure in this irony.The art of the film is limited to the narrow appreciation of the minimalism and economy in moving the story ahead.

            "review_title": "Overrated",
            "content": "There was something about the 1960s that brought out a playfulness in filmmakers which allowed them to not have to condescend to audiences and wrap up every little aspect of the film in a neat little bow. When the films' techniques and narrative strengths worked, as in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup, or Ingmar Bergman's Persona, the result was a great film. When neither worked, the result was a pretentious mess, like Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby or Luis Bu\u00f1uel's Belle De Jour- his 1967 foray into color film, based upon the same titled novel of Joseph Kessler, released in 1928.The film has been described as an 'erotic masterpiece,' but forty years later one is left with a film that has so little sex in it that it could pass as a PG film if released today, as well as lacking all eros. Mild sex scenes are not, by definition, eros, and it's difficult to believe that anyone watching this film could have been shocked, much less aroused by a single scene in it. Yes, young Catherine Deneuve, as bored bourgeois hausfrau S\u00e9verine Serizy, is her typical gorgeous self, but having seen her in several of her later roles, plus her featured role in Roman Polanski's Repulsion, I seriously must question whether she could really act. In Polanski's film, she plays a neurotic, sexually stifled woman who sleepwalks through her descent to murderess, after what was likely a childhood of sexual abuse. Similarly, her character of S\u00e9verine was sexually abused (seen through flashbacks, and after which she refuses communion), but unlike the Repulsion heroine/villain, is not repulsed by raw sex, but attracted to the filthy sadomasochistic aspects of it\u0085. Had Bergman made this film it would have been far subtler and better. That Alfred Hitchcock, by contrast, loved this film, says a lot, for his own films were equally dependent upon hamhanded views of sexuality, and most are equally outdated, as well, for that very reason. Apologists for the film claim that it allows viewers to bring their own thoughts and experiences into the film. Well, most films do, so that's not a great argument. Belle De Jour fails for the opposite reason; it lacks a core- emotionally, philosophically, and technically, masquing it all with claims of Surrealism- that label used to cover and alibi for all manner of bad art.In short, this film does not even walk the walk, and Bu\u00f1uel is not in a league with such filmmakers as Werner Herzog nor Antonioni, as far as symbolism goes. Belle De Jour may have titillated audiences four decades ago, but today it simply plays out as a wan and silly- as well as poorly wrought, exploration of a dull woman's sexual life, and how that keeps her deluded and miserable. One need not pay to see such, when a trip to the local supermarket can give you dozens of more interesting female subjects to choose from.",

We live in an era of explicit sex and violence in movies are commonplace, and where we are very rarely required to think. 'Belle De Jour' is not like this. What you don't see is more important than what you do. It is a movie which needs a little effort on the viewers part. Persevere, you will be rewarded.The basic plot is easy to understand. Severine (Catherine Deneuve in a superbly understated performance) is a beautiful, sexually repressed young bride. Her husband Pierre (Jean Sorel) adores her, but their marriage remains chaste. Severine suffers from dreams and hallucinations of debasement. She eventually is employed in a brothel during the day under a pseudonym, while continuing to live a bourgeois life with her unsuspecting husband. I won't reveal what happens after that.That is the bare bones of the story, but it gives you no idea of HOW Bunuel tells it, which is what makes 'Belle De Jour' such a gem. I think this movie is one of the landmarks of 1960s cinema, and has aged wonderfully. In fact it gets better and better as most contemporary movies about sex get poorer and poorer.

            "review_title": "The Ice Queen, Revealed and Ravished",
            "content": "One of the great surrealist dramas and a staple of cerebral erotica. Luis Bunuel, a director who has been considered the front-runner of Surrealism in cinema, has created a movie that unfolds like a Moebius strip -- beginning at the end, ending at the beginning, with no conclusion to its question. Who is Severine? The question is asked in several key moments throughout the story, but never answered in a satisfactory manner. All that can be done is to sit back and watch the story of how Severine gives in to her own desires and inner dreams and gets lost along the way....Erotica is one of the least understood of literary genres because of the exploitative nature associated with it. Very few people today can write erotica in a way that doesn't, in one way or another, fall into the traps of having to show more than imply and therefore render its effect a moot point. Writers Anais Nin and Pauline Reage were keen in making their worlds places where despite some explicit passages, sensuality was felt through a looking glass filter rather than slapped across the face. When seen under a surrealist vein, erotica becomes less sexual, more cerebral, and completely revelatory.Severine, like Sabina in Anais Nin's poetic novella of erotica \"A Spy in the House of Love,\" is dissatisfied with her life. Like Sabina's husband Alan, Pierre is completely unaware of who he's married to and is all business and travel. Both women, meanwhile, dream of escape, of male dominance asserting their own freedom, and will jeopardize their security. Both characters will undergo complete changes in their personality, under the guise of role-play, never allowing themselves to become attached to other men even when they may want to possess them completely, as Marcel does when Severine becomes inaccessible to him.Cinematically BELLE DE JOUR is perfect (even when this term sounds clich\u00e9). Severine's story is a full circle: she's seen in black, disguise, walking into Madame Anais' town-home; she emerges near the end wearing the same outfit, a cold socialite. (It's an interesting coincidence that Anais is the ringleader who controls Severine's dreamy incursions into sex, and this story bears a strong relation to Anais Nin's erotic writings, themselves incursions into surrealistic sensual dreams.) Madame Anais seduces her in the beginning with a kiss; Severine \"severs\" ties with Anais through a kiss. Also, Severine is framed in an isolated way, at the fringes of the action, in two scenes involving a male client at Anais' town-home -- both times this only makes her more visible, naked, vulnerable. In both she is taken by force, though the second encounter initiates those events that break the third wall and literally walk into her Architectural Digest home.BELLE DE JOUR is extremely, undeniably erotic. The opening sequence per se looks rather mundane -- Severine is subjected to a scene of debasement while her husband Pierre looks on -- but as the story progresses, it will take on a different connotation and from here on, unfold. Because there is no transition from this sequence to the next where Severine and Pierre are in their placid, empty bedroom, it sort of leaves the viewer hanging and wondering just what has taken place, or if anything has happened at all. Of course, Severine's own psyche takes center stage more assertively as she herself gets a stronger footing in her new situation, so these shifts become clearer as the movie goes deeper into her story.Sounds also play an important part of Severine's story: the jingling of bells signal the awakening of an erotic episode. Footmen enter the stage and bookend the story, cowbells become the appearance of bulls bearing names referring to \"expiation\", Severine is sodomized by a \"bull-like\" Asian man bearing a box that hums softly (and whatever is inside has to be clearly repugnant when another escort refuses to go to bed with the client). Bunuel, of course, wants show the hypocrisy behind the complacency of the upper class, and what better way to do so than via guilt. Severine, for example, can't stand Henri, her girlfriend's boyfriend, but through his suggestion she enters this strange world of hidden sexuality. We see her on two occasions as a little girl, in two moments of humiliation through her own guilt. She desires Henri while she also hates him -- a guilty pleasure. Henri discovers her secret and exposes her for what she is -- a common slut. If anything, even when he seems the villain of the piece, Henri can be related to Everyman longing for the ideal woman. Once he finds that she's really not that mysterious after all, he dumps her because she's lost her abstraction.It's this event -- ripping Severine off from her pedestal -- that finally \"severs\" her secure world even when she's apparently abandoned her profession. Again, much like Sabina in \"Spy...\" Severine is doomed now to assume a different role while still longing for her more carnal life, and with the faint ringing of those ghostly bells coming not long after Pierre reacts, weeping, to this \"revelation\", and possibly even dies (his twisted hand is an indication) it makes me wonder if their appearance is only the beginning of her punishment and another way the story becomes a complete cycle of erotic evolution that will take the viewer back to the Bois du Bologne and that coach ride.",

Luis Bunuel's Masterpiece of Erotica in which deals with a frigid young housewife , a virginal newlywed named Severine (Catherine Deneuve) married to a prestigious surgeon called Pierre (Jean Sorel) . She fantasizes about masochistic scenes with male people . Severine and Pierre's friend Henri Husson (Michel Piccoli) and his spouse Renee (Macha Meril) are usually having lunch together , then , Renee tells S\u00e9verine that their acquaintance Henriette is working in a brothel . Severine get the address of a high-class whorehouse in Paris and visits Madam Anais , she then decides to spend her midweek afternoons as a prostitute unbeknownst to her patient husband . As Severine works at her obsessive profession only from two to five . Surrealism and sour portrait upon higher classes, masochism , kinky sex , prostitution and sexual rites by the Spanish maestro of surrealism , the great Luis Bu\u00f1uel . In most subtitled versions of the film, an italicized font is used to help the audience spot S\u00e9verine's fantasies from reality . According to Luis Bu\u00f1uel scholar Julie Jones, Bu\u00f1uel once said that he himself didn't know what the end exactly means . Luis Bu\u00f1uel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion , issues well shown in a lot of films and that would preoccupy Bu\u00f1uel for the rest of his career . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay from the same Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Jean Claude Carriere , Bu\u00f1uel's usual screenwriter based on the novel by Joseph Kessel ,; they pull of a straight-faced treatment of shocking subject matter . After returning his native country, Spain, by making \u00a8Viridiana\u00a8 this film was prohibited on the grounds of blasphemy as well as \u00a8The milky way\u00a8 or Via Lactea , both of them were strongly prohibited by Spanish censorship . \u00a8Belle De Jour\u00a8 is packed with surreal moments , criticism , absurd situations , masochism ; furthermore Bu\u00f1uel satirizes and he carries out outright attacks to aristocracy , sadism and pro-sexual freedom . \u00a8Belle De Jour\" is a day lily in French, a flower that blooms only by day, as Severine is available only during the afternoons. \"Belle De Jour\" is also a sort of pun, as it reminds us of \"belle de nuit\", an euphemism for prostitute . Deneuve's finest most enigmatic acting . Catherine Deneuve's famous buckled shoes were designed by Roger Vivier and her glamorous gowns by Ives Saint Laurent . Pretty good support cast gives fine acting ; it is mostly formed by nice French actors such as Michel Piccoli as Henri Husson , Genevi\u00e8ve Page as Madame Anais , Pierre Cl\u00e9menti s Marcel , Fran\u00e7oise Fabian as Charlotte , Macha M\u00e9ril as Renee and special mention to Spanish Francisco Rabal who played various Bu\u00f1uel films such as Nazarin and Viridiana . In addition , Luis Bu\u00f1uel cameo : Sitting in the outdoor caf\u00e9 when the Duke gets off his carriage. Thid wry and disturbing motion picture was compellingly directed by Luis Bu\u00f1uel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Bu\u00f1uel's strange film belongs to his French second period ; in fact , it's plenty of known French actors . As Bu\u00f1uel subsequently emigrated from Mexico to France where filmed other excellent movies . After moving to Paris , at the beginning Bu\u00f1uel did a variety of film-related odd jobs , including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dal\u00ed, he made his first film , this 17-minute \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929), and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year , sponsored by wealthy art patrons, he made his first picture , the scabrous witty and violent \"Age of Gold\" (1930), which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes, themes that would preoccupy Bu\u00f1uel for the rest of his career . That career, though, seemed almost over by the mid-1930s, as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War , where he made \u00a8Las Hurdes\u00a8 , as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer \u00d3scar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in \u00a8Los Olvidados\u00a8 (1950), winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this new-found acclaim, Bu\u00f1uel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultra-low-budget films, few of which made much impact outside Spanish-speaking countries , though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming \"The Great Madcap\" , \u00a8The brute\u00a8, \"Wuthering Heights\", \u00a8El\u00a8 , \"The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz\" , \u00a8Robinson Crusoe\u00a8 , \u00a8Death in the garden\u00a8 and many others . And finally his French-Spanish period in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re with notorious as well as polemic films such as \u00a8Viridiana\u00a8 , Tristana\u00a8 , \u00a8The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" , this \u00a8Belle De Jou\u00a8 and his last picture , \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" . .",

(Naming names would clue viewers in to the twist ending, and largely give it away.) Belle de Jour, I believe, is another such movie, though it is apparently not regarded as such.***Spoilers Ahead***Severine (the Catherine Deneuve character) has daydreams about being mistreated and even sexually abused. The interspersing of these dream-sequences is Bunuel's way of warning us that what comes ahead may be real life, or may be all in Severine's head.With that in mind...the final two minutes of this movie need to be examined very carefully. Her husband is no longer crippled; indeed, he smiles and enjoys a glass of wine with her, and the impression is that there has been no rift at all between them. And she sees an empty horse-drawn carriage...a carriage that appeared in an earlier dream-sequence. What does it mean?I think it can only mean that Severine never actually went to work for Madame Anais. You will recall that she was about to knock on her door, that first day, lost her nerve, and went to sit on a bench in a park. It was at that point that her daydreams commenced; and from that day onward, she worked as a high-priced call girl only in her mind. Her daydream as \"Belle de Jour\" continued until it reached a kind of crisis point--the shooting of her husband--and this induced a kind of catharsis. One wants to think that she left her dreamworld for good, though this must be left to conjecture. ...if the above is correct, then Bunuel has pulled off a complete table-turning every bit as audacious as the celebrated twist endings of TUS (1995) and TSS (1999) (those recent films I mentioned above). More so, perhaps, since many people don't understand how the tenor of the entire film has changed even as the final credits are rolling....",

Is prostitution an act of women will or is it a social phenomenon caused by misery and poverty? One may say that Mesalina was a prostitute while she was the emperor's wife in the ancient Rome, right, but exceptions of all rules always exist. Normally a woman being wealthy and not satisfied with her husband will either look for divorce or for somebody else as a permanent lover, i.e. what we know as adultery. The latter is far to be prostitution as such. Bunuel here presents a film plot of an exception. The so-called Belle de Jour became a kind of a modern and discreet Mesalina, she often had in her mind nightmare of acts of violence her husband may impose over her body, pure mentality of masochism, and one day she decided to test herself. Logic in her behaviour is not seen, nor with the end of the film. Technically the film is OK, it has good colors and the acting of Catherine Deneuve, Genevi\u00e8ve Page and other actors may be considered acceptable in all cases.",

Fun to watch, truthfully; but art it ain't.Catherine Deneuve (age 24) plays a 24 year old wife whose husband is not only very good looking but he's got a wonderful personality and he loves his wife faithfully. Besides this, he's truly rich -- a multi-millionaire -- who provides her with everything she wants; EXCEPT.... Except having everything can be so boring (Note: True sympathy here. Being rich but without challenge, goals or purpose is an empty life). So Catherine will try to fulfill herself in a fantasy brothel which supposedly operates in an upscale Paris neighborhood. Nothing that happens there rings true, but I think it's especially false as a woman's fantasy. Women do not dream if the Ultimate Orgasm with a seriously overweight slob with a personality to match. But in the film's trademark scene, there's Catherine in the afterglow of a workout with this 300 pounder, orgasm fulfilled at last. Gosh!From there she gets one of these in-movies-only perverts that wants to play the house-servant brandishing a plume feather-duster and being bawled-out by his mistress. Double gosh! Where are all these rich guys that play these games? Mostly in the minds of really bad fiction writers. Does Bunuel even know that most girls in a brothel do not like dealing with freaks, at any price?One other big failure, as if the stupid writing isn't enough. Catherine Deneuve was described in 1967 as \"perhaps the most beautiful woman in history\". Too bad she does a semi-nude scene where we find that despite her stunning face her body is not beautiful at all.In 1967, the French were producing many very fine and artistic movies.

I do not wish to bash it, I just want you to become aware of a few things since you obviously share an enthusiasm in film. Hopefully you will be able to understand Luis Bu\u00f1uel a little better. First of all you wrote \"It's not a masterwork,\" but this film is a masterwork. Why else would Martin Scorsese present it? You talked about being puzzled by the films weaving in and out of dream sequences, and that perhaps David Lynch would be able to do a more masterful job. You have to understand that Bu\u00f1uel does this intentionally. He is a man who tries not to have a lot of logic in the story line of his movies. (Check out Phantom of Liberty) However there is a lot of symbolism that you missed in the film. It takes reading and maturity to find out what Bu\u00f1uel is all about. The film is unclear weather the ending is a reality or fantasy. Even Bu\u00f1uel himself said he did not know. If you wanted to make this film make sense it would kill what is great about it. Most people do not understand Bu\u00f1uel that will and criticize him for doing something spectacular outside of the logical Hollywood system which people are use to. You also wrote \"The film isn't very engaging visually.\" I have to disagree again. Look at the way Bu\u00f1uel shots only Catherine Deneueve's feet in one of the earlier scenes before she enters the brothel. This is genius. Without showing concern on her face or through dialogue for that matter, he shows us what she is feeling through the actions of her walking. He does this again later in the film. Also you have to look Catherine Deneueve's apartment in this film, a very bourgeoisie like style which Bu\u00f1uel likes to criticize. You can see how empty Catherine Deneueve's marriage to Marcel is. You really need to read up on Bu\u00f1uel before you can criticize him like this. I'm not meaning to be rude either. I had no idea what was going on when I first watched this film. You should watch his first film ever made Un chien andalou. He made the movie have no logical sense at all. Cheers,",

Catherine Deneuve stars as the delusional housewife of a wealthy surgeon whom she is unable to commit herself sexually. She has submissive fantasies such as being tied up or being plastered with mud. She eventually discovers a brothel where she embarks upon erotic sexual play with males of all class and race. She is reluctant yet curious. What is interesting is the world she now inhabits and the dangers that accompany it. Insightful directing by Luis Bunuel who previously directed Deneuve in Tristana. Deneuve is compelling as she descends into fantasy not realizing the dangers or consequences. Jean Sorel as her husband accepts her unwilling sexual nature yet becomes the victim of her double life. Genevieve Page plays the brothel head who makes the demands yet accepts her willingness to leave. Michael Piccoli plays a blackmailing friend of her husband's who introduced her to the brothel until having second thoughts. Pierre Clementi plays the obsessive young gangster who desires more than a kinky afternoon delight. Brilliantly crafted examination of brothels and the women who inhabit them. Score: 10 / 10",

She has no physical relationship with her husband, a wealthy young doctor in Paris, so eventually finds pleasure in working as a prostitute in the afternoons at a chic house downtown.There are several interpretations to Bu\u00f1uel's film.  I saw it as a commentary on modern bourgeois life.  Here we have an elegantly attractive woman who needs to be loved yet cannot show love herself.  She cannot break the bonds that define her life and surrender herself to emotion, so she seeks pleasure through anonymous sex.  Perhaps it's Bu\u00f1uel commentating on the estrangement of modern life, particularly our sexual mores.The ending has puzzled many, including myself.  There's a scene at the beginning of the film where Deneuve fantasizes about going on a carriage ride with her husband and being whipped and raped by his servants.  Perhaps the final scene of the carriage returning empty is Bu\u00f1uel's way of saying her fantasies have ended.  But was the experience at the brothel a dream too or is she satisfied now that her husband is paralyzed, the result of a jealous customer's rage?  Is she cured of her detachment or have circumstances simply resolved her emotional dilemma?Catherine Deneuve is one of the world's great beauties, and she is deliciously so in this film, but she also gives a terrific performance here. She hides her emotions and leaves several interpretations to her character which is what Bu\u00f1uel obviously wanted from her.  An excellent film from one of the greatest directors of cinema ever.",

            "content": "A hypnotic blend of fantasy and reality, Belle De Jour is the first film I've seen from Luis Bu\u00f1uel and it certainly won't be the last. The opening scene is a memorable one, as Severine and Pierre Serizy (Catherine Deneuve and Jean Sorel) ride in a carriage through the woods, before he drags her out, ties her to a tree and has the drivers whip and rape her. This shocking image turns out to be just a fantasy of Severine's, but it immediately lets the viewer know that there is a caged erotic mind locked away underneath the titular character's frigid exterior.The film uses these fantasies frequently, and it's in Bu\u00f1uel's approach to them that the film sets itself apart from the way others might use this meshing of truth and fiction. We are never given any warning signs that we are entering a dream state, there's never a blur or fade into them, he doesn't shoot them in a way unique from how he shoots her daily life, and thus Bu\u00f1uel catches the audience in this world between worlds. Deneuve, ever alluring and catching of the eyes, walks through her life as a woman in a trance, stuck between her lurid fantasies and her more traditional reality, and Bu\u00f1uel places the audience in this same spell.Severine is a mysterious character, one who dreams of being sexually humiliated and violated, yet for some reason she remains sterile within her own marriage, despite her husband's numerous efforts. Severine finds herself compelled by her sexual desires to enter employment at a local whorehouse, and in this world she is able to slowly reveal her inner nature. Belle De Jour is a character study in the most interesting sense, because it never aims to fully explore it's character. We are given the understanding of why she travels down the path she does, but the character ultimately remains an ambiguous mystery, both to the audience and perhaps to herself.It's plausible that even she doesn't know why she can't open herself physically to her husband, and her actions to explore her inner desires are a way not only for her to release her sexual frustration but also to try and understand what drives her. This approach to the character could have been cold and uninviting, shutting it's audience away from any level of interest, but with a team as skilled as Bu\u00f1uel and Deneuve it becomes a fascinating journey into the mind of Severine, always compelling in it's refusal to give the audience the easy answers.The narrative takes a more direct turn with the introduction of Marcel (Pierre Clementi), a client for Severine who becomes dangerously obsessed with her and is the complete counter of Pierre. The introduction of Marcel was both a blessing and a curse for me, because while it advanced the narrative and Severine's personal struggles, I found myself so entertained by him and his partner in crime Hyppolite (Francisco Rabal) that I wanted to see a film entirely dedicated to the two of them. Bu\u00f1uel's Belle De Jour plays out like a dream state all the way to it's chilling finale, and I wouldn't want it any other way.",

It now appears to be nothing more than a conventional sex melodrama, the kind French intellectuals were railing against in the French theatre as early as 1890. True, there are some unconventional turns, particularly the pedestrian \"dream sequences\" Bu\u00f1el inserted to amplify the fantasies bedeviling the would-be whore Severine (played by Catherine Deneuve). But the sequences are unimaginatively shot and sometimes the editing is clumsy; a good example is the well known mud slinging scene, as Severine imagines her husband and his friend splattering her with a kind of black goo. It's utterly unconvincing.The strength of the movie, if it has one, is Catherine Deneuve. She was (at age 24) approaching the pinnacle of her beauty in the film. The director was wise to choose an actress with her stunning looks, but he unfortunately could not convince her to degrade herself on camera. The degradation process is crucial for what is happening to the character of Severine. She remains prim and proper, as all manner of fetishists have their way with her; one can only speculate what an actress like Fanny Ardant or Isabelle Adjani could have done with this material. Both actresses were much too young in when the film was shot in 1967 to be considered for the part (Ardant was 18, and Adjani was a child), but subsequent performances by both actresses have revealed abilities that make the prospect intriguing.",

In most movies, it is clear when there are flashbacks, when there are dreams.  In Belle de Jour, it is often debated which scenes were Severine's dreams, and which are \"real.\"  When a scene is surreal, I like something, light and colors and aura, to indicate it is not an exact reproduction of reality.  Maybe the mud scene and whipping scene were dreams, but what about some of the other things?   There are no interesting characters in the film.  To me, not even Severine, except to look at.  But you do not really get to look at her, if you know what I mean?  OK, this was not the point of the movie.  It was to analyze a situation of a woman who becomes a prostitute because she has abuse fantasies but cannot enjoy sex with her husband; does she need to be abused to enjoy sex?  I have to admit, Catherine Deneuve is not my first choice of someone to see in that light, no insult to the particular other lady chosen.I do not mean there was bad acting, just no interesting characters. Severine's husband is blah.  The only livening is when someone is giving orders, someone is delivering abusive language, like Severine's client who wants complete control over her.  Nothing really happens in the movie, and there is nothing substantial in the relationships between Severine and other prostitutes, her clients, and her husband.As for the \"erotic\" scenes, we all have our fantasies.  But we get to see Catherine Deneuve only fully clothed, and abused.  If she is having mud thrown on her, can't we spare the foul name calling at her?  Or just have her mudwrestling and smiling?  At various times, she is whipped and slapped and ordered to have sex against her will.  I understand that there may be some intelligence at work in the film, but I question the entertainment value.  And if we must show this stuff, can't we have some development into something dramatically meaningful?I do not mean to totally pan this film.  I understand that the director was not necessarily trying to do things in terms of what I or others might be asking for, and it is not a worthless film, it brings out some thought.  But it is not entertaining to me, and I believe it falls short in a number of fairly objective ways.I also sometimes cannot help but wondering whether, had \"Belle de Jour\" been called \"Beauty of the Day\" and been made in Hollywood, it would be condemned rather than thought of as a classic, being French made.

'Belle de jour' may be his greatest masterpiece, although I personally do prefer the likes of 'L'age d'Or', 'Viridiana', and 'Simon of the Desert', I feel like 'Belle de jour' can certainly be considered the most genuinely high quality film in his prolific and more than impressive cinematic oeuvre. It contains many of the elements that make Bunuel such a beloved and brilliant artist; the humor is there, the tragedy/drama is there, the strange sexual content is there, and the classic sense of surrealism all his greatest films have utilized so wonderfully is perfected here. This is Bunuel at the top of his game, blurring the already-blurry lines between cinematic fantasy and cinematic reality, playing w/flashbacks and dream sequences and never keeping absurdity out of the question no matter the setting or situation. And sexuality is portrayed with as much confusion and wild surrealist hijinks as is necessary when attempting to explore such a mess of a topic. Few filmmakers (or artists, whether they be authors or painters or whatever, for that matter) can depict sexuality quite like Bunuel can. 'Belle de jour' harkens back to Bunuel's much earlier masterpiece, 'L'age d'Or', which depicted sex w/a raging sort of surrealist accuracy that struck something in people, turning them angrily against him and his work, making them set fires to some cinemas in which it played, banning his obscene and blasphemous black comedy of horrors, and 'Belle de jour' may strike a similar emotional reaction to those of a more archaic sensibility, and the same energy said archaic-types may muster up in response may be utilized by film lovers across the globe to tear their hearts out in gripping love and admiration for Bunuel and this fantastical film!",

In this regard, the film in ancestor to Stanley Kubrick's similarly misunderstood EYES WIDE SHUT, another erotic film that is less steamy exploration and more psychological study.Whether or not you find this compelling is up to you, but as someone who generally does not take to films that blur the line between fantasy and reality, I loved BELLE DE JOUR. Catherine Deneuve's Severine is a compelling, layered figure, a woman whose experiences are a result of past trauma and internalized shame. While the film is disturbing and deals with heavy subject matter, it is laced with a playful, dark sense of humor that keeps it from being downright depressing.

In this review I will treat first the fantasy aspect in general and then the fact that these fantasies are female sexual fantasies.To seperate her club life (living out her fantasies) from her normal life (reality) S\u00e9verine only works in the club from 2 - 5 PM. The question constantly is if this seperation is sustainable in the long run?Another interesting aspect with respect to the dichotomy between fantasy and reality is an old fashioned carriage that emerges frequently in the film. This carriage seems to symbolise the mode of transport to travel from reality to fantasy and vice versa. In this way this carriage is comparable with the old fasioned car escorted by two motorcycle cops in \"Orphee\" (1950, Jean Cocteau)The fantasies in \"Belle de jour\" are female sexual fantasies. With a male director there is however a slight suspicion in me that maybe the fantasies are indirect male fantasies (what a male thinks female sexual fantasies looks like) after all.Disrecarding this doubt a comparison with \"Eyes wide shut\" (1999, Stanley Kubrick) is interesting. \"Eyes wide shut\" is about male sexual fantasies, but the trigger are female sexual fantasies, the male being bewilderd that his wife has this kind of fantasies. As already said \"Belle de jour\" is about female sexual fanatsies, but (unlike \"Eyes wide shut\") the husband knows nothing about them. Given the sadomasochistic character of the fantasies and the good character of the husband, he would never be capable to satisfy them.At the end of the film we see the carriage I have talked about drive past empty.

Cinematographer Sacha Vierny ('The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover' (Greenaway, 1989) and 'Nuit et brouillard' (Resnais, 1955)) made it sober and effective (not quite like 'The Cook ... Lover').  If you like this style, go see 'Charme discret de la bourgeoisie' (Bunuel, 1972).I feel that Catherine Deneuve was not the greatest for this part, because she tends to continue her style from Repulsion (Polanski, 1965) in the wrong story.  Maybe that's one of the shock-effects Bunuel wanted to accomplish: the established ice-queen loses her cool.  But overall the cast succeeds in the presentation of members of some bourgeoisie who live and talk completely past each other and never achieve their goals, even better portrayed in 'Charme discret de la bourgeoisie'.  That must be the individualism in society that Bunuel despised.9/10",

Since i watch Lars Von Trier's \"Dancer in the dark\", i found that actress... how is her name... ah yes: Catherine Deneuve!!! Not only she is beautiful, she is a great actress. One day, i found in a videostore \"Belle de Jour\". I don't know if this time this films with such rich artistic combination going to like me. All the opposite. \"Belle de Jour\" is a ,asterpiece and a must see. Is an entertaining surrealistic drama with a sticky story and delightful characters.\"Belle de Jour\" told us the story of S\u00e9verine, a beautiful but reserved who keeps the distances with his husband. Sexually, she don't want to know much. But... well, she lately have been attracted for that topic, and decide to prove it in a brothel. She begins to discover the decadence in self. \"Belle de Jour\" is a must see because offers a touching story, with all the touch that only Bu\u00f1uel knows. The surprises are stupendous, Catherine Deneuve are unique (I think that is the best character of her) and the others are marvelous too (Pierre Cl\u00e9menti is perfect for that mysterious boy named Marcel)... the fact is, that \"Belle de Jour\", written by the same Bu\u00f1uel and Jean-Calude Carri\u00e8re (Who works too in \"La Voie Lactee\" and \"Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie\", is,as rare, an excellent surrealistic masterpiece where you can think and feel what you want. The characters, specially of Belle de Jour and Marcel, have a touch that make that we identify ourselves with them... i mean... there is no words to explain how wonderful is \"Belle de Jour\". So get it and see it... you going to be pleased.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",

Often, you never know you're watching a fantasy until it becomes more absurd and obvious. Other times, it's subtle and difficult to tell. This creates a special and unique rythmn to the scenes that sells the subjective perspective of the main character; we feel for the character and understand what she's thinking and why she makes the choices she does.Perhaps what makes this such a great film is the honest and truthful depiction of one character's relationship with herself and her sexual fantasies. These fantasies are suppressed and she feels like she can't honestly communicate these fantasies with her husband so the only way to live these fantasies out is by spending her afternoons as a prostitute. The film dares to ask personal and sexual questions while providing no answers. This feels enough considering I've never seen these questions truly explored by any classic or contemporary film. It's a brave and honest film that inspires one to become comfortable with their own sexuality and view it as something important to acknowledge and come to terms with. In cultures and societies where discussion of sex is so taboo, I found this film to be refreshing and emotionally moving.As far as the craftsmanship on display, I view the film virtually flawless. Performances are brilliant across the board, the film's well cut together, shot beautifully, and rendered with attention to detail and care for the subject matter. I would recommend this film to anyone who is willing to watch such a personal film and honestly acknowledge the value it has. It's compelling, deep, and beautifully done and there's a reason why it's considered one of the best erotic film of all time. Because it genuinely is.",

Marxist film-making (or film criticism!) is about as successful as Marxist government: it sounds so much better on paper than it plays out in reality.

'Belle de Jour' is the story of a young woman, victim of childhood abuse, who recently married cannot find satisfaction into her marriage and finds refuge and fulfillment of her masochistic fantasies in working as a prostitute. The moral ambiguity of the story may not look so new nowadays, but it stands well the passing of time because of the superb acting and the very reserved style applied by Bunuel in his story telling. The best parts of the film are the intermingling between reality and fantasy which place the egocentric fragility of the heroine in the context of her dreams and desires.

The quasi-Freudian exploration of the character of a woman who can only be sexually aroused and satisfied by being treated as trash doesn't exactly play in today's world, nor would it appear on Ms. Magazine's most admired list.Deneuve demands the screen and is fascinating to watch, and Bu\u00f1uel's direction, while not flashy or completely intelligible, is intriguing and focused. Bu\u00f1uel has done some great work including two I recall, \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" (1972) and \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" (1977). His early work goes back to the silent film era. My favorite Deneuve film is \"Mississippi Mermaid\" (1969) followed closely by \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" (1964). Deneuve is your high class, slightly cool beauty, somewhat in the manner of Grace Kelly. She looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth and so directors have always tried to sully her up. Bu\u00f1uel smears her both literally and figuratively here as a day-tripping prostitute addicted to debasement. I don't buy the psychology, but this sort of thing used to play well. I recall an Italian movie from the same period in which the hero couldn't perform with his sweet and beautiful wife, but had to go slumming to get it on. I think it was called \"Bell Antonio\" or something like that.",

            "content": "Catherine Deneuve plays S\u00e9verine Serizy, an obviously unsatisfied wife of a man who does not mistreat her as much as he simply doesn't seem to interest her enough sexually. She is in a financially comfortable but otherwise largely uninteresting relationship with him. There are a lot of strange aberrant fantasies that are placed periodically throughout the film, the meaning of which pertains to what is going on in the characters' lives at the times that they are presented. The movie starts off by showing a lengthy and rather disturbing example of one of these fantasies, in which S\u00e9verine is pulled from her carriage by the two drivers after her lukewarm response to her fianc\u00e9e's marriage proposal, and then tied to a tree and beaten and raped. A scene this strange and disturbing this early in the movie immediately presents her as an unsatisfied woman searching for fulfillment outside of her marriage. The fantasy at the beginning of the film quickly reveals itself to be S\u00e9verine's, who otherwise appears to be fairly normal and well-adjusted.\nS\u00e9verine is involved in a relationship with Pierre, for whom she has feelings but none of them have anything to do with pleasure, and she constantly seeks other fulfillment, at first in fantasies and then by working part time at a brothel. There is a colorful variety of characters that frequent the brothel and whom S\u00e9verine does not always enjoy working with (or for), but the exact activities that go on while she is at work are beside the larger point, which is that she is escaping the dreariness of a typical marriage and displaying some sort of sexual independence, which was a bad thing to do in Spain under the dictatorship of Franco (and, as was the case in El Bruto, also serves as the reason that this movie could not possibly have been made in Spain in 1967, given Franco's enormously oppressive censorship system). There are themes of dissatisfaction that run throughout the movie, even in small things like the fact that the champagne in the movie never seems to be cold enough, characters complaining that champagne is never that great if it's not cold enough, and things like this tie in with the dissatisfaction that is obviously prevalent in the marriage between S\u00e9verine and Pierre.\nOne of the things that ties in closest with some of Bunuel's earlier films is the theme of the dishonesty from the woman, which is complicated in Belle de Jour by the irony that is involved in her dishonesty. She leads of double life, maintaining her respectable composure in her relationship with Pierre but also working as a prostitute named Belle de Jour a few times a week, fulfilling an erotic need that is never explained or displayed any more than absolutely necessary. Pierre is completely oblivious to what is going on in her life until late in the film when one of her shabby clients, who has fallen in love with her, shoots him, confining him to a wheelchair and blinding him. It's strange that Pierre is struck blind only when the truth begins to come out. His vision has been destroyed by the very thing that was causing his blindness throughout his entire relationship with S\u00e9verine. Pierre develops the feeling that he is a burden to S\u00e9verine, his `pure' wife, and wants to have his life ended since he's paralyzed. He does not want to burden her anymore, until Mr. Husson, the man who discovered what S\u00e9verine had been doing, let him know what was going on (giving in to an understandable humane decision that it is simply not right to allow a man to torture himself over a woman who has herself led such a dishonest life in her relationship with him). (spoilers) At the end of the film, there is a fantasy which has been said to be possibly S\u00e9verine's and possibly Pierre's, but we are never told for sure which one, in which Pierre stands up out of his wheelchair, his sight restored, and they display a happy and healthy marriage. It seems to me that this is clearly a fantasy of S\u00e9verine's, which significantly suggests that, although it IS a fantasy and Pierre is still confined to a wheelchair, she no longer fantasizes about being beaten and raped and abused, and that she is ready to have a happy marriage and that Pierre is enough for her, despite being bound to a wheelchair. It seems to me that she has accepted herself as who she is and Pierre for who he is and, most importantly, his injury as a result of her own sexual digressions. A lifetime of loyalty is the LEAST she could give him.",

And then at this point, suddenly we are in a new environment Severine describes her husband laying on another bed that she's has had that dream again. And is oblivious to understand why. While her husband is a successful physician he takes her to a resort for the purpose of meeting some old acquaintances and it is during then she is told of a escort service nearby and for some odd reason she is somehow drawn to it. And she becomes an escort herself giving an alter ego name for herself \"Belle de Jour\" hence the title. And we find out later that as a result of her past when she may have been groomed as a young child may have lead her to be attracted to people who are aggressive towards her or toward men who force themselves on to her leading her to lead a double life.(Spoilers)Although, their are many different interpretations regarding the ending, the one that looked like to me is that her husband was 'actually' assaulted, to the extent of ending up in a wheelchair like a vegetable, but at this point as soon as she begins to sit down gazing, is when she begins to hallucinate, beginning with her husband Pierre suddenly standing up from his wheelchair before ripping the cast and neckbrace off gazes out of the balcony seeing the empty horse carriage.",

            "content": "\"Belle de jour\" is a novel-based co-production between France and Italy that result in this (mostly) French-language film from 1967. This means it has its 50th anniversary this year and thanks to that, several theaters here in Germany (Berlin) decided to being the film back to the big screen. First of all, I want to say that I love this decision. I wish they could bring back many old films again to theaters as I believe it is an entirely different experience to see that film at a theater than to see it at home. Unless you're a millionaire and have your own theater room in your mansion. But for everybody who doesn't, it is a unique opportunity and looking at how packed the theater today was, I am sure that many will agree and that the argument that people would not watch old films on the big screen again is simply incorrect.Now, lets take a look at this one here. Let me say first that I have not read the novel by Joseph Kessel before seeing this one. I also have not seen the film before today's viewing, it was a first time watch. And I guess I enjoyed it. The director and writer was Luis Bu\u00f1uel and he was already in his late 60s when he made this one, so you can certainly say that new ideas can come to life in old shells. Looking at how sexual and free-spirited the movie is, it is easy to say that Bu\u00f1uel was way ahead of his time back in the 1960s when people were still prudes, at least when it comes to sexuality in films. The lead actress is Catherine Deneuve and while I am usually definitely more into brunettes and dark-haired women, I cannot deny that she was pretty attractive in here. However, they also certainly knew how to put her in the right position, for example when we see her in an expensive coat and the two other prostitutes next to hear wear nothing but underwear, even if she was one of them.Now I mentioned prostitutes already: Yep this is a movie that takes place mostly inside a brother during its 100 minutes running time. It is about a woman who is not satisfied sexually by her very kind very charming man, but she needs what you may want to call a strong hand to tame her somehow. Or a special place where she can fulfill her sexual desires. Oh my, this sounds like 50 Shades of Grey doesn't it. Not intentional. Anyway, the brother is certainly pretty exclusive as wealthy businessmen and doctors join the girls as \"customers\" who want to explore their forbidden desires too (masochism e.g.). But the protagonist has more of an interest in a career criminal and not a small-time thug, but a brutal gangster actually. It becomes a relationship with deadly consequences in the end. One of the more interesting aspects of this film is certainly how the line between reality and the central character's fantasies gets more and more blurry and at the very end when we see the injured man suddenly get out of his wheelchair as if it was nothing, there is basically a complete mix-up. I also quite liked the last shot back to the sound and images of the carriage because this was where it all began with her fantasies.Finally, I want to say that the film needed a little while to really get me interested, but finally it was a fairly decent viewing I would say. It certainly gets better the longer it goes. I would not consider it an epic as many do today (I still read a description about a newer film recently where it is called a modern \"Belle de jour\"), but it's for sure among the better films of the 1960s. I know they showed some restored version, but boy did it look modern. But not in a bad way as it did not take away any of the film's charm I am sure. So yeah if you like Deneuved and still haven't seen it (which sounds like a really unlikely possibility because it is one of her trademark films, then you really need to see this one, preferably on a big screen. But even if you aren't a big Deneuve fan (neither am I), it is still worth checking out and be it only to show theaters that you want to see old films on the big screen because next up may be one of your very favorites. Go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

It gets a score of 7 because it was highly inventive, the acting was very good, and the film had an interesting twist at the end.

I still have no idea whether this was a fantasy or reality and it didn't fit into the story very well. I did like the one scene when she was working at the brothel and called the man \"sick\" because he was into whipping and submission--pretty much the SAME things she'd fantasized about herself!

Standing on the outside of film history, Bunuel never really considered himself a \"filmmaker\" but more of an artist who uses film as his means of expression. Most of his films were laden several layers deep with repeated narrative elements, incendiary attacks on social institutions, deeply personal musings and of course his trademark surrealism. Even today his films not only defy aspects of film form, but mock any notion of categorization. They're not films, they're defiant chuckles at the expense of the abyss.Belle de Jour is the rebel director's most popular film and by all outward appearances his most commercial. A rundown of the plot reads like an Adrian Lyne film; Severine (Deneuve) a young but emotionally vacant housewife spends her afternoons as a prostitute. Yet what's lost in such a description is the film's oozing sexuality and festering indignation of Catholicism and haute bourgeois living. Not a single frame of Belle de Jour is filled with nudity yet everything is given a sexual dimension from the quiet demurs of a housewife's diligent sewing to the firm coaxing of Severine's madam (Page).The film in its initial run was no doubt helped at the box office by the presence of Catherine Deneuve, whose performance in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964) and followup work in The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) have made her an international star. What brought her to Belle de Jour and Bunuel is a bit of a mystery but unlike some of Bunuel's leading ladies in other films, Deneuve is quite simply irreplaceable. She walks a razor-thin tightrope between dignity and depravity encompassing the troubling idiom \"angel in the kitchen, whore in the bedroom\" yet on her own terms. No doubt a lesser actress would fray to Bunuel's wearisome demands but with Deneuve it's hard to tell who's really controlling who. Keep in mind in several instances Severine fantasizes about being raped, beaten and whipped in dream sequences Deneuve had to perform. Anyone who can keep their dignity while being pelted with mud like that is certainly talented beyond most.Unlike the equally engaging Viridiana (1961) and The Exterminating Angel (1962), Belle de Jour is at once more collaborative and more personal. Personal because the film certainly indulges in naked and prurient interests of the director. Yet collaborative because he's found an actress willing to explore human perversion in a way that goes beyond sharp and blustering mockery. Bunuel and Deneuve would team up once more for Tristana (1970) becoming one of the only leading lady repeat collaborators (a list whose only other inclusion is Silvia Pinal). As a followup, Tristana is certainly angrier yet in its petulance feels less layered by comparison.Anyone intimidated by the expansive and critically irreproachable filmography of Luis Bunuel should seek Belle de Jour as an introduction. The film lies on the nexus between popular appeal, art-house, thinking-man's proclivities and the director's particular brand of madness. Furthermore, Catherine Deneuve is a game collaborator who at times steals the film to add some tasteful meta- text. Gloriously sexy, defiantly surreal and presented in luscious color for the first time in Bunuel's career, Belle de Jour is a must see for film fanatics.",

            "content": "How much of 'Belle De Jour (1967)' is a fantasy? Even its director, Luis Bu\u00f1el, doesn't know. The film's story is certainly a mix of the real and the imagined, but the lines that separate these elements are blurred to the point of near non-existence. Is the ending hopeful, or is it bleak? Since it's impossible to definitively tell, I suppose it can be considered both and neither at the same time. The picture tells the tale of a sexually repressed woman who often fantasises about 'unusual' sexual situations (most of which involve some sort of humiliation or non-consent) and seeks work in a brothel in order to experience these fantasies first hand. It's a tale of repression and liberation, of love and lust. Our lead isn't able to be intimate with her husband (perhaps due to some hinted-at-but-never-close-to-confirmed childhood trauma), yet she loves him deeply; she is able to be intimate with strangers, yet doesn't truly care for them. S\u00e9verine is set free by her sexual escapades, able to exorcise the demons that prevent her from getting close to her spouse. Though sex, she learns to appreciate love. It's an interesting narrative, for sure, and it's certainly ahead of its time. The protagonist is never judged for her seemingly strange - or, rather, socially unacceptable - sexual desires. She's treated with much more empathy than any of the men in her life, as are her co-workers and boss, which prevents the picture from feeling like a perverted male fantasy (though it is certainly told through a male perspective, due to its director's gender). It isn't exploitative in any real way (there isn't even all that much nudity and there's no on-screen sex). It's a mostly entertaining experience, even if its unwillingness to commit to one interpretation of its events can prevent it from being truly gripping at times (you're never quite sure if what's happening is real and, thus, will have genuine consequences outside of our protagonist's headspace). Still, the picture is about an internal journey much more than an external one. Though the character arc that S\u00e9verine undergoes is pretty subtle, it's unmistakably present. It can be a little slow in places, but this is typically an intriguing and enjoyable experience that tells a distinct story in an almost equally as distinct way. 7/10.",

She fantasizes about sexual clinches, but seems to know little about what makes a man tick. After hearing about another woman who took up prostitution as a way to earn some quick money, Deneuve becomes obsessed with a local whorehouse (actually, a rather quaint one, with a madame and only two other girls) and gradually learns to dispel her repulsion of intimacy. It's a highly enjoyable journey to take part in, and Deneuve is often amazing in her role (it's easily one of her finest performances). The film nimbly balances different moods and ironic passages with subtle flair, although in its latter stages a moralistic tone creeps into the story that I didn't much care for (the filmmakers seem to be saying, \"don't let this happen to you!\"). Still quite good, with a thoughtful climax and terrific work from the supporting players. *** from ****",

            "content": "Bunuel's controversial film starts provocatively as we enter into the mind of Catherine Deneuve, playing Severine, the pretty young wife of a comfortably well-off (they must be, they have maid-service!) Parisian doctor. We ascertain quickly that there is no intimacy in their marriage as she fantasises about being and tied up, beaten and then raped by two horsemen.Clearly something is missing in their marriage, highlighted further when a leery friend of her husband makes clear that he has carnal intentions towards her but she finds him a turn-off too, apart from one thing he mentions in passing which further sparks her imagination, the nearby location of a high-class brothel in town, where he presumably has been a client in the past. Instinctively, if against her own better judgement, Deneuve presents herself there to the madame, Genevieve Page, who, attracted by the young woman's looks, fashion sense and bearing, consents to her joining her other girls. Initially awkward around some of the weird and wonderful \"John's\" or should that be \"Jeans\" to whom she's allotted, she gradually finds her feet, so to speak and starts a regular afternoon residency, always returning home in time for her husband's tea.As her popularity amongst her clientele increases, we see her put to work in a bizarre necrophiliac ritual by a rich, titled older gent and then, more fatefully, with a young, gun-carrying hoodlum who initially treats her roughly but soon enough wants to keep her almost like a trophy. Things then finish explosively but in a final twist we're left doubting whether the frenzied ending is real or imagined.We're led to sympathise with Deneuve's condition especially when we're shown evidence that she was abused by an adult as a child. Still I was left confused by the ending and would have preferred Bunuel to come down on the side of the angels rather than hedging his bets by compromising the movie's climax.I do have issues however with Bunuel's character-focus here, it seems men with sexual problems go to prostitutes whereas like-minded women it seems have to become one, with no sign of a marriage counsellor around who might have talked her through her issues without her taking to the streets. It's noticeable too that the only actors shown in a state of nudity or undress are all female.Impossible not to admire the nerve, not to mention the skill of the film-making, right up to the perplexing finishing scene. Perhaps the dialogue is a bit overripe between Deneuve and her husband and her various clients, with the exception of the plain-speaking young hoodlum who becomes fatally attracted to her, but at least in acknowledging the secret fantasies of a female lead character, Bunuel was ahead of the feminist curve.I'm not sure in the final analysis if Bunuel got the balance exactly right in his treatment of the saint or whore depiction of Severine / Belle De Jour as played by Deneuve but of course I readily concede my contemporary view on the movie as being naturally revisionist. What's beyond doubt is the young lead actress's enigmatic and compelling performance in a part which must have been difficult for her to play.Interestingly, as a personal postscript, the last film in which I watched her was as the disappointed young girlfriend at the end of the wonderful \"The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg\" and in some ways the plot here could almost read as her follow-on story in an alternative universe.",

            "review_title": "Cinematically Erotic",
            "content": "\"Belle de Jour\" is a classic of cinematic eroticism, I believe, because it's all about the illusory power of the art form. Ellipses always brush past the actual sexual intercourse, and there's hardly any nudity, either, nor does the sadomasochism of it matter except as a reflection of filmmaking and voyeurism. It's the shared fantasy of it. The intrinsic voyeurism of watching characters get into trouble puts the spectator in the position of the sadist, while the actress, Catherine Deneuve, plays out the fantasy of the masochistic counterpart--prostitution as acting and vise versa. Her dreams as ideas, actualized by cinema as represented by her hooking--completing the combination of the two, imaginary and real. Notice how she scoffs at sharing our and the camera's perspective in one scene involving a peephole looking in on a scene of another courtesan playing the dominant role. No, her part is to be looked at and acted upon. Indeed, the happiest we see her is after an encounter with the Asian client, who frightens the other employees, and her satisfied look is only for the spectator, too, as her face is turned away from the maid when she makes a retort that could be interpreted another way without the facial expression.Otherwise, for the most part, Deneuve's performance is appropriately reserved. It's not by observing her expressions, which tend towards a glazed-over look in her eyes, that we mostly discover the depths of this character. For that, we go into her imagination. Reportedly, these fantasy sequences are original to the film and not included in the book it's based on, and the ambiguous ending here is different, too. These changes make all the difference, especially if one considers cinema to be primarily an art form of illusion, which a sometimes-surrealist like Luis Bu\u00f1uel surely did, for the most part. The dreams here aren't surrealism, though, and are quite straightforward beyond the conflation of the imaginary and the real (especially in the end and the episode with the Duke). \"Un Chein Andalou\" (1929) this isn't. And, that's fine; the sex is already strange enough as it is.Moreover, I'm uninterested in reading anything into the flashback during the repeated breaking of glass of the protagonist being molested as a child as determining her embrace for sadomasochism and prostitution or her sexual rebukes of her husband's advances. Note, however, that in her fantasies her husband is present as a bystander, like the spectator, and ordering the scene from afar, like a film director. A similar role is occupied by her madam at the brothel. Likewise, I don't care what this secret lust has to say as a commentary on the inhibitions of the bourgeoisie. What's fascinating is what it says about cinema; the intersection between performer and that of camera, director and spectator; the duality of its character (in the story, the double life of prostitute and housewife); and the blurred lines between realism and fantasy.This may also be Bu\u00f1uel's best-looking picture. His first film in color, in addition to the costume designs, a large part of the success here is due to cinematographer Sacha Vierny--an all-time great of the profession. Bu\u00f1uel's camera rarely lingers, except to demonstrate conflict with those shots of Deneuve's shoes, but the vibrant hues and lighting of space may still be appreciated here, surely in large part to Vierny. Three major talents (Bu\u00f1uel, Deneuve and Vierny) at play in a scenario that's reflexively about constructing cinematic illusion--of course, it's effective.",

Brief flashbacks hint at traumas in her past which may contribute to her struggles as an adult. In any case, she's turned on by the idea of servicing men for pay, which she does under the tutelage of Madame Anais, who runs a tasteful brothel in the city. Whether this little experiment of Severine's is a success or not is left ambiguous. Taken literally, the film suggests that Severine is liberated by being allowed to explore her sexuality with strangers and therefore becomes a better wife in the process. But Severine is an unreliable narrator, and in typical Bunuel style, the film blends fantasy with reality to the point where we don't know where one ends and the other begins. Is Severine drawn to prostitution as a way to take control over something that scares her? Or is she punishing herself in a way for things that have happened to her in the past, as is typical in many who have been sexually abused? Bunuel himself has said that he isn't really sure how his own movie ends, so how are we supposed to? But it doesn't matter. The point isn't the ending, but rather the psychic exploration of a woman who on the surface is dull as dishwater but who internally harbors a rich and complicated personality.Grade: A",

The surreal elements come into play with the way that the story is told: as a series of episodes that change from reality to fantasies to dreams and to memories. All these episodes are filmed in the same fashion, creating a blur that reflects the main character's mental state - she herself is unable to work out what is real and what it is not. There are clues to point out when she is dreaming though, with repeated dialogue and some situations that are similar to the reality. It is cleverly done and intriguing to watch, as one tries to put the puzzle together. In the end though, there are no straight answers as to what is what, which will irritate some viewers. Personally, I like to be able to come up with a definite answer at the end of any film, and here there is simply none. It it also contains a number of unresolved loose threads, such as what is in the buzzing box. Everything does not really fall into place too well by the end, but nevertheless the film leaves a lot to consider after it is over. The film definitely has some things to say about sexual antics - although this is basically all that it is about. If nothing else, it is a unique, very unusual film experience, complete with curious touches of comedy, drama and fantasy. Deneuve is great in the lead, and if not fully satisfying, the film is fascinating enough that the skill put into it can be appreciated either way.",

The thing is, is that I didn't know quite what I was responding to back then and although the film still has many puzzles, I do understand the main goings on rather better. It is clear from the outrageous and violent and abusive opening that we are in the realms of SM and as soon as the shocking opening, where our heroine is dragged from her carriage and beaten at the behest of her husband is revealed as her dream/fantasy, we know full well that it is she who is the leading player here. Indeed he is revealed to be far too caring and understanding (that is not understanding!) for her deeper needs and it is inevitable she will seek out alternative areas where she can enjoy her humiliations. Catherine Deneuve is sensational and does not make one false move in a very tricky role, Jean Sorel has a much less attractive role but does well and whilst it is regrettable that he has seems to know nothing of the urges within his wife, the madam in charge of the brothel susses her out in minutes, as she orders her back to her client.

Once you get past the pristine mist of designer products, enviably beautiful people, and inexplicable shine (Is it the money? The power? The final hour?), what's left? Someone who carefully dresses their life with opulent panache can never truly be happy; a few too many Benjamins cannot purchase a coherent existence. Look at all those 1950s housewives: while they might have a husband all the other ladies on the block swoon over, while they might have perfect kids, and while they might have the most picturesque house in the county, behind their cherry red lipstick and gleaming manicured nails is a hollow interior. Choose style over substance and you'll be left with a designated look, not a feeling. When Belle de Jour turned into an international success in 1967, Luis Bu\u00f1uel was nearing 70, an age where most directors should be retiring; but at 67, Bu\u00f1uel is at his most salient and his most stingingly observant. One might initially expect blatant erotica with a film so sexual at its core, but Belle de Jour is even sexier than all those immodest Emmanuelle moneymakers; it holds the power of suggestion like a little girl clinging to an antique China teapot after her grandmother tells her not to drop it. The film doesn't need, nor give into the urge, to set the screen on fire with slow-motion, sweaty, softly lit love scenes. As audience members, we expect too much; a screen can blur reality until it turns into a massive smudge. We've come to believe that if we're watching an action movie, we're going to see some witless but thrilling bloodshed; if we're watching a film deemed to be erotic, there better be some soft-core movement.But what if the usual frankness was taken away from us, and we had to use our insight to fill in the extensive blanks? No matter how disappointed our inner 13-year old selves become, not showing something that we want to see is much more affecting than pouring sexuality onto the screen like an unstoppable liquid. Yet when a film as pointed as Belle de Jour contains so much mystery and so much surrealism, it's difficult to be completely focused on whether Deneuve will show as much skin as we want her to (spoiler: she doesn't). Everything seems to have a double- meaning, an introspective question; our lingering arousals are put on hold in favor of trying to make sense of it all.There are a few times where S\u00e9verine exclaims that she could hardly live if she weren't also moonlighting as a prostitute, but there's something about how she says it that suggests otherwise. Is she doing it because she's dissatisfied, because she's disturbed, or is it something else? Personally, I think the authority involved is what turns her on. Her entire life, S\u00e9verine has mostly likely been looked at as an untouchable beauty that may as well be an object; people are afraid to approach her, scared that they might somehow morph her astonishing good looks. But as a lady of the day, men are no longer wary of her. She is giving her body to their depressing needs, and where most would feel materialized, she feels empowered. She doesn't have to be known as a surgeon's wife any longer; she is in control of the success of a romp, and being the focus of a man's humiliating passion puts her on a pedestal after acting as an ethereally attractive shadow for so long.By the end of the film, though, it's hard to tell what has been real and what has been fake. Throughout much of its course, the fantasies and the flashbacks are completely separate, and we think we know what is and what isn't reality. But the conclusion (which would be unfair to tarnish), is so unpredictably bizarre that it offsets everything. It suddenly becomes a film, open to anyone's interpretation. That's what has made Bu\u00f1uel's movies last so long; with their abstract themes, it's hard to truly understand what he's trying to say, but he gives us enough content to keep us intrigued long after we've seen them. Belle de Jour, as simple as it may seem at first, is knotted in its meaning, and the untangling process may take longer than a few days.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",

She effortlessly exudes class and refinement. Naturally, therefore, she would be an obvious choice to play a prostitute in Bu\u00f1uel's classic film of perverted fantasy and repressed desire.The film is so iconic because of the juxtaposition between Deneuve's placid, charming, bourgeois presence and the scenarios which she becomes directly involved in. Apart from involving scenes set in a brothel, these include Deneuve's character being whipped, tied up, smeared in mud, verbally insulted and generally enduring all manner of humiliations. Most of these scenes appear to be imagined from Deneuve's character's point of view, and the very fact that such a mind is proven to be capable of such deviance is part of what would have shocked and titillated audiences at the time.Bu\u00f1uel was a master of offending audiences having to leave his native Spain early on in his career due to the alleged indecency of his work. This film was clearly meant to delight and excite in equal measure and the film exudes a true sense of joy in subverting the apparent wholesomeness of Deneuve's outward persona. Belle de Jour shows us how what is on the surface is often artifice; through its exaggeration, we are given an extended glimpse into the rawness of human desire and fantasy.",

As a consequence of her sexually repressed life, she hires herself out as a courtesan to an exclusive bordello ultimately satisfying those very human impulses. The men that visit have all kinds of kinky fetishes and likewise demean her to the point of humiliation but strangely, it all aligns with the sordid fantasies she's been daydreaming about heretofore.What makes this film so charming in my estimation is the fact that it's so dated and therefore innocent. Any one of its escapades would be considered laughably mild or even puritanical by today's standards. Because this is the case, it offers some valuable insight on the psychology of sex and sexuality. Do some men and women have a need to be dominated sexually or even physically? How responsible for our actions can either of us be, if those appetites go unsated for longer than can be endured? This film shows you that, on both sides. It's a delicious French classic.",

Many people complained that the surreal and real parts are never defined by bunuel and we have to guess which is which. Exactly!!! Why do you need to know? can it be powerful and simplistic at the same time? One of the better qualities of the film is the confusion between sevrine's fantasies and reality. Aren't we confused by our own fantasies? aren't we all suppressing taboos and fetishes we judge as immoral without fully understanding them?I will misquote severine's description of the doctor who likes to be dominated. she says \"how can a person sink so low.\" She too like us, even though consciously realizes she has a problem, unconsciously doesn't realize \"how low she sank.\"The husband's character is so well shaped and drawn by bunuel. YES! YES!The images of the chariot on the never-ending road reminds me of Dali's paintings. A common surrealist theme about sexuality. The absence of a musical score adds to the artistry of the film rather than diminishing it. The acting, unlike what was stated in other reviews, is exeptional especially by catherine deneuve. I will dare to say maybe her best performance.A deep study of human's inner-self and the thin line between the image we project and the person we are.Again this film is A MUST SEE. Genius!",

Well, I didn't understand all of what was meant to be going on, and I was hoping for an 18 certificate film it would have a lot of sexual material that I thought it would. I can see reasons the critics gave it 5 stars, but it is not as good as bigger foreign films, e.g. Am\u00e9lie and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Anyway, as far as I remember (before dozing off), S\u00e9verine S\u00e9rizy (The Hunger's Catherine Deneuve) is happily married to handsome young surgeon, Pierre S\u00e9rizy (Jean Sorel), and for some reason she becomes a prostitute called Belle De Jour. That is pretty much it, all I can remember after that is her see-through silk dress, her naked back, and a couple of men stroking her, but nothing really much that I think people would be excited over. But like I said, I can see reasons for it being five stars, and why I guess it is essential viewing. It was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, and it was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Although I take responsibility, I was not knowledgeable of (or, apparently prepared for) 'surrealistic French directing'.

If you leave the room to refill your drink, you can ruin the film experience by missing an important 20 second scene with no dialog. Again, this film requires attention - especially if French is not your first language.Films about sexuality should contain great nudity of some sort. This film does not. I do not care for Luis Brunel's directing or writing style. Maybe Catherine Deneuve felt the same, because she should have given more to this role. She was mostly unemotional and stiff, and the character was written in an irrational way.I've seen this a few times now. The location shots in Paris and the French countryside are pretty cool.

Be that as it may, while she apparently cannot have sexual relations with her husband, she still has needs and she becomes a prostitute to fulfill them. At first she is very scared and tentative, but as she continues to work she gains more experience and becomes more confident and relaxed. Unfortunately, complications arise and things begin to get out of control. Now, rather than divulging how the story ends, I will just say that it is open to interpretation and let the viewer decide for himself. Additionally, while the subject and some of the scenes are somewhat risqu\u00e9, there isn't a great deal of nudity or sex actually in this film. That said, depending on your point of view, that could be good or it could be bad.

It still has some dreamlike sequences in it but overall its narrative, dialog and characters are easy to follow and understand, making this movie a perfectly accessible one for just about everybody. So really, don't let the name Luis Bu\u00f1uel scare you off, if you are afraid for some artsy fartsy type of stuff. Really hardly any of that present in this movie, though it still remains something unique and stylish to watch.The movie and its story is being an exploration of a woman's sexual fantasies. And it's not the romantic and cute kind of stuff. Things like bondage and other masochism pass through this movie, which all seems to be in big contrast with the cute looking and soft spoken Catherine Deneuve character. But that also makes it work out, I guess. It keeps things surprising and interesting because you basically never know what you can expect next from her and where the movie will be going with everything. Despite of its serious and heavy sounding subject, this actually remains a pretty fun movie to watch as well. This is all due to the unusual fantasies and the wishes of the customers the Catherine Deneuve character hooks up with, when she starts working as a part-time prostitute.The movie handles all of its themes very well and interesting, which gets you into the mind of the main character and understand her dilemmas and motivations. You don't ever condemn her, even though she is also committing adultery on her unknowing and somewhat too sweet and naive husband.It all got beautiful told and shot, thanks to Luis Bu\u00f1uel's directing approach, which had always been more visually orientated.A great and original movie to watch!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

For me, it is just enjoyable to see the minds at play of those of us in society that don't adhere to the standard prescribed sexual normalities of polite social expectations. Fantasies are mixed with memories, and realities of people who are going through a sexual awakening, the trauma, torment, indecision, admittance, pleasure and desire that follows such a journey.Sadly though the film failed to truly engage me, it wasn't as titillating as a Jesus Franco film, not as descriptive as Lars von Trier. It didn't delve into unanswered questions such as a Bernardo Bertolucci not did it have the drive of films such as Secretary or The Night Porter. The surrealist mixture of dreams, fantasies and reality, however, was pleasing.I found the interaction between Severine and Marcel to be the most interesting in the film. The gangster who desires the prostitute and deludes himself with the thought that she reciprocates any feelings towards him. It is a common theme with prostitution, both real or fictionalised, but the portrayal in this film gave gravitas to the notion, and while nothing new, was executed with perfection.",

It's a story of erotic fantasy told with Bunuel's unique surrealistic style. The film also presents a young Catherine Deneuve at her most striking.Ms. Deneuve's Severine plays the bored housewife to her doctor husband (Jean Sorrel). He is extremely patient and understanding of her coldness in the bedroom, and it's clear that she loves him, despite the lack of physical attraction. Soon enough, we are provided a glimpse of Severine's masochistic fantasies. It's not until later that we begin to understand what drives her imagination.Severine deflects the advances of an older family friend played by Michael Piccoli, who is so attracted by her purity, and unknowingly leads her into a world that might satisfy her in ways that her gentleman husband hasn't. When Severine meets Madam Anais (Genevieve Page), she begins playing out her fantasies through the afternoon shift at the brothel ... all while keeping up appearances for society.Bunuel provides us teases of the source through flashbacks and sound effects - a carriage harness bell and the periodic meows of a cat. It's never Bunuel's intent to answer all questions, and he certainly makes no moral judgment towards Severine. Instead we get an exploration of the variances in love, sex and fantasy.In the end, we aren't absolutely certain that we can distinguish between Severine's reality and her fantasy, but we do understand the importance of her fantasies within the structure of her day to day life. If watching Ms. Deneuve perform in this gem motivates you to see more, I would recommend Roman Polanski's Repulsion. Also, it should be noted that she still acts today.",

A woman is never quite sure, but knows when her husband is emotionally neglectful.She wanders the boutique shops of Paris, eventually wandering to Madame Anais' (Genevieve Page) brothel which is a small non-described building in the middle of the city.Initially, she is just curious and wanders in, asking about employment. Deneuve as Severine is beautiful here, her pale blonde hair, demure, and sensual.After awhile she is intrigued and Madame Anais makes up her alias \"belle du jour\", she works during the day, and encounters some very odd characters. One is an Asian businessman with a propensity for masochism, up to a motorcycle man with metal teeth, very strange.There are some interesting visuals with horse and carriage, bells, and a man with a death fetish.

S\u00e9verine initiates a double life, as a wife and then luxury prostitute, then going by the name of Belle de Jour.In this context a dichotomy it merges in the two worlds, the real and the fictitious one. An existing scope where S\u00e9verine shows herself without emotion, almost hieratic; the typical wife subjugated to a perfect life, a bourgeois life that hits her true essence, that annihilates her intimacy.The other world, the scope of the imagination, the one of its desires, collides with the external one, triggering the argument plot of the script where by flash backs we discovered the traumatic childhood of S\u00e9verine: raped and punished by the society, releasing in her feelings of guilt and the fantasies generated by her inner desire.In the meantime Bu\u00f1uel is playing with the plot, exposing a S\u00e9verine disturbed by the fault, and simultaneously hypnotized by the sensuality that manages to reach when becoming a prostitute, in a masochist woman, no longer subjugated by the society, if not, by the clients which frequent the brothel of Madame Anais, interpreted by Genevi\u00e8ve Page; S\u00e9verine is even allowed to be whipped, to be raped, to imagine what it is like to be fornicate by one of her husband's friends.Sequences full of symbolic objects, scenes full of dreams and a surrealism that is never lost in the work of Bu\u00f1uel, reveals a production packed of cold characters that is colorful non single as well, by its luminous interiors or the elegant and chic clothes created by the very same Yves Saint-Laurent for Catherine Deneuve and shoes by the legendary Roger Vivier, but by a clean and fascinating eroticism that anticipates the work of directors like David Lynch and Fran\u00e7ois Ozon.",

            "content": "Godard may have quipped that all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun, but Luis Bu\u00f1uel knew better: all you need to make a movie is a girl and her imagination. Picture this: opening credits beckon us in to a peaceful, aristocratic countryside carriage ride, with almost histrionically dull effete banter between suave, chirpy husband (Jean Sorel; exquisitely bland) and stony, disaffected wife (Catherine Deneuvre). But don't worry - the drolleries only last minutes before they're interrupted by a rape and bondage sequence orchestrated with carnivalesque bounciness, making it almost as disturbingly cheery as it is jarring. It's polarizing, distanciating, and risks losing any particularly prim viewers within the first five minutes. And, naturally, it's completely false. And thus, having successfully doubly(!) yanked the rug out from under us within roughly the first five minutes, the only thing we know to be real about Bu\u00f1uel's Belle de Jour is its commitment to falsehoods - and therein lies its playful, magnetic, fascination that lingers more than any voyeuristic titillation.Belle de Jour is still regarded, doubtlessly with a nervous chuckle in some circles, as one of the earliest films conflating eroticism and artistry. Yet it's shy even for the swinging' 60s in terms of depicting actual sex on screen - cleverly, Bu\u00f1uel realizes that for us, as for Deneuvre's bored-housewife-turned-high-class-prostitute S\u00e9verine, sex is best when left up to the imagination. But the film is anything but shy in its voracious, almost fidget-inducing satire of antiquated, monolithic gender roles, with S\u00e9verine's stagnant facade of happy upper-class home life being the film's most brazen illusion of all, and her escape into the equally constraining and prescriptive role of men's sexual fetish object in an attempt to actualize her lurid fantasies evoking a sour laugh in itself. Over time, Bu\u00f1uel's slow-born critique unearths a viciously tongue-in-cheek account of the dissonance between S\u00e9verine tentatively but aggressively trying to wrestle her own meaning out of a life full of people trying to dictate hers - her husband, society, their pretentiously aristocratic neighbours, especially Michel Piccoli's eloquently unrepentant horndog - with the results being as sordidly funny, and, inevitably, deeply sad as anyone would expect. Pacing is appropriately dreamy, verging the line of excessively languid, but Bu\u00f1uel packs each frame with tantalizingly subtle details of characterization and foreshadowing, keeping the fantasy/reality playfully hazy throughout. Some, like Roger Ebert, point to the subtlest of sound cues to differentiate the two, but it's just as possible these are as much of a red herring as any of the film's more prurient interchanges. Each of 'Belle de Jour''s colourful trysts allow for gleefully salacious scene-stealing bits, most memorably a teasing \"what's in the box?\" moment that Mr. Quentin Tarantino, amongst countless others, can thank Bu\u00f1uel for (and here, like its homage in Pulp Fiction, the answer is fiendishly simple: it's whatever you want it to be). Like any self-respecting French film from the '60s there are gangsters, as cartoonishly grotesque as they are impossibly slick, particularly Pierre Cl\u00e9menti's sulky, cane-wielding vampire. And then: that legendarily ambiguous ending, the film's most innocuously and and subtly perverse of all. Unless, of course, it's just another rug-yank, that Bu\u00f1uel, that scoundrel, never quite shows his hand with. Perhaps, it's simply macrocosmic of the earlier mystery box: it's whatever we want it (or most fear it) to be. Still, the film reaches the annals of legend almost singularly through Catherine Deneuvre's rivetingly inaccessible performance. It takes an actor of rare talent who can anchor a film of guiding an audience through every scene while remaining so impenetrably deadpan, but Deneuvre's cool, chic glassiness bleeds out just enough flints of a vast inner world of yearning and desire that even she may not be fully privy to. She barely speaks throughout the film, but her eyes and the smallest moments of relaxing her shoulders are more subtly revelatory than the most stentorian soliloquies, the delicate power therein making her work here truly unforgettable. Based on Joseph Kessel's novel, Bu\u00f1uel's Belle de Jour's play with sexual, ideological restriction and release is too sharp not to have inspired a number of real life accounts. Most vocal about her experiences is Brooke Magnati, who herself reappropriated the titular billing for a series of books based on her own call-girl experience as an upper- echelon prostitute while completing her PhD which, naturally, are themselves now being adapted into a film. Fantasy inspiring fantasy inspiring reality inspiring fantasy? Sounds about right.-9/10",

Belle de Jour has a very precise understanding of where to draw the line from fantasy to reality. It drifts in and out of these ideas frequently, yet has a steady tone and atmosphere that manages to travel to both sides with much finesse. Deneuve is always very aware of how far to take her character and isn't afraid to hold back and let the minimalism of the script speak for itself, making more a far more mysterious take on such a character. Most other features of this film complement each other well too; whether it's the music, landscapes, or lighting, they all blend together into a whole very well.",

Engaging in a variety of fetish acts and fantasies she begins to become more intimate with her husband but an underworld client (Pierre Clementi) becomes infatuated and threatens to fracture things.Director Luis Bunuel has a field day lurching the viewer between fantasy and reality with the ice queen beauty and presence of Deneuve as our guide through a luridly erotic, threatening and comic world of kink. There is a dire price to be paid but not before Bunuel has bombarded you with some classic surreal imagery to go along with his usual wry broadsides infused with dark comic irony of societal hypocrisy. The film's final twist confuses me somewhat regarding purpose but either way could work given Bunuel's parallel worlds and the subversive sense of humor seen throughout his illustrious and controversial career.",

The close up of the legs and feet rather than looking showing a close up of Deneuve's face expresses so much emotion, the feet turning back shows Severine's hesitation. The film is a critique of bourgeois society. How the character is sexually repressed. The mise en scene including the costume is startling. the cut to severine's apartment to show how decadent and oppressive it is, and the release she can get at Mdm Annais's. Bunuel does not like wasting time with his story telling, so when we are given address, the next show shows that very address, no wasted narrative on how the character got there. In working this way time and temporal cohesion often become confusing, however this only adds to the beauty of belle de Jour. It is a truly remarkable film with an ending open to interpretation. the audience is allowed in the the mind of severine, by seeing her fantasies, however, they never truly understand her. Severine is played brilliantly by Catherine Deneuve, whereas many actress work by trying to make the audience understand and become one with the character, Deneuve works through distance, you can never get too close to her character and her feelings towards characters and her character itself remains in some ways and enigma. Bunuel, in place of non diegetic music uses noises such as a cattle belle, slay bells, and cat's meows. severine seems to find all of these erotic, however, it is never explained why, and the continual reference to the cats, and what is inside a box (bunuel loves boxes) has remained unknown and has become a much discussed topic. however, simply, what people find erotic, they often cant understand themselves. this film explores many different ideas, it has Freudian symbolism, but is above it. Women are seen in a more sympathetic light than men. This film is brilliant and further reading and viewing of it is essential. Brilliant!!",

That's a masterpiece! I will make one remark, though, about the DVD version I am viewing in 2017 via rental: it is a Miramax edition curated by Martin Scorsese, so you would think this latest DVD incarnation is improved in all ways from the original 1967. But I regret to say the translation (i.e. the subtitles) from French to English is often inaccurate, if not downright misleading. Pardon my hauteur, but I am French-born and 100% bilingual, darnit. I wonder if that sloppy translation was actually deliberately \"softened\"(i.e as a form of censorship), because it often results in a \"softening\" of the situation seen on screen . One example: the necrophiliac character addresses his \"dear departed\" in the coffin as \"ma fille\"in French. It is translated as \"my girl\" in the DVD version. Yes, \"ma fille\" in French can be \"my girl\", but it is also far more frequently \"my daughter\". And here, it is far more likely \"my daughter\", considering Bunuel's social comment and intent in this film. If you view the scene I am referring to, you will know that whether this man calls this dead woman \"my girl\" or \" my daughter\" makes a great deal of difference in the meaning of the scene.",

            "content": "Luis Bunuel is a very common name that gets uttered and mentioned in film schools and cinematic discussions in critical circles all around the world even today. His brand of surrealistic filmmaking is not only unique, but it is also thought provoking. Most of his films put more importance on what the viewer might get out of the watching experience instead of the basic facts of the screenplay. Belle de Jour is probably his most well known film and its reputation as one of his best has persisted ever since its release.On the face of it Belle de Jour is a strange film about a married woman's love life, her marriage and her sexual desires. But Bunuel ornaments this potentially simple script with masterful dream sequences, subtle flashbacks and a surreal style of storytelling to make the film extremely rich thematically and quite complex. The film starts off with a scene that is both beautiful to look at and also extremely meaningful and gives a great opening to the character of S\u00e9verine. Bunuel throughout the film plays with the viewer by blurring the distinctions between dreams and actual occurrences. There are very subtle and beautifully placed flashback sequences that also shed a lot of light on S\u00e9verine's past and provides a possible reason behind her behaviour. The dream sequences are abstract and open to infinite analysis. As a matter of fact, the whole film is made in a way which leaves the door wide open for endless interpretations. a whole chunk of the screenplay can be interpreted to be dreams and a number of characters in the film can be interpreted to be S\u00e9verine's creations. I have my own interpretation, but one has to respect a filmmaker for respecting film for what it is which is a subjective art form. Many have suggested that the film is a commentary on feminism and feminist ideas. I don't really agree with that, but that just underlines why this film will lead to conversations. I think Belle de Jour is a character study on S\u00e9verine, whose traumatic past makes it impossible for her to accept sex as means of making love and getting close to your loved one, rather to her, sexuality is something that is only supposed to be used to quench your wild desires in the most clandestine and secretive way. The cinematography is beautiful with richly bright interior scenes and the dream sequences have a beautiful visual psychedelic quality about them. I watched the Criterion Blu Ray version and the film looks as good as ever. The camera moves in a very effortless and nonchalant way to perpetuate the surrealism of the script. Bunuel puts very little importance on the nitty-gritty details of the script and puts more effort on symbolism, metaphors and the contextual allegorical content. The film epitomises the artistic style of Bunuel and is a treat to watch.Last but by no means least, I have got to talk about Catherine Deneuve. She is flawless as S\u00e9verine. She expertly portrays all the traits essential to the character which are naivety, vulnerability, shyness, an implicit sex appeal,etc.The film ends on a very unforced, subtle yet beautiful little scene which I think makes for a happy ending for a film which is so not conventional.",

She's simply great as Severine/Belle de Jour, and Bu\u00f1uel is a genius. I thought it was impossible for me to watch this sixties' experiment, filmed the same year I was born, coincidentally. I read the book first back in the seventies, when I was maybe eight, nine years old, and I can't just begin to explain to you, oh good people, how reading that book had a certain effect on my erotic perception of the world in those faraway, bygone days, and I'm simply talking about my early and intense wanking pubescence activity. This film is so true to the original story and so well acted it hurts. The surrealistic management of time and places are all but a simple exercise in Belle de Jour, and that's when you understand what it means to be open-minded while you're watching a real piece of Seventh Art. Do not hesitate in watching and re-watching this movie, a production made back when art really meant something to film directors and to the public. Controversial as it is Nabokov/Kubric's Lolita, Belle de Jour contains some very un-PC scenes involving kids which would be banned, had they been filmed nowadays, because back in those days Political Correctness simply meant nothing and wasn't an impediment at all to the making of filmed art. I highly praise the moment I took away prejudices from my mind and decided to watch this movie for the first time after all these years. I was beautifully surprised and just couldn't stop watching till the end. And talking about the ending...., it has that special seal\u0085 you know, like when you turn to see if someone else, someone maybe sitting beside you and who may or may not explain to you what the director really meant, you not being convinced at all by the happy ending it seems to portray the first time you watch it. And this comment may contain a spoiler, but Severine/Belle de Jour is so nuts she takes you away with her craziness until the very end, making you to want to believe there's a happy ending and not just another one of the mind- tricks she performs in order to introduce some balance into her strange, unreal reality. This film is, by all means, a real 10-star one, and one that shouldn't let you undisturbed. Thumbs up for the French avant-garde represented in this movie, not one of Bu\u00f1uel's \"little movies\", as some pretend it is, but a postmodern classic in psychological drama. It has that dirty, corrupt air you get a taste of when dealing with songs like \"Lemon incest\", as recorded by Charlotte and Serge Gainsbourg. It is also the only movie I have watched in the last 20 years which doesn't make me feel like wanting to puke when hearing the noise of shotguns being fired, as, i.e., in shooting choreographies such as Western/Mafia/Star Wars- styled movies. If you're high on Western/Mafia/Star Wars movies, this may not be the ideal movie for you to watch. Again: a real 10-stars and a must- see, decidedly.",

            "content": "French language director Luis Bu\u00f1uel is a master at cinematic surrealism. After seeing his masterpiece Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie in film history class during college, I had been intrigued to seek out and see more from him. So, when the Sundance Channel recently aired Belle de jour I took the plunge. While at first glance it seems we have a straightforward narrative, it all soon unravels. The first glimpse of our main character, S\u00e9verine, occurs during a masochistic nightmare (or maybe welcome dream as we might later discern) where her husband betrays her on a coach ride through the woods. She awakens in bed, where we discover she has had dreams like this before. All this is in a linear stream until we soon get a lightning quick cut to a scene of a little girl being sexually advanced on by an older man. Could this be a memory of S\u00e9verine's childhood? or maybe just another puzzle piece leading us astray. Either way one thinks, he/she is in for a ride of reality and fantasy melding together, eventually becoming one and the same, where at the finish of the film no one will know what actually happened, if anything at all.Our lead is played magically by Catherine Deneuve who's striking in beauty as well as dramatic chops. Deneuve may be the most beautiful woman put to film that I have seen. She is not just a pretty face, however, as her angelic features are needed to juxtapose herself against the brothel lifestyle she soon enters. While cold to her husband physically, although we are shown signs she really does love him, she seems to open up completely during her escapades at the Madame's underground whorehouse. At first she shies away from the intimate contact, but soon is reveling in the embarrassment as she's dominated by her male suitors. The \"nightmares\" sprinkled throughout, then, could be pleasant dreams, as maybe she wants her husband to demean her and treat her as an object like those that she sees during the day. She superimposes the brutality on her husband in her thoughts because that is what she really desires.Along with Deneuve, we are treated with many great performances, including her husband's friend Hussan played by Michel Piccoli who plays the part with great duplicity. He is a man that S\u00e9verine despises yet her husband finds hilarious. An integral part of the film, Hussan could be construed as the conductor of the events at hand. He puts the idea of prostitution into S\u00e9verine's head and ultimately gets the ball rolling for what the movie's climax holds in store. Pierre Cl\u00e9menti also does a wonderful job as Marcel, a regular customer of \"Belle de jour\" and the complete manifestation of everything she wants her husband to be. His brutality and emotion form a great edge to his character as you never know what he will do next. Marcel is constantly on the fence of keeping himself in check or totally losing his mind.Belle de jour is a journey into the psyche of our main character. We see her fantasies, her nightmares, her thoughts, and the horrors that all hold in store for her. She lives dangerously close to disaster, but seems to enjoy the possibility that she will be caught or hurt. The excitement is what she is really after. There are many ways to interpret a film of this kind and all are probably correct. Bu\u00f1uel has created a template for thought and discussion. One leaves his films with a feeling of disorientation, much like that contained by his characters, yet also a desire to crack the code to the mystery. This is cinema at its best; an intelligent story that challenges the viewer and doesn't allow for the banal passivity that many movies churned out by Hollywood do today.",

She responds with frigidness and, usually, turn-downs to his physical overtures.Then she decides the thing to do is start working as a prostitute at a whorehouse. While he's away working to make the money to support her idle luxury, she flops down on a mattress to sell to a series of fat, sweaty strangers the sexual favors she usually won't share with hubby at home.For his sake, it's unfortunate she neglects to mention this. He also could stand to know the name of a good lawyer. With a friend like her, he won't need many enemies.We see she was molested as a child by some elderly pervert. As an adult she fantasizes about being tied up, whipped, raped, and having animal dung flung into her face until half her person is covered in it. And you wondered why they never show this at women's self-esteem conferences.We do tend to guess she has issues, a side of her sexuality she hasn't come to grips with. Her prostituting herself, we speculate, is some exploration of it.Director Luis Bunuel seems mostly interested in manipulating the characters like marionettes to reach his pre-planned political agenda, showing them as empty-headed bourgeoisie marching to certain doom.Doom comes, not to her but to him. He pays a vicious price for her duplicitous back-stabbing. Unable to face what she's wrought, she descends into a world of fantasy, dreaming of him as he was, conveniently forgetting how much it bored her.While I did care about the characters and was drawn in by the tragedy, it also seemed an all-too-easy excuse to make it all about some dark sexual matter. For all her exploring, Denevue doesn't seem to gain much insight. I didn't either, except that movies like this tend to draw attention.Bunuel seems to hold his characters and society in contempt, while also not suggesting any better alternatives. Sexuality is almost always depicted as something either perverse or for sale in half-hour increments. The one character who seems to feel it's healthy - Sorel - winds up an invalid in a wheelchair. This anti-human strain was off-putting.Bunuel's hatred of the middle class seems endless, and is uninterrupted by the fact that he is one himself. He even appears in a cameo, drinking coffee in a cafe. Better he'd been the waiter, so audiences could have sent this all back to the kitchen and ordered up a little less misanthropy, a little more care about the characters.",

By the end we're never quite sure just what has happened and are left with lingering doubts about the meaning of fidelity, love, and sexuality -- hot topics when the movie premiered in 1967.Several things stand out and make this movie a real treat. Foremost is Catherine Deneuve's extraordinary beauty. Whether in underwear or the incredibly stylish costumes by Yves Saint Laurent, she is ravishing. But just as enchanting are Genevieve Page as Madame Anais and all the actresses that haunt the picture with their suppressed loveliness. Judicious use of sound effects (there is no soundtrack - a mark of Bunuel) and color (supposedly this was Bunuel's first color film) give sensory clues to the narrative that still inspire debate.

Although Catherine Deneuve is magnificent in what many people consider to be her signature role, and the rest of the cast is more than competent for the requirements of their various characters, I think the primary reason for appreciating this film is its ambiguous stance on sexual ethics rather than actors striving to deliver pitch-perfect performances.",

            "content": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel, probably the king of surrealist films, opens Belle de Jour, his first color film, with a couple of lingering shots and minimal sound which makes me feel like I was thrown in a different world or staring at beautiful paintings - which rightly sets the mood for 100 minutes of pure surreal movie experience.On the film's technical aspects, there is no background music except for the all-important bird/bell sounds; and the cinematography & lighting are not as visually satisfying as other films i've seen. It's probably intentional on Bu\u00f1uel's part, I wouldn't know.. but it doesn't affect the quality of the film at all. The smooth/uninterrupted editing, I think is nicely done because the transition between Belle's fantasies & realities looks seamless which adds to the film's puzzling \"which is which\" reality. But the \"fantasy\" scenes, in my opinion, are just excellent in its simplicity, not too much garish artsy fartsy touch, but enough technical creativeness to give the audience a pure surreal treat. Not a bad choice for a Bu\u00f1uel virgin. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing his masterful manipulation of his surrealist techniques and his tasteful execution of \"sexual depravities\" without having to resort to showing any nudity or crass sex scenes. At the end of the film, it's interesting to note that in a way, this is like a mix of Inception, The Housemaid, and Mulholland Drive, but satisfyingly less complicated. It doesn't mean that it won't leave you scratching your head, as Bu\u00f1uel decides to keep this film open to your own interpretations. Catherine Deneuve IS Belle de Jour. I just love her in this one.",

            "content": "After seeing Roman Polanski's REPULSION and falling in love with it and it's star, I've begun my Catherine Deneuve kick. Many consider Belle De Jour her best film. While Repulsion suits my tastes far more, Belle De Jour was definitely a wonderful film of a different breed.I can't say I've seen too many French movies from the 60's - but from what I do know, I found the film to be very straightforward. There were abstract dream sequences from time to time which did a very good job rounding out the general feel of the movie, in contrast to the simple pace of the actual events.Deneuve looks stunning as always and gives her signature \"I'm so shy I barely show any facial expressions at all\" performance. Only in this film, you get to watch her transition from her normal shy self to a wilder, smilier creature which is unleashed once she secretly begins prostituting during the afternoons behind her well-rounded husband's back! So I guess the message is that some women just need to have a lot of promiscuous sex in order to really be happy??? There is a dirty almost punk-rock looking dude that comes into play about halfway through who undeniably resembles Cillian Murphy, only with a full set of gold teeth. I thought aside from Deneuve, he stood out as a very memorable character. He was problematic, violent, and unpredictable - reminded me of a lot of people I have known throughout my life.Solid movie. Interesting subject matter. Enough twists and unexpected situations to stay entertaining. The dream sequences are the strongest parts. Deneuve makes it completely worthwhile in the end. But see REPULSION first.",

            "content": "The sexual context in which this film was made is rather different from today, so concepts such as rooting Severine's fascination with prostitution with child abuse may seem a little outre to modern audiences. Nonetheless, it's a brilliant character study, with the originally reserved Severine transforming from distant and aloof to playful and coquettish as the film progresses. The dream sequences are interesting, and inserted into the narrative without ceremony. As a whole the film is thought provoking and open-ended, with Severine's character always remaining a source of fascination, mainly due to Deneuve's captivating screen presence. I also loved the grainy, high colour contrast film stock, which along with Deneuve's constant wardrobe changes saturate the film in 60's Parisian chic. There are plenty of obscure details such as the Chinaman's box, which are as bewildering as they are interesting. Macha Meril, here playing one of the other prostitutes at Mme Anais', is probably best known for playing the psychic murdered at the beginning of Dario Argento's 'Profondo Rosso' (1975), whereas Jean Sorel, Deneuve's Doctor/Husband also entered into the Italian horror/thriller genre in two films by Lucio Fulci ('Una sull'altra' 1969, and 'Una Lucertola con la Pelle di Donna', 1971), as well as 'The Sweet Body of Deborah' ('Dolce corpo di Deborah', Romolo Guerrieri, 1969,) and Umberto Lenzi's 'Paranoia' (also 1969).",
