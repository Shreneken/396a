            "review_title": "A great western which enables multiple interpretations",
            "content": "John Wayne is \"The Ringo Kid\" in this John Ford-directed parable of outcasts traveling towards various kinds of figurative and literal redemption/salvation. On a surface level, the basic plot is disarmingly simple--a motley crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg, trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on the way. They are having their own problems with the U.S. government and are thus likely to attack. The stagecoach bounces from outpost to outpost while the relationships of its passengers evolve, helping each other to \"find themselves\" and (usually) providing hope of some kind of new life.The Ringo Kid has been wrongly accused of a crime and is on his way to Lordsburg to avenge both the false accusations and more importantly, the murder of his father and brother. Dallas (Claire Trevor) is implied to be a prostitute, and so is ostracized from Tonto (which means \"stupid\", \"foolish\" or \"daft\" in Spanish) by a self-stylized matronly moral majority. Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is far more concerned with getting drunk than being a doctor, and is partially ostracizing himself from Tonto. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a \"gambler gentleman\" with a shady reputation and a false identity. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is trying to get to her husband, who is in the military; she's in a surprisingly \"secret\" physical state. Samuel Peacock, whom everyone keeps mistaking for a reverend, is in the alcohol business and just wants to get back east to get back to his business. Henry Gatewood is a crooked banker trying to flee before his questionable dealings are discovered. And the stagecoach drivers consist of a lovable buffoon, Buck (Andy Devine) and the most forthright, straight arrow of the bunch, Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft).Even though Stagecoach remains tightly focused on its wilderness road trip, that might seem like a large stable of characters to shape into a taut plot. Ford, working from script by Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht, based on a short story, \"Stage to Lordsburg\", by Ernest Haycox (which itself bears a relation to Guy de Maupassant's \"Boule de Suif\", 1880), keeps the proceedings in check by only giving us the information we need to explore the evolving relationships, and only focusing on each character when they're important to the plot. This results in a few of the characters being functionally absent for extended lengths of time, but Ford can so easily establish a \"deep\" character with a minimum of screen time that the absences are not a detriment.The principal focus, of course, is between Ringo and Dallas, as on a significant level, Stagecoach becomes a romance. They're initially brought together via their mutual ostracization, even among the ostracized, which gives them an immediate bond beyond their physical attraction towards one another. Wayne and Trevor are both fantastic in their roles, avoiding the occasional overacting by some other performers. But this is a film where it's difficult to count the slight overacting as a flaw, as it was more of a stylistic tendency of the genre during this period and it provides a nice counterbalance to Wayne and Trevor.Stagecoach is also famous for its setting. Much of the film was shot in Utah's Monument Valley, along authentic stagecoach \"roads\". The (beautiful) starkness of the desert is often taken as a symbolic trip through a kind of purgatory for the characters, where they're left alone with their souls, their only connection being their small group, to contemplate their pasts and futures. Whether we choose to read something along those lines into the film or not, Monument Valley is at least a captivating presence in the film, although for me, the cinematography could have been better technically, especially considering that Stagecoach was made at the same time as The Wizard of Oz (1939). Ford's famous tendency to do only one take results in a couple minor gaffes, such as the initial shot of John Wayne--a zoom into a close-up--that is out of focus for most of the zoom.As one could guess, eventually our passengers run into a band of Apaches, who are often interpreted as representing more of a \"natural force\" that our heroes must surmount. The climax features a fabulous extended chase/fight sequence with a number of amazing stunts by both humans and animals. The most impressive human stunts are performed by the legendary Yakima Canutt, including one that involved being dragged through the dirt by the horse-pulled stagecoach, which was moving along at about 40 miles per hour and supposedly missed running over Canutt by only 12 inches (30.5 cm). This scene was an inspiration for a similar stunt in Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Although it's not a \"perfect\" film to me, and it's not even my favorite western (I'm more partial to the classic spaghetti westerns, for example), Stagecoach is a very good film and was very influential, despite being made at a time when Ford was told that he was committing professional suicide by even contemplating a western. As the plethora of critical literature attests, it works on many levels, including as an allegorical microcosm of U.S. Depression-era society, and should be seen at least once by anyone serious about film literacy.",

            "content": "Saw this in the 90s on a vhs. Revisited it recently on a bluray. It is an awesome entertaining film with beautiful scenery n amazing action sequences. The long shots captured the landscapes well, the characters r all very memorable n the tension is maintained throughout, the action scenes were top notch, especially the stagecoach running in the middle of the vast wide open space n pursued by the Indians. Wayne shooting his guns from the top n he controlling the horses were amazing action sequences.\nThis movie did two great things. Wayne became a major movie star n western movies upgraded to A grade. It is also the first western shot in the beautiful Monument Valley.\nThe movie is about a group of passengers who r travelling in a stagecoach. The passengers are given the alarming news that Geronimo is on the warpath and that their lives are in danger but each of the passenges has their own reasons for taking the risk.\nWhen the Marshall is informed that an outlaw is present in the destination town, he joins the stagecoach which is filled with a driver whos got a unique voice, a prostitute who has just been forced out of the previous town, a drunken doctor, a pregnant woman, a gambler, a liquor salesman and a crooked banker.\nWayne gets a solid entrance after we have heard about him multiple times from other characters.\nRingo Kid (Wayne) joins the stagecoach cos his horse has gone lame. He has to surrender his gun to the Marshall n will be arrested once they reach the destined town but our Ringo kid has to settle score with a trio of outlaws who killed his father n brother.",

            "review_title": "Over the rise, it's the Duke, Winchester in hand",
            "content": "One of my favorite movie shots of all time comes in Stagecoach when the coach rounds a bend and you see a figure in the distance and has the camera zooms in closer you recognize it as John Wayne, saddle in one hand and winchester rifle in the other.Certainly the figure of John Wayne is familiar enough even to today's moviegoers as the man who put more people in theater seats than any other player. But back then in 1939 all he was known as was B picture cowboy who was a friend of John Ford, whom Ford happened to be giving a break to. He sure took advantage of it.Wayne heads an ensemble group of players who are journeying from Tonto to Lordsburg by stagecoach. It is a dramatization of the western novel by Ernest Haycox and John Ford brilliantly cast his film.Anyone of them could have been Oscar material, but one player did win an Oscar, Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone. 1939 was maybe the highpoint of Mitchell's career. Imagine being in three films nominated for Oscars, Stagecoach, Gone With the Wind, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He could have been nominated for any one of them.On top of the coach is driver Andy Devine and riding shotgun is Marshal George Bancroft. Devine is a befuddled dunce and a lot of reviewers usually pass him over in talking about the film. To be sure he is, but there is a scene where the stagecoach has to cross a deep stream. A pontoon like device is rigged, but it's professional teamster Andy Devine who drives the stage across with his team swimming it. He may be a dunce, but he's a professional at his job. I think it was Andy's moment to shine.Bancroft is a stern but kindly marshal. He and Mitchell are friends of Wayne who plays the Ringo Kid. Wayne's busted out the penitentiary to get the Plummer brothers who framed him. There's a reward for Wayne, but Marshal Bancroft ain't worried about the reward, he's concerned about Wayne getting killed, biting off more than he can chew. However Mitchell spends most of the journey cultivating mild mannered Donald Meek who's a whiskey salesman. A useful friend to have you like to imbibe. If ever a character actor was aptly named it certainly had to be Donald Meek.In 1939 you couldn't say that Claire Trevor was playing a prostitute named Dallas. But it's surely hinted at often enough. Claire Trevor was Hollywood's greatest portrayer of girls with easy virtue and a heart of gold which she has here. She got her Oscar in Key Largo again playing just such a role. The difference is she loves good guy John Wayne instead bad guy Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo.And to add to the mix we have an embezzling banker on the journey played by Berton Churchill who played many a sanctimonious hypocrite in his career. He gets news that the telegraph is down because of the Apaches on the warpath and in an act of impulse fills a satchel full of the bank's money and grabs the stagecoach at the last minute. He's also trying to escape a hatchet faced harridan of a wife. Nevertheless he's the least sympathetic and most useless character on the journey.A few months ago I saw and reviewed the film Carrie which was based on a Theodore Dreiser novel. The lead character in that, George Hurstwood is also an embezzler of his employer's money as he runs away to New York to get away from his harridan of a wife. But Hurstwood, same crime for the same reasons, is a sympathetic figure. Not our friend banker Gatewood as Churchill portrays him here. It some times depends on the writer's point of view.The last two passengers are John Carradine a mysterious gambler of Southern origins and the pregnant wife of an Army Captain played by stage actress Louise Platt. He also boards the stage at the last minute as he's crushing out big time over her. He becomes her protector during the journey.Of course Stagecoach is the first film that John Ford shot in Monument Valley and the long shots of the valley with the lonely stagecoach driving on to Lordsburg are breathtaking. And there's the Indian attack. The question is often asked why didn't the Indians just shoot the horses. The real answer is you wouldn't want to cut short abruptly one of the most spectacular chase scenes in film history. And then of course maybe the Indians wanted the live horses.Ford uses for the first time a spectacular gambit during the Indian attack. I won't say more, but think about the fact that he repeated the same shot in Fort Apache with the Indians chasing John Agar and the repair party there.What I like most about Stagecoach altogether is that it sticks to the first rule of movies, it moves. Even in the scenes of dialog inside the coach you get the feeling of movement. Nothing static about it, and the story could never be adequately done on a stage.It's what movie making is all about.",

            "review_title": "The classic film that started it all.",
            "content": "The Overland Stage Lines stagecoach is traveling from the frontier town of Tonto, Arizona to Lordsburg, New Mexico.  Geronimo, the Apache chief, has just jumped the reservation and starts an uprising.  Before leaving Tonto, the passengers are notified by the Calvary that they are now traveling at their own considerable risk but they will be escorted by the soldiers (here's a clue: don't believe it).  Among the passengers are a prostitute being thrown out of town by a group of women with their noses so stuck up in the air you could fly flags off of them.  She is joined by a drunken doctor, a gentlemen card shark, a meek whiskey salesman, a crooked banker, a pregnant woman on her way to meet her husband, and a young cowboy who just broke out of jail and out to revenge his family's murder.  The coach driver and his shotgun complete the group.  It's all based on a short story called appropriately Stage to Lordsburg but also on a French story (Guy de Maupassant's Boule de Suif) with similar characters traveling in a coach during the Franco-Prussian War.\nThe basic structure of the plot is also familiar to fans of disaster films. Passengers are introduced, board a common conveyance and face a tremendous danger.  The exciting adventure of who lives, who dies, will the stage make it to its destination, and what happens next is highlighted by perhaps the most famous stunts in film history by the most famous and respected stuntman of all Yakima Canutt.  If one of the stunts looks familiar, Steven Speilberg recreated it for his first Indiana Jones film.  The film is also a lot more.  Unlike other westerns up to its time which were mainly shoot-em-ups between the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black hats, it examines very serious social issues and how different people look down at others differently.  Besides prejudice, some of the characters are flawed with alcoholism, greed and revenge.  We also see the good in bad people with respect for new life and ultimately redemption. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor (won) and Best Score (won), Stagecoach was John Ford's first sound Western and elevated the genre in both critical praise and popularity.  The low camera angles in Monument Valley would become a John Ford trademark.  Despite doing 70 films, this is the one that made Wayne a star and it's easy to see why.  Many consider it his best performance; both subtle and clear he cares for the needs of the people around him and yearns for his own need for a home, a wife and a family.  It is considered one of the great films in cinemas greatest year, 1939.  Gone With the Wind, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Dark Victory, The Wizard of Oz, Of Mice and Men and Ninotchka were all nominated for best picture alongside Stagecoach that year.Regarding the political incorrectness of an Apache uprising, well, they happened.  If you just happened to be in a stagecoach in the middle of the southwest during an Apache uprising chances are you would be killed.  This story does not examine the reasons for the uprising only the effects on a group of travelers trying to travel through it.",

            "content": "\"Grand Hotel\"-styled Western that puts nine very different people together on the titled vehicle to go across some very dangerous Indian territory. There is convict John Wayne (in his star-making role), scorned prostitute Claire Trevor, drunken doctor Thomas Mitchell (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning role), slick gambler John Carradine, pregnant youngster Louise Platt, shady banker Berton Churchill, whiskey salesman Donald Meek, lawman George Bancroft and driver Andy Devine on this star-studded ride. Soon the characters are turned from would-be stereotypes to very complicated three-dimensional figures that are all deep and humanistic. \"Stagecoach\" does not only benefit from its actors and screenplay though as legendary director John Ford (Oscar-nominated) shows his ability to mix and mesh quiet, heartfelt moments with amazingly detailed action sequences that were way ahead of their time. A great picture from arguably the cinema's finest single year of films. 5 stars out of 5.",

All the other passengers have their own reasons for getting to the destination, including a vengeful outlaw, a prostitute, a drunken doctor and a cad.  However the journey is made incredibly hazardous by the fact that Geronimo is on the warpath in the area they must pass through.Although I miss seeing the desert landscape in full yellows and blues, this film is one of my favourite westerns and only suffers a little by being in black & while and not really enjoying the visual sweep that later Ford westerns had.  The plot is quite simple on one hand - a group battle Indians on their way to a town while some of the characters confront their own battles.  However this succeeds because it is more than just a B-movie shoot'em up, it has characters and sub plot.The characters may be quite broad and the film may well use them like a disaster movie (set them up just enough to care about and then see who gets knocked down) but it does have touches that improve it.  Characters are shunned due to their social status, `good' people are revealed to be not so good as they think themselves while `bad' people reveal themselves to have good hearts and the potential for redemption in their lives.  While it isn't earth shattering it is well crafted and well written in the context of the traditional western.Wayne is good and this film allowed him to step up from B-movie westerns to the type of films that made his career.  The rest of the cast are also good in their various roles, while the characters are broad they all play it well, especially Trevor, Devine, Mitchell and Carradine.Overall this is a solid western that has good action (include a great stunt that was lifted directly into Raiders of the Lost Ark) but also has characters and interactions which make for a polished and enjoyable movie.",

            "review_title": "An amazingly timeless Western",
            "content": "This is the breakout film that helped to propel John Wayne from a B-movie star to first-rate status. Up until 1939, he'd been relegated to series B-movies like the Three Mesquiteers or other rather generic hour-long movies. In this case, he heads an ensemble cast of dynamic supporting actors in one of the best Westerns of the era.Before I go any further, I should mention that I've seen this film several times but only this last time did I realize that this movie is actually a re-working of the old Chester Morris film, FIVE CAME BACK. In FIVE CAME BACK, the setting was a downed airliner in the jungle and in STAGECOACH the setting is a stage that is trying to avoid Apache Indians on the warpath in the old West. However, apart from this, the films are remarkably similar--with many of the same style characters--such as the \"fallen woman\" who in the end proves that she is \"true blue\", the embezzler, and all the rest of the characters are so similar that at times I mixed the movies up in my head.Both are superb films, but I have got to give the nod to STAGECOACH as the better of the two films due mostly to some amazing stunt and camera-work. The scene where they are being attacked by Indians on horseback is incredible--without the use of cheesy rear projection and top-notch stunts. In addition, the location shooting throughout made it a much prettier film, as FIVE CAME BACK had more the appearance of a stage production with lots of decorative plants--it wasn't bad, really, just not quite as realistic.Overall, I loved both films but insist you see STAGECOACH if you consider yourself to be a film lover. It is one of the top 5 or 10 Westerns made and is brimming with quality from start to the exciting finish.UPDATE: I had a chance to actually see this on the big screen last weekend. I enjoyed it immensely. However, I also saw another great Ford film that same weekend (\"How Green Was My Valley\") and realized that \"Stagecoach\" actually was more impressive when it came to cinematography. Inventive camera angles, the use of light and dark and impressive framing of the scenes give me an even greater appreciation for \"Stagecoach\" and because of that I am raising its score to 10. For a relatively low-budget western, it is awfully impressive and is without flaws.",

An American classic nevertheless with director John Ford bringing his valley in Arizona which he would later use with star John Wayne in The Searchers and She wore a Yellow Ribbon, among others for himself as director, to the film of the tale of a group of people all stuck together on a stagecoach. After reading the short story from which the film is based on, some of the characters made sense, but they are still very much casted perfectly. New star John Wayne is in one these kinds of iconic performances that only got as good as with the Searchers. Plus there is Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell as a drunken, but not stupid, doctor. Very memorable as character study and as a pure action Western as well. As far as the style goes, the long-touted rumor that Orson Welles watched this film 40 times before directing Citizen Kane only makes the experience more enjoyable.",

It's easy to see while watching his performance how this film made him a star. As great as Wayne is in this film, he doesn't overshadow any of his fellow performers. Thomas Mitchell plays the drunken doctor thrown out of town, a performance that earned him an Academy Award. Andy Devine is hilarious as the complaining, squeaky voiced stagecoach driver. John Carradine is sleek and snake-like as the gambler. Claire Trevor gives a heartbreaking turn as the good-hearted whore thrown out of town by pious hypocrites. Donald Meek plays his name, a meek whiskey salesman befriended by the whiskey-loving Doc. Each actor quickly and deftly sketches his character so vividly that every performance is memorable.But the real star of the show is John Ford, the director. To introduce and define nine characters in the context of a fast-paced western is no easy task, and he accomplishes it in masterly fashion. Much of the action takes place in the limited confines of a stagecoach, but Ford takes advantage of the limits by staging brilliant and subtle bits between characters; John Wayne casts sultry glances at Clare Trevor, who blossoms under his glance, the young calvary wife's eyes glaze over as the banker pontificates, and Doc sneaks sips of whiskey from the samples case while he solicitously keeps the wind from chilling the whiskey salesman. When the action moves outside, he films the action in dynamic angles and stunts that were the most daring of its time.If you enjoy westerns and haven't seen this, you have a great night of film-watching ahead of you. And if the last time you saw Stagecoach was some midnight years ago when you wandered home for a bit of the late show before bedtime, watch it again and rediscover what a great western it is",

            "content": "For some reason, 1939 has been proclaimed  \"Hollywood's greatest year\".  I doubt that, but the year IS important if only because John Ford released his mythic  *Stagecoach*  in the midst of the surrounding Technicolor sap 'n' pap  (*Gone With the Wind*, *Wizard of Oz*, etc.).  In fact, *Stagecoach* firmly gets my vote for the best Western John Ford ever made.  Unlike the current critics'  darling, *The Searchers*, this movie doesn't depend solely on John Wayne to save it from self-parody and/or pretension.  In 1939, Monument Valley wasn't a cliche, yet.  (As it was by 1956, when  *The Searchers*  came out.)  The whore-with-the-heart-of-gold, the Southern-gentleman-who-is-handy-with-a-gun, the overeducated-drunk-who-can-be-counted-on-in-a-pinch, and naturally the honorable-gunslinger weren't cinematic cliches yet, either.  For that matter, John Wayne wasn't a cliche, yet.  Therefore, if you can forget the 6 or 7 decades of baggage that trailed after this movie, baggage that has turned up not just in Westerns but in other genres such as film noir and romantic comedies and  \"disaster epics\", then the freshness of *Stagecoach*  becomes readily apparent.Oddly enough, the movie seems at first to be a cowboy spoof of  *Grand Hotel*  in the manner in which it throws together its 7 archetypal characters into the stagecoach for the long journey to Lordsburg.  But soon enough Ford creates his own archetypes, like John Wayne emerging from the desert, alone, carrying his saddle like some epic hero.  And there's the magnificent setting itself, empty and unforgiving and beautiful. Unfortunately, Ford would come to rely on Monument Valley to convey \"significance\", but here it seems at once incidental and yet integral to the plot.  *Stagecoach*  ultimately comes to feel like the birthing of our great mythos, both of our understanding of our nation's expansion and of the importance of our 20th-century entertainers.  Even the characters'  names have been burned into our consciousness  (Ringo Kid, Stella Dallas, Doc Boone).  And this is the movie that made John Wayne the indispensable American hero, a role he easily carried for 4 decades.Above and beyond all this, the movie also features one of the all-time great chases in cinema:  the breakneck race across the salt-flats, with Wayne expertly wielding his shotgun, keeping Geronimo's hordes from getting too close.  Watch for some death-defying stunt-work as Wayne's character leaps from harness-to-harness along the team-of-eight . . . then consider how cheaply it would be done today, with computer imaging and choppy editing. Ford delivered action the old-fashioned way:  he made his stunt-players EARN it, keeping an unblinking camera on them the whole way.  Superb.",

            "content": "`Stagecoach' isn't so much a traditional Western as it is a forefather to the modern disaster film (with Apache warriors being the `disaster').  In many ways, the film is closer in style to `The Towering Inferno' than to `True Grit', but it's undeniably a great film, one of John Wayne's best. It's a simple story, really -- eight strangers, each with their own secrets and emotional baggage, are passengers on an Arizona stagecoach going from the town of Tonto to the city of Lordsburg, despite the looming threat of imminent Apache attacks.  Along the way, the stagecoach comes across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), who's just broken out of prison -- he's looking to go to Lordsburg as well, to avenge the death of his kid brother.  He joins the passengers to Lordsburg, and during the journey, in one way or another, most of the passengers wind up learning something about themselves -- and wind up fighting Indians as well.Hokey?  Not really -- the story's quite good, and for the most part, the acting's wonderful.  John Wayne's great as the Ringo Kid -- this actually may be one of his best Western roles.  The Ringo Kid is a murderer, looking to avenge his family, but he's also a fairly principled man.  The role's a lot deeper and more complex than some of Wayne's later `white hat' heroes who were always perfectly good and flawless.  The Ringo Kid wants a normal life, but at the same time knows he'll probably never have one, and John Wayne pulls off this internal conflict flawlessly.  Wayne also has great chemistry with the wonderful Claire Trevor, who plays Dallas, the former lady-of-the-evening -- she's also seeking to create a new life, and the uncomfortable, almost shy way she reacts to Wayne's gentle, genuinely polite comments is terrific to watch.  Like the Ringo Kid -- indeed, like most of the characters in `Stagecoach' -- Dallas wants to change her life around, but doubts that she can.  The other characters in `Stagecoach' are excellent as well, but it's Claire Trevor and John Wayne who really make the film enjoyable.  (Side note -- while he's quite good, I was shocked to read that John Mitchell actually won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dr. Josiah Boone in this film.  His character's essentially a cross between W.C. Fields and Yoda, and while I'm not sure who else was in contention for the Best Supporting Actor award with Mr. Mitchell, I find it hard to believe that this was, in fact, the best supporting performance captured on film in the year 1939.)John Ford's direction is excellent as well.  `Stagecoach' is the first film where Mr. Ford used the breathtaking landscapes of Monument Valley, and even in black-and-white, they're still used to vivid effect.  His action shots of an Apache attack and war raid are also stunning, even by today's standards. Ford also has great touch with changing moods in `Stagecoach' -- the film moves effortlessly from light comedy to tear-jerking drama, and the changes of mood never seem contrived. `Stagecoach' is clearly one of John Ford's better films.  Does `Stagecoach' have problems?  Yes, but most of them are more a by-product of the customs and conventions of filmmaking in the 1930s.  For example, the music is often obtrusive, and doesn't always fit with what's actually happening in a given scene.  There's also not a lot of time spent exploring the character's backgrounds -- it would've been nice to know lot more about where the characters had come from (particularly Dallas), if only to help understand each character's motivations.  Since this can be said about most films made during this era, it' somewhat forgivable.  However, one significant flaw of `Stagecoach' itself is the character of Hatfield (John Carradine) -- while Mr. Carradine does a good job with the part, the character constantly contradicts himself.  He behaves one way in one scene, then in a completely different manner in the next, and there's never a reason given for this.  Add to this that Hatfield adds next to nothing in the film (his only useful purpose, apparently, is to ask Mrs. Platt (Lucy Mallory) `Are you all right?' every thirty seconds), and he becomes totally superfluous.  If the part of Hatfield had been excised entirely from the script, \"Stagecoach\" would have been much better. `Stagecoach' is not a typical Western (there's a lot more character introspection going on than blazing six-shooters), but it's an extremely entertaining film nonetheless.  The memorable interaction between John Wayne and Claire Trevor alone makes it a near-classic.  Grade: A-",

The plot is simplicity itself and involves a stagecoach riding through Apache territory.

Stagecoach is no exception, in fact it is a brilliant film not just as a western but of any genre really. Everything about it is wonderful, and I can see why Orson Welles watched this apparently 40 times preparing for Citizen Kane. The cinematography is gorgeous, and as always the Monument Valley locations are magnificent. The music is very well done too, and the story while simple always grips. The script is clever and well written and all the characters are credible. On top of that the big chase sequence for me has to be one of the finest action set pieces for any film. The special thing about these characters are that by the end of the film they aren't as they are initially seen to be. John Ford's direction is superb, and the acting is excellent, not just from John Wayne who gives one of his better performances here but also from the likes of John Carradine. Thomas Mitchell though is the one that steals the show. Overall, a fine film and a benchmark in the western genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "John Wayne's first appearance on screen in \"Stagecoach\" is one of the great character introductions in film. It's as if he took the energy from all those Republic, Lone Star and Monogram Westerns and compacted them into one grand entrance that subliminally announced 'here's a brand new Hollywood star'. John Ford's trust in his actor friend forged a new chapter in American movie-making, and with it, the birth of the modern Western.I was surprised by the amount of humor in the story without a traditional comic relief character. For sure, you had Andy Devine in a characteristic role, but other individuals took their turn as well, notably Thomas Mitchell in his Oscar winning turn as Doc Boone, and Donald Meek as the subdued alcohol salesman. Can you picture him as the father of five kids in the story? The best concept though was the 'Ladies of the Law and Order League'; who came up with that one? For all the times he's mentioned by name, the one character who never winds up being a part of the action is the 'Apache butcher' Geronimo. Checking even the secondary uncredited cast, one can find no mention of an on screen appearance by the Chief.One of the impressive things about the story is the way virtually all of the stagecoach characters start out as caricatures, and wind up evolving into three dimensional people you wind up either caring about, or disliking enough to want to see them get what's coming to them. They wind up feeling the same way about each other too, perhaps the relationship between Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) and Dallas (Claire Trevor) to be the most transforming on a personal level.Hey, did the Plummer's ever have a chance once the Ringo Kid hit town? Luke draws an aces and eights hand and a black cat crosses the path of the brothers as they take to the streets of Lordsburg. Wisely, the saloon owner took down the mirror over the bar, or there might have been seven years bad luck on top of the shootout.If I had to come up with a single odds defying moment that didn't work for me, it would have to be the ballistics (is that the right word?) of the arrow that struck Peacock at the start of the Apache attack. It might have been possible if it had gone through the Doc's head first. On top of that, the booze salesman survived! In fact, everyone on the stage survived, putting to shame the law of averages in a situation like that.One thing remained certain for John Wayne, after dozens of Westerns, no matter what the situation, he winds up getting the girl. Unlike his many Lone Star films though, he actually had to work at it a bit, and vice versa for co-star Trevor. But at least it was neat the way Marshal Curly (George Bancroft) and the Doc gave Ringo and Dallas their send off, and it only cost the sheriff one drink!",

            "content": "If John Ford's Stagecoach is clich\u00e9d today, it is merely because it set the standard for `A' Westerns in 1939. That many of Stagecoach's attributes eventually became clich\u00e9 simply speaks for the importance and the elegant simplicity of the film.I had intended to see Stagecoach for years. This, in fact, was one of the few times I actually read several IMDb reviews of the movie before seeing it. Ford's classic definitely met or surpassed all of my expectations. I came away with a strangely fulfilled feeling after watching it. Much of the plot, shooting style and other devises were so familiar to me (from later duplication if not outright plagiarism) that one corner of my brain occasionally complained `This is a tad corny.' Yet the bulk of my brain came away immensely satisfied-as if I had just enjoyed a favorite desert, alamode. My best explanation for this is that Ford's film simply WORKS. It worked in 1939 and it does in 2003. That, of course, is why so many other Westerns and other movies borrowed so heavily from it. It set a standard that held sway for more than a quarter of a century.What is so good about Stagecoach? Plenty. Ford combines just enough action with strong character development, solid dialogue and outstanding cinematography, to piece together a very satisfying 96 minutes of entertainment.  Those unable to comprehend that a film made in 1939 and set (by my best estimation) in 1880 is not going to be played out in 1999 politically-correct sensitivity, naturally cry long and hard-as they do with nearly all pre-1990 films. Other than `Get a life,' I have no real comment to direct at this group. To those others, who fail to see anything above the ordinary here, I suggest an additional viewing. It may not be Hollywood's best film of the 1930s-or even the legendary year of 1939 for that matter, but it is a true Hollywood classic.SPOILERS AHEADSet in the Arizona Territory, probably in 1880, (The Longstar newspaper editor noted that the Republican National Convention was in Chicago at that time, making it 1868, 1880, 1884 or 1888. Considering the apparent age of the Civil War veterans and Geronimo's activities, 1880 would be my best guess.) the film has a simple, linear plot. A private stagecoach tries to make it from Tonto to Lordsburg, despite the ominous threat of the legendary Geronimo going on the warpath. Soldiers are promised as an escort, but are later reassigned, when more pressing dangers arise. The stage forges ahead, unprotected, and eventually faces the Indian attack everyone has feared. Inside the coach, nine individuals are gelling into a somewhat cohesive mini-community. As some posters have noted, Ford was good at building characters that were deeply developed, yet still managed to represent an entire class or group of people.The ensemble cast is outstanding, with John Wayne bursting on the scene with a strong and likeable performance as the Ringo Kid. Claire Trevor, Oscar-winning Thomas Mitchell, David Caradine, George Meek, Burton Churchill and Louis Platt, along with Andy Devine and George Bancroft are believable and for the most part likeable.Without rehashing every aspect of the plot, I will comment on the Caradine character, which has bothered and/or stumped some viewers. Hatfield, at first called `a notorious gambler' and `certainly no gentleman,' certainly perceives himself to be an old style southern gentleman. He seems to prove that he really is-at least when he is in the inspiring presence of a real southern belle like Lucy Mallory (Platt). Of course Hatfield turns out not to be the lecherous wolf we assume he is. Rather, he is a loyal ex-Confederate solider who fought under Mrs. Mallory's father. Apparently recognizing the now-grown Lucy, he decides she needs protection on the voyage. I personally do not find this sudden show of loyalty/chivalry out of character-despite Hatfield's recent activities.The most fascinating and riveting scene for me-and one I have seen no other reviewer accurately pontificate upon-is the climactic moment in the Indian fight when the ammunition supply has been exhausted. We have sensed that the `good guys' have a slight chance of surviving, thanks to the good shooting of Wayne, Caradine, Bancroft and even Mitchell. Now, however, the ammo is gone and only a fraction of the attackers have been dealt with. Hatfield finds one lone bullet in his chamber. Apparently envisioning likely rape and torture for Mrs. Mallory-as well as her possibly being forced to witness her baby's murder, he faces a titanic moral dilemma and then puts his gun to the head of the praying woman. Before he can perform this apparent `mercy killing,' though, an Indian bullet hits HIM. Moments later, Mrs. Mallory closes her prayer and seems to be deliriously imagining a bugle call. Of course it isn't her imagination and the first of the ever-present just-in-the-nick-of-time U.S. Cavalry charges of Western fare quickly saves the day.Other than Hatfield apparently dying, everything is wrapped up smoothly and happily. (One hopes SOMEone takes poor Mr. Peacock up on his invitations to visit his wife and himself in Kansas City, KS. Since no one can seem to remember his name correctly, however, this seems unlikely!) Of course Ringo and Dallas ride off into the panoramic Ford sunset, `safe from the blessings of civilization' and wise enough not to let social stigmas hinder their love for each other. For Ford, Wayne and the modern Western, of course, the end was really the beginning.",

            "content": "Stagecoach is widely credited as the film that brought the western back in as a serious genre, after years of being relegated to b-picture status during the talkie era. For me, what really stands out about this picture is that it really takes the west seriously as a setting. What I mean is, whereas most westerns of the time simply trot out a load of genre conventions \u0096 the cattle drive, the saloon brawl etc \u0096 Stagecoach is first and foremost a gripping action adventure and a very mature humanist drama which uses the west as its backdrop. It announced to Hollywood that the west was a place in which stories could be told.Stagecoach also marked a turning point in the career of John Ford \u0096 his first shoot in Monument Valley, his first time working with John Wayne and not to mention his first western since the silent era. It is perhaps the quintessential Ford film. It's a story about redemption, forgiveness and understanding for the outcasts and underdogs. It's about resolving the contradictions between old and new, and between civilization and wilderness. The west, and in particular Monument Valley itself is the ideal location for this story. Monument Valley is not only an incredibly beautiful and impressive landscape, it's also overwhelmingly empty and bare, with the rock formations as isolated as the outposts and ranches. For Ford the unclaimed outdoors was a place of uncomplicated freedom, but also dangerous and inhospitable. The growing civilization is also full of contradictions \u0096 it is safe and secure, and the fairness of democracy was something Ford really cherished, but on the other hand it is tarnished by corruption and prejudice.What is really key to this work however is Ford's even-handed respect for his characters. The really amazing achievement here is to tell the stories of eight or nine individuals over a mere ninety-minutes. Each character has their own demons, their own reasons for travelling \u0096 some are outcasts with nowhere to go, some are running away from something, others are desperate to get home. The journey in Stagecoach heals divisions, puts the fallen back on their feet and gives everyone what they deserve.Of course John Ford knew that cinema is really about entertainment, and he had the respect for his audience to give it to them. The action sequences in Stagecoach are truly exhilarating, and really unlike anything done before. You can even see echoes of Stagecoach in the action movie revival of the 1980s, particularly in the truck scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, or the finale of Mad Max 2. I think one of the reasons cinema has always had this love-affair with the old west is, although it's quite a narrow genre in that it's confined to a particular time and place, it works so well as a backdrop for all kinds of relevant stories, allegories and so on. It's very often a safe retreat for a director who wants to get their ideas across untainted. Take for example the character of the Ringo Kid. Stagecoach was made at a time when there was a massive hoo-hah in Hollywood about gangster films turning criminals into heroes, and films like Angels with Dirty Faces came along to reverse that image, but with Ringo the outlaw is once again a likable rogue who deserves to escape the law.But, in spite of this being a very \"wild\" west, it's still a comparatively rosy picture Ford is painting, with all the innocence of 1930s cinema. The cavalry, for example are like a kind of perfect force, capable of anything and indisputably good. Stagecoach put the old west back on Hollywood's map, but the genre was to be massively shaken up over the next thirty years.",

            "content": "John Ford's Stagecoach(1939)does a great many things well. The photography of the beautiful and deadly wild west landscape, impressive action sequences, universally solid performances and very good use of light and shadows to set the tone and mood of the piece. Where the film failed for me was that I just didn't find any of the interlocking stories of the travelers very interesting. The romance between John Wayne's Ringo and Claire Trevor's Dallas seemed to come out of nowhere, as the characters had no previous contact it just seemed like the romance hadn't been earned in the time they shared on the screen. At one moment Ringo is inviting Dallas to sit next to him at dinner and at the next he's proposing marriage, it just didn't follow for me. The crime drama story seemed to be completely thrown away and needless with Berton Churchill's Gatewood being a thief that nobody really cares about. John Carradine's mysterious Hatfield is probably the most interesting of the dramatic characters as the dark and brooding gambler is not one to show his cards. The film's main thrust is John Wayne's revenge storyline and it certainly the most satisfying storyline of the piece but Wayne's characteristic lack of emotion hurts what could have been a more interesting and personal through-line. The film's brightest spots are two genuinely entertaining comedy double acts in the drunkard Doc and whiskey salesman Peacock as well as Buck the driver and Marshall Curly Wilcox. Both pairs have great comic dialogue and wonderful comedic performances and really bring a lightness and an easiness to an otherwise dark film. The other highlight of the picture was the climatic wagon chase scene near the end of the film, while it wasn't exactly believable(the Indians just kept coming)it was extremely impressive and entertaining. Stagecoach(1939) is certainly a mixed bag but there are a few very nice treats for those like me who just can't get into the whole John Wayne thing.",

This film was more like a soap opera. The only action scene in this 96-minute \"action-packed western\" was at the end, and that looked really hokey. (Special-effects weren't the most realistic- looking in the late '30s.)Then again, loudmouth drunks always annoy me, so Thomas Mitchell's portrayal of \"Doc Boone\" did not enhance the viewing experience for me. Mitchell played a lot of those roles. It's pretty sad the drunk in this film was a doctor! While the film looks very dated, as a whole, we do get a bunch of stereotyped characters that have been around on film for decades, like the prostitute with the heart of gold and the crooked barker (not Bob) while the nice girl is dull. Reportedly, this film made John Wayne a star. He played \"The Ringo Kid.\" Well, I'm glad for him; he was a fine actor.As he did with his later westerns, director John Ford gave us some nice looks at Monument Valley.

            "content": "The John Ford Stagecoach (1939) is a movie to be treasured, not analyzed. Its enormous virtues have more to do with the way it was made than what it is about, whether the characters are well-written, or how much sense certain scenes make. Stagecoach is not sensible, it is a movie; and it is the kind of movie than Americans do best and which no one else can touch.\nFord was a great primtive artist, not a thinker. In Stagecoach we see him at his best. He blends action and emotion seamlessly; and has the one virtue that all great directors possess whatever their subject matter or level of sophistication: he knows exactly where to place the camera. This may seem like a minor virtue to literary-minded critics and viewers, but it is as much as anything what Ford is about. Stagecoach is, among other things, one perfectly photographed and acted scene after the other; with the camera, whether discreet or close at hand, always positioned for maximum effect, which in this film is as much musical as visual. Stagecoach is among Ford's most graceful films. It is also perhaps his least pedantic.\nThe actors, whether sitting, standing, jumping, riding, talking, shooting, giving birth or dropping dead, are at all times where they ought to be on screen. How they go through their motions constitutes the bulk of the movie. We are not told how characters feel through dialogue; it is shown to us, vividly. The later scenes in Lordsburg are staged almost like a ballet; a ballet in the dark. Whether in a crowded saloon or an empty street we experience the movements of the principle characters, as well as the denizens of the town, often accompanied by music, some of it underscoring, some of it from an upright barroom piano, all of it relevant to the feeling of the story and the film. This is not a smart movie of the kind they make today. What irony there is is none too impressive; and the dialogue is not clever. It works at a different, almost subconscious level; and what one of its characters says about the young couple riding off to freedom in the end could be said of the entire movie, saved as it is, from the blessings of civilization.",

            "content": "I'm not American, no ancestor of mine was a pioneer inhabited by the 'frontier' spirit, but I grew up watching American movies until they became standards of my global cinematic taste. But like many kids of my generation, it's only when I became a true movie lover that I started to consider watching the good old black-and-white Hollywood classics.However, I have one cultural privilege that increased my enjoyment of \"Stagecoach\": I grew up reading the \"Lucky Luke\" comic books. I've already made a tribute to the legendary cowboy created by the Belgian 'Morris' in the \"Ballad of the Daltons\" review, I mentioned that the comic-book was a celebration of all the Western myth, through humor and caricatures. Like many men of his generation, Morris grew up with the Western classics and each of his adventure-albums tackled one or two archetypes. And one of my favorite albums was \"Stagecoach\", and it really made John Ford' classic even more rewarding.Granted, there was no hooker with a gold of heart, there was an elegant gambler, in fact, all the gamblers had John Carradine's instantly recognizable features, there was a priest, the coachman was a caricature of Wallace Berry, there was a meek little man bullied by his dominant wife, and Lucky Luke was assigned to escort them. Yet \"Stagecoach\" doesn't feature stereotypes, it created them, hence its status as a landmark, not just on the Western genre but on the adventure movies consisting of reassembling different persons with different background and different motives in a same place, and the interactions combined with the action lead to close each main character's arc at the end. The notion of character's arc is one of the most basic principles in screen writing, in fact the reason to be of any film, because the purpose is to make us care for a character, let alone many characters. Maybe it's one of the reasons Orson Welles was said to have watched the film almost 40 times while making \"Citizen Kane\", beyond the masterful editing, the way the characters evolve all through a relatively short picture is exemplary. The film was unanimously praised, it's still regarded as one of the greatest Western classics, and was rightfully nominated in the AFI's Top 10 list, but one of the reasons it maintained its impact is because the film transcends the archetypes of the genre. \"High Noon\" was a psychological thriller, \"The Wild Bunch\" influenced the depiction of violence and \"Stagecoach\" is the milestone of arc-movies.And on that level, a gallery of unforgettable supporting characters carries the film: Thomas Mitchell steals the show as the lovable drunkard Doc Boone, John Carradine as the chivalrous and sophisticated Southern gambler is a living enigma and Andy Devine never gets over the top as both the coachman and the comic relief with the incomparable raspy voice. But naturally, \"Stagecoach\" is mostly remembered for the true pillars of the film, Clair Trevor as the prostitute Dallas, and John Wayne as the Ringo Kid. He's an outlaw determined to avenge his father and brother, she's a pariah whose past prevented her from all the privileges a lady should have, and it shows all through the film where she doesn't get the same treatment as the other lady, played by Louise Platt. Now, the more I'm getting familiar with John Ford, the less conservative I suspect him to be. I'm not sure his portrayal of the banker speaks in favor of capitalism. And Ford' indulgence toward the hooker and the outlaw reveals a very subtle vision: a man can find redemption anywhere, and maybe that's the core of the conquest of the West, a place built by people who escaped from a past to build the future, like Tom Joad in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", he killed a man, doesn't regret it, and only sees toward the future. Ford's movies are all about a movement, the idea of going forward, go west: the core of the frontier spirit, with the passing of time, across the nature, transcended by a magnificent geography. When Wayne proposes to marry Trevor, the night is the fitting symbol of a new day coming, a new life. There is some humanism in Ford' ideological view on the West, yet Ford doesn't compromise himself for humanistic considerations, notably through the infamous portrayal of the Natives. They are not the 'bad guys' but only those who try to block the road to the west, symbolized by the stagecoach and the iconic climactic sequence. Some would feel uncomfortable with the gut-wrenching moment when Carradine finds a dead woman in an uncompromising position (mirroring the taboo issue of rape in \"The Searchers\"). But the scene is not gratuitous; it explains his last act of gallantry when he saves one last bullet, to use on Louise Platt's character, while she's praying when everyone is running out of ammo, right before the providential arrival of the cavalry. There's no doubt that ideologically speaking, from Ford's point of view, Indians are the antagonists and although they elevated the film to its iconic status through one of the most emblematic sequences of American cinema, it hardly masks the controversial aspects. But the way I see it, John Ford was an ideological director because he made iconic films out of his own ideas, never gratuitously and never at the expenses of sheer entertainment. At the end, we don't cheer because the voyagers kill the Indians, but because they didn't die, it's a case of self-defense embodying all the survival instinct that guided the pioneers who conquered the West. We're glad the stagecoach arrived, but that doesn't make the characters any good 'morally', there is an outlaw, a greedy banker, a prostitute, a gambler, Ford selected a bunch of people who were own rejected in a way or another, they were not perfect, but at least their rejection gave their life a specific direction.",

Starting out, I was startled at how stupid, meaningless and moronic it was. It was like watching a depression era Cartoon. Presented are a bunch of idiotic, tiresome, \"civilized\" people chatting about nothing in particular. Once they get on the Stagecoach it's no better, their self-righteous attitude, which comes across in the director's and script writers' intents, are much to stomach. You have a prejudiced, aristocratic dandy (John Carradine), a dumb as nails loner (John Wayne), a gullible, understanding prostitute, a vile corrupt banker, a smug small-minded \"preacher\", an inane drunk doctor, an annoying sanctimonious \"lady\" (who is pregnant) and a few other dimwits, all riding on the Stagecoach, ever fearful of the \"evil Indian\" attack. They talk about the most frivolous rubbish ever imagined. All of the characters are entirely irksome. Scenes proceed from A to B without any story, good dialogue or interest.The Apache are played by Navajo Indians (or a Mexican woman in ranch scene) in close ups and by blatant white stunt men in the horse shots. Of course, as expected, since this is filmed by a virulent, white bigoted Director, financed by a greedy studio and written by calloused short-sighted, studio stable script writers, it is no surprise that the Apache are played off as a hostile threat to the grand white civilized lifestyle (if you have a brain, you will observe that the 'grand white civilized lifestyle' is nothing but a bunch of loathing drunks who shoot each other). You will notice that the Apache are so inept that they can't even stop a Stagecoach, and are shot by the rabble riding in said Stagecoach, who never run out of bullets and put down about 55 of the attacking Apache in one of the most shallow, impalpable scenes ever imagined. If you are wondering how the Apache stopped Stagecoaches, all they had to do was shoot one horse. The Apache, by that time, having been reduced to being a poor starving band of corralled slaves, imprisoned, murdered by the US government and it's hostile citizens, were fighting for survival at that point. Instead, they are called \"savages\" and made to resemble sub-human scum. Having lived with the Apache myself, I realize that they have a rich culture, are deeply spiritual and had a love for their land.If you can get past all the inept portrayals and ostensible characters, which if you are intelligent, is impossible to forgive, then at least you can enjoy a narrative but Stagecoach lacks that as well. John Ford doesn't even give us a palpable story. All that is left is cheap 1930's gimmicky cutouts, as John Wayne instantly falls in love with ostracized prostitute, kills all bad guys, then everything is fine.After Stagecoach (1939) was over I was left questioning all the misleading \"great\" reviews. I burned my copy as it has no value whatsoever, not even as average entertainment.Stagecoach goes nowhere.",

Here's what I didn't like:The film quality is so bad, Monument Valley is barely recognizable.The so called profound \"social relevance\" of the movie is a joke. Hey, guess what? If you really had to ride in a stagecoach with a prostitute, drunk, escaped convict and a gambler, you'd be pretty upset too. So the \"great theme\" of the movie is to sanitize and glorify the criminals and deadbeats and ridicule and parody normal law abiding middle class citizens? As Tom Hanks says in \"Big\", \"I don't get it.\" Did the Ringo Kid really propose marriage to Dallas about an hour after he met her? And most of the time he spent with her he was crammed in a sardine can with 6 other people. Sorry I wasn't swept up in the romance of it. Just looked like poor decision making to me. No wonder one's a whore and the other's a convict.Claire Trevor did nothing for me. I read in a Jimmy Stewart biography that Ford wanted Marlene Dietrich for the part. Too bad, Dietrich was born to play this part, but even she couldn't have saved this turkey.I'm sure this is heresy, but I thought the 1966 version with Bing Crosby was much better than this. And if that guy Thomas Mitchell got an Oscar as the drunk, Bing should have won a Nobel prize for his performance. And give me Ann Margaret as the whore over Claire Trevor any day.I felt like I was watching \"Airport\" or \"The Towering Inferno\". What a legacy. The first corny disaster movie. A model for so many great films that followed - \"Earthquake\", \"Airport '77\". Thank you, John Ford!I think this movie's big rep comes from the story that Orson Welles watched it 40 times while he was making \"Citizen Kane\". Well guess what? Orson Welles was an overrated pompous a**!!! There. I said it. The emperor has no clothes!!!!!This movie is truly memorable for one reason. It made Duke a star. For people who grew up watching the older Wayne, it is quite a shock to see him so young, handsome, glowing and vibrant. Every John Wayne fan should see this movie for that reason.But if you want to watch \"Stagecoach\", watch the 1966 remake. It's not half bad.",

A lot of the comedy comes from Peacock and stage driver Buck, who is not the smartest person on board. When the Apaches finally do come John Ford gives us one of the best chase sequences I have seen. Even for todays standards it is very good and as exciting as a scene like that can be.Director John Ford is always able to make a John Wayne-performance pretty good and in 'Stagecoach', their first collaboration, we have a Wayne on the top of his game.

            "review_title": "The perfect western from Guy De Maupassant",
            "content": "In the 1880s the master of the French short story wrote a classic about the Franco Prussian War entitled \"Boule De Suite\" (translation: \"Ball of Fat\" - a reference to the nickname of the heroine). It dealt with a coach of middle class Frenchmen traveling together in 1870, who are captured by Germans (it is during the Franco - Prussian War). One of the passengers is a prostitute the others look down upon, although she is a nice person. The Prussian officer in charge takes an interest in the prostitute, and the others notice this. They overcome her patriotic scruples and she agrees to sleep with the Prussian. As a result the passengers are released. But once they return to their journey, they snub the poor young woman - she is still just a whore, even if she saved them all.The story was actually filmed in the 1940s (produced by Val Lewton and starring Simone Simone as the prostitute) as MADEMOISELLE FIFI. It is not considered one of Lewton's classic films (certainly not in the same breath as his three films with Boris Karloff). But in 1939 it was part of the basis of this film, one of the greatest Westerns and John Ford movies of all times: STAGECOACH.Claire Trevor is the prostitute taken from the De Maupassant story. But she is not given the same central ironic position that her French original had. Trevor does not have to sleep with the enemy to save lives, only to be spurned by them. That she is spurned by them is part of the plot, but her prostitute is far luckier than the original one. Trevor actually has a chance for real happiness in the end.Now set in 1884, STAGECOACH is set in the southwest, where a stagecoach is leaving a small dirt town with a mixed crowd of passengers (several of them are outcasts types - borrowing a little from Bret Harte's short story \"The Outcasts Of Poker Flats\". The passengers to the larger city of Loudsberg include the town trollop (Trevor), the town gambler and ex-Confederate (John Carridine), the town's drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), the wife of an Army Captain (Louisa Platt), a liquor salesman with a satchel of samples (Donald Meek), the town's Sheriff - going because of current dangers from the Apaches under Geronimo (George Bancroft), and the stagecoach driver (Andy Devine). Bancroft is going along because he knows the Apaches are on the warpath and have cut the telegraph lines to Loudsburg. Therefore he is surprised when the town banker (Berton Churchill - in his possibly most disagreeable character part) shows up on the town's outskirts with a single large carpet bag and the statement that he just got a telegram to head for Loudsburg for business. What's up there?It is a crowded little world inside the stagecoach, with Trevor being cold shouldered by Churchill, Platt, and Carridine (although the others treat her better). Carridine, proud of his Southern military heritage collides with Mitchell, a former Northern soldier. Mitchell keeps emptying out Meek's sample case (at one point Meek tries to stop him very gently - it doesn't work). Churchill keeps bloviating about Government interference with banks (to the annoyance of everyone else). Carridine shows most consideration of Platt, who is pregnant. This seems tied to knowing that at one time Carridine served under Platt's southern father (but under his real name - not his current one of \"Hatfield\"). Bancroft, when not thinking of the mystery of Churchill's appearance, is watching for the arrival of the cavalry to protect the stage, and the dangerous Apaches.Then he and Devine see a figure on the road - it is John Wayne in the cinematic moment when he stopped being an actor in grade B westerns. John Ford just shows his tall figure rising out of the earth as the stagecoach screeches to a halt. Bancroft now has another problem - and a personal opportunity. Wayne is \"the Ringo Kid\", a wanted prison escapee - he too wants to go to Loudsburg to kill Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler) and his two brothers, who murdered his own father and brother and stole their land. Bancroft, a peace officer, arrests him - but because of the situation Wayne is allowed to have free movement. Soon he and Trevor begin noticing each other - and becoming attracted.The film builds through a series of sequences that have classic, such as Mitchell's pulling himself together to deliver Platt's baby. The balance of the film is perfect, as is the casting. We end caring for these souls (except possibly Churchill). And it concludes with one of the best filmed showdowns in movies. Made eight years after CIMMERON won the first Best Film Oscar, STAGECOACH was deserving of the same award, but it came out in the best year for Hollywood movies in the Golden Age of the talkies (and GONE WITH THE WIND won instead). But it has maintained it's standard of greatness, and remains the yardstick for all Westerns that have been made since.",

It stars Claire Trevor, John Wayne, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine, Donald Meek and Louise Platt. Director of photography is Bert Glennon and director of music Boris Morros.6 people on board a stagecoach bound for Lordsburg, each one very different in character, each one with their own issues in life, and some carrying shame as well as dark secrets. The journey is fraught with danger as the Apache are tracking them thru the desert flats, can all the polar opposites come together to form a united front?It's now written in history that the 1930s was a bad decade for the Western movie. The decade began with expensive flops The Big Trail & Cimarron and from there the big studios pretty much condemned the genre to being nothing more than a B movie production line. Then in 1937 a story called Stage to Lordsburg was published in Collier's magazine, a story written by Ernest Haycox that itself was inspired by a short story called Boule de Suif written by Guy de Maupassant. John Ford liked the story very much and purchased the rights, trusting Dudley Nichols to rework a screenplay into a classic Western narrative. Meeting resistance from some of the head men at the studios, Ford had to fight hard to not only get the film made, but to also have John Wayne playing The Ringo Kid. Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea were wanted instead of Wayne, and Marlene Dietrich was suggested for the role of Dallas, the role eventually went to Claire Trevor. But Ford stuck to his guns, and rightly so, for now Stagecoach can be seen as a wonderful film that not only launched Wayne to stardom, but also as the film that reignited the Western genre and paved the way for some essential classics that followed.John Ford's first sound Western is rich with character dynamics at play, with the great director exploring what would become a trademark theme of his, that of moral qualities born out of people deemed less pure in society's eyes. True enough Stagecoach is still very traditional in an early Western movie sense, but the study of different characters under duress is magnificently moulded by director and cast alike. It was something that Orson Welles liked about the film, calling it perfect textbook film making, even claiming it to be a film he watched numerous times whilst crafting Citizen Kane. It's easy to believe Welles, we obviously remember the stunning Apache pursuit of the rocketing stagecoach, the stunt work, the breathless energy and the majestic location of Monument Valley, but thematically the film sizzles as well. That Ford is able to marry sharp action with real human drama -I ntimate drama played out on a massive panoramic landscape - is why Stagecoach continually entertains and influences with each passing year.From the moment Ford zooms up close on the face of John Wayne, a mega-star was born, but more importantly, from the opening credits to the last second of Stagecoach, the Western movie was reborn. A near masterpiece of the genre. 9/10",

John Wayne has an unforgettable entrance too, which was deliberate by Ford! But it's not all Wayne here. It's also the story and the other actors who jointly put their work together, to a complete whole! And it was the first Western that used the Monument Valley (fondly named John Ford country later)! This is also, not an all action Western, but more of a character piece! John Wayne will also be seen, in one of his favorite on-screen poses (used by Jean Reno in \"Leon\" as Homage, in one scene), but there is so much to say here (even if I'm more of a Sergio Leone Fan), about this fantastic movie, that it would break the mold here ...

Yes, he wants to settle down and get that farm and marry a good woman, but there is business to finish first.Wayne will draw on the soulful speech and body language he displayed here in many films to follow. He knew that America liked that and he gave them what they liked.As we remember this great John Ford film that won an Oscar for Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), we fondly celebrate The Duke's 100th anniversary this month.",

Personally, I'm usually not a big fan of the old westerns but this one definitely interested me. The presence of a mysterious villain, Geronimo lingers along a feeling of suspense throughout the movie. The audience feels like he could appear at any moment and that is exciting, As the characters in the movie ride on the stagecoach throughout the movie, we get to know each character better and each is more unique than the next. With the presence of many western elements, this film also contains a love story between Ringo Kid and Dallas. Ringo promises her a simple life and vows to keep this promise as the movie goes on. Many consider this film to be significant solely due to the emergence of John Wayne as the focal point of western films. However, this film is significant due to the plot, action, suspense, and love.

            "review_title": "One of my favourite westerns of all time, second only to \"High Noon\".",
            "content": "\"Stagecoach\" is one of the most influential Westerns ever made. It is based around a concept which has since become a classic Western plot- the motley group of strangers forced by chance to travel together through hostile territory. This plot was used, for example, in the Paul Newman film \"Hombre\" and has also been used in non-Westerns, such as the British-made \"North-West Frontier\", set in India, and \"The Journey\", about the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.In this instance the motley group is travelling by stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. The date is 1880, during the period of the Apache Wars. Among the travellers are a prostitute, an alcoholic doctor, a Southern gentleman-gambler named Hatfield, a pregnant woman travelling to meet her cavalry officer husband, a banker and a whiskey salesman. Along the way the stagecoach also acquires a reluctant passenger, an outlaw named the Ringo Kid, who has been taken into custody by a US Marshal.\"Stagecoach\" is notable for two reasons. Firstly, it is the first sound Western directed by John Ford. Although Ford had made westerns, such as \"The Iron Horse\", during the silent film era, he had not made any since the coming of sound, and had spent the late twenties and thirties working in other genres. It was also the first film that Ford made in Monument Valley with its sandstone buttes which were to become something of a trademark in his films.Secondly, this was the film which made a major star of John Wayne, previously regarded as a B-movie star but only a supporting player in A-movies. Although Wayne has the largest role in the picture, that of the Ringo Kid, he took second billing behind Claire Trevor, regarded as a much bigger name in 1939. He was 32 at the time the film was made, but looks younger, surprisingly youthful for those like myself who chiefly remember him as the grizzled old hero he became in the sixties and seventies. Part of the myth which has grown up around Wayne is that he only played characters who were patriotic, courageous and 100% morally upright, but the truth is rather more complex; it is worth recalling that in the film that made him a star he plays an outlaw in search of redemption, not a flawless hero. (The same is also true of Wayne's last film, \"The Shootist\", from nearly forty years later).Some of the scenes in the film make use of what were later to become standard Western clich\u00e9s, notably the final shootout between the Kid and his enemies the Plummer brothers and the Indian attack on the stagecoach, thwarted by the timely arrival of the cavalry. (Would a skillful tactician like Geronimo really have wasted the lives of so many warriors in order to capture a target of negligible military value? At least a dozen Indians are picked off by the unerring marksmanship of Hatfield and the Kid). In 1939, however, scenes like these must have seemed much fresher than they do today, although even then they were probably not completely original, given the vast number of Westerns churned out in the twenties and thirties. Ford, however, manages to bring considerable excitement to these scenes, especially the attack on the coach. There are a number of excellent acting contributions, something essential in a film of this nature which depends upon characterisation and upon bringing out the contrasting personalities of the travellers. Those that stand out are from Wayne, from Trevor as the prostitute Dallas, from Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone and from John Carradine as the slightly dubious Hatfield.The film is based upon a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox, but there are also similarities to Guy de Maupassant's short story, \"Boule de Suif\", another story of a wartime journey by stagecoach which also features a prostitute as one of the main characters. As in de Maupassant's story, it is the seemingly disreputable characters who reveal their moral strengths, whereas the ostensibly respectable ones are exposed as cowardly, hypocritical or dishonest. Dallas proves to have hidden reserves of decency, the wanted criminal the Ringo Kid displays great courage in fighting off an attack by hostile Indians and the drunken Doc Boone manages successfully to deliver a baby when Mrs Mallory unexpectedly goes into labour. The pompous banker Henry Gatewood turns out to have embezzled $50,000 from his bank.Like most Westerns from this period \"Stagecoach\" is based on a good-guys-versus-bad-guys morality, with the added twist that a whore and an outlaw can turn out to be good guys, and a respected pillar of society turn out to be a common thief. Much of the appeal of this film lies in the fact that it is a celebration of life in the Old West and yet subtly subverts the conventions of the Western genre in precisely this manner, presenting us with something both reassuringly familiar and yet also refreshingly different. It is an exciting tale of adventure, a morality play and a study in characterisation. It is also one of my favourite westerns of all time- perhaps second only to \"High Noon\". 9/10",

            "content": "A stagecoach with diverse people, a kind of microcosm of post-Civil War American society, makes a trip from Tonto, a typical Western town, to Lordsburg, a much darker version of a typical Western town. Along the way, the passengers pass through increasingly dangerous situations. Most change, at least temporarily. Some survive and some don't. It's taken from a short story that appeared in Collier's Magazine and is probably a rip off of de Maupassant's short story, \"Boule de Suif,\" but with a happier ending.The character I enjoy most is the one who doesn't change in any way. That would be Berton Churchill as the banker Gatewood, whose wife runs the Law and Order League that's driving drunken Doc Boone (Mitchell) and the whore Dallas (Trevor) out of town. Churchill is a fat cartoon, his jowls wobbling, his voice quavering, always indignant and angry, spouting off anti-New Deal bumper-sticker slogans about how business is good for America, and we ought to have a businessman for president, and the government ought to keep its nose out of the affairs of the free market. He's running off with all the bank's assets.The year in which this appeared, 1939, was a banner year for Westerns. During the 30s they'd been cheap and crummy. But all at once we have a wave of \"major motion pictures\" starring names like Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Tyrone Power, and Henry Fonda. They amounted to a reexamination of traditional values that had become problematic during the Great Depression. What, exactly, does the word \"progress\" mean? The character of Gatewood aside, Ford doesn't address many of the contemporary difficulties directly. Poverty isn't brought up because the subject is the difference between social status and honor. His West is stripped of most of the conventions. There is no fast draw. Nobody cleans up a corrupt town. The movie is in black and white, it's Ford's first film in Monument Valley, and it has no bankable stars. It made an icon out of John Wayne -- perhaps in one single and sometimes out-of-focus shot -- who had spent most of the last decade in Gower Gulch cheapies with names like \"'Neath Arizona Skies.\" It's a little too perfectly done. We can more or less tell from the start who is good, who is bad, and who is likely to reform. It's over-engineered like some German automobiles or Swiss watches. Yet there's a good deal of built-in ambiguity and qualification.For instance, Doc Boone is the happy but abject alcoholic. As Wayne's character tells him at one point, \"That was my brother's arm you fixed, Doc. You did a good job even if you was drunk.\" Boone replies with a satisfied smile, \"Thank you, son. Professional compliments are always appreciated.\" Later, Boone's skills as a physician are called for and he pukes himself sober and rises to the task. The expectation now is that Doc Boone, having \"found himself\" again, is off the booze for good. Not quite. At the end, when he and the sheriff send Wayne and Trevor away, the sheriff proposes they return to the saloon and have a drink. Boone hesitates, then says, \"Just one!\", in a tone of voice that tells us there is likely to be more than just one.The other characters have their stereotypical qualities similarly undercut. John Carradine is a gambler who has shot men in the back, yet he takes a pregnant aristocrat under his wing. \"I'd like to offer this lady my protection.\" At the same time, he treats the whore with nothing but disregard.There isn't enough space to get into all of the virtues of this simple but fascinating look at American values. I'll mention the dark and dispiriting red light district of Lordsburg, which is Dallas's destination, and the insane laughter coming from some of the houses. The neighborhood is so drenched in shadow that there ought to be a neon sign somewhere, Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. In the final scene she avoids her fate by riding off with Wayne in search of a little ranch \"across the border\", a paradise that may exist only in the cognitive map they share.",

            "content": "No need to recap the plot following 400+ reviews.Beautifully crafted Ford western, from the magnificent landscapes, to the fine ensemble acting, to the colorfully edgy screenplay. No wonder the 96-minutes is considered a screen classic. It certainly shot Wayne up the industry ladder from his usual B-movie cowboy flicks. Here, he shows a soft side along with usual tough-guy determination. In short, it's the actor showing an emotional range that later iconic roles unfortunately diminished. All in all, as his Ringo shows, he was a better actor than usually given a chance to prove.Even though Wayne is best remembered, it's really an ensemble cast with no central character, unless maybe Trevor as a tarnished hooker shunned by respectable folks. And what a collection of engaging characters they are, so nicely interwoven by director Ford, and contributing greatly to the film's iconic status. Though Mitchell's eternally tipsy drunk is sometimes over-the-top, he's a really colorful presence that helps spice-up the entertainment. I guess if there's an overall story moral, it's about the Importance of strength and determination in getting you where you need to go, like the passengers on their way to Lordsburg (check out that name!).Anyway, several notes in passing. Note the only really dislikable character among the traveling ensemble is imperious banker Gatewood, probably a reflection of the Depression era 1930's. Note too the attention to detail by actually blowing a wind on the stagecoach passengers, their hats struggling even while tied down. That's a realistic detail usually ignored by westerns of the time. But most of all, I could never understand why the hard-riding Indians didn't just shoot the stagecoach horses instead of paralleling them as sitting ducks for stagecoach shooters. Heck, you don't have to go to West Point to understand that tactic. But then, if the Indians did, how many cowboy flicks would have bitten the dust.All in all, for this former front-row kid turned geezer, it'a heckova Ford triumph along with a Wayne as seldom seen, and that remains so even though times have changed.",

            "content": "A classic with everything that you want in a Western, \"Stagecoach\" may be a little old-fashioned, but it's still one of the best movies of its kind. Besides a lot of action and suspense, there is a wide assortment of characters, brought to life by a good cast headed by John Wayne and Claire Trevor.  The plot includes everything from outlaws on the run and Indian attacks to romance and a woman in need.After an introduction to the main characters, most of the action takes place on a crowded stagecoach ride through territory where Geronimo is on the attack.  Each of the passengers has his or her own reasons for traveling - some good, some bad - and there are a lot of interactions among them, which may not be especially profound, but are certainly interesting.  If some of the characters and events seem a little stereotyped by later standards, that is at least in part because films like this have so often been imitated. \"Stagecoach\" stands out from the average Western in that most of the characters have a particular purpose and a distinct personality, which make otherwise familiar events a little more meaningful.  Some of them do irrational things, but that is what many of us would do in the kinds of situations depicted in the story.The scenery and settings are also good, helping the viewer to feel part of the old West and emphasizing the predicaments faced by the passengers.  For example, one particularly good shot occurs when the cavalry unit that escorted the stagecoach for the first step of its journey has to go in a different direction - there is a slow shot of the path splitting in two, with the stage taking one fork and the cavalry the other.While some aspects of \"Stagecoach\" may be dated (such as the portrayal of Indians), this is still an excellent Western, and it is also worth watching for anyone who likes classic movies of any kind.",

Even Andy Devine's mild comic relief or Thomas Mitchell's drunk scenes work, unusual as those are the sorts of scenes that rarely pass the test of time.

            "content": "By 1939, John Ford was already a established director who had gone from making countless B-Movies of the Westen genre during the early decades of cinema, to direct very effective and successful A-Movies through the 30s. It was at this point in his career when, at the age of 45 years old, Ford returned to the genre of his earlier films with \"Stagecoach\", his first Western since his silent classic \"3 Bad Men\", and not only meant a revolution of his own style (that very same year he would also direct three other gems: \"Drums Along the Mohawk\", \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\"), it was also a turning point for the Western genre, as pretty much as he had done previously with \"The Iron Horse\" in 1924, Ford took the genre once again to the level of art, and proved once again that Westerns were more than silly shoot'em up stories of cowboys and Indians. With \"Stagecoach\" Ford not only introduced a new way to make Westerns, he also introduced the world to one of the most enduring icons of cinema: John Wayne.\"Stagecoach\" is essentially the tale of a simple stagecoach trip across the dangerous lands where Geronimo and his Apache warriors are preparing for War against the U.S. Army. The travelers inside the stagecoach include a young woman (Louise Platt) hoping to reunite with his husband, who is a member of the Cavalry, a whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), a moody banker (Berton Churchill), and four persons of \"bad reputation\": a gambler (John Carradine), a drunk doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a prostitute (Claire Trevor) and the infamous outlaw Ringo (John Wayne). Together with the driver (Andy Devine) and the Marshall (George Bancroft) watching over the stagecoach (and Ringo), the odd group will find themselves not only worried about the apaches, but about each other's secrets as well.While virtually a mix of road movie and Western, what makes the plot of the movie (written by Dudley Nichols) really interesting is the way he plays with the characters and their relationships. Adapted from Ernest Haycox's story \"Stage to Lordsburg\", the film plays heavily with the theme of morality and hypocrisy, as inside the stagecoach are characters of every \"social class\", but everyone has some kind of secret. It has been stated that Haycox based his story in another interesting study of morality and hypocrisy, the story \"Boule De Suif\" by Guy De Maupassant, translating the story to a Western setting and toning down the story's heavy handed use of the themes. Of course, \"Stagecoach\" still retains many of the elements of the typical Western of its time, but yet, it shows that like Ford, writer Dudley Nichols was decided to make \"Stagecoach\" something more than another Western by adding a considerable amount of character driven drama.As written above, it is in this movie when finally the \"Ford style for Westerns\" is born, as he takes the genre to the level of art by his excellent use of cinematography (by Bert Glennon) to capture for the first time in his career, the amazing landscapes of Mountain Valley. However, this extraordinary use of wide shots is not the only remarkable feature of Ford's directing, together with Glennon he gives new and original uses for the camera with a great eye for the use of light and shadows. \"Stagecoach\" is a very atmospheric movie, as the story requires a great amount of tension between the characters and their environment and Glennon's expert cinematography plays a key role to achieve that effect. While books could be (and have been) written about Ford's visual style, it's worth to point out that specifically this film is very character driven, and Fords proves to be up to this challenge with great control and superb storytelling skill.After building a 10 years long career as a star of B-Movie westerns, John Wayne finally proved that he could be a real Hollywood star with his remarkable performance as Ringo Kid in this film. Granted, Wayne never had a big acting range, but this film shows what he could do when provided with a great script. Claire Trevor is simply awesome as Dallas, taking the classic \"hooker with a heart of gold\" archetype to perfection, making a very real and human character. John Carradine shows his talent in a role that, while not having many lines, says more with physical expression than with words. However, the real jewel of this movie is the truly outstanding performance done by Thomas Mitchell as the friendly, yet unreliable Doc Boone. It is truly the work of a master.One could say that \"Stagecoach\" is simply a film where everything is just the way it has to be for making a masterpiece; for starters Dudley Nichols' screenplay is certainly one of his best works, playing with his assortment of characters in very clever and original ways. It's true that \"Stagecoach\" owes a lot to Ford's directing style, but Nichols too deserves the credit for its freshness and overall success; I would even say that along with Ford, Nichols reinvented Epic Westerns with this movie. Finally, Ford's terrific use of music to enhance this atmosphere and Yakima Canutt's brilliant stunts (after all Ford knows how to make action sequences) complement this film and put it in a category few Westerns to that date had achieved.While of course by today standards this film is considerably dated, it still is one of the best Westerns ever made. True, it still has some of the characteristics of 30s Westerns, and I don't doubt that it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hard to deny that this is no b-Movie, this is the birth of the Western as an A-List film, and the beginning of the legends of Wayne and Ford. Anyone remotely interested in the genre must give it a look. It'll be worthy. 9/10",

Yet it's still a darn tootin' good prairie saga as well!  Mitchell as a booze-soaked doctor and Trevor as a shamed saloon girl board the title vehicle under a certain amount of duress.  They are joined by whiskey-peddler Meek, gambler Carradine, pregnant soldier's wife Platt and crooked banker Churchill.  The addled driver Devine and marshall Bancroft are on top.  Before long, prison escapee Wayne is picked up and added to the coach.  As the stagecoach makes its rough and tumble way towards Lordsburg, the threat of Geronimo looms everywhere.  The passengers all have reasons why they do or do not want to reach their destinations which creates the conflict and interest of the story and makes this a sort of sand and saddle \"Grand Hotel\".  More thoughtful film fans will recognize that the passengers represent various elements of humanity and certain social groups.  Director John Ford made this his first foray into the remarkable landscape of Monument Valley and achieves gorgeous results.  He also does some wonderful things with lighting throughout the film.  The actors are all exceedingly fine, most of them having acted in dozens upon dozens of films.  Trevor is gorgeous and heartfelt.  Wayne is given the star treatment even though at the time he wasn't quite one completely.  This put him on the map.  Even as young as he was, his forehead has washboard wrinkles in it, but his height and virility make him a striking hero of the west.  Mitchell is nothing short of amazing. A man of many, many talents, he won an Oscar for his amusing, yet engrossing work here.  Western veteran Tyler pops up at the end as a bad guy.  Though the film is clearly dated in certain respects and has a few flaws (a heinous and unnecessary musical number and some misplaced levity in the dialogue), there is plenty to keep viewers occupied and a healthy dose of threat from the marauding Apaches.  Unlike the inferior remake, this version keeps the stagecoach rolling during the first climax, which keeps the suspense rolling.  Comparing the two films, the flat, TV-level actors (Mannix, Mrs. Hart, etc) of the remake can't hold a candle to the veterans in the original.

He isn't nice to her because he wants to be 'nice'. God forbid. He is good to her because she is good to others. She earns his respect, just as Mary Magdaleine earns that of the Christ.The cinematography in this movie is astounding. You see painting after painting, carefully composed.But it is the presentation of basic human virtues, stripped of all social pretense, that hits you in the gut. And no movie does that better than this.",

            "content": "Stagecoach marks the first collaboration between director John Ford and actor John Wayne. The film tells the story of nine people embarking on a dangerous journey through Apache territory on, you guessed it, a stagecoach. The cramped interior of the stagecoach forces its passengers to interact and deal with each other in ways made unique by their situation. The film has some memorable characters and a thrilling climactic chase scene, but overall left me with a bitter impression of John Ford as a director.Stagecoach struck me as the sort of film that did too much in too little time. Thinking back to the events of the film feels like a hurricane of underdevelopment. The problem with having nine people on the stagecoach is that it never allowed most of them to become anything more than a totally flat character. In my opinion the banker, Peacock, the gentleman type gambler guy whose name I cannot even recall, Lucy Mallory, and Dallas all felt very one-dimensional. This is particularly troubling because Dallas is supposed to be the main love interest and her character didn't seem to extend anywhere beyond \"the love interest.\" The other four characters were good. Doc Brown was alright but not what I would consider to be Oscar worthy, John Wayne was John Wayne, so either you're thrilled by his performances or don't care for him at all, but the thing about this film that surprised me most was the characters I thought were the best. The sheriff and the stagecoach driver really stood out. They were played so excellently that their actors took the sort of flat characters they were given and turned them into something worth watching. Were the performances of two secondary characters enough to carry the film for me? No, but they certainly put forth a gallant effort.I gave the film a 5 out of 10 not because I liked it enough to warrant a 5, but because I noticed and understood that there were parts of the film that were very well done. That being said, I hated it. It sickened me. Cowboys versus Indians type westerns disgust me to no end. The way the films so often portray their native American antagonists is absurd and bigoted, with Stagecoach being no exception. I do come from a place of bias, I was raised by a proud Native American mother, so I realize I'm taking more offense to this than the average viewer, but that doesn't change the fact that John Ford must have had an ignorant and hateful view of these people. The truth is \"Geronimo\" was a real man named Goyathlay, and he did lead revenge attacks after Mexican soldiers murdered his mother, wife, and three children. Geronimo was a name given to him by Mexican soldiers, so a good number of people at the time of this film's release would have recognized him as a real person, but John Ford just relies on the Native American tribal killer stereotype to make him a threatening villain in the film, no other substance is given to the antagonist.",

            "content": "Stagecoach is often considered the movie that made John Wayne into the tough cowboy stereotype most people think of him as. The reason for this is obvious. The character Wayne plays is Ringo Kid, a fugitive who is trying to find and kill someone named Luke for murdering his father. Ringo doesn't appear until about 20 minutes into the movie, but it isn't a surprise that Wayne dominates the entire movie with his presence. He was almost always the main character in any movie he appeared in. Anyway, the story shifts paths a little bit after a horse and buggy is sent to retrieve Ringo, and Ringo climbs aboard, finding the coach occupied by a few other characters. They eventually arrive at a house, and Ringo tells Dallas (a girl he is traveling with) that he wants to marry her. At first, she doesn't give Ringo a straight answer, but later agrees. Meanwhile, the cart is chased by native americans on horses, which could have ended in a disaster if not for the US Cavalry. After stopping in a town, Ringo confronts Luke and is ready to take revenge for his father's death. Luke doesn't fight fair and shows up to the shootout with his two brothers, but Ringo kills them all anyway. After this, Ringo is permitted to ride to Mexico with Dallas. It shouldn't be a wonder to anybody why this movie is enjoyable. After all, John Ford directed it. He was nominated for best director in 1940, but Victor Fleming took the award thanks to Gone With the Wind. The actors do their jobs well here. Wayne as Ringo Kid defines what it means to be tough, in every sense. After this film, it's hard to imagine Wayne as anything but a western star. Claire Trevor plays Dallas, one of the people taking part on the coach's journey, and later Ringo's love interest. She doesn't initially accept Ringo's offer of marriage because she is ashamed of her old life as a prostitute. There's a few more characters, such as a doctor who thinks it's a good idea to drink while performing medical procedures on his patients, and Mrs. Mallory, whose father was a civil war veteran. Nothing is comparable to Wayne though. He still manages to retain his tough guy image decades after his death, and Stagecoach played a key role in starting that reputation.",

I really enjoyed watching the round characters show different colors and you begin to fall in love with them, like the doctor. He was my favorite character of the whole film. The acting, at times, was a little melodramatic but all in all? I really enjoyed watching it. When the new mother was praying in the stagecoach for the sound of the military trumpet, I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the sound to ring in her ears. To me?

            "content": "Nearing the end of the poll on ICM for the best movies of 1939,I started to check on Amazon UK for DVDs. Hearing about the impact it had on Citizen Kane,and also a fan of their team-up for The Long Voyage Home,I saddled up for the first collaboration between John Ford and The Duke.View on the film:Riding into his first \"talkie\" Western, producer/ director John Ford & cinematographer Bert Glennon display a remarkable eye for using the soundtrack to build upon the images,from the pop of bullets darting round the screen,to the creaking sounds of the stagecoach highlighting how close the group are to danger at every turn. Going to Monument Valley for the first time, Ford looks across a valley of spectacular action,via wide-shots crisply following Yakima Canutt's stunt work, and stylish shots looking out of the window of the rumbling coach.Inspiring Orson Welles (who watched it over 40 times when making his debut) use of ceilings in Citizen Kane,Ford and Glennon brilliantly contrast the great outdoors action with an intimate,claustrophobic atmosphere,of the limited space in the rooms subtly bringing a closeness to Dallas and Ringo,and also squeezing the group into a tight space,where they must work with each other to escape. Loosely based on Boule de Suif by Guy de Maupassant (whose Bel Ami was wonderfully adapted in the same year) and Ernest Haycox's short story The Stage to Lordsburg,the screenplay by Dudley Nichols superbly gives every member of the gang their fair share of attention,which goes from the ill at ease Wilcox and dashing Ringo, to the playful Buck and alluring Dallas. Sending them round the track,Nichols makes each element of the group join into a thrilling team, with the cornering from the Apaches sanding down the dividing differences.The biggest name in the cast when the movie was made, Claire Trevor gives an excellent performance as prostitute (something the Hays Code had \"issues\" with) Dallas,thanks to Trevor making Dallas strong- willed against any of the guys,but also being well aware of the \"outcast\" status the job labels her with. Joined by a charming Andy Devine as Buck and a terrific George Bancroft as Wilcox, Da Duke gives a great performance as outlaw Ringo. Pushed around by Ford behind the scenes, Wayne bring out the rough treatment on screen by giving Ringo eyes a burning determination to see the stagecoach complete the journey.",

            "review_title": "One of the Best Westerns Ever Made!",
            "content": "1939. One of the best years EVER in cinema's history. There are instant classics such as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, and now you can add one more: John Ford's Stagecoach. This movie is considered the father of modern Westerns. Yes, there have been many Westerns (including some directed by Ford) prior, but they were all seen as B-films. Nothing that would make its mark on cinema. Not until Ford pressured studios to turn the genre from B-films to A-films. This movie is considered to be one of Ford's greatest films and he made plenty of them. As for my own personal opinion, I loved this film. I can see why it influenced many other Westerns in years to come. It really is a film ahead of its time, especially with that heart-wrenching action sequence.The film is the beginning of a long partnership between John Ford and star John Wayne. Ford has made many silent films to put himself on the map. John Wayne has been in nearly 40 Westerns up to this point, from extra to lead. He still wasn't well known to the general public and that is one of the biggest reasons why Ford had trouble getting this picture made. Even after securing financing, he had to combat internal battles regarding the actor. Claire Trevor, a big name at the time, had to be given top billing. Ford complied. For fans of film and Westerns, this culminated in the rise of John Wayne, the everyman that people loved.If seen for the very first time today, you would ask yourself, \"How can this film be considered original?\" It's about a group of nine very different individuals gathered to face extraordinary circumstances. Well, it was this film that influenced countless other films. Ford and screenwriter Dudley Nichols got the idea for this film from a Ernest Haycox short story which you can actually read if you purchased the Criterion version of the film.It's after the Civil War in Arizona. There is a caravan that goes from Tonto to Lordsburg. As the stagecoach is about to ship out of Tonto, they learn that Geronimo and his Apaches are on a warpath, so they travel at their own risk. The passengers include: Buck, the squeaky-voiced driver (Andy Devine), Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) who is going to see her husband and holds a secret, gambler Hatfield (John Carradine) whose intentions are not entirely clear, a drunkard doctor, Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), Dallas (Claire Trevor) who pleases other men and got kicked out of Tonto, and the Marshal Curley Wilcox (George Bancroft) who provides security when he learns that Ringo the Kid (John Wayne) is on the loose, amongst other travelers. Ringo actually meets up with the stagecoach on its journey and could be a helping hand on the journey to come.There are noticeable names within the cast, but I liked how Ford gave each actor their own chance to shine. I think each major character received an equal share of screentime. The characters are all stereotypic (different personalities), but Ford made the characters humanistic and three-dimensional. The actors were all were fantastic too. Thomas Mitchell rightfully won the Academy Award for his performance as the drunk Doc Boone. His character was funny and quite a joy to listen to. John Carradine, with the skinniest face ever, delivers a really interesting performance as Hatfield. Is his mysterious character villainous or not? Then, there is John Wayne! This is the film that turned Wayne into a star. At 32, his youthful appearance is about gone, and he is more rugged. But the tenderness and the gracefulness is within his character. Westerns have a way about treating women as an escape method for the male characters, but Wayne is able to do away with that trope.I loved the location shooting for the picture. Films have not been shot in Monument Valley before simply due to not being near any civilization. Monument Valley became Ford's favorite location shooting and it does work wonders in terms of cinematography. The pillars certainly gave the film an intimidating feel.There is one instance of negativity: Ford's treatment of the Apache Indians. Contemporary viewers claim this is racist, while it's really just how the Native Americans were portrayed back in the 1930's. The Apaches are the villains and film does not bother to explain their reasonings behind the warpath. I found that a tad disappointing, but I understand the time period. The extended action sequence involving the Natives is excellent. It's well-choreographed and of course, no CGI. Which impresses me considering how well-made this sequence is.Stagecoach is a fantastic film that brought together the collaboration of John Ford and John Wayne. It also began the years when John Ford cranked out great movie after great movie earning many accolades in the process. It turned the Western genre into something the mass audience could watch. The characters are fleshed out and the actors breathe life into them. I loved this film and I agree with the statement that it is one of the best Westerns ever made.My Grade: A",

            "content": "This movie is intense. The dramatic power of the is movie is off the charts. Clare Trevor is both beautiful and vulnerable; she is the star. The other players are outstanding too; their performances are legendary. Yet, Ms. Trevor's performance brings a tear to your eye and a lump to your throat - without it being hokey, corny or contrived. The scene where she shows Ringo where she is lives - in a whorehouse - is the climax of movie, for it there that Ringo is confronted with the truth of who she is and now duly informed must decide what to do. In fact, remove Ms. Trevor from this movie and the movie fails because there would be no story. John Carradine's performance is also particularly noteworthy. Here, he portrays a gambler with a shady reputation but as the story progresses he reveals another more noble side; the same can be said for Doc Boone, played by Thomas Mitchell. Some my say that this is not the best western movie. Others may say that the story contains too many clich\u00e9s. And others may say that the movie is outdated, a relic of the past, an antique, to be relegated to the closet, attic or shelf. Well, they'd all be wrong. This movie was great when it was made in 1939 and is still great today. That this movie is still watchable is proof of the story's strength. The director, John Ford, manages to bring together the script, the scenery and above all the acting to create a classic, a movie that withstands the test of time. Especially powerful are the two characters, Dallas and Ringo, played by Claire Trevor and John Wayne. Both give outstanding emotionally charged performances, one as a prostitute, the other as a cowboy, both with pasts, whose paths cross. Far from being stagy or corny, Mr. Ford manages to inject into their relationship a bond that transforms the movie from a typical cowboy movie into a cinematic and artistic masterpiece. Thomas Mitchell also gives a notable performance in this wonderful movie.",

The film, which is definitely the foundations genre. Set design could be a bit better. The story is one of the best in the history of cinema. The acting is top notch.This film is a milestone in the careers of director and lead actor. The story may not be original but it is great. I appreciate movies where each character in the story gets space. I would not go so far as to say that every character becomes a segment involved in the story. On peculiarities of the characters the story is based. This is perfection.John Wayne as Henry \"The Ringo Kid\" is a young rancher, a fugitive from prison in search of revenge and a sense of his future life. Wayne was an amazing authority, at times with his statements and act as if the whole world is his. I am glad that Ford was not overly forced his character, because it would have the opposite effect. Claire Trevor as Dallasis very attractive lady of pleasure, although a better description was \"on the verge of prostitutes\" because the contempt related to her. Extremely strong female character. A brave woman with a big heart, capable to love and nurture. Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone is a doctor and an alcoholic. It's hard to determine what's on better. Alcohol humiliates his profession, but at the same time raises his humanity. Other characters are also excellent. Southern gentleman and elegant gambler Hatfield (J. Carradine), haughty heroine and pregnant wife cavalry officer Lucy Mallory (L. Platt), feminine whiskey merchant Samuel Peacock (D. Meek), evil and treacherous banker Henry Gatewood (B.

            "content": "John Ford helped popularize the serious western as a film genre and put its biggest and best film star on the map in this entertaining movie. It's not his greatest work, at least by my lights, but \"Stagecoach\" still plays well, especially at establishing Ford's clever use of perspectives.The Apaches are on the warpath in Arizona. While most whites know better and stay low, a group of disparate, desperate people travel on a lonesome stagecoach. Some are running from trouble, while at least one, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), is running to it. But a final destination proves hard to reach, and Geronimo is making sure they never get there.John Ford was a great director, and \"Stagecoach\" shows he knew a lot about what made a film special. In some ways he is quite subtle, like in his launching of Wayne, who keeps our attention even though he seldom dominates after making his signature entrance. Wayne plays Ringo way too nice, with little of the grit he effortlessly displayed just three years later in \"Flying Tigers,\" but his reaction shots here, a source of quiet lifelong pride for the Duke, are in fine form.Ford also gets rather broad, playing the comedy of a drunk doctor and a disapproving town or the ignominy of a crooked banker with hammy acting and cutesy musical cues. Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar as the doctor, and though fine in parts he is also another in a serious of problem alcoholics Ford played too much for laughs. There's a lot of talk and no action until the two-thirds mark, when we get a big chase battle between the stage and the Apaches that shows off brave stunts as well as cruel animal mistreatment all too typical of the period. Yakima Canutt has the stunt people talk about, but it looks too much like a stunt for me. (He's better with other, less showy stunts, and delivers the movie's first lines to boot.)Anyway, \"Stagecoach\" is often brilliant, never stupid, and not racist in the way some posters here complain. For me, the racism is more problematic in a scene where we see a woman abandon her husband so she can help her Apache brothers get some scalps, a scene rendered even more artificial by the fact she performs a song while rendering her betrayal.The reason directors still love this film is not, I'm convinced, for its take-it-or-leave-it storytelling but for the masterful way Ford delivers on the subjectivity of perspective. This is done both in the camera-work, lighting on individual faces exchanging significant looks in group shots, and in the script. At one point, the Ringo Kid is upset because he thinks he's being snubbed by some more respectable citizens, not for himself but the fine girl he's seated next to.\"Looks like I got the plague, don't it?\" he huffs, starting to get up for a confrontation.The woman stops him, knowing it's her they are snubbing. Demurring on her behalf, Ringo sits back down, his admiration for her enlarged. Little does he know...The most memorable scene of the movie is during that big Indian chase. Just as the chase builds to a climax, Ford closes in on the face of a praying woman. Her face fills the frame, but our attention is more on the object slowly entering the left-side of the frame. It's a double portrait of hope and despair, but just as you figure Ford has no more trumps to play, he cleverly introduces via the soundtrack a music cue over the dramatic score that sounds like bugles. Is it just part of the score, Gabriel blowing his Horn, or something else? We don't know, and thus become part of this wonderful depiction of perspectives all askew - until Ford throws in what would become a clich\u00e9 in later films but works like a charm here.Seeing isn't quite believing in this film, not for me. But as a calling card of things to come, from Ford and Wayne, \"Stagecoach\" makes an impression and works as solid entertainment.",

Of course, the film will always be remembered for making John Wayne a star but it's also a film that took the genre out of the low-budget \"B\" range and put it high on the studios list of films to make. The story is fairly simple as a different range of people are trying to make it through Indian territory with the deadly Geronimo liable to attack at any moment. There's a lot to admire in this film but for me the greatest thing about it is the ensemble cast. Not only do we have Wayne as the Ringo Kid but we get Claire Trevor, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Donald Meeks, Thomas Mitchell, Louise Platt and George Bancroft. Each cast member really does a wonderful job at making their characters more that one-dimensional stereotypes and they also made the return for characters to be a mixture of good and evil. In way too many Westerns people were either good or bad without too much in between. This trend started when sound came into play and studios were making \"heroes\" but Wayne's character here proves that you could be both good and bad and still be a hero. It's easy to see why Wayne would become a star with this movie because there's so much energy behind him even when he's talking with that laid back style or walking at a calm pace. Carradine is another stand out to does a great job and his work with Ford was always quite impressive. The scenery is another major plus as is the cinematography. Who will ever forget those beautiful shots of Monument Valley or that incredible first shot of Wayne's character? The action scenes are filmed with so much detail that you feel as if you're right down in the middle of everything going on.

Granted, there were some parts where the film lagged a bit, and for a runtime a little over an hour and a half, it seemed to stretch longer. That aside, there were several aspects of this film that were exceedingly well done. first and foremost among those would have to be the outstanding camera work and general cinematography of the film. The long sweeping shots of the open west, combined with the action sequences were both fun to watch. To me though the most memorable scene of the film is probably the same as every other persons, namely the first time the audience gets to see John Wayne. That shot was particularly well done, what with the shot first starting from far away, and then drawing into an extreme close-up. A second enjoyable aspect of the camera-work was the way in which the camera rotated around inside the actual stagecoach, allowing the viewer to connect at different moments with each of the different characters therein. There was no one point where I was able to simply forget that one of the character's was there, as they all played so well off each others respective personalities. The film's story, while far from unique in and of itself, proved to be unique in the sense that as a viewer I was able to truly grasp the range of emotions that the characters were feeling due to their respective back stories. Be it the banker, or Doc Boone, or even the slightly less than memorable Peacock. Some things that I did not enjoy however, were times during the \"indian\" scene, where the \"good guys\" would almost never miss, and the Indians always did. While it is understood that the film was striving for perfect accuracy in its telling, a greater sense of realism would have been appreciated. In addition, the love story between Ringo and Dallas, while obviously needed to give the film its \"Hollywood\" ending, in my opinion, could have easily been left out. That being said, it is not as though I have no appreciation for a good love story in the middle of action, it is simply more to the point of avoiding such well-worn clich\u00e9s. Nonetheless, despite these minor shortcomings, this film is a classic unto itself and it is clear to see how after starring in this film, John Wayne began his rise to super stardom. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of classic westerns, as it clearly set the mark for all the films in the same genre that followed it.",

But the praise is one level removed - a viewer has to ignore the natural tedium that pungently outdated ideas smother you with, and endure clich\u00e9 after clich\u00e9 accumulating. Sure they weren't clich\u00e9s at the time, but they're the dry, crusty ancestors of clich\u00e9s now. As entertainment, this is quite unwatchable.You could play \"Memes of the 1930's\" Bingo watching this. Hooker with a heart of gold? Check! Unconvincing exterior gun-fight shot INSIDE a studio? Yep.As always in 1930s movies, the score mercilessly pounds one theme into your brain over, and over, and over, and over, and over. I find I can only go back to about 1939 in terms of film viewership before I can't detect a representation of the world commensurate with modern ideas & values.",

            "review_title": "Classic Western tale of nine compelling coach passengers",
            "content": "I'm not normally much if a Western aficionado but enjoyed this old classic, directed by John Ford and apparently the first serious one of its genre. The musical score is lively accompaniment to the coach's journey, and the scenery through which it travels is spectacular, even in black and white. It's very impressive to watch this stagecoach wending its way through the desert. I understand the picture was filmed in Monument Valley on the Arizona / Utah border. The movie portrays a dramatic stagecoach trip through dangerous Apache territory from a frontier Arizona town to Lordsburg, New Mexico. The nine very disparate travelers include an outlaw under arrest called Ringo the Kid, the Marshal escorting him to prison, a woman of ill repute named Dallas, an alcoholic doctor, an embezzling banker, a pregnant lady (Mrs. Lucy Mallory) en route to join her soldier husband, a mysterious Southern gambler, a timid liquor salesman, and the coach driver. From the outset of the trip, they realize that Geronimo is on the warpath. However, the calvary is unable to continue offering protective accompaniment throughout the trip. Not only that but if Ringo survives this journey, he still has a mission once he gets to Lordsburg to exact justice for his family's murder.The climax involves both an Apache raid and a classic street shoot out in keeping with the true spirit of Westerns. The Indian chase scene with the horses is masterful. However, this movie has much more than the standard good guys versus bad guys. It paints a character portrait of each of these nine travelers in a short time, and depicts very skillfully the conflict and other interactions that develop between them, the loves and the hates. During the trip a baby is born and as a result of the raid, there are injuries and perhaps even deaths (don't want any spoilers).A very young John Wayne is brilliant as always here in his role of Ringo, a cowboy who has broken out of jail. Claire Trevor plays the ostracized, kind hearted prostitute Dallas. A romance develops between these two social outcasts, although Ringo doesn't realize from the onset the nature of Dallas's work. It's a very moving scene when Dallas conveys to Ringo where she does work...the sorrow on her face and tears in her eyes would melt the coldest heart, as she feels her dream slipping away.The film tackles themes of social issues and prejudice. The respectable folk are not always as they appear to be. The banker is a thief, the doctor is a drunk (albeit a lovable one), and the Southern gentleman is an enigma. The outcasts, Ringo and Dallas, are good hearted folk with the potential for ordinary, decent lives. Initially the very proper ladies have run Dallas out of town. Likewise at the beginning, even some of her fellow coach passengers turn their noses up at her. Mrs. Mallory seems to undergo quite a change in her own attitude toward Dallas as a result of the unfolding events. Everything is so deliciously subtle in these films of old. For starters, perhaps I didn't scrutinize closely enough but I didn't even realize that Mrs. Mallory is pregnant until she's fainted and they're calling for hot water! Also, at no time is it ever directly stated that Dallas is a prostitute, the viewer simply gathers it as a result of the attitudes of others. No subtlety these days, everything must be blatant. This is a wonderful old film that appears to be quite simple, but has much more complexity than at first meets the eye.",

Practically every element here later became a cliche--the whore with the heart of gold, the drunken doctor, the small-minded small-town women--but they're fresh and unhackneyed in this setting. For me, the highlight is the Indian attack, and political correctness be damned: It's so thrillingly shot and edited that, while the outcome is never in doubt (this is 1939 Hollywood, after all), I really feared for the lives of the passengers. The photography is gorgeous, the dialogue lean and pithy (this screenwriter was known for this), the details authentic.

            "content": "It's a movie that is mostly mainly set at one location; of course in a stagecoach. It makes this already quite an original movie for its time but its also original with its overall approach. \"Stagecoach\" is not just purely a western about cowboys fighting Indians, it's also a real character movie, in which all of the characters have their own personality and motivations and start to bond together, since they are all together in the same situation. Under any other normal circumstances they would had most likely never met. It's a movie that has basically everything in it; action, romance, comedy and drama. The fact that the movie is almost entirely set aboard a stagecoach and therefor is always on the move, gives the movie also a great adventurous feeling.You could say that this movie was John Wayne's big breakthrough, even though he had starred in many movies before, including westerns, prior to this movie. He was still a big unknown at the time and isn't even the top-billing actor of this movie. It must be said that he also just doesn't play the biggest role of the movie. He is just one of the characters. It was the first of many collaborations between director John Ford and the actor John Wayne. The movie has a great assembly cast next to Wayne, with actors such as John Carradine and George Bancroft, who were quite big names at the time. It's of course really a movie that allows its actors to shine, since its a movie that mostly relies on all of its characters. I especially liked John Carradine in the movie.It above all things is a great made movie, that is beautifully looking. The John Ford directing for the movie is dynamic and knows to combine elements from all kind of genre, with always keeping the movie look and feel like a western, despite featuring so much different 'non;-western like elements. Ford also received an Oscar nomination for his directing of this movie. The movie received a total of 7 Oscar nominations but took only home 2 awards, of which not the most important ones. I also really liked the movie its Oscar nominated cinematography, which gave the movie a great look and overall atmosphere. The movie also uses some nice settings. For some part the movie was filmed in Monument Valley, Utah. A location director John Ford would use many more times again after this movie but he used for the first time ever in this movie.Some of the stunts in the movie also deserve credit.Guess it's not a movie for just everyone, especially not those who are expecting a typical John Ford or John Wayne western. The movie for most part feels and progresses like a typical '30's drama. It nevertheless is a timeless classic. When people call this movie outdated, they just probably have something against black & white pictures in general, for \"Stagecoach\" was a quite modern movie for its time and still perfectly holds up this present day.A wonderful timeless movie, even for those who aren't into the western genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

A stagecoach sets off across the untamed wilderness carrying a mixed assortment of characters: an infamous outlaw, a drunk doctor, a prostitute, a whiskey salesman, the wife of an Army officer, a gambler, a bank manager, the local Marshall and the driver. Animosities and petty differences, and unexpected friendships, surface. Their fortunes take a turn for the worse when they learn that an Apache raiding party, lead by Geronimo, is in their vicinity. A masterpiece that is the most important Western ever made. Great plot, well directed by the legendary John Ford. Not just a conventional cowboys-vs-Indians / gunfight sort of Western (though there a large element of that) but a character drama too. There is great character depth and development on display and this is used well in developing the story.Some great themes running through the movie too, especially one of anti-prejudice.Good performances all round. John Wayne is great as the Ringo Kid and shows a softer side that wasn't always apparent in his later films. Thomas Mitchell deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Doctor Boone.More than just a brilliant movie, a movie that created the blueprint for Westerns, and pretty much defined the genre. It also made John Wayne a star. He had acted in plenty of movies before this without much impact but Stagecoach is what truly launched his career as we know it.John Ford had already won a directing Oscar before directing Stagecoach, so this movie wasn't as career-enhancing to him as it was to John Wayne. However, it did set him up as the foremost director of Westerns. Moreover, it was to be the first of many collaborations with John Wayne, a series of collaborations that would see them make movies like The Searchers, Rio Grande, The Quiet Man, They Were Expendable, Fort Apache and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.A brilliant and historic movie.",

Like all great movies, it's also a wonderful drama filled with fascinating and memorable characters. It is beautifully judged by Ford to play as both a spectacular action film set against a fabulous backdrop (the gorgeous Monument Valley in Utah) and as a brilliant character study as folks from every walk of life are thrown together into a desperate situation. The entire ensemble give tremendous performances - Wayne is brilliant in the keynote role of the Ringo Kid, but Trevor, Mitchell and Bancroft and particularly Carradine as a Southern Gentleman rogue are all terrific. Almost every scene has a poetic quality to it, enhanced by the traditional score (six people worked on the music) and the wonderful dialogue, and the Injun attack sequence (featuring amazing stuntwork by the great Yakima Canutt) remains a textbook example of how to shoot and cut an action scene for maximum impact and entertainment value. Being British, and a child of the late twentieth-century, I'm not a particular fan of classical westerns because it's hard for me to get into that good old American frontier freedom sensibility.

            "review_title": "Well Done Technically - But Far Too Much Melodrama For My Tastes",
            "content": "As the movie that made John Wayne a big star, \"Stagecoach\" can rightly be considered a classic. To this point in his career, Wayne had starred in low budget B-movies typical of the Western genre. Here was a big(ger) budget Western directed by the famous John Ford. Wayne had taken a step up in the world. And there's a lot to like about this movie - especially on the technical side of things. It was shot on location instead of on a lot, and the scenes of the Arizona desert landscape (even in black and white) are captivating, and give the viewer a real sense of being there. The fact that the scene where the stagecoach is being chased by the Apache wasn't filmed using rear projection also made that seem more realistic. So, technically, I'd say that this film was quite an achievement. Where it falls a bit flat, in my opinion at least, is the story.I've seen a number of Wayne's earlier B-Westerns, and in terms of story I'm not sure this is any better than most of them, and in some ways it's not as good as at least some of them. They tended to be short and fast paced and got to the point fairly quickly, if not right off the top. This one got itself bogged down in melodrama that we had to wade through to get to the only parts of the movie that really counted. In that sense, it reminded me a little bit of the \"Airport\" series of movies from the 1970's. The basic story in \"Stagecoach\" is that a stagecoach is trying to make its way safely through Apache territory. So you know what this is leading up to - a confrontation between the passengers on the coach and the Apache. But to get there you need to learn about all the characters and get at least some of their backstory - and the sad truth is that most of them aren't really all that interesting , nor, really, do we learn all that much about most of them in the end. They're just populating the screen, and sometimes adding a bit of humour to the story. Of all the characters the only one I found myself truly curious about was Dallas (Claire Trevor - who received top billing, ahead of Wayne.) She played a woman with a dubious past with whom Wayne's Ringo Kid (who's escaped from prison to confront the Plummer brothers who put him there) falls in love. I felt sorry for Dallas, who was shunned by most of her fellow passengers, except for the Kid. Otherwise, I found myself just waiting for the Apache - and they don't show up until very late in the movie, in what turned out to be a well filmed gunfight - another technical accomplishment. It only lasts about 10 minutes, mind you, and then we move on to the final scenes offering us the resolution to the Kid's encounter with the Plummers.Too much melodrama just isn't for me - and that really took away from my ability to enjoy the movie. As I said, there was a lot to like about this and so much of it was very well done. But the story left me a little bit flat. (5/10)",

            "content": "Of course the film Stagecoach is a classic. Writing yet another review is only of value, if you make a connection to your own perceptions. Many decades ago the film Stagecoach made a deep impression on me, even more than its reputation justifies. As a child I had read all the cowboy and western stories of Karl May, a German author of adventure books. May was a fantast and had never been in America, but his books were extremely liked in Europe. In his adventures there was never any doubt about good and bad, and in the end the good always prevailed (sometimes after a struggle of decades). It is apparent why for me, after such an early education, the film Stagecoach fell on fruitful grounds. For years John Wayne became my greatest hero and example, and his deeds seemed to be the obvious answer to many problems. Time has passed, and my interest in western movies withered. How do you revalue an artefact, that shaped your youth? The cover of my DVD version describes Stagecoach as a journey of social misfits, and that is probably an accurate summary. Actually it paints a gloomy and incredible picture of the early pioneers in the American West. On closer examination many of the events are very unlikely or even impossible. This degrades the film, since it insults our intelligence. However, my main objection concerns the crooked presentation of human sentiments. For instance doc Boone, a severe alcohol addict whose liver is most likely about to collapse, is portrayed as a witty, proud, capable (when he is sober) and at times courageous man, and a patriot during the civil war. In short, he is essentially good and a hero. Ringo Kid, the other hero, decides to propose to an unknown woman, after a day together in the stagecoach. And the director John Ford admits of no doubt, that this development is in his perception highly romantic. You have to think deep in order to find a even a rudimentary moral lesson here. It makes you wonder about Fords own private life. In one aspect the film Stagecoach differs from the books of Karl May. With May the Indians are noble wild men. With Ford they are just targets, and we will never know why Geronimo organized an uprising in the first place. In conclusion Stagecoach seems to advocate a surrealistic world, that is twisted to the bones.",

The scenery was amazing - especially considering it's a black-and-white movie - with how vividly it paints the american west. The one problem I had is that the movie didn't feel very engaging. IT's hard to put a pin on it, but it just felt like the movie didn't present high enough stakes. John Wayne never really changes his plan from when he's introduced to when he finally leaves at the end, so it feels more like an inevitable journey from one palace to another than a character change.

It presents the society in microcosm, as a stagecoach full of traditional types (the hero, the whore, the puritan, etc.) travels across the untamed West. What maybe felt vibrant and different at the time now seems obviously schematic, but that's not really the movie's fault--it's the fault of countless film classes that have turned this film into more of a blueprint than a movie. And of course it no longer feels especially fresh, but that's because it set the pattern for nearly every western that came after.What does stand out now about Ford's film are two things: 1.) On a cerebral level, this western feels much more fraught with subtext than other movies of its era; there's a cloud of anarchy that develops over this group as they get further and further away from the civilization they know, and as their cultural judgements and labels begin to mean less and less; and 2.) On a purely cinematic level, the extended action sequence in which the stagecoach is beset by Indians is a stunner for its time, and it's terrifically exciting.This movie is also credited with making a star out of John Wayne, a crime for which I can never forgive it, no matter what its other redeeming factors are.I'm not a huge fan of westerns, so by extension I'm not a huge fan of this film. But I did enjoy it, and it's one of those movies that's fun to watch from a historical standpoint if for no other reason.Grade: B+",

Its reputation rests largely on being the first western to deal explicitly with 'serious' issues in an intelligent, uncompromising way without losing sight of the entertainment value inherent in good old Cowboy and Indian pictures, in establishing Monument Valley as a key Ford location and in giving us a new star in John Wayne, (his introduction on the road is legendary), even though the actor had been around for almost a decade.

            "content": "Before John Ford's majestic Stagecoach was released in 1939, the western genre was festering in B-movie hell. While we can all now agree that the genre can encompass just about every sort of human experience and underlying theme imaginable, in the 1930s it had become a joke; simplistic and goofy tales of good guys in white versus bad guys in black that were little more than an excuse to deliver an action scene or two. Although he had made a staggering amount of pictures by the time he directed Stagecoach, John Ford left it relatively late in his career to become the lauded auteur he would be remembered as being when he adapted Ernest Haycox's short story The Stage to Lordsburg.Stagecoach is special indeed. Not only did it revitalise a flailing genre, but it seems to give birth to another - something more classical, thoughtful and mythical. This is, in part, down to the casting of John Wayne as The Ringo Kid, an actor who became so synonymous with the role that he spent his entire career both embracing and running away from it. Already a veteran of around eighty movies made for 'Poverty Row', the still-young Duke was only cast after Ford stubbornly insisted on it, while the studio wanted Gary Cooper. Ford knew he would be a star, and the director certainly gives him an introduction worthy of a screen giant. As we first meet the Kid, cocking his rifle as a tracking shot brings us close to his face, it's inconceivable just how Ford was the only one to recognise his screen presence.Yet Wayne is only one of a magnificent ensemble of characters flung together in the claustrophobic stagecoach as it heads closer towards towards hostile Indian territory. Everyone on board seems to wrestle with their own vice or prejudice, including effeminate whiskey salesman Peacock (Donald Meek), brooding Southern gambler Hatfield (John Carradine), and shifty banker Gatewood (Berton Churchill). The two largest roles go to Claire Trevor as kind-hearted prostitute Dallas and Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone, the latter winning an Academy Award for his efforts as the blow-hard whose realisation of his own flaws become his redemption. The two are set on their journey after being thrown out of town by the 'Ladies' Law and Order League' - a group of busybodies who begrudge any sort of moral taint on their town - as Doc cries social prejudice.The idea of social prejudice being rampant in a country guilty of its own recent atrocities is a key theme running throughout, and Stagecoach is a surprisingly liberal movie, despite the depiction of the screaming Apaches, who play the enemy here. We spend a lot of time with the characters before we get to climactic action sequence, but the skill in which they are drawn and played, along with the fascination of watching these shunned personas unite against a common goal, means it never feels like Ford is making us wait. The Apache attack is a high-speed work of technical brilliance, featuring stunt work so nail-biting that you won't even stop to ponder why they don't just shoot the horses. It's so memorable that you'll forgive the redundant second climax featuring the Ringo Kid's unfinished business with the Plummer gang, and the sentiment that comes with it. Arguably the finest American western ever made,",

Re-made in 1966 by Gordon Douglas, with Anne- Margret as Dallas, Alex Cord as Ringo and (interestingly) Bing Crosby as Doc Boone.COMMENT: \"Stagecoach\" is one of the most popular westerns ever made. The reasons are not hard to find: More action that you can poke 101 rifles at (including the most excitingly-staged Indian attack ever filmed), set against the most awesomely magnificent scenery, a cast of likable and seasoned players, and handsome production values including a jaunty music score which adds further momentum to an already pell-mell pace. Ford's craftsmanship \u2014 his eye for arresting detail and dramatic composition, his unerring sense of flow and movement, his ability to draw involving characterizations from his players \u2014 was never more evident. One of the most remarkable qualities of Ford's genius is his unerring ability to top himself. On paper, the Lordsburg shoot-out looks like becoming an anti-climax after the dynamic thrills of the stage chase. But Ford is more than equal to the challenge. That shoot-out is equally as edge-of-the- seat suspenseful because of Ford's imagination and skill. He is a master at creating atmosphere and mood, he has a feeling for people and places that lifts the action, characters, setting and dialogue of his scripts to the highest emotional plane of sympathy and involvement.\"Stagecoach\" made John Wayne a major star, but although he was to make many outstanding movies in the rest of his career (some again with Ford), he never equaled the vitality, the unassuming doggedness of the Ringo Kid. This is the John Wayne that most moviegoers remember.AVAILABLE on an excellent Criterion DVD.",

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939): Dir: John Ford / Cast: Claire Trevor, John Wayne, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine: Early adult western using its title as a term for vessel regarding the lives and personal dilemmas of the characters. It stars John Wayne as Ringo the Kid who is arrested and placed on a stagecoach that is set for dangerous territory. There are two women, one pregnant and wishing to reunite with her husband who is serving in the war. The other is a prostitute ignored by all except Ringo. Other characters include a Sheriff and a drunken doctor. Adventurous and exciting with an ending of simplistic violence that seems clich\u00e9 even for those days. Tremendous work by director John Ford with a highlighted pursuit by Indians. Ford would go on to become one of the most impressive directors in the business. Claire Trevor is clearly the lead here as she struggles to maintain her dignity and finds sympathy from Ringo. John Wayne expresses regret in his eyes yet dutifully accepts condemnation. Unfortunately the showdown in the conclusion hasn't the dramatic power that it was perhaps intended to have. Great supporting work by John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell as the doctor. Both have their moments of scene stealing as they reach their destination. Andy Devine plays the stagecoach driver. A trend is set for westerns showcasing great production showcasing the excitement. Score: 9 / 10",

So, I found the whole movie and story to be a little uninteresting. I guess westerns aren't for everybody. I did, however think there was excellent camera-work during the movie. Varied shots and angles giving us views from many different peoples perspectives. The coordination during the Indian fight scene was pretty well done. The Doctor (played by Thomas Mitchell, who I almost immediately recognized from the movie It's a Wonderful Life)was pretty entertaining, the other characters were dry. That's not saying anything towards the actors, I just think this movie wasn't really entertaining. Maybe western film fans might see the beauty in this one, but for me it fell flat.",

            "content": "An unlikely group of companions is lumped together in a stagecoach... some are kicked out of town, another is heading home to her husband, and others are on the lookout for Geronimo and his Indian warriors. But they form an alliance that works out for the best of them all.This film is notable for the casting of John Wayne (formerly a B-movie actor) and the direction of John Ford. But, for me, Wayne's portrayal of the Ringo Kid takes sort of a back seat. The real talent is John Carradine, who I think may also have been largely unknown at the time (both men were paid less than an actress whose name I cannot recall). His role as the gambler and his distinct look made him the anti-hero to root for.Also, Doc Boone (played by Thomas Mitchell), who my friend Matt classifies as one of his favorite movie drunks. I concur. Boone is a good-hearted man who wants to help his friends and neighbors, but has a bit of a drinking problem. This does not make him incapable of doctoring or violent... just happy and silly, which mixes well and goes even better with his love of quoting classic literature. He is a true renaissance man with a taste for whiskey.While I'm not generally a fan of westerns, this one works well because the cowboys versus Indians parts are fairly minor, and the real story is how a diverse group of characters interact. And they interact well, causing this to be a win for the writer, director and the actors. A must see.",

            "content": "There seems to be a myth that John Wayne's dramatic entrance as the Ringo Kid in the film STAGECOACH immediately catapulted him into the first rank of film stars. That's an exaggeration to say the least. After STAGECOACH Wayne starred in four low budget quickies for Republic Pictures. He got second billing to leading ladies and played the second male lead in a few major studio productions. Ford cast him in THE LONG VOYAGE HOME in a forgettable minor role. In the early '40s he starred in a series of cheap Republic war films. His stock rose later in the war, but not until his excellent turn as cattle baron Tom Dunson in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER (1948) did Wayne garner Ford's respect for his acting.Nevertheless, Wayne is very good as the Ringo Kid determined to pay back the Plummer boys for murdering his family; but Claire Trevor is even better, exuding vulnerability as Ringo's love interest, Dallas, a sympathetic prostitute. Thomas Mitchell (Doc Boone), John Carradine (Hatfield), Donald Meek (Peacock), George Bancroft (Curly), Andy Devine (Buck), and Tom Tyler (Luke Plummer) are likewise fine. So it's a little unfair to view STAGECOACH through the prism of John Wayne's legend status. In its time STAGECOACH was not a John Wayne vehicle but a John Ford film, the first to convey the stark beauty of Monument Valley's desert mesas in high-contrast black-and-white. It was Ford's ingenious camera set-ups that captured those luminescent cloud formations that look like Ansel Adams photos.The work by the stunt crew has never been equaled, but it was Ford who cast Navajo Indians as extras, and added bits such as Indians reloading single-shot breech-loaders while riding at full speed, or the little colt trailing the buckboard when the soldiers evacuate the way station. Such small details pass almost unnoticed, but add significantly to the feeling of authenticity we see in John Ford's best work.Bert Glennon's B&W cinematography is superb, but one suspects Ford had more than a little to do with the noirish lighting, especially in Ringo's showdown with the Plummers, which may have been influenced by George O'Brien's eerie night-walking scenes in Ford's favorite film, F. W. Murnau's SUNRISE. Ford certainly chose the parlor tunes and folk songs that make up the Oscar-winning score, which resembles many of the compilation scores in his later films.This film is a landmark western that wasn't the morality tale audiences were used to, but dealt dramatically and realistically with Depression Era themes that resonated with 1930s audiences: a girl who is decent and kind, forced by circumstances into prostitution; an aristocratic southern Belle - one of society's paragons - who is a snob; and of course the banker, a pillar of the community who is really a thief. There are many films that make use of archetypes to tell a story, but very few like this one that invented and defined them.",

            "review_title": "Citizen Stagecoach",
            "content": "I will spare you the details of how universally influential STAGECOACH was. It set the framework for 70% of westerns made after 1939 and, most importantly, became the artistic model for Orson Welles first little production, CITIZEN KANE. More on KANE later, but for now lets look at Bert Glennon's cinematography. This is the man who would later work on numerous Ford productions in addition to such projects as THE RED HOUSE, SHADOW OF A WOMAN, and RUTHLESS -- all in the Noir tradition. This suggests an intriguing interplay between John Ford's westerns and the Noir style. Fritz Lang was already developing the Noir narrative during the late 30's, but, surprisingly and inarguably, Ford was forging the early stages of Noir design. It couldn't be more evident in STAGECOACH. Powerful single lighting sources, long black shadows, and high contrasts. The whites are real white. The blacks are real black. Orson Welles said that he learned how to make KANE by watching STAGECOACH over and over and over again. What's this about KANE creating the ceilinged set? It's all over the place in STAGECOACH. Where did he get the sound idea for the opening tracking shot of TOUCH OF EVIL? Watch STAGECOACH. I don't think Welles would deny this and I don't think he would have rather lost the Oscar to anyone but Ford that night in 1942. Indeed, STAGECOACH is all over KANE. Everywhere you look. Ford's style is at its most pure and unadulterated here. It is done with his usual degree of technical virtuosity. The graceful camera motions are subtle beyond all others but possibly Murnau. Ford left so little to the editor in terms of choices, thereby exerting extraordinary artistic control over the picture. By giving so much artistic power to the natural surroundings, Ford allows Monument Valley to ornament his shots and they are thus illuminated by this dwarfing presence. The expanse of the west rightly plays a starring role in STAGECOACH. It's a Western's Western where outcasts can be redeemed by the expanse of the unexplored. The lawless and unruly land encourages entrepreneurship and thrift. Here, the west is the land of misfit cowboys, ready to take their chance and wake up from that American Dream. Of course, I can't finish this review without giving credit to the ensemble of decent actors who turn a stagecoach into a courtroom of extraordinary personalities. Wayne isn't strangled by his own image yet and his exuberance is tangible. Ford directed him with one side of the whip and Hawks with the other. Both directors drew some of this century's greatest moments out of Wayne. Unlike Hawks, who had a trove of his own gifts, Ford could pull more feeling and direction out of a human eye than anyone else. It's so evident in STAGECOACH.STAGECOACH, aside from being the mammoth standardizing western that it is, possesses a style that crosses boundaries and prepares the way for Orson Welles and Film Noir. If it isn't the best from Ford, it's at least a testament to his formidable output.96.8001",

            "content": "SPOILERS!  BEWARE!It's no secret that \"Stagecoach\" has been a very influential film.  What distinguishes it even more than that, however, is how simply GOOD it is. This is a must-see that is to be watched less out of artistic obligation and more 'cause it's damn good.  It's the original Road Movie.  You know the routine: A group of people (at least two are needed) undergoes a great journey from point A to point B and, on the way, everyone gets to be real good friends (well, in this case: almost everybody).  The plot is as narrow as the path they take.  You just heard it.  Nevertheless, if the elements are just right (as they definitely are in \"Stagecoach\") these movies are a wonderful journey for the watcher as well.\"Stagecoach\" is responsible for fostering or even inventing quite a few other trademarks too.  The oft-used Stretcher scene near the end of your favorite movie.  It's here.  And so's the \"redeemable prostitute\".  But this was back when it meant something, when wrong was wrong and forgiveness meant something.  The relationship between Lucy and Dallas reminds me of the President's wife and the pilot's wife in \"Independence Day\".  (Remember when the First Lady finds out that Jasmine is a stripper?)  Only (like in Demi Moore's \"version\" of \"The Scarlet Letter\") no forgiveness was needed 'cause no wrong had been done.  \"Stagecoach\" is \"old-fashioned\" enough to still think that selling your body to strangers was a sin.  In this light, it's message of redemption is actually meaningful.         Furthermore, its action sequences (really there's only one) are still wonderful.  Watching those Apache warhorses pitch their riders after being shot can't help but make you gasp.  And the Ringo Kid's intrepid stunt with the stagecoach horses is probably the best known of all this movies scenes. \nFinally, \"Stagecoach\" is filled (literally) with interesting characters. None of them are flat.  All of the travelers get at least one chance to surprise us.  John Wayne is still fresh and wide-eyed.  His character, the Ringo Kid, is as guileless and doughty as they come.  Nevertheless, even this early, he is a powerful presence on the screen.  The Ringo Kid may have a heart of gold and seem even overly-naive but we aren't surprised when he walks away victorious from a shoot-out with three men.\"Stagecoach\" is an exciting, endearing little journey that needs (for the uninitiated) to be taken as soon as possible.",

Steering the coach is Andy Devine (as comic Buck), and riding shotgun is George Bancroft (as lawman Curly Wilcox).Ford makes an already great film a cinematic masterpiece by having the coach pick up John Wayne (as \"The Ringo Kid\"). Note how the camera treats the arrival of Mr. Wayne - it is literally a re-introduction to the actor, who was then approaching his 100th film. Possibly, Ford's increasing close-up of Wayne was only meant to highlight the legendary \"Ringo Kid\" character, but it certainly achieved much more - Wayne is stunningly approached, and Ford's camera clearly loves him.\"Stagecoach\" is extraordinary. It's difficult to isolate individual elements as being \"better\" that others, but the traveling coach scenes are beautifully done, from both the inside and outside of the coach. Wayne's introduction, and boarding, are highlights, of course. The off-coach stop-over, with Wayne and Ms. Trevor conversing in the nighttime outdoors, is equally beautiful. Writer Dudley Nichols' scenario is great, and the characterizations universally appealing. \"Stagecoach\" is an absolutely essential viewing trip. ********** Stagecoach (2/15/39) John Ford ~ John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Andy Devine, Thomas Mitchell",

As soon as the stage car leaves town the beautiful landscape in the background jumps right out at you. Really adding to the lawless feeling of the film, you can tell there not as safe as there were in town. The movie just continues to increase that feeling after they drop the troop escort and the Apaches Indians are there biggest concern. The movie soon add's a love story aspect to the film between John Wayne's character and the prostitute. This is depicted perfectly in the shot of the prostitute walking down the dark hall way with John Wayne starring at her. The suspense continues to build through the film. Its ends with a great battle against the Apaches. This fast moving shot is done excellent must have taken hours of film to put together the ten or so minute scene.

Although this news causes some concern to the passengers they all agree to proceed as they have important matters to attend to at their final destination. However, to make matters even more complicated, a wanted outlaw by the name of \"Ringo\" (John Wayne) is picked up along the way and held prisoner by a marshal traveling with the passengers and this causes even more friction between them as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of John Wayne' s better films from the early part of his career due in large part to the in-depth character development and plot.

The young, fresh-faced Wayne is excellent as the runaway Ringo Kidd who joins his townfolk and the rest of the cast is equally splendid and memorable in numerous, characterised and interesting roles.  The screenplay is excting and light-hearted, though skilfully steps up the tension when it wants to.  Ford also masterly balances the drama with compulsive action.

I'm a big Western fan but I didn't view this classic until last night (although, of course, I've seen clips here and there over the years). When it comes to really old movies like this I generally dislike the music and the B&W photography, so the story and characters really have to work in order for me to enjoy the picture. Not to worry here as within 20-25 minutes I found myself involved in the story.THE PLOT: A number of characters travel on a stagecoach through an area where Geronimo and his clan are on the warpath. The people include a somewhat goofy driver and his shotgun, a marshal; inside are an outcast prostitute, an escaped prisoner named the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), a pregnant woman traveling to meet up with her husband, a suave Southern gambler who knew the lady's father during the Civil War, an alcoholic doctor, a crooked banker and a meek whiskey salesman.The first 2/3 of the film is mostly character development as the group travels on the stagecoach and spends the night here and there. The last third involves an action-packed Indian attack and the Ringo Kid settling scores. The attack is quite thrilling and there are a couple of outstanding stunts.Films like this are like going back in time to the period in which it was made. Although times have changed dramatically there's not a lot of difference in some ways. People are people whatever the time period and certain behaviors or lifestyles will never be respected by society at large no matter how \"progressive\" we become, like being a prostitute or drunkard. It's just the moral facts of life.The film works because it establishes the characters well and effectively builds suspense concerning the Natives. The outcasts all prove their worth one way or another because they all want redemption or to make things right. The doctor may be a drunk but no one else on the stage can do what he can; the saloon girl is repeatedly overlooked or disrespected until the Ringo Kid stands up for her honor, an outlaw, no less. The marshal must perform his duty, but how do you take an \"outlaw\" in when you've been through a life or death situation together and he was instrumental in their survival? Something else occurred to me while watching. People often think that the \"antihero\" originated in the mid-to-late 60s with the Spaghetti Western and the like, but we see the whole \"good badman\" concept here way back in 1939. Or consider Brando's character in \"One-Eyed Jacks\" from 1961. In other words, the antihero was nothing new in the late 60s.It's also great seeing John Wayne back when he was lean and mean, or pretty kind actually.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in California, Colorado, Arizona and Monument Valley, Utah.FINAL SAY: Step back in time and enjoy a truly classic Western.GRADE: B+ or A-",

It takes place in the wild west and there's a constant threat of attacking native Americans. There's guns and saloons. It's all very... generic. However, Stagecoach gets credit where credit is due, as it is THE western film to base all western films on and because it helped make John Wayne become a success. The story consists of three parts, a buildup, and action packed climax, and a wrap-up ending. Without going into plot details, the buildup focuses entirely on character development. At the time, this would be great, no one has seen these character tropes before. Now it almost seems excessive. I found myself bored for a good portion of the intro simply because the film establishes well defined character tropes for half the film. After making it through the character build-up phase the film picks up quite a bit and is over all quite enjoyable. Also John Wayne never said 'Pilgrim\", which was a little disappointing.",

            "content": "The word \"stereotypes\" can be applied to every stock character in this story of a dangerous trek across Apache territory that has so many climactic moments that it seems as though the writers didn't know when or how to finish the story. John Ford made many great westerns and all of them had more finesse than this bloated tale whose main virtue is that it introduces John Wayne in his first star-making role as the Ringo Kid. Wayne's scenes with Claire Trevor give the film an intimacy that is somewhat lacking elsewhere despite the claustrophobic closeness of the passengers on the coach.The cliches are in the characterizations: the prostitute with a heart of gold, the drunken town doctor, the squeaky-voiced coach driver for comic relief, the \"good woman\" (played by the bland Louise Platt), the crooked banker, the timid salesman--all of whom are played to the hilt by the cast in the style of acting rampant in the '30s.The big set piece of the story is the Indian attack toward the end--after a lot of hokey storytelling attempts to flesh out the characters--and it's a stunning and lengthy assault worthy of a much more important work of the director. STAGECOACH is probably the film that started all the western cliches--but time has not been kind to it. Among the performances, aside from John Wayne the best are Claire Trevor, John Carradine (as a nice man for a change) and Tim Holt in a brief but well played bit role. Thomas Mitchell's drunken doctor gets to be a bit of a bore along the way. (I was more impressed by his Gerald O'Hara in GWTW that same year). Donald Meek does his usual timid act and Louise Platt makes almost no impression as the good woman. Andy Devine is super annoying as the comic relief. Tom Tyler does a nice bit as the villain in one of the film's best anti-climactic moments (of which there are many!!)Other John Ford westerns using Monument Valley backgrounds were far superior to STAGECOACH and far more subtle in getting their effects than this one. Personally, I find it vastly overrated with stock company acting ruining much of the proceedings.",

            "content": "The narrative of Stagecoach is very simple. A group of contrasting individuals travel across the Arizona desert in a stagecoach. Their journey is from the prim 'Eastern' town of Tonto to the wild 'Western' town of Lordsburg, via the Apache infested desert. Although the story is basic, the characterizations have some depth and the interactions between the passengers provide most of the impetus of the film. The characters can roughly be divided into the Eastern four \u2013 the banker, the salesman, the upper-class lady, the gambler \u2013 and the frontier five \u2013 the driver, the lawman, the doctor, the prostitute, the outlaw \u2013 and much of the conflict in the film comes from the culture clash between these two groups. Clearly the sympathetic characters are the frontier folks. The group from 'civilisation' are portrayed as snobbish, superficial and dishonest, while the westerners are imperfect people \u2013 the coward, the drunk, the whore, the outlaw - but all have noble characters. Stagecoach is as much about the impossibility of these two disparate groups living harmoniously together than it is about the hazardous trek across hostile terrain. The Apaches are presented so one-dimensionally that they have no character or motivation beyond being murderous savages. They are just another obstacle for our group to overcome. Although what a glorious obstacle they turn out to be \u2013 the action scene involving the Indian attack is excellently orchestrated and exciting, with some terrifically dangerous looking stunt-work. Not quite the same can be made of the final scenes in Lordsburg between the hero and the three gunslinging villainous brothers; these final parts just seem somewhat underwhelming overall and means that the film doesn't end on a great climax.Stagecoach seems to have been a landmark Western. It ushered in a brief period where the genre was treated as a prestige category and it made a star of John Wayne. So its significance in cinematic history is cemented. It's quite an accessible film for those who aren't too keen on the genre as a whole, as it doesn't really focus on the Cowboys and Indians side of things that much, and mainly concentrates on its character interactions. An enjoyable film.",

I didn't enjoy the story that much and got a kick out of how terrible the Native Americans were at their bows and arrows and how amazing a shot John Wayne was with an inaccurate weapon on a moving stagecoach.

To the right go those for whom film is part of building a life. Film as entertainment; film as art.The conventional story is that John Ford brought the majesty of the west to the then moribund western (and thus helping to redefine America); that he helped merge the mainstream conventions of theater with still newly emerging cinematic ones, and that he introduced (with John Wayne) a new rhythm in reading lines -- in fact a whole new posture to performance.Probably so. This project mixes hackneyed conventions of theater (the group of stereotypes cast together) with cinematic contrasts: the confinement of the stage, the quiet of the town (with power lines in the background!), the motion of the openness. No one is evil in this world, only \"otherly motivated.\" Nearly all that matters is better at the end than at the beginning.I see what he has done. I understand its importance. I still think it is banal, lowbrow, condescending. Ford opened the camera up, but didn't exploit that space. That would come with Orson Welles, who studied \"Stagecoach\" obsessively.\nFord introduced a new pace in Wayne's dialog, and he was in this case smart enough to know what he did. But Wayne himself was too plain stupid and unskilled to know what to do with it. That would have to wait for Brando, and then Wayne could follow in his later projects.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

The bad guy was the good guy and the good guy was the bad guy, one of the first movies to do that and makes the audience think and question their judgements of people in general. However, the acting itself was a tad mediocre. There was not much to John Wayne's character.

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939) :\nMovie Review -Legend John Ford invents Adventure, Drama and Western genre in Human Character Journey. Stagecoach was looking like a life theory kind of film till the 1st half and i thought it must be all same in coming time but NO. In the 2nd half this funny, life drama film took an adventurous turn in full action mode and that includes some unbelievable stunts too. I was shocked to see such a turning point all of sudden but then i thought it would have a waste if John Ford and John Wayne Combo had finished it without action. This western touch makes this one look solid commercial blockbuster which apparently means Entertainment and not just serious stuff. Stagecoach is about a group of people traveling on a stagecoach find their journey complicated by the threat of Geronimo and learn something about each other in the process. The Strangers generate a bond in this journey and breaks many harmful social myths and traditions. John Wayne gets into the Macho Western Role suit for the first time and it is nothing short of pleasure watching him doing all the things he's known for. Thomas Mitchell as Drunken Doc does wonder. He as a supporting actor almost overtook lead actors in the film and which is why i believe he deserved that Oscar doll. Claire Trevor and Louise Platt both look gorgeous despite very calm characteristics. Rest of the artist too are fantastic and deserves the equal appreciation. This film was a turning point for Legend John Ford's career as i could see the very next year he delivered another classic and the next year after that he delivered an Oscar winning classic. Stagecoach blends a great and rare mixture of character study into action adventure genre which was not probably achieved in 30s. This is heartbreaking to see this film not getting much attention on Critics website and Movie Lovers watchlist, come on guys give it a deserving quality Tag.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

However, the movie wasn't as painful to endure as producers thought it would be. The locations were gorgeous, the main roles all seemed to contribute one thing or another to each other, and the structure of the plot allows for a great collaboration between characters. Noted, John Wayne can get pretty laughable on screen, and it's often fairly easy to pick him off from the other characters in the story. I think my favorite thing about this movie is in how many different emotions it can fit together in nearly two hours. We end up feeling instances of joy, sadness, and remorse. We end up laughing, gasping, and thoroughly refreshed.",

            "content": "\"Stagecoach\" is 70 years old and is compelling today as it was when it was first released. Directed by John Ford, with John Wayne in his star-making role, it's the story of people riding in a stagecoach through Apache country. Ford shot \"Stagecoach\" on location in Monument Valley, the first of many times not only he, but Wayne, would make films there. I rode the \"Stagecoach\" trail some years ago - it's hot, dusty, with the magnificent formations in the background. And it's a bumpy ride.There are many elements that come together to make this film great. The first is the striking group of characters: a prostitute (Claire Trevor), a drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a gambler (John Carradine), a Virginia woman trying to get to her soldier husband (Louise Platt), a liquor salesman (Donald Meek), a skittish stagecoach driver (Andy Devine), etc. Most impressive is the accurate depiction of the mores of the time: It was considered unladylike and distasteful to a woman to speak of her pregnancy; ladies did not consort with prostitutes. These standards worked in the east, but once you got into the wild west, you were either together or you were dead.The second thing that makes this movie great is the way it was shot - Ford has a marvelous cinematic sensibility - he has large panoramas where the stagecoach looks very tiny against the vastness of Monument Valley, and one wonders how they could ever make it through. One feels the heat, the dust, the wind, and the bumps.The third thing are two performances in particular: Claire Trevor's and John Wayne's. Producer Walter Wanger wanted Gary Cooper, an established star, and of course, he would have been excellent. Ford went with Wayne and gives his character of Ringo a stunning introduction. Trevor, a brilliant actress, shows us all sides of the fallen woman Dallas. She's the prostitute with the heart of gold; she tolerates the insults and indignities, but still manages to help where she's not wanted, to want what every woman wants, and to fall in love with Ringo.Truly vintage Ford and vintage Ford/Wayne, a collaboration that went on to make many great films.",

            "content": "From the moment we are introduced to John Wayne as the Ringo Kid, with the camera tracking in to an imposing close-up, we know we are in the presence of a major star. Although he had shown some early promise as an actor, Wayne's potential was being squandered in a series of forgettable B-Westerns for Republic Studios. Ford invited Wayne, who was already a good friend, on a weekend boat trip to read the screenplay. \"I'm having a hell of a time deciding whom to cast as the Ringo Kid,\" he said. \"You know a lot of young actors, Duke. See what you think.\" Wayne suggested Lloyd Nolan. \"Nolan?\" Ford asked incredulously. \"J e s u s C h r i s t, I just wish to h e l l I could find some young actor in this town who can ride a horse and act.\" The next day, as the boat pulled into the harbor, Ford declared, \"I have made up my mind. I want you to play the Ringo Kid.\" It was likely that Ford had Wayne in mind for the role from the beginning. However, he had to work hard to convince Wanger to cast the star of mediocre B-Westerns in the part; and Republic Studios, to which Wayne was still under contract, proved to be a difficult negotiator.Ford liked to bully actors on the set, and Stagecoach was no exception. At one point he said to Andy Devine, the husky-voiced character actor who plays the coach driver: \"You big tub of lard. I don't know why the h e l l I'm using you in this picture.\" Undaunted, Devine replied, \"Because Ward Bond can't drive six horses.\" Likewise he attacked Thomas Mitchell, who eventually retorted, \"Just remember: I saw Mary of Scotland,\" effectively humbling the director. Worst of all was Ford's treatment of the Duke. He called him a \"big oaf\" and a \"dumb b a s t a r d\" and continually criticized his line delivery and manner of walking, even how he washed his face on camera. However, at least part of this was to provoke the actor into giving a stronger performance; Claire Trevor recalls how Ford grabbed Duke by the chin and shook him. \"Why are you moving your mouth so much?\" he said. \"Don't you know you don't act with your mouth in pictures? You act with your eyes.\" Wayne tolerated the rough treatment and rose to the challenge, reaching a new plateau as an actor. Ford helped cement the impression that Wayne makes in the film by giving him plenty of expressive reaction shots throughout the picture.Although it was not the first film to use Monument Valley as a location, Stagecoach did much to popularize it. Part of the vast Navajo reservation near the Utah/Arizona border, the desolate landscape with its striking sandstone buttes and mesas, lends a mythic quality to the film, dwarfing the vulnerable stagecoach party in the presence of eternal and impersonal Nature. It came to embody the very idea of the West for John Ford, who used Monument Valley in many of his later films. At the time the film was made, the region was still sparsely populated and not readily accessible, making work difficult for the film crew. Yet as prominent as it appears in the film, the location was in fact used surprisingly little. The Apache raid was shot on the Muroc dry lake bed near Victorville, California, and the river crossing took place on the Kern River near Kernville, California, to name only a couple of other locations that were used. The interior scenes of the coach were all shot in a studio, and the town sequences were shot on Hollywood backlots. Moreover, to focus solely on the admittedly stunning outdoor landscapes is to lose sight of the film's stylistic richness as a whole: the beautifully lit nighttime scene in Lordsburg, with graceful tracking shots following Dallas and the Ringo Kid on their stroll through the town; and the taut editing of the conversations inside the stagecoach, with their perfectly timed reaction shots. Orson Welles later claimed to have watched the film dozens of times before directing his own masterpiece, Citizen Kane (1941).Stagecoach received seven Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Score, Best Art Direction and Best Supporting Actor (Thomas Mitchell). Even in the face of the Gone With the Wind juggernaut at that year's Academy Awards ceremony, it won two awards - for Thomas Mitchell's performance as Dr. Josiah Boone and for the score, a deft combination of folk tunes, including the hymn \"Shall We Gather at the River,\" which seems to have been used in every subsequent Ford Western and is darkly parodied in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch (1969).",

Though, this movie isn't exactly like that. The cinematography is done extremely well, filmed on location in some scenes. The movie also takes a deeper look into the class clash. In the stagecoach is a variety of different characters, which makes the movie interesting. Watching the different ways that each characters acts towards one another is socially constructive. It highlights the flaw in humanity, and the inability to overlook such simplistic qualities that stand to separate people. I found the film extremely boring at times, just was not into it at all. I am confused to why John Wayne is revered as such a legend of the silver screen. He was revolutionary for his time, but I think his unique style and approach is boring and tasteless. I would recommend this film to those in search of good cinematography and to get a look into the social classes back in those days.",

            "content": "In our modern eyes \"Stagecoach\"is an old fashioned Western. The indians are one dimensional bad guys. Only much later (\"Dances with wolves\", 1990, Kevin Costner)) more nuanced Westerns would be made. In 1939 however \"Stagecoach\" was a very innovative Western that meant the rebirth of this suffering genre that had grown too predictable in the late 20's.For John Ford it was his first Western since \"Three bad men\" (1926). It was also the beginning of his glory days. \"Stagecoach\" was his first collaboration with John Wayne and it was his first film situated in Monument valley.The innovative aspect of \"Stagecoach\" was in my opinion that it was not only a Western but also a so called \"Arc movie\". In an \"Arc movie\" a group of individuals is locked up in a small space and is exposed to a terrible danger. Viewed in this way there are surprising similarities with a film such as \"The old dark house\" (1932, James Whale). In the old dark house the characters are locked up in a house during a storm, and the danger comes from a madman who lives in this house. In \"Stagecoach\" the characters are locked up in a stagecoach (what a surprise) riding through the desert and the danger comes from the Apaches, whose territory this dessert is.The main atraction of Arc movies usually is the interaction between the characters that are locked up, and this interaction becomes interesting when these characters are distinct from each other. Well, distinct they are in \"Stagecoach\". We have a prostitute, a corrupt banker, an alcoholic doctor, a salesman in whisky, a pregnant lady, a charming gambler and last but not least an outlaw (John Wayne). Were the indians are one dimensionally bad the white men are certainly not one dimensionally good.A lot of scenes are inside the carriage, but cinematographly the most beautiful ones are exterior scenes. Apart from Monument valley I am talking about the scene in which the stagecoach has to cross a river. Or the scene in a tavern in which Ringo Kid (John Wayne) makes avances and later a marriage proposal to the prostitute Dallas (Claire Trevor). He watches her as she walks through the corridor and then starts to follow her. Last but not least is the scene in which the Apaches attack. The use of horses resembles the famous carriage race in Ben Hur (1959, William Wyler). A coincidence? Not in the least, both scenes were designed by the same stuntman: Yakima Canutt (an Apache).",

There is some goofy stuff going on in nearly every frame, I guess this is how they made films back then - without the characters not contemplating much.However, STAGECOACH is still a very entertaining and cleverly plotted film. There are some hilarious moments thanks to THOMAS MITCHELL (I could totally identity with his hard drinking character :)) and BERTON CHURCHILL. CLAIRE TREVOR evokes sympathy and I could relate to the seemingly younger RINGO THE KID (John Wayne) falling for her. It is not clearly stated that she is a prostitute. But the fact that she is thrown out of town and the other passengers ignoring her at the dinner table and refusing to give her a drink of water in the coach indicates that she is a woman of easy virtue.The film does offer us some insight into the attitudes prevalent during that era. Especially through BERTON CHURCHILL's complaining about government interfering in the activities of businessmen and banks and the paranoid attitudes towards the Indians. It was interesting to see a very thin and fit JOHN WAYNE play an outlaw figure before he became a man of the system.There isn't much scope for tension between the characters as they are pitted against the enemy (the Indians) all the time. American masculinity is celebrated in an uninhabited manner (like when one of the men in the coach gets ready to shoot the woman whom he covets because he thinks they are losing the battle against the Indians).The hands on action scenes are excellent. So much more exciting than any of the over the top special effects crap being made these days. There are also some great outdoor shots of grand vistas.(8/10)",

            "content": "John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" is one of the most acclaimed Westerns of all-time. It is also notable as the film that made John Wayne a star.The story is fairly simple: a stagecoach trip is made perilous by the threat of Geronimo and his Apaches on the warpath. Nevertheless, a varied group of individuals is determined to make it to their destination regardless of the danger.Perhaps the film's greatest strength is the ensemble cast composed of a number of fine actors and actresses. Thomas Mitchell won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, but his was only one of several worthy performances in the film. John Ford regulars John Wayne, John Carradine & Andy Devine were augmented by the likes of Claire Trevor, George Bancroft & Louise Platt, all of whom gave memorable performances. In fact, there isn't a single weak link in the entire credited cast.Ford's direction garnered a well-deserved Oscar nomination, as did the editing, art direction and cinematography. Filming in Monument Valley was an inspired choice that would benefit future Ford films as well. Also worth mentioning is the score, which secured the film's second of two Oscars.All could have been for nought, though, if the stellar acting and assured direction weren't in support of a compelling storyline. Luckily, the Dudley Nichols script juggled the movie's characters masterfully, weaving several story threads into a satisfying tapestry of human drama.In the end, \"Stagecoach\" is a classic for good reason. John Wayne's star-making turn as the Ringo Kid is not to be missed and it's only one of the film's many attractions. I'd even venture to say that this may be John Ford's all-around best Western, trumping later classics like \"The Searchers\" and \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\".",

This makes for some interesting dialog and some funny moments. However, that is the only good part about this movie. The film is quite long and just as you think it is over, its not there was more. The cinematography at certain times is actually quite good. Some scenes stand out much more than others. The action and night time scenes for example. All in all if you are into westerns of this time period you will more than likely enjoy this film, or if you are interested in some great camera work.",

The political correctness of nowadays was not even on the horizon back then so the referrals to the First (they are as native as I am) Americans was not kind. The nine passengers are an interesting mix form an expectant, snob of an officers wife to a drunken doctor to a con on the way to prison. They get attacked on the way by some Apaches. I do get tired of almost always seeing the dumb \"Injuns\" just ride after the whites charging into their fire and losing many warriors. They were a lot smarter than that. Andy Devine is funny as the driver. After they make it through the attacks and the birthing of the baby they arrive in town. Here Wayne reveals he held back three shells for his rifle. They are for the three brothers he is after. They meet and Wayne does kill them all, no wild shots here! Wayne then goes to the hooker, played very well by Claire Trevor, and sends her to his ranch where he will join her after his prison term. A great movie!!!",

I liked the character Lucy a lot, I like how she had her mind up and wouldn't give up for anything. The editing was so-so, I felt it was a little choppy, but I have to remember it's a 1939 film.

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939)John Ford created archetypes as much as he used them, and the stature of John Wayne as an American conservative icon, and a movie star, starts here. The story, and the characters, around him are the larger-than-life basis of America and the West--making good in the face of adversity, courting prejudice as well as fighting it, having an eternal sense of humor and need for love.Not that any of this is solely American turf--and so Ford is cruising through the archetypes of any society. Everyone here is a familiar type, exaggerated just enough to be clear for the viewer, but complicated enough to be believable and interesting. Everyone in this little container on wheels (the stagecoach) is flawed, and yet everyone (except maybe the greedy banker) is good deep down. The yearning gambler, the displaced prostitute, the refined lady, the wise doctor, the earnest sheriff, and most of all the troubled young man ready to make his life over again, and take the most fundamental of human steps, settling down and having a family.The movie is tightly constructed and has moral and logical clarity (no wonder Orson Welles watched if forty times while making Citizen Kane). It can be seen as a sequences of distinct parts--the setup in town where we learn the types, the first stretch of the ride, the stop in Dry Fork, and so on. If the story slows up for some (the long break in the middle where they all sit to eat) or is a little redundant (lots of shooting and hollering in the famous chase near the end), the whole makes sense with these changes of pace, which are part of the balance. Characterizations are as vivid as the actors who pull them off--character actors coaxed (and bullied) by Ford to their subtle and not so subtle best--and without too much bland stereotyping (the whiskey seller is a bit thin). The camera-work feels like the best of what you might see in the earlier 1930s in some Warners gangster films, which is probably Ford's visual sensibility even in 1939, when this came out, and if there is a weakness to the movie, the visuals might be it (and if Welles saw this flaw, he made up for it nicely in Kane).And 1939, that year, as the world plunges into darkness across both oceans, issues of morality, tolerance, and, in the end, escape (\"safe from civilization\") are on everyone's mind. Could this film have been made earlier? Maybe not--the public was used to Westerns being cheesy or cheap B-movies. That an independent producer (Wanger) and little known star (Wayne) were lifted to A-list quality and exposure is a small wonder. Ford had the vision to pull it off when the public was ready for it, and Stagecoach, a study of character above all, was a commercial success. But he wasn't alone. Three other mainstream Westerns are remembered from 1939, and if you watch even one other you'll see that the fine-tuned perfection of the studio system is lifting all the boats: Destry Rides Again (a spoof with Stewart and Dietrich), Jesse James (with Fonda), and Dodge City (directed by Curtiz).You'll also see that Ford's contribution is special among them. Stagecoach is enjoyable a second and third time even though you know all the little twists, like the three bullets set aside after the Indian chase, or the last moments of the film, which leave the audience cheering a little, too. It's just that tightly made.",

            "review_title": "The \"Casablanca\" of Westerns",
            "content": "Except for some oddities about it, \"Stagecoach\" would warrant all 10 stars. Fortunately, those don't detract from excellent acting all around in a movie with a great plot. The story in this film is engaging and keeps one interested with new and different twists. None of these is surprising \u2013 except for the pleasant one at the end. But, those keep one interested watching a bunch of folks traveling on a stagecoach. Many reviews discuss the plot, and the film billing tells what the story is about. So, after these overall accolades about plot and cast, I'll note the oddities that lower the film production down a notch. I think of \"Stagecoach\" as the \"Casablanca\" of Westerns. By that, I mean that it has a little bit of everything for the time and place. And, it just seems to capture the atmosphere of the place and time in history. The film has a great cast with an engaging story. \"Casablanca\" had intrigue, World War II Vichy occupation and threats by Nazis, POWs on the run and others fleeing Germany, the fringe area just outside the cordon of the Nazis, black market, resistance, open market and regular business in an open city, night clubs with night life, and romance. \"Stagecoach\" has the Old West, Indian uprising, a pregnant woman traveling to be with her U.S Calvary husband, a saloon gal leaving town at the behest of the local prudence society, a clandestine bank robbery, an alcoholic doctor forced to change residences, an escaped criminal, a long stagecoach ride, and romance. Thomas Mitchell won best supporting actor for his role as Doc Boone. By now, most movie fans would know that \"Stagecoach\" was John Wayne's break-out film, as the Ringo Kid. \"Duke\" had made more movies before this than many movie stars make in a lifetime. He had more than 80 films under his belt, dating back to 1926. He had achieved some recognition for Westerns and sports films, but he mostly was stuck in the second-tier of movie makers before this. That all changed after 1939. He still made Westerns, but most were major studio productions with sound plots, sets and casts. And, he branched out with some drama, comedy and then war films. The rest of the cast is superb. It includes a later Oscar winner, Claire Trevor as Dallas, and Oscar nominee, George Bancroft, as Marshal Curley Wilcox. Others are some of the top supporting actors of the day \u2013 especially in, but not limited to, Westerns. Andy Devine is Buck, the stage driver. John Carradine is Hatfield, the professional gambler and former Civil War officer. Donald Meek is the traveling liquor salesman, whom Doc eagerly takes under wing. Tim Holt plays a cavalry officer, and other familiar faces have supporting roles. \"Stagecoach\" also won the Oscar for best musical score, and it had five other nominations, including best picture and best director. And that was in a year in which Hollywood produced more than a dozen truly great films, including \"Gone With the Wind\" that took home eight Oscars. \"Stagecoach\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" each won two Oscars. These and any of the others of the 10 nominated for best picture would beat out most other films nominated since 2000, and many nominated in the last third of the 20th century. But, \"Stagecoach\" had some odd or nagging things about it as well. The first thing that struck me as very odd was Curley carrying a double barrel shotgun. Yes, he was riding \"shotgun\" on the stage, but they expected trouble with the Indians. His shotgun wouldn't be effective much beyond 75 yards and he is shooting at Indians clearly 100 to 200 yards away. And hitting them. For better reality, he should have had a rifle. Another oddity was the Indians. They all seemed to be older guys \u2013 many quite a bit older. It was usually the braves, the younger men, who went on the warpath. Then, when they arrive in Lordsburg, the stage first lets the women and wounded off. Then it keeps going down the street and when it stops, Dallas is already there. That seemed to be a continuity problem that was very obvious. John Ford supposedly discovered Monument Valley in Arizona and it became \"the\" place to film Westerns over the next couple of decades \u2013 at least for Ford. That area along the Arizona-Utah border is striking. It became a sort of icon of the territory of the West. In reality, most of the West is nothing like it \u2013 or has bits and pieces of what looks like Monument Valley among prairies, mountains, dry and lush valleys, etc. But Monument Valley is high country desert \u2013 with the desert climate to go with it. Only sagebrush grows there. The valley is just under 30 square miles and it lies entirely within the Navajo Indian Reservation. This movie shows the buttes of Monument Valley from just about every angle. It's hard to imagine anyone settling or living in a place like that, and indeed, no one did. So, when the stage pulls into a thriving town of Lordsburg, it's a stretch of the imagination. But for that little bit of unreality, \"Stagecoach\" is a fantastic film and one that generations to come should enjoy.",

I thought the movie was filled with good acting, especially in the performances by John Wayne, as the Ringo Kid, and Clare Trevor as Dallas. Their characters were interesting and likable. However, I thought the romance between them wasn't that interesting. Because they were both outcasts, they seemed to be drawn together by the situation rather than because they had genuine feelings for each other. What I thought was a more interesting relationship was the one between Dallas, a prostitute, and Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), a young wife, who initially shuns Dallas, but gradually comes to respect her as a person.While some of the story seemed to drag, especially in the early stages of their journey, the suspense did begin to build once they discovered that they were being followed by the Apaches. One especially exciting part of the movie was the battle scene with the Apaches near the end. Both the stunts and the camera work were excellent and held my interest. Another enjoyable part of the film for me was some of the comedic parts from Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) and Buck (Andy Devine).",

Standout performances from Claire Trevor, Thomas Mitchell, (who won the Oscar for this role in the year in which he also played Scarlett's father in Gone With the Wind, a reporter in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and the Beggar King in The Hunckback of Notre Dame!), and of course, Wayne, electric in his first moment onscreen, where he twirls a rifle and yells, \"Hold it!\" in his famous drawl, and not really any less than that afterwards.  Good direction from Ford, great scenery even if the film's in black-and-white, and, (forgive me if I'm being politically incorrect), a very exciting shoot-out with the Native Americans, featuring stuntman Yakima Canutt's breathtaking drop in between the legs of running horses.",

            "content": "A stagecoach encounters danger on its journey to Lordsburg. Among the passengers are a drunken doctor, a pregnant soldier's wife, a bank manager who has run off with his customer's money, a southern gentlemen/gambler, a 'loose' woman chased out of town and the Ringo Kid.I think the key plot is not the story of the passengers battling against the Indians, again with the Indians but the romance between Ringo and Dallas, two outcasts from \"normal society.\" Ringo because he has escaped from prison and Dallas as she is considered a loose woman, this is only hinted at in the film. Ringo treats Dallas like a lady unlike everyone else around her. It is a very tender romance and you hope at the end that they will get together but they have obstacles in their way, Ringo is on his way to kill the men responsible for his brother's murder and Dallas doesn't want Ringo to know about her past and knows it will come out if she stays with him. The chemistry works really well between Claire Trevor and John Wayne.The film is about how judgemental people can be if they see other people not fitting into the way society rules. Ringo, Doc and Dallas are regarded as the dregs of society and it is only when the people classed as decent members of society are in a life and death situation and spend time with the 'dregs', they learn to look past their initial judgements.This is John Wayne's breakthrough role from B movies to the big screen. Even at this point, there is leading man qualities. He has a tinkle in his eyes, he is a lot more easy going as a character in this film then any other film I have seen him in.The cinematography is amazing even though it is in black and white. It shows the vastness of the west and how desolate it was in those days with nothing around for miles.John Ford builds up the tension especially at the end when Ringo goes to kill Plummer and Ford keeps the audience on tenterhooks about whether Ringo will survive and you cheer when he does because you want the film to end with these likable characters going off together in the sunset.",

            "content": "The expedition of Stagecoach, throughout which a contrasting cluster of amplified archetypes encounter immense peril, adheres to a more intimate formula of the ensemble disaster film. Claire Trevor plays saloon girl Dallas, ostracized by a citizens' committee of stuffy wives. Thomas Mitchell, with the physique of a giant baby, the countenance of a sopping chimp, but peculiarly dignified, is Doc Boone, an alcoholic surgeon, and nomadic John Carradine is Hatfield, a gentleman gambler. Joining these men are pregnant southern belle Lucy Mallory, though the time's cinematic decorum prohibited Louise Platt from revealing any of Lucy's external indicators. There's Sheriff Curley, played by George Bancroft, with his bizarre headdress of hair, en route to arrest fugitive jailbird Ringo, known to be going to Lordsburg to kill the men who killed his pa and brother. Andy Devine's plump coachman Buck Rickabough, his voice a fluctuating scratch, easygoing whiskey salesman Mr. Peacock played by the fittingly named Donald Meek, and there's Berton Churchill's corrupt banker Gatewood, a grudging incarnation of double standards and bigotry. Bankers were as hated in 1939 as now, by which I'm sure Ford wouldn't be surprised.Standard pigeonholes, but Ford and the cast make them inventive and warm by having them rebound off each other in startling ways. Character arc exalts Stagecoach. Practically everyone in the movie is either ripened or changed throughout the journey. Snobbish Lucy surpasses the biases of her background through her budding deference to Dallas, and even the faint-hearted Mr. Peacock reaps some might. A family man, he's better inclined to make a stande after Lucy's gives birth, albeit nobody care too much. Curley, meanwhile, because of his rapport with that gracious desperado the Ringo Kid, deserts his unyielding service to the law so a higher impartiality can be resolved.And Nichols's script was a star maker for Wayne, delaying Ringo's appearance till the other trekkers have been familiarized and the voyage started. The swift dolly-in close-up on Wayne indicates the conclusion of his B-movie limbo and the commencement of his fame.The conventional Western is inherently chauvinistic because the woman represent a way out without violence, but to assure the desire for action, this compromise must be discarded, making the woman's role a tedious obstacles to the star attraction. Yet Dallas does more than let the anti-violence spirit be provoked and rebuffed. All the characters can be distinguished by their thoughts about her. If Dallas seems a bit too defenseless, she still propels a convincing flavor of melancholy. The carriage becomes a tiny society, secluded in an immense breadth of antagonistic wasteland.Ford distorts the layout of Monument Valley, changing hills around like pawns and rooks to form a never-ending loop of sandstone background. Conversely, low ceilings put pressure on the characters, flooring echoes with deep clunks. It imposed naturalism on cinematographer Bert Glennon, who had to blazon light in from outside. But Glennon makes realism painterly, with the lustrous glimmering as Wayne lights his cheroot with a lamp, or the dawn burning through a distant entryway. One thing Orson Welles didn't absorb from Ford was the 180 degree rule, because Ford disdains it throughout the Apache assault, carriage and horses consecutively traversing in opposite directions. Yet because the arrangement of the pursuit is so straightforward, we're not deceived that they've changed course, and the hectic sequencing invigorates the tumult of it.The Apaches are an indistinctive danger, Geronimo a purposeless, one-dimensional agitator. As the m\u00eal\u00e9e climaxes, we suddenly switch rhythm for an insert where Carradine's character, with one bullet left, trains his pistol on a more unexpected target. What transpires is a striking moment. The spiritual implications correspond with the movie's storybook characteristics: The classic characters who cart with them the backstories of innumerable western tales, the fairy-tale backcloth suggesting a legendary myth. Ford's method is to construct a Wild West of the mind's eye, guided purely by the commandments of storytelling, and then go into it as a voyager, obliging its authenticity by filming compelling minutiae, a sociologist for an imaginary world.The story takes us from a town of haughty hypocrites to a noirish conflagration of prostitution and budding brutality. When our surviving characters make it there, the supporting figures urge dramatic exoduses and Ringo's payback shifts to spotlight, with his looming incarceration and his affection for Dallas as complicating dynamics. These are so skillfully steady that a happy ending feels unworkable, which is all part of Stagecoach's storytelling dexterity.The screenplay devises some distinctive, credible frontier outlooks: In the closing face-off, three versus one is deemed non-discriminatory, but if one of the three sports a rifle, that's cold-blooded. The showdown is only overheard, which evokes the dramatic reduction by which Ford swells to a poignant culmination. Ford affords the lurid diversions of the western the substance of myth, with concentrated psychology and social editorial lugged through human exchanges and fleeting looks. Stagecoach turns trendy amusement into cinematic balladry.",

            "review_title": "The Rebirth of the Westerns !!!",
            "content": "'Stagecoach' is a landmark film in film history. First of all it is the film that led to the rebirth of the Western as a genre to be given importance and attention after it had been relegated to B-movie status with overused clich\u00e9s and tropes. This is the film that undeniably put John Wayne on the map and pushed him on his way to stardom. This is also the film that re- energised John Ford's career as a major Hollywood filmmaker.The screenplay of 'Stagecoach' written by Dudley Nichols is based on the short story 'The Stage to Lordsburg' written by Ernest Haycox. The storyline for the film is deceptively simple. On the outside it looks like a ensemble piece with different characters coming from different walks of life put together on a journey which we have seen over and over again to some extent as a result of this very film's influence on filmmakers and screenwriters. But in a subtle way, the film is an exploration and a study of the class divide existing in the American society at the time which was the time of the great depression. Ford and Nichols are championing the rights of the downtrodden and frowned upon in the societal system through the film. The characters like Dallas, Doc Boone and the Ringo Kid i.e. the receivers of social prejudice are the ones who get treated with the most sympathy by Ford. While the banker gets mocked which must have been a reflection of the public sentiments of the era. In a way the stagecoach itself is a metaphor for the birth of America as a nation.The script is good, but Ford's direction is absolutely brilliant and it is what makes the film. His camera movement itself is extremely expressive. The pans, the tracking shots and static shots are all very expressive. Some of the examples of these breathtaking shots are - the static shot where the stagecoach and the troops part ways, the static shot where Ringo in the foreground watches Dallas walk away from the camera down the passage in a straight line darkened by the shadows and then when she crosses the door, a glistening light falls on her and she almost ends up looking like an angelic figure(which is very meaningful), the shot where the camera pans away to reveal the Native Americans looking on,etc. But the most famous and iconic shot has to be the zoom-in which introduces Wayne in the film. The bravura with which Ford introduces Ringo Kid here reminded me strongly of Scorsese's introduction of De Niro's character Johnny Boy in 'Mean Streets'. These have to be two of the most badass character introductions in film history. The film also clearly is a call back to the silent era. Ford's composition and certain dramatic choices are very reminiscent of silent films.This brings me to the action sequence in the film. 'Stagecoach' is a Western, but to be honest it doesn't depend on the familiar generic swashbuckling elements of the genre. Ford takes his time to build the storyline and explore the characters and make us familiar with them. He doesn't feel the need to be unnecessarily flashy. But when the action hits, it hits harder than the viewer will ever expect especially from a film made in the 1930s. This action sequence which is basically a chase is edited in the most fast paced way with the intertwining of static camera as well as moving camera shots. The shots where the camera moves along with the running horses are awe- inspiring and are bound to get the adrenaline flowing through your body. Some of the stunts performed in this scene are extraordinary. The way Ford captures the beauty and elegance in the simplicity of a bunch of horses running fast is amazing. I can see the influence of this particular scene in films that came decades later like the Indiana Jones series or Mad Max Fury Road.One aspect of the film that can easily turn people off in today's day and age is the way the film treats Native Americans. If this film offends viewers, I can completely understand that. Even though the social politics in the film is something that no one will have a problem in supporting, but the racial politics can leave a large section of viewers cold. This is because the Native Americans are nothing but villains here. That's it. Their motivations, their characters are not explored. Now in order to admire the film one has to accept this as a mindset of the past. But some won't be able to overlook this and I can completely understand that.The acting is very solid from everyone involved. Although John Wayne is in the film, but the narrative doesn't revolve around him. He is a part of the ensemble and 'Stagecoach' is first and foremost an ensemble piece. This is a film about a group of people going together on a journey. Every character either undergoes a change or experience self discovery. But the humanity of the film I believe lies with the character Dallas expertly and affectionately played by Claire Trevor. The heart of the film is the cute and innocent romance between Dallas and Ringo. What makes this romance work is the fact that Ford allows the romance to develop and prosper through sharing of affectionate glances, small acts of kindness and lack of judgments instead of flashy, over-the-top romantic gestures. Thomas Mitchell also deserves a special mention for perfectly playing the role of the alcoholic but kind-hearted Doctor Boone.'Stagecoach' was a great introduction for me into the filmography of one of the most revered and influential American directors of all times. Once you accept the fact that the racial politics is a reflection of the time in which the film was made, you will be able to admire and appreciate a master director at work.",

John Ford took a simple story, some interesting characters and a newcomer named John Wayne and combined them all to create the greatest western of all time.There is never a dull moment during Stagecoach, which says a lot when compared to other films of the day. Unlike westerns made over the past thirty years, Stagecoach doesn't have guns blazing throughout the film. A credible story is built up which makes the climax all the more interesting.This film has quite a lot of humour as well, helped by throwing a drunk into the situation and a driver with a high-pitched voice. Without these few moments of humour, Stagecoach would have been rather dull, again crediting Ford for knowing when to be funny and when not to. John Wayne's performance is in my opinion top five for his career. One would never know that he had basically no acting experience before this film was made.I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are not accustomed to the greatness of John Wayne.8/10 stars.",

The ridiculous screenplay just assembled so many unlikable characters into a stagecoach and jammed them together.

I think John Wayne is really good in this, my favorite of his movies.  I really like the way his character, Ringo, respects Dallas (played by Claire Trevor).  He's the first to acknowledge her as a lady, but Dallas thinks it's only because he's unaware of her disreputable past.  She doesn't realize that he loves her.One of the best scenes in this is the chase with the Indians.  This is real nail-biting excitement!  That scene is definitely one of the most memorable in the movie.Last, but not least, I'd like to say that I absolutely love Thomas Mitchell in this, his only Oscar-winning performance.  He was such a great actor, and his unforgettable performance ranks up with other such performances as Gerald O' Hara in \"Gone With the Wind\", Uncle Billy in \"It's a Wonderful Life\", and many, many more.

With beautiful scenery and music that drives the audience into dreaming of riding a horse into the sunset after the tip of their hat, this film encompasses the typical vibe of dust in the air and hearing spurs click against the wooden floor of a saloon. John Ford pushed his production further by giving us a diverse cast and set of characters. The way each individual interacts with one another is amusing, and pulls out the drama. Putting such different characters into the same demanding situation lets the audience wonder how they've would've gone about it. Each person fits some sort of stereotype, but it's not a cliche. They aren't overdone and are developed just enough to where it was the actor's duty to push the skill of portraying their role. Accompanying the various happenings of this movie was an excellent score. It perfectly set us into a Western atmosphere and never felt like too much. To me, at least, a good score is what really draws you into the setting and into the mood of the overall film. The camera work was done really well, too. They used to right combination of shots and lighting to put the audience into a dramatic setting. It worked really well with the other components of the movie. They made the landscapes even more beautiful and truly flaunted its beauty through the lens.",

Its box office success and artistic merit changed the way the genre was perceived and paved the way for the Golden Age of the Western.John Ford had not directed any westerns since the silent film era, but he sure returned to the genre with a bang.Stagecoach manages to be at the same time an action-packed thriller and a character study of a group of people locked together in an enclosed space. As far as I know, it's the movie that created what we could call the ark genre, a group of very different characters locked together and forced to cooperate to survive. Through their interactions in that extreme situation, their characters are gradually revealed, in a way that reminded me of a theater play, or of other great movies that would come later, like 12 Angry Men.Apart from the character study, the scenery is spectacular and the action during the climax of the movie is thrilling, with excellent stunts.This was also the breakout role for John Wayne, arguably the most legendary actor in the western genre. In 1930, Wayne had had the chace to be the lead in a great western movie, The Big Trail. Although it's an excellent movie, it unfortunately flopped in the box office, and that set the genre back and sent Wayne to a decade-long purgatory in B-list westerns from minor studies with very low budgets. Ford, however, had not forgotten that actor and wanted him for his big return to the genre. The director had to resist very strong pressures from the producers to have Gary Cooper instead, who, unlike Wayne at that time, was a box office draw. Ford would not budge and finally had his way. Wayne would interpret the Ringo Kid in a surprisingly vulnerable and gentle way, well accompanied by Claire Trevor as the prostitute Dallas and a very strong cast. The movie would be a big success and made John Wayne a star.",

This is unusual for so many characters and helps to explain the high regard for the film.Reflecting the time of its making, there is an obligatory fight with the Apache, and the Apache warriors are very much the \"other\" as they are in most Westerns until recent times. The stagecoach is ultimately rescued by the Cavalry. There are also docile Mexicans at one of the rest stops. Awareness of these stereotypes makes one cringe in 2020.The story is told well, and the ensemble acting is very good. The film settings in Arizona and Utah were used often by John Ford in his later Westerns and provide a spectacular backdrop.It's interesting that Ford insisted on using John Wayne, though Wayne was seen by most producers of that time as a \"B\" actor because one earlier Western in which he was featured had bombed.

            "content": "One of the most comprehensive Westerns you'll ever see in that it contains all the familiar story lines, (what would become stereotypical) characters, scenery (e.g. Monument Valley) and other elements one associates with the genre. Appropriately, it was directed by John Ford and it features his first collaboration with lead actor John Wayne, whose role as the Ringo Kid helped to make him a star.Written by Dudley Nichols, who based his screenplay on an Ernest Haycox story, the credited cast also includes (top billed) Claire Trevor, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar playing Doc Boone (a drunken doctor role remarkably similar to his only other Academy Award nominated performance in The Hurricane (1937) a few years earlier), Louise Platt, George Bancroft, Donald Meek, Berton Churchill, Tim Holt, and Tom Tyler.The film also received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, director Ford, Editing, Art Direction, and B&W Cinematography; its Score won an Oscar. It was added to the National Film Registry in 1995. #63 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list.Dallas (Trevor) and Doc Boone (Mitchell) are being run out of town by its more proper residents; she for being a prostitute, he for his drunkenness on the job. Marshal Curly Wilcox (Bancroft) makes sure both make it onto that afternoon's (titled) stage, driven by the talkative (to the point of annoyance) Buck, played by Devine, whose over loud and cracking voice are perfect(ly obnoxious) for the role. Society's Lucy Mallory (Platt) insists on traveling to rendezvous with her husband, despite having to share the coach with the shunned Dallas. Gambler Hatfield (Carradine), smitten with Mrs. Mallory, decides to go along as well. Doc is thrilled to assist the reluctant liquor salesman Samuel Peacock (the apt named Meek) aboard with his (soon to be free) samples too.When cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard (Holt) arrives to tell of Apaches on the route, Marshal Wilcox decides to ride shotgun. On the way out of town, they pick up banker Henry Gatewood (Churchill) who, unbeknownst to the others, has just embezzled some valuable assets.Along the way through Monument Valley, they encounter an escaped prisoner, The Ringo Kid (the camera zooms in, and then focuses on Wayne), who's wanted for avenging one who'd killed his brother and vows to get the rest, Luke Plummer (Tyler) and his two brothers, to finish the job. The marshal arrests him on the spot.Dallas is the hooker with the heart of gold that dreams the impossible dream of finding a more normal happiness as Ringo's wife; upon joining the others, he was instantly taken with her and, without knowing her past, had insisted that the others treat her as a lady, like Mrs. Mallory. She turns out to be pregnant, in the days when showing this fact (i.e. gaining a lot of weight) was frowned upon, which explains why she's so intent on reaching her husband.Doc is quickly sobered up and called into action. Upon his success, he's suddenly respected by the others for the first time on the journey. Dallas earns Mrs. Mallory's appreciation by assisting with the delivery and caring for her child. Of course, the stagecoach makes it through Indian territory; initially they'd had to go it alone without an escort, but the cavalry arrives just in time (as they've run out of bullets and Hatfield was just about to use his last shot to save Mrs. Mallory the horror of falling under the savages control) to save the day.Upon arriving in town, Gatewood is arrested and Ringo has his showdown with the Plummers, with predictable results, while the supportive Marshal decides to look the other way. As the story ends, Dallas and Ringo ride off into the sunrise (presumably, he's to serve the rest of his time in prison while she waits at his ranch).",

It is classified as a \"western movie,\" but does not have as many chase scenes or fight scenes in it to make it more intense and fascinating. Although many western movies have the clich\u00e9s and the stereotypes, that is how we notice them. For instance, the Indian race/tribe who fights and chases the \"western\" men. Yes in this movie it had a small chase scene that actually made the movie good to watch, but it still did not meet my standards because it was very slow pace. The slow pace of this film made the movie seem to drag on and on and seemed like it never ended. But, my favorite aspect about the movie was that of the higher class woman ( Lucy Mallory ) learned to accept and appreciate the help that was being given to her by the prostitute Dallas. It sends the message that even though there are many differences between people and their social class, it doesn't mean that they aren't people and have feelings to. So by Lucy appreciating what Dallas was doing for her, it allowed their differences to be put aside and their appreciation to shine.",

Basically in 1880, a group of strangers board a stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona Territory journeying to Lordsburg, New Mexico Territory, the travellers are ordinary at first glance. They include prostitute Dallas (Claire Trevor) driven away from town, alcoholic doctor Doc Josiah Boone (Oscar winning Thomas Mitchell), pregnant Mrs. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) travelling to see her cavalry officer husband, and whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek). The stagecoach driver Buck Rickabaugh (Andy Devine) is told by Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft) that his normal shotgun guard has gone searching for fugitive the Ringo Kid, who has vowed to avenge the deaths of his father and brother, killed by Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler), so the marshal rides along as guard. U.S. cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard (Tim Holt) informs the group that Geronimo and his Apaches are on the warpath as they set out, they pick up two more passengers, gambler and Southern gentleman Hatfield (John Carradine), and banker Ellsworth Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), who has embezzled $50,000 from his bank. Along the way they come across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), although they are friends Curly takes him into custody, as the trip goes on Ringo comes to strongly like Dallas. The stage reaches the Dry Fork, and the expected cavalry detachment has gone to Apache Wells, Buck wants to turn back, but Curly demands a vote, only Buck and Peacock objects and they proceed on to Apache Wells. They stop only for lunch, and find out more about each other, and on arrival Mrs. Mallory faints hearing that her husband has been wounded in battle, then she goes into labour, Doc Boone assists delivery, and Dallas emerges holding the healthy baby girl, later that night Dallas is asked by Ringo to marry him, she does not answer immediately, but agrees the next morning. There are signals of an oncoming Apache attack, so the passengers return to the coach to avoid any encounters, they reach Lee's Ferry, Ringo is released from his handcuffs to assist helping with logs to float the stagecoach across the river, all the sudden Apaches set upon them, there is a long chase, Peacock and Buck are hit, and Hatfield is fatally wounded, but the 6th U.S. cavalry arrive and rescue the group. The stagecoach finally arrives Lordsburg, the local sheriff arrests Gatewood, Mrs. Mallory is told her husband's wound is not serious, she and Dallas reconcile, Dallas asks Ringo not to seek vengeance against the Plummers, but he is determined to settle matters, Curly lets him go and gives him his gun. A shootout ensues, Ringo dispatches Luke and his two brothers, he returns and expects Curly to put him in jail, however he is allowed to board a wagon and \"escape\" with Dallas, with Curly and Doc laughing as the horses get moving. Also starring Chris-Pin Martin as Chris. Wayne became a big star following his great noble performance in this film, and Mitchell does give a great award winning performance as the drunk doctor, the film has only a few locations, the most frequent being inside the title transportation, but there are sweeping landscapes, including the iconic Monument Valley, the characters are good and the action sequences grab your attention, it is a most worthwhile and splendid western. It won the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!",

I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of westerns in any capacity, so if you are a fan disregard what I have to say. It's not because the movie is old, there are many even older than Stagecoach that are better. This film was just too dry. I'd estimate the entire first half of the movie is almost exclusively dialogue with very little happening. 6 (?) strangers, few of whom are endearing to the viewer (I'm looking at you, Lucy Mallory), embark on a stagecoach journey to a near-by town but get derailed along the way. With much of the movie being strictly dialogue I found myself unable to become interested in what was going on. You may say I'm just a naive youth who doesn't appreciate the genius behind this particular film and don't respect the original's, and we as audiences have been spoiled cinematically with flashy, over the top films of recent making it hard for us to enjoy simple old goodness like stagecoach. That isn't true, I just cannot force myself to sit and watch 6 people talk without interest. Many of the characters were flat, predictable people (I'm looking at you, Andy Devine, or Buck) and the comic relief felt so incredible forced and dry. There are redeeming qualities, however, as Doc Boone surprises us all with a very nice and insightful piece of food for thought toward the end of the film. Overall, this movie does not work without John Wayne, he is the only one who was able to keep me remotely interested, as he draws energy and life into his part. THE MOVIE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT JOHN WAYNE. Sorry for yelling, I just wanted to make that clear. If you can tolerate 6 people talking for an hour before things start to happen, giddy'up.

            "content": "Some actors find stardom right out of the chute. Some toil for years before making a name for themselves. John Wayne, one of the biggest movie stars of all time, falls into the toil category. He made dozens of pictures (many of them in the silent era) before finally breaking out with a star turn in director John Ford's influential western Stagecoach.The story is rather simple. The Ringo Kid (Wayne) joins an eclectic group of people travelling from Arizona to New Mexico by horse and buggy through Monument Valley in 1880. In a racist shot at Native Americans, Apaches (including superstar Geronimo) are always on the warpath, even gunning for our stagecoach filled with these ordinary people. After the cavalry detachment pulls away its escort, the coach is ripe for Indian attack.Claire Trevor has an important role as Dallas, the prostitute kicked out of the town in Arizona for *horrors* being immoral. Fortunately, she makes a friend in the Ringo Kid. She's also got just as much character as any other person on the stagecoach. Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar for his supporting role as an alcoholic doc. John Carradine also shows up as an enigmatic Southerner.Ford's direction is outstanding as he shoots his first sound western and also sets the story in his beloved Monument Valley. The camera-work and camera placement are wonderful, especially considering how much of this picture was shot on location. Why the film would rank 63rd on the American Film Institute's 1998 Top List and then not make the 2007 version at all is a mystery. Maybe it isn't one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's awfully solid. Just go back in time and ask The Duke. He'd tell you it was one of the most important things to ever happen to him.If this snapshot review tickled your interest, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the \"Podcasts\" section for our 26-minute Stagecoach 'cast...and many others.

In this particular movie, his acting was not the best and it is apparent in the scene where his character reveals that his brother was murdered.Aside from the few things I found disagreeable, the rest of the film was quite good. There is a solid dynamic between the characters that definitely draws the viewer in. John Ford makes excellent use of lighting throughout the film to set a tone with in particular scenes. Also, the stunt work in the Indian chase scene was fabulous. Knowing how dangerous the stunts were makes the scene even more memorable. Overall this film is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "John Ford's immortal western classic \"Stagecoach\" made a movie star out of John Wayne. Ford and Wayne began a long collaboration with this Ernst Haycox inspired oater and made several memorable westerns, among them \"Fort Apache,\" \"Rio Grande,\" \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,\" \"The Horse Soldiers,\" and \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\" When you watch this stark but impressionable horse opera, the first thing that you notice is the ensemble cast. John Wayne's Ringo Kid isn't the only character in \"Stagecoach\"; he is surrounded by other strong characters. One of the strongest characters is a drunken doctor; Thomas Mitchell played this role so well that he received an Oscar for his performance. The Dudley Nichols screenplay concerns the passage of a stagecoach through Indian infested terrain when Geronimo is on the warpath. Each passenger is a character. Doc Boone is being run out of Tonto by his landlady, while a prostitute Dallas is being escorted to the coach with a group of prudish women. A banker is leaving town because he has to attend a meeting out of town; in reality, the pompous banker is fleeing because his books are not balanced. Finally, after they leave town, the coach comes across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) who has broken out of prison to kill Luke Plummer (Tim Tyler) and his two brothers who murdered the Kid's father. \"Stagecoach\" is about relationships. The Ringo Kid cannot take his eyes off Dallas. Laan Curly cannot take his eyes off Ringo. A genteel Southern gambler in a white hat named Hatfield is drawn to protect Mrs. Mallory while she awaits the return of her cavalry officer husband. Doc Boone buddies up to a whiskey drummer. In effect, the stagecoach becomes a microcosm of society. The scene where the Apaches pursue the stagecoach across a dry lake is exciting stuff.",

            "content": "The film \"Stagecoach\" from 1939 was the first Western film to truly become popularized. During this period the main genre of films were the Screwball comedy and of course the new Techna color films. Westerns during this time were commonly characterized as 'B' rated films that never really took off. The director John Ford knew in order to make this work he wanted John Wayne and good directing skills and would hope for the best. his theory worked and in turn created a new basis for the western genre. Stagecoach is a movie with action, drama and suspense; 3 main characteristic to make any good movie. It is based on a stagecoach with an array of different social classes and personalities all together with one similar goal; They just wanted to make it safely to their destinations. The passengers were earlier made aware that Jeranamo was planning for an attack, and where they were going was right in the middle of where the Indians were thought to be hiding. John Waynes character Ringo Kid is a wanted man. Along the way he is picked up by the sheriff and forced to travel as a prisoner on the stagecoach. The way the movie is written and brought together with each persons conflicting personalities was genius. It helped to create dynamics in the movie that other wise may never have been expressed. The most irony during the film is when Ringo turns into the saving grace when Geronimo does decide to attack. It is at this point that everyones opinion of each other come to a realization; No matter where they come from or where their lives will lead it is that moment that they're all equal and dependent on one another. Stagecoach is a movie that will be enjoyed by those that like westerns, but still appreciated by those that they don't.",

The film is full of great, well rounded characters who all have their own personal journeys. The cinematography is breathtaking for its time and the action is suspenseful and exciting. The story is full of great moments and I only wish it was longer so we could learn more about the characters. I've seen this story redone several times, most notably in \"The Hateful Eight\". That's a good film, and adds a nice mystery element, but it pales in comparison to \"Stagecoach\"\nGranted, the depictions of native Americans in the film leave something to be desired, and some of the less important characters lack character development (even though all the characters have their fair share of it). This does not deter the movie though. The acting is excellent. John Wayne, John Carradine, Claire Trevor and Thomas Mitchell are deserving of much praise. This movie is a top notch western still after all these years and is up there with the best of the genre. It also lives up to Ford's other masterpieces like \"The Searchers\" and \"The Grapes of Wrath\"\n1939 is called by many historians and critics as the greatest year for film. This film is a great starter for people who want to watch westerns and get into classic movies. A timeless, must see classic.",

            "content": ". . . in the past 12 months, I decided to re-watch STAGECOACH prior to the firing of the first artillery rounds of America's Second Civil War (sometime Wednesday morning)--in case the Grid goes down--to see if it was half as good as THE HATEFUL EIGHT. What a letdown! It turns out that STAGECOACH was shot on the cheap in Black & White, even though GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ were released in glorious color that same year (1939). Speaking of shot, I did NOT remember the final shootout scene BECAUSE THE SHOTS ARE ONLY HEARD, NOT SEEN (director John Ford probably could not figure out how to show blood in monochrome). Perhaps the best thing that can be said about STAGECOACH is that it may be Mr. Ford's most honest movie. The \"Ringo Kid\" (Wayne)'s heart's desire is to marry a hooker and move to Mexico (in Real Life, Il Duce's second wife WAS a Mexican hooker). Ex-Confederate soldier Hatfield is full of pompous Chivalry but devoid of Brains--he saves only ONE bullet to murder Lucy, totally forgetting about Lucy's daughter. As in Real Life with Today's pipeline scandals, the Native Americans get it Right, gunning down Hatfield BEFORE he can slay Lucy (and doom her kid to a grisly death). Finally, the Art of the Deal Businessman--Elsworth H. Gatewood--gets the just desserts ALL One Per Centers (Then and Now) so richly deserve, being hauled off to the clink for his financial shenanigans, as Donald J. Duck will be one day.",

            "review_title": "The first for Ford and The Duke",
            "content": "Imagine you are 25 year old Orson Welles watching this one more than three dozen times as he works on his masterpiece Citizen Kane. Such is the influence of John Ford's Stagecoach. It may or may not be the greatest western film of all-time (a matter of preference), but it's inarguably the most influential.More than 75 years later, it's difficult to imagine a time when John Ford and John Wayne weren't joined at the swaggering hip making movies together. By 1939, Ford had won an Oscar for The Informer (1935) but had not directed a western in more than a decade, while John Wayne's career to this point consisted of bit parts and B movies. The \"firsts\" here include: John Ford's first movie with John Wayne, the first movie filmed in Monument Valley, Ford's first talkie-western, and the first starring role in a major motion picture for John Wayne Probably the most iconic star-making screen ever is that first shot of John Wayne twirling and cocking the rifle as the camera zooms in on his face. It should be noted that The Duke was wearing his own cowboy hat \u2013 one he would wear in many movies over the years (until it finally was in such bad shape, it was placed in a glass display case at Mr. Wayne's home).Dudley Nichols (Oscar winning screenwriter for Ford's The Informer) adapted the original story from Ernest Haycox into a screenplay that examines the early attempts at transitioning the \"wild west\" into a more civilized society. Social commentary abounds as several characters from disparate background are crammed into a confined space (the titular stagecoach) for an extended period of time. Some viewers may complain about the use of clich\u00e9s, but in fairness, what we have come to label as clich\u00e9, was anything but at the time.Adding their own special touch to the wide range of characters were some of the finest actors of the era. Claire Trevor was the best known star in the cast at the time, and she plays Dallas, the good-hearted woman whose past/profession causes her to be treated as an outcast by most in the group. Ms. Trevor would go on to win a Best Supporting Oscar for Key Largo (1948). Donald Meek plays the meek travelling salesman ironically named Peacock. John Carradine is perfectly cast as Hatfield, the elegant gambler carrying a secret. Drunken Doc Boone is played by Thomas Mitchell, who many will recognize as Uncle Billy in It's a Wonderful Life. Louise Platt plays Lucy Mallory, the pregnant wife who is on a mission to reunite with her soldier husband. The villainous banker is played with gusto by Berton Churchill, and Law Enforcement is represented by Marshal Wilcox, played by George Bancroft. The stagecoach is driven by the great Andy Devine (as Buck). Mr. Devine manages to create a bit of comedy relief by the use of his trademark high-pitched raspy voice. Other notables making an appearance are Tom Tyler (once known as the strongest man in America), Woody Strode (one of the saloon patrons) who is known best for his fight scene in Spartacus; and Tim Holt who brings the charging Calvary to the rescue, and is best known as one of the prospectors in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948).Of course, it's John Ford and John Wayne who draw most of the attention when this film is discussed. The Duke plays bad-guy-with-a-heart Ringo Kid, and gets to show a pretty full spectrum of machismo, humanity, dignity and sensitivity. His extraordinary physical screen presence led him to the top of the film world with roles in some of the most popular films over the next 4 decades, capped by a Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969). John Ford won 4 Best Director Oscars (plus two special Oscars for his WWII documentaries): The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green was my Valley (1942), and The Quiet Man (1952).Two others deserve special mention. The movie provides Stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt the opportunity for what may be his best and most daring stunt \u2013 leaping onto the moving stagecoach and its 6 horse team and then sliding down under the carriage and out the back \u0085 all at breakneck speed! It's fascinating to watch, and in this age of computerized special effects, it demands a level of awe and respect. While this film provided the first on screen glimpse of Monument Valley, it was Cinematographer Bert Glennon who figured out the best ways to take advantage of this breathtaking setting. Mr. Glennon was nominated for 3 Oscars (including Stagecoach), and was a frequent collaborator with both John Ford and Cecil B DeMille.Stagecoach received 7 Oscar nominations including wins for Thomas Mitchell as Best Supporting Actor and Best Music (score) for Richard Hagerman, W Frank Harling, John Leipold, Leo Shuken. The other nominees were for Best Picture, Best Director (Ford), Best Cinematographer, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. 1939 is considered by many to be the best ever year for movies: Gone with the Wind; Mr Smith Goes to Washington; Wuthering Heights; Goodbye, Mr Chips; Ninotchka; The Wizard of Oz; Of Mice and Men; The Hunchback of Notre Dame; Young Mr Lincoln.Despite being the first movie to feature the \"dead man's hand\" \u2013 a pair of black aces and a pair of black eights (the hand Wild Bill Hickok was holding when he was gunned down), this film continues to live on in cinematic lore and is often included in the discussion of the best westerns of all-time. It was a joyful experience to finally get to see this one on the big screen in a theatre setting. It's clear how this film elevated the western genre, and it certainly deserved recognition by the National Film Registry in 1995.",

The passengers are made up of a unique group of individuals with various careers and ambitions. Meanwhile, the stagecoach will face various perils where one of the younger passengers, Ringo Kid, will need to keep everyone safe.This movie is directed by John Ford (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) and stars John Wayne (Rio Lobo), Claire Trevor (Key Largo), John Carradine (The Ten Commandments), Andy Devine (The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) and George Bancroft (Mr. Deeds Goes to Town).This cast and group of characters are very entertaining. This is a classic cowboys and Indians storyline that is fairly straightforward but still fun to watch unfold. The character interactions and chemistry amongst the cast is perfect with some characters easy to root for and some you're okay with the Indians getting. The action scenes are awesome and the shootouts are legendary. The ending chase is unbelievable and the Indians attacking the stagecoach is well shot with some unbelievable stunt man sequences, especially for the era. The sets, props and backdrops are all perfect for this tale.Overall, this is an iconic addition to the western genre that is an absolute must see.

            "content": "In some ways this hasn't aged well, particularly in the \"classic\" but racist and antiquated trope of \"civilized man\" versus \"savages.\" To be very frank, I also continue to believe that the cast member who today is most well known was, actually, in no way a good actor; there were a few times while watching that I couldn't help but laugh because the disparity between the acting of John Wayne, and that of his co-stars, is vast. Enjoyable as it is, I recognize why it's regarded well, but there are also many other westerns that are far more deserving of one's time.Still, while 'Stagecoach' isn't perfect or essential, it's still really good and worth checking out. Between the varied cast of characters - all with their own values, motivations, and difficulties - and the trials of the journey across the plains, there's considerable value in the narrative. The plot sustains minor tension as personalities clash and the path forward doesn't go quite as anticipated. To that point: in addition to these two specific elements of the storytelling, and excepting Wayne, the other great strength of the movie is in the cast. Everyone (else) involved gives fine performances of range and nuance, bringing their roles to life with gratifying spirit and dexterity. It's always a joy to see Andy Devine in a film, as his distinctive timbre lends to a bit of comic relief, and Claire Trevor is a sturdy anchor for the picture as troubled and unfairly maligned Dallas. Some characters are certainly written with more depth than others, though, and as such, it's surely Thomas Mitchell who shines most brightly here. Doc Boone is the one figure who seems to have a real arc, and thusly is Mitchell allowed to demonstrate a greater breadth of his skills than his fellows.I admire the production design broadly, and of course the costume design, and hair and makeup work, are terrific. The carriage(s?) employed for the titular conveyance are/were well cared for, and the one definite action scene we get - though mired in those aforementioned outdated notions - is genuinely pretty exciting. John Ford's renown as a filmmaker was no mistake, and while not without unfortunate indelicacies, Dudley Nichols' screenplay works to build a solid, engaging narrative. Ultimately it's not so gripping as to demand viewership or inspire verbose praise, but even bearing in mind its shortcomings, 'Stagecoach' remains fairly worthwhile even more than 80 years later. Those who can't abide older films probably won't have their minds changed here, and compared even to many of its genre brethren it's no titan, but if you happen to come across this, it's a decent way to spend 95 minutes.",

            "content": "Justly celebrated John Ford Western from Hollywood's golden year of 1939. A critic of the time termed it the \"Grand Hotel\" of the West and you can see why. Placing a group of people in a confined space in a more dangerous wider situation is a great premise for examining human interaction, especially when the group is as disparate as this.The inhabitants of the stagecoach to Lordsburg can be broken down into pairs, from the sheriff Curly, George Bancroft and coach-driver Andy Devine's Buck with his remarkable \"Deputy Dawg\" voice riding shotgun upfront, to those inside, like John Wayne's rangy Ringo Kid, along for the ride to exact revenge on the man who shot his father and brother in the back, who is attracted to down-on-her-luck town prostitute Claire Trevor's Dallas, the posh, pregnant army wife Mrs Mallory, Louise Platt, seeking out her husband before she gives birth to their child and her smooth Southern gentleman protector John Carradine's Hatfield and drunken Yankee doctor Thomas Mitchell who's along for the ride because he can cadge drinks from travelling whisky salesman Donald Meek's Mr Peacock, make sure you get that name right, in probably the least convincing piece of casting in the film.As they approach their destination and the danger amounts, especially the prospect of an attack by those pesky Apache Indians led by Geronimo, these people are changed and new bonds are forged under fire on their collective road to perdition or is that redemption. It's a simple idea and it works, aided by the familiar Ford trait of frontier humour, principally involving Mitchell's quest for his next drink from Mr Peacock's ever-dwindling supply of samples and Buck's cowardy-custard wagon-master, probably not the guy you'd want behind the reins on a trek like this.The moral centre of the film is undoubtedly the relationship between Ringo and Dallas, two losers at the last chance saloon who find redemption in each other, if reluctantly on her part. Their pairing is contrasted with the haughty manners of the gentleman and lady of the group, Hatfield and Mrs Mallory, but in the heat of fire, class barriers are broken down and new dependencies are forged even if reluctantly.The highlight of the film is undoubtedly the extended chase scene as the coach is pursued by the rampaging Apaches featuring some horse-riding stunt-work still remarkable to see today while the film climaxes with Wayne's reckoning with his kin's killer at Lordsburg..Ensemble pieces can only work if the group of actors can convince the viewer of their collective credibility and watching it, I certainly got the sense that this road-worn bunch had been together on that coach for hours on end, Wayne is grand in his first great role, while Trevor probably steals the acting honours with her heartstring-tugging performance. Mitchell goes over the top at times as another of Ford's boozy medics and if Carradine, Platt, Bancroft, Devine and even the aptly-named Meek get less to do, they ably flesh out the narrative in their supplementary roles.I believe this was one of Ford's first location shoots at Monument Valley and it's clear he's at home here, both with the dramatic surroundings and this particular group of actors, many of whom he would re-employ time and again in the future.\"Stagecoach\" then is a convincing combination of a rollicking action movie and character study which always keeps the viewer interested. Little wonder Orson Welles revered it so much.",

This film was rather very enjoying.The beginning of this film was a little bit confusing for me, not knowing which character is which, they all looked similar and were in an enclosed area throughout the film. All the actors did quite an amazing job at playing their characters. The only memorable one that I personally can remember is John Wayne (figures).The setting was spectacular, and made the film jump to life. It helped the film capture such realism that made you think \"wow that could have really happened back then in the West\".What I really loved of this movie and so many others will too, is the film makers making it unpredictable in many places. The feeling of knowing something, but finding out differently intrigues many people to watch all the way to the end of a film.So if you enjoy Westerns or never really watched them this is the movie to watch.",

            "content": "The film stagecoach released in 1939 is a great example of a classic American western film. The genre of western films is the only genre named after its setting. And the film stagecoach does it justice. The setting in this film is amazing, shot in a desert location. It gives viewers a real look at the civilization that existed back then. How the town looked also, how traveling was made possible. The types of clothing the people wore. The different types of social a class that existed back then, but in a way they still exists today. The actors are also great. They do a good job play the roles they have. The actor and actress make the film feel real for viewers. Western films are general not my type of film, I often find then dull and boring. What made this film work for me unlike other western films was the variety of different types of personalty's. Also seeing how these different personalities's come together and interacts with one another. The end scene was a scene I really enjoyed. The way the guy walked into the bar like he won the battle but then drops to the ground indicating that Ringo won. For I moment I was upset but then I realized Ringo did win. I was relieved. I like how the directed set this scene up to trick the viewers for a moment then revealed the truth. It was brilliantly done in my opinion a good directing technique. I would say it was not a bad film. A little slow on the action but entreating the whole way though.",

Each individual has a distinct characteristic that intrigues us while the smooth & seamless interplay between them only gets more n more involving as plot progresses.The crisp black-n-white photography, appropriate set pieces, suitable locations, savvy editing & consistent pace improve the viewing experience while excellent performances from all further solidify the drama. Claire Trevor is outstanding in her role. John Wayne chips in with a restrained input in what's his breakthrough role. The rest are no slouch and the chemistry they share simply works.Overall, Stagecoach presents John Ford in splendid form and remains one of his most impressive directorial efforts. Gripping, thrilling & entertaining for most of its runtime, the film is almost as engaging & effective today as it was back at its time of release and hasn't eroded much over the years. Often touted by many as the western that set the template for other westerns, Stagecoach is worth a shot.",

(If you borrow a disc from someone to watch a movie you've heard things about, it's probably a good idea to make sure that the audio is not stuck in an alternate Yak Track.) Kitses says that there's little dialog in STAGECOACH (this is more than made up for by his continual droning on and on during the soundtrack to which I had access). Kitses says that Senator Joe \"Sig Heil!\" McCarthy's infamous 1950s Witch Hunt Hollywood Supersnitchers--STAGECOACH director John Ford and \"actor\" John \"Ringo Kid\" Wayne--were liberal dues-paying Communists a decade earlier, in their STAGECOACH days. I find this assertion pretty tough to swallow, since Kitses also reveals that Mr. Ford rode with the Ku Klux Klan even before that. While Kitses no doubt is correct in saying that STAGECOACH is hardly a \"John Wayne movie,\" but rather a Chick Flick with a desert chase scene thrown in, it probably would have been nice to hear a few more lines of its original dialog (rather than Kitses opining \"Claire Trevor Blah Blah Madonna Blah Blah Cleansed, Redeemed, and Saved Blah Blah Prolonged Soulful Gaze\").",

Also, the stunt one of the Indians pulls off when he goes underneath the horses and coach was impressive. I personally could have gone without so many diving horses during the chase scene. The lighting during, and shortly before the final shoot scene with Ringo and Plummer was great, especially the way Plummer is introduced at the card table sitting ominously in the shadows.

The action shots and all of the photography was excellent, the photographer was able to catch some great angles and views of the scene that gave you a great perspective of what was going on in the film. The sound was great as well, the guns and all of the sounds were realistic and with no delay. The only complaint is that some points of the film were very dark, mostly inside the actual stage coach; but it's not dark enough to where it ruins the film, it was just darker then I would've have it.

It also showed that sometimes in times of need, your unlikely allies will aid you and prior stereotypes go out the window. The acting was fairly good. The drunken doctor did an excellent job with continuing creating his character and the women he treated, and how she turned quiet and kind to an upsetting and judging woman.

This movie was able to get into people's heads and force them to think about \"figurative and literal salvation.\" Of course the immediate focus to any movie goer would be the plot idea of travel and wilderness. However Ford was able to incorporate a high romance into the movie between Dallas and Ringo.

            "content": "Stagecoach is without a doubt one of the most influential movies ever made, In terms of both technical skill and character-wise. Nowadays the characters featured in Stagecoach might seem a bit clich\u00e9, but the authenticity this film creates immerses you into the fact that this is one of the first examples of these kind of characters. We have the drunken doctor, the gentleman gambler, the good hearted prostitute, the masculine anti-hero & the immoral banker. None of this is very original if you, like me, have watched loads of modern movies before seeing Stagecoach. However, none of the more modern movies are truly as good in characterization as this one is. Every single one of the characters has a backstory, all of them are fleshed out well & we truly do get the idea that these extremely different characters learn something from one another during this stagecoach ride. It isn't the typical biased view of the strong American individual either, because all of these people are flawed in some way, and that is what makes them human and relatable. The acting in Stagecoach is superb, and Thomas Mitchell as the dronken doctor truly steals the show in every scene he is in. Other notable performances are Andy Devine & John Carradine, but literally the entire cast except perhaps in some instances Louise Platt is excellent. The screenplay features sharp writing with an excellent narrative structure because we are introduced to these characters in a great first act, and their development and learning from one another is brilliantly structured. The dialogue is excellent, especially from John Wayne's character the Ringo Kid. There is a scene with him trying to convince Dallas to live with him which is simply dripping with authenticity and raw masculinity. These people feel as though they are real people due to this.The cinematography is fantastic, with many wide shots through one of the most iconic filming locations ever, Monument Valley. There are also a couple of remarkably lit scenes featuring Dallas & the Ringo Kid, and while normally these mostly outdoor types of westerns look better in color, these scenes do make you glad that it was filmed in black and white because the lighting of these scenes would never have looked so good in color. Ofcourse one cannot forget the one scene that made John Wayne ride into the annals of history, and later into legend. His introduction sequence with him cocking his Winchester rifle with the Monument Valley shot in the background, all the while the camera zooming in on his face. It is one of the greatest character introductions ever, and it really tells you the importance of his character just with this single scene. In an extended action sequence near the end, the Stagecoach fights off against various Apache's, and this is truly how action should be filmed. Every time one of the members of the Stagecoach shoots an Apache it is followed by a shot of an Apache hitting the ground, so we can truly see the dots connect in this film. This is a technique taken over in many other great films, most notably in Seven Samurai (1954) where action sequences are shot in the same kind of way. ( Ofcourse John Ford was a great inspiration for Kurosawa, so this makes sense ) A character hits an enemy followed by a shot of the enemy hitting the ground. This simple technique really allows the audience to get a feel for the situation. These days this technique is pretty much abandoned for a fixed shot on the hero knocking the bad guys off without even showing their demise. Ofcourse one cannot forget the one incredible stunt where one of the Apache's jumps on the horses of the Stagecoach and gets 'shot', after which he falls down and miraculously avoids the hoofs of the horses and the wheels of the Stagecoach. It is on par with the stuntman in the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959) as one of the most dangerous stunts ever made.We have already seen influence on Kurosawa in this film, but towards the end we also get some shots that seem a bit reminiscent of Leone's work. The one sequence with Ringo walking towards three adversaries with the high wide angle and the slow walking to one another seem reminiscent of the opening scene in The Good, the Bad & the Ugly. All of these scenes ofcourse once again feature beautiful lighting in the black and white setting. Stagecoach has great acting, writing, characterization, cinematography & action sequences, and its influence can be seen over the entire world. It is not just the start of westerns as we now know them, it is also on its own a fantastic achievement to be cherished for many years to come.",

He'll find it a hoot that a trim-looking Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is able to pop out a full-term baby at the drop of a sombrero. Another bonus is that the only non-Apache character SHOWN getting fatally wounded is the infamous ex-Confederate officer, Hatfield (John Carradine). After the action he saw during the Civil War with the 9th Indiana, Ambrose will not take kindly to Hatfield's mock chivalry.TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse. Bierce is expected to be fully defrosted by late 2049 or early 2050.

            "content": "Along with \"Jesse James\", \"Dodge City\", and \"Union Pacific\", also released in 1939, this film helped establish the adult genre of western. It was John Ford's first foray into the talky western. It's also notable as John Wayne's first big budget film role since the financial disaster of \"The Big Trail\", nearly a decade before, in his first starring film role. At a time when a color shoot was a rare privilege, this was filmed in B&W, as Ford preferred. Thus, the rich colors of the impressive Monument Valley erosion remnants are lost, only to be realized in Ford's much later westerns \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\", and \"The Searchers\".This story, based upon the 1937 short story \"The Stage to Lordsburg\", has been filmed 3 times, also in 1966 and '86. I saw the present version back to back with the '66 version. Hence, I will be making some comparisons. Although the '66 version lacked Wayne or another charismatic actor to play the Ringo Kid, it has the significant plus that it was filmed in color, although not in Monument Valley or elsewhere on the Colorado Plateau. It was filmed in the lush Colorado mountains, quite different from Monument Valley. Also, while the present film fingered Geronimo as the instigator of the Apache rampage, in the '66 version, it was said to be the Sioux Crazy Horse who had gone on the warpath, and the road the stage traveled led to Cheyenne, WY, rather than to Lordsburg NM, as in the present film. Both films have the same main characters with the same names, who ride together in or on the stagecoach. Besides the Ringo Kid, these include: Dallas, as a saloon floozy, Mrs. Mallory, going to meet her husband in the cavalry, and having a baby in the middle of this trip. The talkative stage driver and his shotgun, who was also a marshal, looking for Ringo. Mr. Peacock, the nervous whiskey drummer, and the alcoholic Doc. Boone. Also, the card shark Hatfield, and Henry Gatewood, a banker embezzler. An additional important character, although with limited screen time, is Luke Plummer, whom Ringo is hoping to kill in a showdown, in revenge for his killing of Ringo's father and brother, while Ringo was in prison. In some cases, I prefer the actor in the original, in other cases, I prefer the actor in the '66 film, and in other cases, I don't have a preference. I will say that I prefer Andy Devine as the driver as a plus in injecting some needed humor into this version. However, I can see that he may irritate some viewers, in which case, Slim Pickens, the driver in the '66 version, is also charismatic... Claire Trevor plays the important role of Dallas in this version, whereas fiery-haired Ann-Margaret is her counterpart in the '66 version. Ann-Margaret presents a more cheerful character than the depressed Claire, which helps make the '66 version more fun.On his way to Lordsburg, where he hopes to find Jake Plummer, Ringo's horse goes lame. Thus, he hails the stagecoach, which is already full. Ringo sits on the floor in the middle. Don't know how he avoids sitting and standing on people's feet! Gradually, he promotes romantic talk with Dallas, both having no family. But, Dallas is put off by Ringo's ambition to kill the Plummer brothers, fearing they will probably kill him instead, and if he doesn't kill all, the remainder will come looking for Ringo. Curley, the shotgun and marshal, aims to get Ringo back behind bars before he gets a chance to duel the Plummers. But, after Ringo succeeds in extracting his revenge on the Plummers, Curley changes his mind, as does Dallas. Is this warranted?Barton Bancroft, John Carridine, and Thomas Mitchell all make rather sinister-looking characters. In contrast, Donald Meek lives up to his name as the mousey nervous whiskey salesman. Incidentally, he gained his signature bald dome from a bout of yellow fever while in the Spanish American War, believe it or not! The counterparts of Bancroft, Carridine, and Mitchell in the '66 version are not sinister looking.The'66 film is longer, and includes an opening massacre of a camping cavalry detachment by Indians, not seen in the present film. Later, in both films , the isolated stagecoach is attacked by Indians, who are easily shot off their horses, like in a turkey shoot. This is an extremely common criticism of westerns. The director knows that most of the viewers want to see the adversaries fall down dead, especially from galloping horses. In the present film, they still need a serendipitous arrival of a cavalry unit to finish off the Indians. In the '66 version, the shooters are so good that they finish the job without cavalry help....In this version, the Plummers are shot down in a street standoff, which we don't see, surprisingly. In contrast, in the '66 version, there's a shootout in a saloon, which catches fire from a chandelier Ringo shoots down. This smokes the Plummers out of their hiding places for Ringo to finish off. In that case, we see them fall.In summary, neither of these films are among my favorite westerns. I prefer the '66 version ,despite no John Wayne. Another film that may interest you is \"Dakota Incident\", in which a similar odd collection of passengers, including a dominant woman(Linda Darnell) travels through hostile Indian territory. This one is in color and Linda makes it worthwhile",

The film is very entertaining in spite of being deeply influential.Ford really does direct with a steady and assured hand. The script is pretty good-it's cromulent exploration of several types of people with various philosophical, class and political conflicts. But it is Ford strong sense of grandeur of the environment and the epic Western action Ford captures that make this film. It may be in black and white but it is among the most grand Westerns.The acting is quite good too. Even Wayne is more of an actor here than a star.",

The film tells the story of a group of unlikely travelers as they travel through dangerous Apache territory together. The characters are diverse, well written, and superbly acted. The strength of this film was in the development of deep characters and complex relationships in a relatively short amount of screen time. The dialogue and interaction help you feel for the characters in a very real way. You feel the scorn of the prostitute, the nobility of the gentleman, the aloofness of the drunk, the determination of the sheriff, and most of all the pain and grit of the misunderstood outlaw, Ringo. John Wayne's portrayal of Ringo Kid is undeniably real and heartfelt, and is without a doubt the strength of this film. The story is a good one, if not wholly unique, but the reason \"Stagecoach\" is a classic is the development of deep, and unforgettable characters, specifically John Wayne's Ringo Kid.",

            "content": "This is the movie that most people seem to think begins John Ford's career. Well, that ain't true at all. It's not his first western, and it's not his first film with John Wayne. What it happens to be was an inflection point in Ford's career and in the direction of American cinema. One of several large westerns in 1938 and 1939 that blew up the box office, Stagecoach helped signal the return of the western into pop culture, having languished for a decade because of the difficulties of capturing sound on location, something rather necessary for stories about wide open spaces. Ford had been making movies for twenty years by the time he made Stagecoach, his output ranging in a host of different genres, coming out of the inferno of studio filmmaking a steady, practiced, and assured hand behind the camera (and a merciless prankster and brutalizer to his actors). His easy mastery of the camera, manipulation of actors to get specific performances, and ability to shoot to the edit effectively helps to elevate a great script by long-term collaborator Dudley Nichols into a classic.Nine people climb aboard a stagecoach in Tonto, Arizona Territory, headed for Lordsburg, New Mexico. Seven passengers, the driver, and the marshal all embark for different reasons, determined to make it through the Apache held territory being patrolled by the horsemen of Geronimo. That's pretty much the plot of the film. It's really simple stuff, but what makes the film shine is its emphasis on building and developing the characters themselves, taking nine stereotypes and pushing them in this strenuous situation to grow as they either support each other or rub up against one another.An ensemble piece, if there is a star of the show it is John Wayne as the Ringo Kid. Second billed because Claire Trevor was a bigger star at the time, but it's Wayne's show despite appearing for the first time about a third of the way through the film. He's on the run from the law after having broken out of prison with the objective of finding and killing the three Plummer brothers who are responsible for the death of his brother and father. The marshal of Tonto (George Bancroft) joins up to find Ringo. Trevor plays Dallas, a woman being driven out of Tonto for unspecified reasons (she's most likely a prostitute). There's also a liquor salesman, Mr. Peacock (Donald Meek), a young married woman (Louise Platt) out to join her army captain husband, a gambler (John Carradine), the local banker (Berton Churchill) who's absconding with the bank's funds, and the Tonto town doctor Boone (Thomas Mitchell), driven out because of his constant drunkenness. Driving the gang is Buck (Andy Devine), having taken on the difficult job to support his Mexican wife and her large family.What's interesting to me about the journey is that, when stepping back from the character driven moments that really dominate the film, it's a steady build of tension towards the inevitable showdown with Geronimo. Rumors turn into scary reality as the stagecoach makes it further into Apache territory and they find that the local cavalry has disappeared, a ranch has been burned, and the Apache wife of a Mexican man who mans an outpost disappears into the night. The actual confrontation itself (complete with horrifyingly irresponsible horse stunts) is exciting and clearly filmed as the stakes grow and the situation grows increasingly dire. And yet, that's not the end of the movie.The reason the film is Wayne's is because of that ending. It's all about the Ringo Kid and his personal situation. In Lordsburg he has to face down the three Plummer brothers, and he's no longer just on a single-minded quest for vengeance. His interactions with Dallas have given him a greater purpose than just revenge, and yet he can't just walk away from his responsibility to his family. There's more at stake than just justice, there's the future.And I think that points to what the film is ultimately about. All nine figures are dealing with either their pasts or trying to figure out a path in the future. Doc Boone has to shake off his failure in Tonto, sober up, and deliver a baby when the situation calls for it (he immediately starts drinking again after his professional success since this is no teetotalling picture). The marshal has to figure out what kind of country he wants, driving his action on whether to simply arrest Ringo or let him do his business and clean up the West a tiny bit. Dallas needs to find a new life, even if it means retreating into the old world she tried to leave behind.There's a line of dialogue late where Doc Boone says that Ringo will be free from the blessings of civilization, and I think it highlights something I've noticed on this trek through Ford's filmography. He tends to focus on those on the outskirts of society, those who can never quite be a part of it fully. The most famous example will come later in The Searchers when Wayne remains outside after his quest to save his niece is completed, but it's easy to see it through most of Ford's films. Stagecoach is no exception, and it feels similar to something Wayne did in Red River with Howard Hawks. The men who make civilization possible, the hard men willing to make the hard choices to tame the worst impulses of uncivilized men cannot live in a civilized world. They're necessary for the creation of civilization, but they have to remain apart from it. The Plummers are the bad parts of humanity that can grow into a cancer, and they must be rooted out if civilization is to actually thrive. The Ringo Kid is the answer to them, but when the job is done he's not the kind of man who can thrive himself. Civilization is bound to soften, not harden.There's always so much more to say. The nine riding the stagecoach end up representing a kind of civilization unto themselves, all from different walks of life and backgrounds. There are former Union and Confederate soldiers. There are prim easterners and rough westerners. There are representatives from the working class and the management class. There are idlers and go-getters. And all of them are wonderfully written with a barebones plot that allows many opportunities for the characters to grow and interact. This film is really stuffed with goodness, and it's honestly no wonder Orson Welles was borderline obsessed with studying it in preparation for the filming of Citizen Kane. It's efficient, visual storytelling with a great depth of interpretation.It's also a bit of a crowd pleaser with high quality action and likeable, not just interesting, characters. There's a reason it helped kick off the Golden Age of the Western in Hollywood.",

If you can't enjoy all that, you didn't have a grampa who loved watching Westerns in the days before cable TV.Alas, Stagecoach has much more going for it. It has John Ford at the helm. Now I'm not a Ford fanboy like the rest of America seems to be, but if you want non-ironic, manly action, he's the director of choice. It brings me great joy reading the 1-star complaints from woke reviewers who probably typed their criticisms between sips of soy latte and will never get any closer to gunfire than their Playstation 2 video controllers.In the lead isn't Gary Cooper or Joel McCrea or any number of obvious-for-1939 choices. We get John Wayne - established actor but not a star. And when that camera zooms in on the Duke for the first time, it's easy to see how this movie launched him into Hollywood immortality. But he wasn't just a celluloid superstar. He could act. Check out the scene where Claire Trevor is holding the new baby. Andy Devine is gibbering. Camera zooms out. Wayne is on the far left of the group. There is no musical bed to the scene. Check out Wayne's facial expressions. Cut to a closeup of Trevor. Cut to closeup of Wayne. No dialogue. Just pure magic.There are so many wonderful touches like that in Stagecoach. Many - if not most of them - involving Trevor, who puts across a character completely offside in society, fragile, yet with an inner strength and integrity that cannot be extinguished. Frankly, she stole the movie. How she was not even nominated for an Academy Award is beyond belief. Winner Vivien Leigh? For what? Crying 54 times in a single movie. Puh-lease.Thomas Mitchell did win Oscar, for his portrayal of the drunken doctor. John Carradine, George Bancroft and Donald Meek are all solid. Louise Platt doesn't add much except to be a plot point.Ultimately a straight-ahead film with a deceptively simple story, filled with characters society labelled bad, who rise above those labels to find redemption. Not a movie for those seeking 57 - or is it 58 these days - variations on good vs evil.",

            "content": "A wildly influential western, one which cemented many of the genre's best-known tropes and stereotypes and invigorated the careers of two of its most noteworthy players. Stagecoach made an overnight star of John Wayne, who had toiled in light supporting roles for years, and boosted the profile of John Ford, already a well-recognized director with nearly a hundred entries in his filmography. The pair would collaborate on countless films over the ensuing quarter-century, and had known each other for some time prior, but Ford wanted to wait for the right moment to work together. Hindsight is kind to that judgement.Wayne's Ringo Kid is no angel (he's an escaped convict on a mission for revenge), but that's true of most everyone in this shades-of-gray drama. Stranded in the open Arizona desert, he's picked up by a horse-drawn carriage that's already bursting at the seams with personality. Onboard sits a US Marshal - bad news for a fugitive - plus a snobby officer's wife, a drunken town doctor, a sly and shady gambler, a crotchety old banker and an amiable liquor salesman. In each we see both iniquity and virtue (okay, maybe no virtue from the banker) as the looming threat of an Apache war party grows ever-closer. The Kid finds a kindred spirit in Dallas, a harried prostitute and social pariah, and the two gradually win over the others before their journey's end.Despite its age and well-worn conventions, this remains an excellent watch in the modern light. Especially the climactic action scenes, which are startlingly vivid and powerful. Actually, maybe those are a little too real. These herds of nose-diving horses weren't play acting, and the director said he found one particular stunt so nerve-wracking, he wouldn't try it again, even if the first take hadn't worked out.",

I have always been interested in how Hays Office-era films treated adult subjects. As a kid I saw that Western towns had \"saloon girls\" but no other real reference was made about them. Claire Trevor's character, Dallas, was apparently a prostitute, and was run out of town at the beginning of the film. If I had seen this in the 1960's I would have wondered why all those people disliked her. I suppose that nowadays all ten-year-olds know about prostitution, but I was fairly innocent of that. Interestingly, John Wayne's character was said to have been in the penitentiary since age 17 to explain his naivet\u00e9 about it, since he appeared to be in his late twenties or so. Did they have penitentiaries in the 1870's in the West? Anyway this is still a pretty good movie.",

Of course world has changed in 80 years and some stereotypes aren't appropriate in modern times like using term savage. But I think old movies were done at the time of different views. That's why I rate stagecoach just as itself.There are drunken doctor, gambler, salesman, escapee, sheriff, stagecoach\ndriver, pregnant wife and despised woman in stagecoach during war between cavalry and Geronimo's Apache warriors. During the trip to Lordsburg these different characters experience situations where they are forced to cooperate despite different opinions. I think all characters have their place in the story.

Even though the traditional gun-toting outlaw bent on revenge, a shootout, and a small town sheriff were present, this was ancillary to the real plot: people, like books, should not be judged on surface appearances.The cinematography is artful with the memorable zoom shot of John Wayne and the panoramic exterior shots of Monument Valley which provide an air of exquisite and expansive isolation between fragile, \"civilized\" human settlements traversed by a tiny, intrusive stagecoach. Those great exterior shots mostly make up for some of the traveling scenes which are obviously shot against a projected background.While some of the situations seem to be a bit unlikely (Dallas and The Ringo Kid deciding to marry so soon after meeting for example), the writing and actors do an admirable job of driving the plot forward in an entertaining manner.",

In the beginning, a series of wide shots show the long train of horses and stagecoach traveling amongst the buttes and truly amazing scenery of the American Southwest. I did wish that this movie was shot in color, not because I dislike black and white, but because I have visited the Southwest and know the colors add tremendously to the grand atmosphere. The sets are well constructed with the small, western style town being the foundation of what audiences will consider 'western'.The character relations and the comment the movie makes on people in general is what really makes this movie a must see. \"Stagecoach\" shows how people interact\u2014the awkwardness, the body language, the expressions, and all. The movie is like a mix of the show 'The Real World' and 'Lost' with truly different people confined to the stagecoach together, yet having to work together to survive the constantly looming Apache. You observe how certain types of people gravitate towards one another. True sexual tension and flirtation is contrasted by utter disdain. The characters are mostly all stereotypes in some way or another. It is ironic, yet possibly quite true to life, how the \"gentleman\" and \"gentle lady\" are the most judging people in the movie, while the \"prostitute\" has the personality and traits we are all taught to have (except for her 'profession'). The chasing scene, where the Apache are in hot pursuit of the stagecoach, is the action-packed highlight of this movie. Quick shots back and forth between both parties, amidst gunfire, create excitement and anticipation. And the ending is anyone's guess. Will Ringo survive?",

I think that this was terrible. One part of the film that I did enjoy was when the Indian jumped from his horse to the horses of the stagecoach. He was then shot by Ringo Kid and proceeded to fall on the ground was trampled over by both the rest of the horses and the stagecoach itself. Anddddddd he survived! This was pretty cool. Another part of the film that I did like was the very end when Ringo Kid shoots the Plummer brother. But, the nice part about this scene was that the Plummer brother proceeded to enter back into the Saloon, which makes the audience originally think that Ringo died, until Plummer falls dead to the floor.

It was made in 1939 after all! However it was the film that raised the profile of Westerns and John Wayne. Oh how it could be remade now in glorious colour and stereo as part of a double bill or something.Any film that has a whisky salesman called Peacock can't be all that bad!The stagecoach does eventually clash with the Apache Indians and hence a fantastic five minute gun battle ensues with some splendid stuntwork for the time that ended up being copied by Seven Spielberg in Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981.

            "content": "Stagecoach is not only a quality film, but an influential one. It set the standard for the modern Western, outside of B film level entertainment (both in its literacy and daring- the stunts of Canutt, during the Apache attack, are justly famed), and it made a star out of John Wayne, right from his dramatic entrance into the film (replete with out of focus zoom and twirling rifle). But it also is a great example of a film that, on the surface, seems to be all clich\u00e9 and melodrama, but via Dudley Nichols' and Ben Hecht's non-wasteful screenplay (adapted from Ernest Haycox's short story The Stage To Lordsburg which had roots in Guy de Maupassant's short story Boule De Suif), and acting, rises well above such. It resists clich\u00e9 by subverting it with the performances and writing. There's not even a mediocre performance in the film (look at how often details of plot are conveyed via the eyes of characters). I know of no film where the eyes of its actors convey so much, so many times, and so consistently. Even John Wayne comes across as sympathetic, gentlemanly, and lovable, and most of his 'acting' comes in reaction shots where he is silent or says little. One need only look at many other films from the 1930s to see how different Wayne's acting style was from the remnants of the overly theatrical acting styles of the silent film era actors that were still around. Claire Trevor is adorable as her non-trite version of the hooker with a heart of gold, and Thomas Mitchell won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as the Doctor, and deserved it. His progression from drunk to indignant righteousness in the face of Luke Plummer's gunbarrel, is truly a pleasure to watch, and a clinic in acting subtlety and bravado in tandem. The other Oscar the film won was for musical scoring, for Richard Hageman, W. Franke Harling, John Leipold, and Leo Shuken, yet, the score is really unmemorable, and the worst scene in the film (one of only a few points which keep the film as a near-great, not great film) is a scene where the Apache wife of a local Mexican sings. It simply is out of place in the film. The cinematography, by Bert Glennon, is quite good, especially in the Apache chase sequence that alternates between live locations shooting, and rear screen projections, and in numerous compositions in Monument Valley.As mentioned, watching Stagecoach, then comparing it to later films in Ford's canon, is sort of depressing, because it makes one wonder how much of this film's success was just happenstance, since, such a literate and well acted film never again made its way to the screen under the John Ford name. Nonetheless, watching this film was a pleasure, both in and of itself, and in how it is that rare work of art that forcefully demonstrates to me that even I can succumb to the rigors of habit, in expecting too little from a certain work of art merely because most works of art, in any genre, or from any artist, so often conform to one's worst expectations. Thus chastened, I implore anyone else with that or a similar bias to toss it aside, for a while, and allow its destruction under Stagecoach's ever turning wheels. What's left won't be worth much, if at all, but often it's the loss of something that is the best part of the thing. I think Doc and Curly would agree.",

Claire Trevor brings a tempestuous and fiery reality to Dallas, the prostitute who is looking simply for some type of acceptance; along with her in that search is the alcoholic doctor Doc Boone in an Oscar-winning performance by one of the best of all character actors, Thomas Mitchell. Of course, the one with the greatest legacy started out here as the one known only as a B-movie actor with seventy-plus credits to his name. With one brisk but famous closeup, Ford introduced his friend and favorite actor as well as the man still today most associated with Westerns: John Wayne. Along with the man he called \"Pap,\" he starts out on a journey that would take them to the Hollywood stratosphere.Still, Stagecoach works as it does mostly because of Ford's direction. Here, he does a masterful job of tying all loose ends together as well as corralling all pieces of the plot into a dense and entertaining story. He also makes incredible use of closeups and mise en scene, techniques only discussed but not truly used at the time. It's no wonder Orson Welles screened this so many times when making Citizen Kane; it is a blueprint for how to create so many different emotions with so many different characters. As for the cinematography, it is gorgeously expansive and breathtaking, even if it is black and white. Today, Ford is respected but also tainted for his portrayal of Indians. That racism is shown here, but so is jealousy, pride, prejudice, and social class differences. All these years later, Westerns still have their way with us and this movie from this director are a big reason why.",

Zinnemann and Peckinpah took the genre further by tweaking the story and settings, not the characters.The characters here are stereotypes we've seen in 'Breakfast Club' to 'Usual Suspects'.

The characters were all equalized in the end-the doctor became the criminal instead of John Wayne, and Dallas and Lucy bonded. I loved John Wayne although I didn't think this was his greatest acting. There were parts of it that felt choreographed, like the ladies walking Dallas out of town and the men moving in to look at the baby. It was graceful in a way. The best scene was when the Apaches attacked the stagecoach, it was tense and exciting, even though I knew what was going to happen. The look and feel of this movie was wonderful and I will probably watch it again.",

This was my first time watching a full western involving John Wayne. The speed of the movie I felt was to slow and didn't grab my attention at first, but slowly it gained momentum and had attention grabbing scenes. The characters in the movie where all very interesting and had specific traits that I admired. I also enjoyed seeing what life was like in those days and how people carried out their everyday tasks. The scenes and setting of this movie where beautiful and captured the essence of the Wild West",

            "content": "The film, Stagecoach was directed by John Ford in 1939. A typical, Hollywood western film, it featured the legendary John Wayne. It was shot in Utah. There was much controversy over having Wayne in the film. Ford had been turned down by many studios for financial backing. Finally, he was able to come to an agreement with a financer, but John Wayne could not have top billing as the star, instead it was given to Claire Trevor. This role, ended up being the role that made John Wayne. Wayne portrayed Ringo Kid, a prison escapee who hops aboard a stagecoach on it's way to Lorsburg. Claire Trevor portrayed a prostitute, who was outcast from her town. You can't help but feel sorry for Trevor. Two of the screen shots with Wayne are timeless. One scene is when they are all in the stagecoach, appearing to be resting, and he peaks out from under his hat. The second was when Wayne stops the Stagecoach after his escape. The scenic background, the way he rolls his rifle it is a \"look\" that showed his iconic nature.While some of the filming was very realistic, such as the western town scenes, and the Indian chase on the horses, there were some that did not appear as realistic. For example, in one of the scenes when the stagecoach was on the run, John Wayne is sitting on top of the roof, others are around it, as the stagecoach is on the run, the background looks very artificial and you can tell that it is not a live moving stagecoach. At times, some of the scenic backdrops were obviously not real. Music seemed to contribute to the movie as well. The runaway scenes had swelling chase- type music. The filler type of music seemed to contribute to the movie in general.",

Ringo is treated as though he cannot be trusted because he is a criminal. Both of them are neglected, even though they seem to be the most virtuous of any of the other passengers. The ironic twist at the end is that the high-class banker was the criminal all along. Ringo and Dallas are set free to go live together happily.

            "content": "Stagecoach marked the beginning of a known career for John Wayne. Director John Ford had his eye on John Wayne since his stagehand and stunt man days. Believing there was further potential in the strapping 6'3\" Wayne, Ford fought for him to be the main star of his picture, Stagecoach. John Ford certainly knew what he was doing, as John Wayne proved to have a prolific career in the western genre he would call home.Stagecoach brings together a mixed gang of individuals, each armed with their very unique intricacies forced to endure a long journey together. As their trip progresses, they learn about each other, and some even find love. The Ringo Kid (John Wayne) is introduced to the audience, with a superb zoom shot, as a towering figure believed to be a criminal by the other members of the group. Taken captive, Ringo joins the group comprised of an alcoholic doctor, a prostitute, a gambler, a wife searching for her military man husband, a \"reverend\", a corrupt banker, and an endearing stagecoach driver for the duration of the trip. Through the trip, a baby is born to the searching wife in the unit, we meet a native family with a visit capped off by a beautiful song, and we see an unlikely love blossom between the believed criminal Ringo and the prostitute, Dallas. The travels prove electrifying culminating in an intense shootout in which the audience is treated to a horse hoping John Wayne.Given the director John Ford's immense talent behind the camera, it is not surprising to see such a myriad of great shots in this film. As we meet the gambler, there is a great shot in which he is shown through the window. We see a wonderful overhead shot of the stagecoach fording a dangerous river. There are several other shots spread throughout the film, as enough good cannot be said for John Ford's exceptional camera work. Accompanying the superb camera work, was an exceptional score and sound effects. Realism was achieved with enough depth to make the audience feel as though they were riding atop one of the gang's horses. Also, in typical fashion for a film in the western genre, the ominous music played at just the right time to captivate the audience and keep us engaged throughout the journey.Stagecoach was a pleasing tale of involuntary comradery among very different people in circumstances which were not ideal. It was a joy to see the characters learn and interact amongst themselves as each story line progressed. It was enjoying to see John Wayne in a starring role, as I have not seen him in too much. I quickly learned why Wayne is regarded as such a giant to the genre. It would be difficult to not regard Wayne as a giant, considering his burly figure, but he also commands the screen with his presence in a fun way for an audience. I would recommend Stagecoach to any fans of Wayne's for sure, or anyone that enjoys a story told with a small cast in a confined area. This is a difficult type of film to pull off, but John Ford being John Ford accomplishes these difficulties in stunning fashion creating a visual treat for all those who take part in this picture.",

However, there was the music which performed during the trip, and there were many beautiful background among the desert that I have never seen. Moreover, when the man interrupted the horse carriage after that the camera zoom to him, I suddenly knew that he was going to be the important character or maybe the main character. Besides, the scene that while people in the horse carriage were drinking water, I thought of while I was drinking water in my car, it was quite hard because of the vibration. Therefore, if that scene wants to be more real, the characters should have shown the act of more harder of drinking water. Finally, the climax scene of fighting was very impressive because there were many scenes of interest. For example, the scene that the Indian jumped from his horse to the carriage horse, and he threw the body down from the carriage horse after he was shot. The scene that the man jumped between the carriage horse to do the control was exciting too. Besides, I really want to know how they can make the scene that they photographed from the ground. Nevertheless, I still do not understand when the Indian people were shot, why they fell from their horse immediately ,or sometimes they were shot;their horse went down before they fell.",

Especially the bar scene at the end seems to last forever. In general it's a slow movie for our current day standards, but I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't nearly as slow as I expected. The music in that helped a lot. Which is great as well.Set design is fantastic, the towns are busy and feel lived in. Clothing is appropriate. Action and stunts are incredible during the big set piece, no doubt. Of course the stunts done with the horses make you physically cringe knowing the aftermath. I tried to distance myself a bit but it still hurts seeing it. Gun fights are good too, no infinite revolvers and endless shooting, shots are deliberate.

Unlike many of John Ford and John Wayne's other films this Western challenges that stereotype. The film has significance in what it illustrates regarding social attitudes, exposing the truths and who people really are, and celebrating redemption. Furthermore, this film differs from other westerns in the sense that the epic battle scene is not it's most memorable aspect. A key relationship in the film that ensues is the one between fugitive John Wayne and the marshal responsible for bringing him to justice and inevitable incarceration. After the lengthy, dangerous, and dramatic these men exhibit there true colors and the result is an iconic redemption for both of them. In the heat of a battle against native American attackers Wayne rises to the occasion and essentially saves the passengers from being killed. We see here that he is not a criminal but rather a well intentioned man willing to act for the good of those around him, his assistance in getting everyone to safety is his redemption. In turn, the marshall who appears a stringent law-abiding enforcer sees that Wayne is not a man who deserves to be in prison. In light of this new perception, the marshall lets Wayne go and begin a life with Dallas, the women he has fallen in love with. This exhibits the Marshall's true colors. Rather than the strict enforcer he is a man that appreciates good, thoughtful actions and is willing to reward them. The release of the Wayne is the Marshall's redemption. Stagecoach has significance regarding social attitudes because of the perception and treatment some of the characters display toward the former prostitute, Dallas. In a scene where all the characters are sitting down to dinner a few are disgraced with the idea of sharing a table with Dallas given her past. In the end however, they are forced to look past this when they must host the idea they all may be killed in the Indian attack. At the point the characters pasts become irrelevant to one another and they seem to embrace a sense of togetherness in what could be their last moments alive.",

You have the drunk, the high class girl, the prostitute, a rich man, and so much more. The only thing I even remotely enjoyed about this film was the shootout with the caravan and the native Americans. Other then that there was nothing about the film that was even memorable.

Whether on the stage as Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman or on the screen in the moving family drama Make Way for Tomorrow--Mitchell's roles were always carefully crafted, honest, believable and engrossing.The year 1939 was the diamond jeweled crown of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Books have been written on the subject. And 1939 contains five Mitchell films that represent the art of Hollywood at its very peak. Four of them are bona fide classics (Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Gone With The Wind and Hunchback Of Notre Dame), and and one of them (Stagecoach) earned him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor of 1939. Only Angels Have Wings may have been a notch below the other 1939 Mitchell films simply because there should be a quantifiable difference between the rankings of \"Excellent\" and \"Outstanding.\"Mitchell's role in Stagecoach represents his acting at zenith. His creation of the alcoholic doctor who seems to be a marginal character at first only to change before our eyes into a man of great substance and significance is a major achievement. He invests the role with his basic decency and underlying humanity at a critical time in the story. Mitchell becomes the rock supporting all the characters as they move to the tale's climax. Where would Donald Meek's whiskey drummer have been without Mitchell's stalwart involvement? And surely Claire Trevor's shady lady with a heart of gold owes much to Mitchell's strength and credibility.Mitchell was able to create five very different superlative roles in these five fine 1939 films from Hollywood's Greatest Year. It is astonishing to realize that this assembly of cinematic excellence was all accomplished in the time span of just one year!",

Because everything is very well made. From its pace, its dialogues the fact that we can easily establish how different those characters are, how they reflect society as a whole; its action mostly set inside a stagecoach that's never boring, and even its music which is really good and it deserved winning the oscar - did i know the other contenders? Nope. Doesn't matter. This score is awesome.But the strong point for me here is its mise en scene. The way some of the scenes were created. The way silence is totally part of the tension. How ford filmed that major action sequence that seems \"mad max\" filmed. No really: compare the indian persecution with the chase sequences even in fury road...they're not that different. Because ford never lets us lost in the action: we know where each element is and what they'll do.Now it's true this film doesn't seem to see in a fair light indians, and i didn't care much about the relationships between the characters, also because they are a bit outdated. However it's a 1939 western film starring john wayne. Are we really going deeper into that? The film is very good at establishing their differences and prejudices some of them are accused of. But did i love them? Not much. I cared for them at a certain point. Also the film has an interesting message about \"america in a stagecoach\" but i loved if the film would go a bit deeper than that.Doesn't mean i can't admire for its artistic value: because this movie is a great western depiction with action and tension sometimes in the same frame. There are interesting characters different from each other, and a very firm hand at the helm. It's a western action adventure film that was influencial and it completely deserves a view, being a fun interesting watch. It's not the first western i will recommend, and for a rewatch i would pick \"the big gundown\" first but it's a very fine entrance in the genre. Need to check more of ford stuff.",

The filming of the movie was a new age of cinema with breathtaking shots that often brought long-shots of the vast monument valley to the close-ups of individuals speaking in the Stagecoach. Stagecoach set the bar for what Western's really should be like, and John Wayne gave a performance of a lifetime as the \"Ringo Kid\". Although most of the story took place in the stagecoach, it never seemed to bore me. I link this to the terrific job of Ford of giving many different types of characters. John Ford added round and flat characters while not entering the Protagonist into the film for at least a half an hour in. This really leaves you wondering where the movie will take you next. This keeps you on the edge of your seat while keeping you interested with everything that went on.",

United by a common goal of survival, these stereotypical characters break away and reveal they aren't the people their stereotypes would lead you to believe.

            "content": "Stagecoach can be definitely called a unique and unconventional film in the western genre. It's not concentrated on gunfights, robberies or any other stereotypical aspects of a classic in this type. Along with its fast pace and great storyline it is able to provide a deep and thorough analysis of all the characters sitting in the titular stagecoach running through the Wild West. It certainly is a mastery of its kind by the director John Ford, who made so many fantastic westerns in his career. However, this, very early, film merges entertaining action sequences and psychological insight to produce a picture so great that it should be the one we think about when we think about westerns. It is also the first of many collaborations between John Ford and John Wayne. He plays the famous gunslinger Ringo Kid, possibly the most unwanted passenger here. Even though he is the biggest star of this film his performance doesn't outshine any of the other characters', due to the fact the viewer is able to observe each and every one of them separately during their ride in the far country.Inside the stagecoach we find many, totally different personalities, who embark on a journey that will definitely become the greatest adventure of their lives. Even though at first they don't trust one another, in the process they have to fight together in order to overcome various obstacles and the murderous threat of Geronimo. In order to get to the final destination they need to put all differences aside.In the only, but very impressive, fast action scene of the great Indian chase we ultimately see a clash of all those individualities, as they help each other to survive this deadly onslaught.Because of the fact that the movie takes place mostly inside the cramped stagecoach it gives a claustrophobic feel. The viewer can place himself as one of the passengers and get a glimpse of the mysterious stares given by everyone around. It's hard to be locked for such a long time with a group of strange and not-so-friendly personalities, and that's the general impression this movie makes.Here we have a really fantastic ensemble of actors in the roles, which made them famous in the industry. Andy Devine as the high-pitched and always scared coach driver is probably the funniest person from the bunch. There is Thomas Mitchell as the doctor, who needs to have a drink every once in a while from his precious whiskey hip flask. Claire Trevor as a woman of high class, but also respectively huge ignorance towards others, which makes her unlikeable at first.It's probably one of the most interesting takes on humans as individuals, and at the same time as a unity, ever made. It's a classic western hit, but its structural sense and style is totally different and that's what makes it such a valuable movie to watch.",

This film is shot on location and it gives the movie a very authentic feeling. I feel this was crucial to the success of the film, too many movies feel forced in their attempt to achieve believability and one advantage of shooting on location is that it gives us the most realistic look possible. On top of this it brings us the great John Wayne. AFI ranked him as the 13th greatest male star of all time and that's hard to argue especially after you've seen him in this film. He's exactly what a western needs; a rough, rugged, hard nosed no-nonsense cowboy. Orson Welles regarded it as the perfect textbook for filmmaking and he's widely considered as one of the greatest directors of all time so you be the judge.",

            "content": "Several characters from all walks of life board a stagecoach, bound for Lordsburg. The mixed coach-load of stock characters include \"Doc\" Boone, a tipsy man of medicine; Major Hatfield, a professional gambler and once a Southern gentleman; Dallas, a lady of such transparently dubious virtue that she was leaving Tonto by popular request; Mrs. Mallory, who, given her condition, has every reason to be hastening to her army husband's side; Mr. Gatewood, an absconding banker and windbag; Mr. Peacock, a small and timid whiskey salesman; Sheriff Wilcox and his prisoner, the Ringo Kid (played by John Wayne with effortless authority).Onward rolls the stage, nobly sped by its six stout-hearted bays, and out there, somewhere behind the buttes and crags, Geronimo is lurking with his savage band, the United States Cavalry is biding its time to charge to the rescue and the Ringo Kid is impatiently awaiting his cue to stalk down the frontier-town street and blast it out with the three Plummer boys. Worse, tension arises from within the coach as the different social classics begin to mix. Confined for a good deal of the film inside the stagecoach, these characters create a fascinating community as they gradually reveal their hidden reasons for traveling in great discomfort through hazardous Indian territory.Seen today, 'Stagecoach' may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later movies in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal. But here the notion seems as fresh as a prairie daisy. In taking an ensemble cast on a perilous journey across back-projected landscapes, John Ford classically constructs and superbly directs the maiden voyage of a celebrated clich\u00e9 - with a climax that's one of the great masterpieces of editing and clearly one of the greatest stunt sequences of all time, sustaining interest and suspense throughout. Additionally, Ford ventures into Monument Valley for the first time, and instinctively uses the Western landscape as an artistic, emotional, and physical enhancement for the on screen drama, rather than just a backdrop. But even aside from all these advances, Stagecoach holds our attention effortlessly and is paced with the elegance of a symphony.The greatest enjoyment in watching Stagecoach is in observing how John Ford builds and populates this moral universe, in seeing complex personalities sketched in simple words or gestures. He doesn't squander his action and violence in an attempt to whore for those with short attention spans, but tells a story, during which we learn to know the characters and become invested in them. This is one stagecoach that's powered by a Ford!",

The concept of several different kinds of people with different backgrounds, professions, and personalities all sharing a stagecoach seems like a kind of early reality TV show setup. This was very entertaining to watch them interact with one another, and to team up to make it from town to town. The only complaint that I would have about the movie was that it was kind of difficult to follow around the beginning. It was difficult to tell what was going on, and Geronimo was mentioned as if he were to become an important part of the storyline, but he never materializes again. Other than that, this was a lovely film, full of action, and that was certainly able to hold my interest.",

The meat of the film is in the interesting character dynamics of the members of the stagecoach and the sizzle is the threat of Geronimo's possible attack at anytime along the route. There's some nice character moments here, but I've never found myself much engaged by it. The true gem of this film is the big stagecoach chase seen which must have qualified as the equivalent of the D-Day sequence from Saving Private Ryan for its time. For its time period, compared to what other films were doing, this sequence is more intricate, well-staged, and well-shot than anything else like it.

There is the whiskey drummer named, Samuel Peacock, who's submissive character lives up to his actor's surname, Donald \"Meek\". Gatewood the banker. Arrogant and anxious; the supposed pillar of of any community and running out with a valise full of the bank's funds. Hatfield, the so-called gentleman gambler. A possible southern aristocrat, who's probably fallen on hard times as a result of the civil war. Lucy Mallory, the pregnant wife of a cavalry officer, who is joining him at his frontier outpost. We have the likable, drunken doctor, Josiah Boone. Dallas the scarlet woman, the good bad girl who worked in the Tonto saloon, driven out of town along with the whiskey-sodden Doc Boone by the hatchet-faced sourpuss old matrons of Tonto. The stage driver is excitable and squeaky-voiced, Buck. The man riding shotgun is Sheriff Curly Wilcox.On the first leg of the journey to Lordsburg the Ringo Kid, recently busted out of jail, flags down the stage. Curly Wilcox orders Ringo to hand over his Winchester rifle. Ringo tells the sheriff that he may need him to help to fight off Geronimo's Apaches who are on the warpath. Ringo is determined to get to Lordsburg to hunt down and kill the Plummer boys who killed his family.The stage stops at a way station for the passengers to rest and eat. At the next stop, Mrs Mallory gives birth. The now sobered up Doc Boone and Dallas deliver the baby, and the softer side of Dallas surfaces as a result. She tries to get Ringo to make a run for it but he's determined to get the Plummer boys.On the final leg of the journey the stage is attacked by an Apache war party and is saved by the timely arrival of a troop of cavalry. Back in nineteenth century frontier reality Sheriff Wilcox and Ringo would probably have shot and brought down the Apache ponies instead of the riders. Blunting the attack at the beginning of the chase. Likewise, the Apaches could possibly have shot down the lead horses in the coach team. But on the big twentieth century silver screen the tension and excitement would have been blunted for the moviegoers!In Lordsburg Ringo finally catches up and kills the Plummers. He shoots Hank Plummer, played by Tom Tyler, in the street. Hank then crashes through the bat wing doors and into the saloon, and staggers to his death like a drunken man. Tom Tyler would repeat a similar drunken-like performance when in his death throes seven years later as the gunman, Lafe McWilliams, when Errol Flynn kills him off in \"San Antonio\".Critics have rated this a classic. It may well be; but his later westerns, like the never-to-be-forgotten, \"The Searchers\", are miles ahead in perfection. Ford raised the western genre from its Ken Maynard, Charles Starrett, and Buck Jones, 1930's \"B\" picture existence to a well deserved prominence. He took liberties with frontier history. Then who didn't? He did frontier history a favour by painting the harsh and cruel loneliness of human existence in the new republic, in a poetic manner and on the broad canvas of Monument Valley. It has won him plaudits ever since. And how well deserved they are, too.",

The movie may be too slow and boring to those accustomed to the colorful spaghetti western flicks where a gunslinging man with no identity maintains balance in the town he visits. The movie was probably one of the first few movies with on-the-move action sequences that has one bunch of people firing at the other and vice-versa, on a stagecoach that is far behind its destination.Ford's \"Stagecoach\" has a group of travelers from different walks of life, disparate in every sense, but think better of each other as they travel through the \"no man's land\", the West.An inebriated Doc Boone fetched Thomas Mitchell a well-deserved Academy award.

As funny as that sounds it allows me to watch a western and seek that feeling because if it manages to do so then the film is a success in my book. Stagecoach is a success. Looking back at the movie it must have been difficult to shoot scenes in such a cramp area and in order to have the camera on who was talking they must of had to continue to shot and revise to make sure the conversations had a natural flow. Even though it took a while to find that person you were going to root for in the film it felt natural to me because it allowed for things to develop on screen instead of just implying what had happened. Some may have been implied, such as Ringo's father's death, but that was not necessary to show. It was sad to see how important classes and social status was to the character especially Mrs. Mallory, but nice to see how Ringo looked past that and created a genuine affection for Dallas. I'm not sure if classes were as important in the time of the film, but if it was it was nice to see it challenged through film. It's always wonderful to see films that break the boundaries.

To have contempt for John Ford's monumental, action-packed and compassionate \"Stagecoach\" is like shooting yourself with a shotgun, blindfolded.Post-Civil War, Geromino and his band of Apache warriors terrorize the western part of the United States, giving the Union Army trouble and threatening the welfare of a particular stagecoach and occupants, going from the wholesome but prudish hamlet Tonto (Spanish for \"fool\") to the upscale but decadent mini-city Lordsburg in the state of Arizona.Among them are chubby, cowardly driver Buck Rickabough (lovable, rusty, whistle-voiced western stock player Andy Devine); dutiful lawman Curley (George Bancroft of \"Mr. Deeds Goes To Town\"); mysterious gentleman gambler/Confederate vet Hatfield (future horror staple John Carradine); prim Southern belle/Union army wife Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) whose pregnancy seems illegitimate in origin; pompous, crooked banker Gatewood (Berton Churchill), a barrel of hypocritical hot air and a populist cartoon of crooked bankers then (Great Depression) and now (Bernie Madoff); alcoholic but wise sawbones/Union vet Josiah Boone (Thomas Mitchell, who roped an Oscar here), exiled from point A town by a band of moral harpies; polite whiskey salesman Peacock(the suitably-named Donald Meek of \"You Can't Take It With You\") and socially tortured saloon gal Dallas (sweet, precious future Oscar winner Claire Trevor of \"Key Largo\"), also exiled for her \"sexual immodesty\". It's society, and its conflicts, in a buggy.Completing and protecting the group is the Ringo Kid (John Wayne, out of the B-film hole), a prison escapee Curley's after. Ringo wants vengeance for his father and brother, both killed by the Plummer Boys (led by B-western idol Tom Tyler). Mallory's pregnancy, Geromino's menace and Curley's duty are barriers to him, but Ringo's honest love for Dallas, a woman he mistakes for \"a lady\", keeps him pure and straight, while she's torn, frightened by the truth and enamored by a man who has kindness for her.Working with a tough and tender script by Dudley Nichols (Bringing Up Baby, Ford's first script pal before ex-film critic Frank Nugent) that was based on the short story, \"Stage To Lordsburg\" by Ernest Haycox, Ford masterfully matures the western by twisting the archetypes (Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone sure got the hint) and challenging the expectations attached to them.Though the Hays Code demanded morality and propriety from films at that time, the film's most controversial element is probably Boone's reply to Dallas, who wonders if whether or not to accept Ringo's marriage proposal, since she's not the type of gal a man who'd bring home to see his folks: \"Gosh, child, who am I to say what's right or wrong?\" Saints are not totally clean and sinners are not totally corrupt here, and the main players band together (well\u0085most of them) to survive against adversity. The cast works, especially Wayne and Trevor, whose roles beat the odds by being in love.The story's backdrop, Monument Valley, is vast and breathing. No wonder Mr. Ford returned here for future projects, with and without Mr. Wayne. The climax action's basic but fearless. Stunts are provided and managed by Mr. Wayne's B-movie chum, Yakima Canutt, who has a talking cameo in the film's starting point.\"Stagecoach is forever an epic, a lesson in filmmaking (Orson Welles learned how to make \"Citizen Kane\" from watching this film more than once) and a study of humanity.",

It's a pilgrimage involving all walks of human life which reminds the literati of The Canterbury Tales.  All have a unique past, and all have a different reason for wanting to get to their destination. Monument Valley may not be as impressive in black and white as it is in The Searchers, but there is no better scene in all of film as the one which ends with the sound of the cavalry bugle.

It is just another rewrite of American history, nothing like what actually happened, or what would have happened. The truth is that the Settlers almost completely exterminated the Native American race, yet in this film they portray the Indians as the bad guys, and the happy settlers as the good guys. Again. Has anyone noticed by the way that most of the characters are good upstanding citizens and helpless women? There is a priest, a banker and a blind woman, the first two of which are killed senselessly by the Indians, the directors using every Disney-like sentimental technique in the book. On the other hand, the baddies (or Native Americans, is there a difference?) are portrayed as being brutal, savage, stupid and pretty basically quite evil compared to the Whites.If you want to see a good, original movie about what really happened, I suggest you see Dances With Wolves. Thank God they don't make films like this anymore.",

            "review_title": "A Legendary Western That Remains One Of The Best Of Its Genre.",
            "content": "Prior to 1939, the western genre was primarily looked on as something of a joke in Hollywood, with said films usually being categorized as B-Movies. Many of these films also stared John Wayne, who was likewise considered a B-Movie actor. However, that would all take a turn in 1939, when one film would become a gamechanger in more ways than one. You will find John Ford's Stagecoach, which would become a classic in more ways than one.Stagecoach is truly one of the finest westerns to ever come out of Hollywood. This film was a game changer, as not only did it make a major star out of John Wayne, but it also elevated the western genre to the form of A-Movies. Furthermore, it would also prove to be one of the most influential films of all time, with many directors citing it as an inspiration on some of their output, there's one particular scene (and I won't say what it is), that features some incredible stunt work, which Steven Spielberg would recreate for use in the first Indiana Jones film.The film is essentially a tale of adventure and danger, but what makes it interesting is the fact that it puts an extra amount of focus on the characters. In the film, a stagecoach is en route to Lordsburg, New Mexico, from Tonto, Arizona. Before leaving, the passengers traveling on the stage are warned about a risk of an Apache uprising. The passengers include a variety of individuals, including a prostitute who's been thrown out of town by a group of women. She's joined by a pregnant woman (who's on her way to meet her husband), a whiskey salesman, a gentleman gambler, an alcoholic doctor, and probably the least sympathetic of the bunch, a crooked banker who's just embezzled some money from a bank (which he took advantage of thinking the telegraph lines were down). Completing the assortment are the coach driver and a marshal who's on the trail of a man who escape from prison. Along the way, the group meets the said escapee, who is looking for the ones who framed him for murder. Throughout the course of the film, we are given a perfect glimpse of the personalities of the characters, which are all brought to life by John Ford's sublime directing.As I mentioned, what makes the film very interesting for a Western is the attention it focuses on the characters. Everyone one of the main characters have their own interesting quirks that make them very interesting to see. It also helps that all of them were played to perfection by their actors. In his star-making role, John Wayne shines as Ringo Kid, a man who accompanies the passengers so he can find the ones who framed him and got him sent to prison in the first place. However, it shouldn't be ignored that while he's yearning for his own-self-interests, he also comes to care for the needs of those around him, which make him a very likeable protagonist. George Bancroft was perfect as a sympathetic Marshal who becomes friends with Ringo, and because determined to keep him out of trouble. Claire Trevor was sublime as the sympathetic Dallas, who Ringo falls in love with, and in turn, she falls in love with him. Thomas Mitchell was a scene stealer in his role as the drunken doctor, a role that would win him a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Mitchell's best moments involved many of his interactions with Donald Meek, who was also perfect in his role as the whiskey salesman. Louise Platt was also perfect at playing Lucy Mallory, the pregnant woman who is concerned about the well-being of her husband. John Carradine was also a pleasure to watch, as he was quite dashing as the gambler who takes a liking to Louise Platt's character. Andy Devine was also incredible as the driver, who, while he mostly provides some forms of comic relief, is given some opportunities to shine. And in probably the most unsympathetic role in the film, Berton Churchill is great as the banker who commits embezzlement just because he can. All of these actors could've potentially won an Academy Award, which Mitchell ultimately would. This is a testament as to how great and vital they were to the story, as not a single one of them felt out of place in their respective roles.The film is also impressive from a technical viewpoint, featuring stunning cinematography of Monument Valley (this was the first of many films that Ford would shoot there), particularly the long shots of said location with the stagecoach traveling through it, which are especially breathtaking. There's also the exciting climatic chase scene in which the coach is attacked by Indians, which makes for one of the best chase sequences in any film. In regards to the portrayals of Native Americans in this film, it's important to remember that this was acceptable for the time the film was made. While it might not be viewed as acceptable today, it was perfectly acceptable back then.On a side note, while he was preparing for Citizen Kane, Orson Welles watched this film over 40 times in attempting to prep himself. At another point, when he was once asked who his three favorite directors were, and he replied: \"John Ford, John Ford, and John Ford.\" When someone like Orson Welles gives praise, that is as big an honor as one could hope to receive. And I agree with that, as John Ford was a master of cinema. Ultimately, Stagecoach is a revolutionary experience that shouldn't be overlooked, as not only did it help to make the career of John Wayne, one of the most iconic actors in film history, but it also revolutionized a genre and became a game changer for cinema in the long run.",

I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and the hour and a half of it went by so fast that I didn't want it to be over when it was. The editing was so excellent that the whole movie flowed together very well. The group of people that were thrown together in the stagecoach: the prostitute, the alcoholic doctor, the whiskey salesman, and the woman going to find her husband was such an odd mix of people. But that mix of people worked really well together, and the fact that Ringo (Wayne) fell in love with Dallas (Claire Trevor), the prostitute made the story even more so amusing. I can't say that I am a fan of westerns yet, but I did enjoy this well done movie.",

What i enjoyed most about this film was the amount and variety of well played characters. Each one was played to perfection and held a strong role in the film. Whether it was a round character or even a flat one, they all reflected off of the main plot of the story. The idea of the social ranking was often brought up in the film and but to an extent that almost felt normal.

It has a good story, but it is much more than that. There was a remake done in 1966 and while it was well done with good actors turning in good performances I was disappointed in it. Of course this was the breakout movie for John Wayne. It is strange to think he was in about 70 films before this one made him a star. He plays the Ringo Kid, a sympathetic character in this film. A disparate group of passengers wind up taking a stagecoach with an army escort due to reports of Indian trouble. The calvary is actually looking to meet up with another group of soldiers though and parts company with the stage about halfway on the journey. There is a crooked bank employee who has stolen money with him, a drunken doctor and a saloon girl who have been forced to leave town, a liquor salesman, a southern gentleman gambler, a pregnant lady, a Marshal riding shotgun and the stagecoach driver on the stage. The crooked banker is in a hurry to reach his destination but is continually frustrated by circumstances. There is a lot of interesting give and take among the different characters. Indians attack the coach during the second half of the trip. Thats as much as I will say about the plot. I heartily recommend this movie. It is a classic and should be seen for that reason alone.

She was driven out of town because she was a prostitute, and you know how everyone dislikes them. However, even being one, she had a heart full of gold. Mrs. Mallory, who didn't particularly like her, Dallas helped anyway when it came to delivering and taking care of her baby when she was unable to. Besides Dallas, we had Ringo the supposed \"criminal\" who ended up being a good man along, he was only seeking justice, the hilarious silly doctor who actually knew what he was doing (to an extent at least), and the corrupt banker. Stagecoach wasn't just a simple western film that was all about shooting and what not. It took the time to develop the relationships between the characters, and that's really important.

The acting throughout is ho-hum without much to write home about, but the execution of dialog and character development is where the films fleshes out into a well told story. One of the beneficial plot devices come in handy as each individual is within the Stagecoach, the story is allowed to develop in a necessary but smooth way. It doesn't feel like these conversations are forced as its natural people are going to open when forced into such close proximity for a length period of time. Had they been in a bar, it would have felt far more unnatural.Visually the film looks good and there is some creative camera tricks pulled out of Bert Glennon's bag of tricks.

I've just always thought that it held up the best over the years with its engaging story, great characters, and genuine suspense. But now, my previous statement is being tested, because I've just been reminded what an amazing classic Stagecoach is. I saw this movie when I was a kid, and always seemed to dismiss it amongst other John Wayne movies. It was probably because it was in black and white (I watched a lot of black and white films when I was a kid, but I still preferred John Wayne's colored films) and most of it was dialogue. It wasn't until I was older that I realized how great a movie this is. As a kid, I was very big into action, but now as an adult, I'm much more into good characters and good writing. And that's what Stagecoach is all about. We spend so much time with these characters, and the writing is so good that you feel like you're there with them. Now this movie is very light on action, but I think that's what makes it stick out from other westerns. It's not about revenge, it's not about saving the girl, and it's not about protecting a small town. It's about the characters we meet, and how the journey they take changes them. The characters we're given are unforgettable. Some may be more flat than others, but the whole cast is just great. I've always loved movies that put character and writing in front of everything else. One of my favorite films of all time is 12 Angry Men, because even though it's non-stop dialogue and takes place in one room for an hour and a half, it has great memorable characters, great writing, and it's great watching these characters work of each other. And that's what makes Stagecoach so great; the interactions between the characters. You got funny characters, serious characters, nice characters, mean characters, over the top characters, and mysterious characters. These characters are all completely different, and that's what keeps it interesting. The whole cast is great, but it's the young John Wayne who steals the show. He just has this presence to him, and you can see why he's one of the greatest movie stars of all time. Now like many classic films, the only flaws in the film are the ones that are just a product of their time. One thing I can't stand is when people watch a classic movie, and take offense to every little out dated thing. Yes, the women faint and ride off with the man, the Mexican characters eat nothing but beans, and the Native Americans are bloodthirsty savages. But it was the 1930s, what do you expect? America just got over the Great Depression and there was a war overseas. Movies like this were made to boost the spirits of the American people. It was a dark time, and the people wanted to see a brave American hero rise up against their oldest enemy, which at the time were the Native Americans. Yes, today these things seem very outdated and offensive, but it's what the people needed. If you want to whine and complain about every \"product of the time\" moment, and make an argument about why today's racism is so much better than the racism of yesteryear, then go right ahead. But if you can appreciate the film for the time it was made, and realize how important it was to audiences, then you truly know what cinema is all about. Stagecoach is one of the Golden Age classics; don't let the dated elements blind you from how great this movie really is.",

Old films often feature pretty young women going crazy over every guy they see even if the man is middle-aged and ugly, people who just met discussing spending the rest of their lives together, and passionless marriages. These romances are NOT virtuous.In \"Stagecoach,\" John Wayne's Ringo Kid proposes marriage to Claire Trevor's Dallas on the day they met. Before his proposal, they spent just a few minutes alone, never kissed, and often weirdly stared at each other. He has NO idea who she is. More alarmingly, he is under arrest, but wants Dallas to move to his ranch in Mexico and wait for him for years while he's in jail. Ringo is very stupid, selfish, and immoral.The romance would have been better if they snuck off and, well, did it \u0096 or at least did something passionate. Instead, as he thinks he's about to go to jail for several years, he says goodbye to Dallas by shaking her hand. I'm not kidding. This is NOT a virtuous romance.But, director John Ford deserves credit for raising the quality of Westerns by making \"Stagecoach\" (1939) a character study rather than a shoot-em-up. Like \"The Breakfast Club,\" it is mostly about characters with major problems or flaws. Ringo is a convicted \u0096 albeit framed \u0096 killer. Lucy is pregnant. Dallas is a hooker, Doc Boone an alcoholic, Hatfield a gambler, Peacock a whiskey salesman, and Gatewood a thief.The above seven characters are in a stagecoach that's traveling from Arizona to New Mexico through Apache territory. Their interaction is reminiscent of the relationship of the characters in 1985's \"Breakfast Club\" \u0096 five teens sent to the same room for detention because they violated school rules.\"Stagecoach,\" like \"Breakfast Club,\" has an accepted vs. unaccepted plot. Representing the good are Gatewood, a bank president whose thievery is not known by the other passengers, and Lucy, a pious, married woman with snobbish friends. Gatewood and Lucy think they're morally superior. The bad are represented by Dallas and Doc Boone, who are both being kicked out of town by the Ladies Law and Order League.Gatewood, Lucy and Hatfield \u0096 who boarded the coach to protect Lucy's virtue \u0096 avoid the others. Ringo was picked up away from the town where the others boarded so he doesn't know Dallas is a whore. During the characters' travails, everyone learns that Gatewood is a selfish misanthrope and Dallas is a very good person. Lucy and Dallas bond the way that people from different backgrounds in \"Breakfast Club\" do.Ford was very effective in satirizing pillars of society and demolishing the stereotypes of outcasts. He brilliantly conveyed the film's ultimate lesson when Ringo didn't cancel the marriage after learning about Dallas' profession. However, his characters are too black and white. While watching the movie, I kept thinking \"Stagecoach\" was a trendsetter as a character portrayal, but had less depth than future films of its genre which had more multifaceted characters, better dialogue, and faster pacing. I nodded off a few times.In addition, portraying Apaches as savages who kill Americans for no reason is offensive, and Wayne can't act around females. He's great as a tough guy, but he has limited acting skills. Watch Jimmy Stewart and Wayne in \"Liberty Valance\" if you want to see the difference between two men's romantic acting skills.In 1939, I would have given \"Stagecoach\" a 10 for exploring topics that earlier adventures shunned. Today, I'm unsure what to rate it because it has been surpassed by other character portrayals. I chose 8.ZWriteP.S.: I want to give an IMDb poster named Spudnic credit for reminding me of \"The Breakfast Club.\" I mentioned that movie in a review I wrote on \"The Naked Spur\" last year, but initially didn't think about it.",

All of these characters were looked down on and talked negatively about throughout the whole film even though they were the first people to go out of their way to help the people who were talking negatively about them. Mrs. Mallory never once gave gave Dallas a chance even when she took care of her new born baby so Mrs. Mallory could rest. Even after Dallas kept Mrs. Mallory's baby safe during the shoot out, she still refused to be kind to Dallas. When the two women left each other near the end of the film Mrs. Mallory could not even finish her sentence offering to help Dallas if she ever needed her, because she knew she would not be there for someone like Dallas. Although she was treated with nothing but disrespect Dallas was understanding, it is almost like she felt that she deserved to be treated the way almost everyone treated her. The only person who saw Dallas for who she truly was was Ringo Kid. In the end kindness won, Dallas and Ringo Kid were allowed to go to Ringo's cabin to begin their lives together despite Ringo being a wanted criminal. This movie was very well done and the character of Dallas was performed perfectly, she was a woman who no one could stand to even speak about and yet she had a heart of gold and cared for everyone in her path. Overall every main character in this film had so much more of a story to tell as we met them all at the beginning of one small journey in their lives.",

The combination of the different personalities and use of suspense during the film was great. Each character represented different things causing the film to have multiple layers to it. For example the doctor and the prostitute are shown being thrown out of the town and the start of the film, therefore they were looked down upon for most of the movie and represented the social outcasts. John Wayne's character and Claire Trevor's characters seemed to be bad individuals because of what they stood for, Wayne being a criminal and Trevor being a prostitute but those two turned out to be the kindest and most caring characters.Foreshadowing is used quite often during the film most notably in the beginning when the passengers are warned of the Native Amercians, this helped to build up the suspense. The closeness inside the stagecoach also added to the tension, not only could the characters not escape one another inside but they had no where to go if they were attacked by the Apaches. The suspense is built all during the movie and the scene in which the passengers are being attacked the camera work is fantastic. Wide shots are used to show just how many Apaches are attacking the small stagecoach while the on screen movement of the horses the actors, and their weapons keeps the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The combination of the acting the camera-work, and storytelling techniques makes this a great film.",

The amount of effort that went into making this film was worth it for the stunning scenery in the open area of the desert.

The setting of the story in Monument Valley brings out the true beauty of the location and the film. I like how all the different personalities come together to ride to one place, some of them are funny and some more serious. Doc Boone played by Thomas Mitchell is one of the funniest, he is an alcoholic doctor who is drunk for a lot of the film. I like Ringos cocky attitude and is he is confident in everything he does. This movie is one that I recommend as a beginning to Westerns, after seeing this it makes me want to see more of Wayne's films from the period.

The other performances also deserve recognition, especially from Clare Trevor and Thomas Mitchell. Ford took a simple enough story and turned it into a masterpiece. It's not often you have a film with quite so many characters that are all endearing and fleshed-out enough that you care about each one's outcome. The soundtrack is another strong point of the film, with music that just evokes a western feel, even while listening to it on it's own without the film to back it up. The long shots and amazing setting of Monument Valley made for some beautiful cinematography, and the stunt work was impressive to say the least.

Bert Glennon's cinematography beautifully captures the landscapes of the American west that most Americans at the time had most likely never seen. The camera also gives the illusion that the coach, inside which the character spend a decent amount of screen-time, is larger than it really is. Also, the hard lighting used during the film's interior shots and during the ending serves to build tension and draw the audience in. Despite its technical perfection, I found the film's screenplay to be weak, especially the dialogue. The scene in which the Ringo Kid asks Dallas to come live with him on his ranch, which I understand to be one of the most famous scenes in American film history, seemed to me to be forced and unnatural.

Their journey is complicated by the fact that Geronimo has 'jumped the reserve', and the US Army Cavalry is nowhere to be seen. As are all great Westerns, this is a story of character, or characters.  A cross-section of society is examined under extreme stress, and justice finds everyone in the end.  This movie reminded me many times of O. Henry's short stories, because it so often 'rang true'.

The cinematography uses good framing techniques and lighting to make the setting look more beautiful. Everything is made clear and the reactions made by actors are easier for eyes to digest.

The passengers at first included the town prostitute, a whiskey salesman, the drunk doctor, a gambler, a wife going to see her soldier husband, and a banker. When the stagecoach driver, Buck, informed the marshal that they might come across the Ringo kid on their journey he decided to tag along. The Ringo kid was on the run and seeking revenge on his brother and father's killer who happened to be in Lordsburg where the stagecoach was heading. Right when they were about to leave, they were warned about the Apaches, a group of Indians who would harm them if they saw them. The passengers decided to carry on anyway even if they could be in danger. The stagecoach came across Ringo kid and the marshal arrested him and put him in the stagecoach. The Ringo kid liked Dallas, the prostitute, and was nice to her when no one else was on the trip. The stagecoach even continued on with no protection, some opposed but majority ruled. He even asked her to marry him and she said she would if he gave up his plan to kill his father and brother's killer. Lucy, the woman going to see her husband, gave birth at one of the stagecoach's stops and this shocked everyone and put the stagecoach a little behind schedule. The Ringo kid had a chance to escape at this stop but didn't because he wanted to help protect them from the Indians. When they finally left again, they ran into the Apaches and a gunfight broke out. Just when it looked like the Apaches were going to win, the US cavalry came and saved the stagecoach and its passengers. When they finally reached Lordsburg, the marshal let the Ringo kid go and look for the Plummers, his family's rivals. When he found them, the Ringo kid killed them and returned to the stagecoach thinking he was going to be arrested again.

In a racist shot at Native Americans, Apaches are always on the warpath, even gunning for our stagecoach filled with these ordinary people. After the cavalry detachment pulls away its escort, the coach is ripe for Indian attack. It will have you on the edge of your seat at times. There is a solid dynamic between the characters that definitely draws the viewer in. John Ford makes excellent use of lighting throughout the film to set a tone with in particular scenes. Also, the stunt work in the Indian chase scene was fabulous. Knowing how dangerous the stunts were makes the scene even more memorable.

The intensity of this movie also left the audience on the edge of their seats which tends to leave a lasting effect on them. This genre is not for everyone so if this doesn't sound appealing to you, you probably shouldn't watch it!",

            "content": "John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) set the bar for future Western films. Westerns were generally B films but Ford was determined to create an A classic Western. So he did just that! Ford turned B film actor John Wayne into a star and reestablished Western films into the 1930's; which wasn't a great time period for this genre. This film deals with stereotypical characters who turn out to be good people with moral values despite a bad reputation.All of this is wrapped up in a fast paced classic Western with gunfighting, chase scenes and amazing stunt work. The last part of the film is is packed full of action and suspense. Ford even breaks the 180 degree rule but it is barely noticeable because the scene is so well done that it sucks the viewer right in. The scene is so fast, well edited and put together that I didn't even realize that the camera angle had switched to the opposite side of the action! I suppose that was Ford's intention to make the viewer unaware of this and he did a fantastic job.Ford has made me a fan of the Western genre!",

The diverse and colorful range of characters is the obvious focus with such archetypes as a drunk, an outlaw, a sheriff, a gambler, and a prostitute present among others. The characters begin their journey with obvious prejudices and feelings towards one another, but develop and change as they travel and fight together. The drunken Doc Boone and Buck the driver splash comedy throughout the film, while Ringo Kid and Ms. Dallas provide the romance. Ringo Kid shows Ms. Dallas respect and care when no one else does, but Dallas is afraid he will no longer have interest in her once he discovers she is a prostitute. Ms. Dallas shows compassion and care to Lucy Mallory, whose disdain for Dallas grows into respect after Dallas protects her newborn baby. Sheriff Curley also changes his opinion of Ringo, who was to be arrested, but is set free to enjoy a new life with Dallas. The dynamic range of characters and their interactions in different situations provides an interesting and enjoyable experience. The film seemed a bit rushed, leaving certain details undeveloped. But the richness of dialogue, and elegant photography support an otherwise great western.",

            "content": "...and how unfortunate that is!  John Ford's classic western film - complete with revoltingly fake background scenery (typical of 1939), horrible over-dramatization of pretty much everything in the movie, and acting that would make Pamela Anderson cringe.  There are more mistakes in the movie than I could possible mention.  Also, I would also not like to take the time to watch it again and keep a record.  This movie had two redeeming qualities (as I see it.)  The first is the suave and not-half-bad John Carradine.  Unfortunately, his character never gets developed and has no purpose outside of being an extra for Wayne.  The second one was that this was one of John Wayne's earlier films, and he hadn't yet evolved his character (as he only ever played one) into the pompous and overbearing man that he would become in the 50's and remain until his final picture.  He was still the basis for the picture, though.  His stardom was the main draw.  God knows that the plot wasn't.  John Wayne is no Gary Oldman, but at least a little character diversity would have been nice.  John Ford was no Stanley Kubrick, or even a Sergio Leone, but at least the tiniest eye for detail and art would have made all the difference in the world. \nI gave this movie a 3 out of the sheer goodness of my heart.",

I love actors who can believably portray different types of characters, and Carradine's portrayal of a western gambling man in Stagecoach was great. A great deal of the film takes place inside the stagecoach, and sequences in those parts of the movie were really impressive. There were a lot of close up shots and cutting between characters; also, there was a lot of subtle interaction between characters and information was frequently conveyed through facial expression, often without much dialogue. Acting in these scenes was top notch. It's really amazing how the directer was able orchestrate the stagecoach scenes so well.

            "content": "Stagecoach, released in 1939, is a classic western ride that's a lot of fun. Directed by John Ford and staring the great John Wayne, along with Claire Trevor. This is a film that laid the blueprints for many westerns to follow and marks the beginning of stardom for John Wayne. Stagecoach follows the story of a group of travelers riding on a stagecoach through various towns in the United Sates Western territories. Wayne plays \"the Ringo Kid\", a wanted man on a path to enact revenge for the murder of his brother. I can clearly see why this helped launch Wayne to greater heights in Hollywood, he had this undeniable swagger about him that I gravitated to. The story features a colorful cast of characters behind Ringo. In particular I enjoyed Doc Boone, played by Thomas Mitchell, the doctor as well as the drunk of the group. Even though Docs tab at the saloon is far to big, he plays an imperative role during one of the groups more crucial parts of their journey. There were some rather annoying characters but isn't that difficult to look past them as the remaining characters are so spot on. This film delivered some impressive scenes of the western plains and a sequence involving a meeting with a group of Apache Natives that went beyond my expectations. If you are a fan of westerns this is a must see as it sets the stage for the genre as a whole.",

I even have to admit that the battle between the passengers of the stagecoach and Geronimo's indians was very intense. I knew all along that Mrs. Mallory was pregnant.

The characters travel on a Stagecoach west, and along the way we learn a bit about each character. We see into their past and their relationships with each other, and how they know each other, but we don't go much deeper than that. The plot is relatively boring, with one interesting subplot with Wayne. The characters travel on the coach and stop for dinner a couple times, which is a nice change in plot but then move on. The Indian chase scene is unrealistic. The only exciting part is the final scene with Wayne killing the brothers who murdered his brother, with the three bullets he saved.Stagecoach was not very interesting, and could easily lose the audience.

In short, old westerns seemed a tad bit too utopian, and I almost always knew exactly what would happen. This movie was no exception in that I knew exactly what would happen. The exception comes in with the characters. I knew good was going to triumph over evil, it always does in older movies. But what I didn't expect was what characters would be \"good\" and which would be \"bad\". We were introduced in the beginning of the movie to several character archetypes. The prostitute, the respected banker, the gambler, the refined lady, the drunk, and the outlaw (mainly). What was different about this movie from other westerns, was the way this movie explored both the good and bad aspects of all these characters, even though some archetypes (like the refined lady and the banker) were usually considered \"good\" characters, and archetypes like the prostitute and the outlaw were usually considered \"bad\" characters.

It is here that the similarities of your typical Western fade away for a bit. John Ford the director focuses the majority of the film on character development as the group of misfits travel through dangerous terrain. The plot is pretty brilliant and camera work is superb.Ford uses unique camera placement and long shots with lots of different motion such as tracking shots and also dolly shots that pull away from an individual to reveal what is around them. This kind of shot can be seen in the scene where they are eating at a table after stopping for food. The camera pulls away beautifully as Lucy moves away from Dallas to reveal the rest of the table and the clear division between the two of them. It's brilliant camera work like this that defines Ford's films and is what has earned him the title of best director.

When the wagon crew first set out, it is unknown just how much of an adventure they're going to have. When the wagon picks up the outlaw who recently escaped from jail (Ringo), it paves the way for an action packed flick. As they travel, they become more and more aware of the trouble they will face with the Apache Indians. Although this film is mostly serious and adventurous, the relationship between Mr. Peacock and Dr. Boone gives the intensity a huge comedy relief. Their interactions with each other bring the audience to hysterical laughter. This brings us to the not-so-ironic but ever-important relationship between an outlaw (Ringo) and a prostitute (Dallas) which brings the adventurous film a romantic factor. This film has many different sides, with its amazing photography, classic cowboys and Indians scenes, and fast chases and shootouts. Stagecoach is a film packed with drama, action and humor.",

While there were indeed horses, guns and clich\u00e9's, it was not nearly as a bad as what I thought to be true. I believe there was a solid balance between all the characters, from tough to soft. John Wayne was very good in his performance as Ringo. He showed his toughness and his compassionate side many different times. The evolution of Dallas, Doc Boone and Ringo were very well done. Though I did not like how Mrs. Mallory was not portrayed as pregnant, and randomly a baby pops out. I also wish that there was more about Geronimo, and more scenes with the Native Americans. This movie changed my opinion on western movies for the better, and for people with the bias that all westerns are similar I would recommend this film",

There were also so many stereotypical characters in it which made it fun to watch as one of the first western films, and it was cool to see where the basis for the rest of the films in this genre sprouted from. It was a very typical western film, when I think of a western I think of exactly what happened in this film; Indian and Cowboys fighting, drama, gossip, suspense. I also enjoyed the character development, for example Miss Mallory was so against even sitting near Dallas at the start of the film, but by the end of the film she was holding her baby and they became friends. The shootout scene towards the end was also really intense and I liked how it happened while they were all on the go, whether it be in the stagecoach or on horseback. I especially liked when the gambler had a gun right against Miss Mallory's head and she didn't even notice, but he got shot down before he could pull the trigger. It was intense and suspenseful even if it was only for a few seconds of not knowing what would happen. The last shootout scene was incredible, you think the film is over and all is well but it isn't. I liked that Ringo saved three bullets from the Indian shoot out because he knew he would have to use them against the brothers who were after him. Overall it was a really fast paced and intriguing film.",

It did not disappoint, everything was filmed with a purpose in this film, and with John Ford's experience, the movie was so well recorded that the characters most of the time don't even have to speak to portray what's going on in their minds. A good actor can speak and sound convincing, a great actor can speak and look convincing, a legend doesn't have to speak at all. Some of the greatest character moments are forged through the \"well oiled\" tactics found in the silent era, conventions that can set up the characters very well, and make them feel much more organic, make them feel alive. A must for any film buff, and a NEED TO SEE for anyone who likes a western.",

We have a ship of fools who all get on board a stagecoach going to a specific location, but all inside of it are going for different reasons. And they are all of different social class. The use of photography, made all the more powerful by the use of light, frame this motion picture perfectly. Such as the chiaroscuro on the prostitute when they all stop for dinner. She sits by a window, and instead of being illuminated as one would expect from such a location, she is in the shadows. And due to her costume, which is also dark, she is cast further and further into the shadows. She sits alone near the window, and the rest of the ship is apart from here, which is meaningful photography in the beginning of this film. Then in the same scene, one individual sits by her and another pair are at the opposite end. Another great use of photography to frame the symbolism of the scene and nature of the characters placed in them, how the interact with one another. Towards the end, we get a reserve shots between 2 of the characters, which highlights their newfound connection as people rather than parts belonging to a particular social class. I believe this movie is full of meaning and progresses well, but that the Hayes Code hurt how impactive this movie could have been. Had they been allowed to say/show certain things more without the stringent limit placed on them by the Hayes Code, the impact could be felt a great deal more than it is. Regardless, it is an impactive film that well deserves it's praise.",

You can't imagine the film without Wayne, if you were to see his performance when this film first came out you would have know he was going to be big.

I am not sure where they were going but it seemed like they never went anywhere...maybe I am crazy.

I liked how the music was tied in as they walked, each step they took the music seemed to be right on key and the camera was in front of them following them each step they took as they walked towards the cart. It almost seemed as though the characters steps were slowed down to make it look as though it was slow motion to show that they were off on a long journey. The lighting seemed to be high key, the backgrounds were really dark and the faces were brightened with light. I think the lighting was different at times, I think that sometimes they used high key lighting and other times it seemed to be low key because of the harsh shadows shown. As Dallas was walking down a long hall way to a lightened door, the path is almost completely overexposed with white lighting and then her shadow is super black. It is trying to show some scenes as dramatic. I loved the scene where they were fighting with the Indian's that were on horses, I liked that they did not keep it at one consistent shot. They mixed up the different angles to show the scene as more of a dramatic one.For example they had one perspective were the camera was at the horses feet showing them running towards us, but they show them getting closer and closer to us.",

Despite everyone else's opinion of the prostitute Dallas, Ringo saw her for who she really was and didn't let other opinions effect his perception of her. For me that was the main story in the movie, but there were also many other important stories going on as well. I liked this aspect of the movie. Every character had their own purpose, and perused what they were after. It was all very convincing, except for the Indian fighting scene. There were about 50 Indians shooting arrows and guns at every angle and yet the stagecoach barely got hit, meanwhile Ringo, Buck, and Curley had no problem hitting an Indian every time.

I think John Ford was one of the first to cinematically and photographically realize the potential of the so- called Western setting. The actors mixed well together, each one with his or her own unique personality adding to the whole, it was highly entertaining, the drunken doctor and silly stagecoach driver being my favorites. Of course the film is also chock full of racism, misogynistic undertones, homophobia and especially worst of all the lack of respect for Native Americans. It's embarrassing and somewhat distracting if not repulsive but like most are quick to say it was a part of that period.

One of the main characters internal conflicts was worrying if her man would still want her if he knew she was poor. This is a hard way to live. Always wondering if you're good enough. I find that even though this was so long ago, people still deal with the same problems today.The main positives of this film was the clear visuals, the addicting action, and the entertainment of intoxication in the human body. The movie was still clear and easy on the eyes. This was surprising to me. The gun fights were stressful to watch as a viewer and that's what its all about, the feeling of being lost in a story.

People that we meet have various personalities, identities, and stereotypes that should be respected by everybody. Most of the time, people aren't always what they seem to be, at first. But once, you get to know them and cooperate with them, they'll be able to accept each other for who they are and not by their stereotype.Stagecoach is an example that uses the golden rule, \"never judge a book by its cover\" rule to an extreme, throughout the story as all of the main characters are traveling together to find their loved ones, discovering their true selves, and starting out a new life where they'll be able to attain their goal. Traveling to this new place was used as a metaphor for all of these characters to accept each other for who they are, work as a team to save themselves and get a job done, discover something new about themselves and redeem themselves and start a new life with their new identities within themselves. Although a few people's actions are unchanged, people are constantly discovering things about themselves. The director uses this rule and these stereotypes and reverses the thoughts of how at one point, we would see some of these characters as bad people and let us see them doing good things and lets the viewer get rid of that bad stereotype and accept them for good people, especially the main characters.The overall story line and the various plots that were used with all the main characters were developed and used well throughout the fast paced movie that kept you glued and curious about what was going to happen to the characters. The use of the western theme in a real outdoor setting was used well and with the setting, storyline, writing, and costumes made this story more realistic with real life issues that these characters faced in the western life. The acting was performed well throughout the film. The framing in the cinematography was used well with the film as the camera was able to give some scenes a great sense of depth of field and shallow scenes with great lighting to make the scenes more dramatic and adventurous as the viewers were watching the film.Overall, it's a great movie to watch!! With its drama, suspense, adventure, moral lesson, story, and plot, this a great movie that you don't want to miss watching on television or on the internet.",

Director John Ford creates a great mental picture of the western frontier in its infancy. Many Americans at this time were moving west from the east coast to find success and start a new life. The problem is that Native Americans, unknown to many, had already been settling this land for centuries. So you can imagine, an American with the idea of Manifest Destiny in their heads would do anything claim this land. You can also imagine a resistance between these two groups. Each character in this film had a different reason for leaving; from outlaws, to prostitutes to a wife looking for her husband. So the question this film proposed is identity. Do you remain yourself or do you become another person? Much of the West at that time was unmapped and it was a risk to migrate west for fear of being killed by Native Americans starvation or the fear that all humans hold; what they can't see and understand. I can't forget to mention the great action with good old fashion gun slinging and a remarkable chase seen involving John Wayne's character jumping from one horse to another while they're running at full speed.",

Luckily they were traveling with a doctor because something very unexpected happened that shocked me quite a bit. One women who was trying to reach her husband went into labor. The dresses the women wore were very bulky so there was no way of telling that she was pregnant. The scene when the Indians attacked was very exiting and it got my heart pumping. I did not imagine that the Indians would be carrying guns on horseback. Luckily the army came to their aid just in time and they got away to their destination safely. I liked this movie and would suggest it to my friends.",

            "content": "This film is not by any stretch your average Western. Although the plot may follow the typical 'lone cowboy saves the day' format the overall smoothness of the story and the incredible flow that it has throughout kept me much more tuned in than I would normally be for a Western.I found the humor in this movie to be very well done. The doctors drunken antics never failed to make me laugh and the overall sarcastic form of humor the movie had was right up my ally.The main characters equal regard for everyone and his tendency to treat everyone with kindness and respect was truly moving in the film. When he spoke to someone he didn't speak as if he was speaking to a gambler, or a prostitute but instead spoke as if he was speaking to a person which I feel reflects the underlying theme of the movie.On the surface the film is your classic Western but if you look a little deeper you find that the film has a very socially critical message. Everyone is equal and should be treated as such. The harsh judgments placed on the prostitute by the travelers in the beginning illustrate this perfectly. Later on in the film we find that she is not a bad person at all but rather, is very sweet and caring.An awesome, socially critical, well put together masterpiece. Well worth a watch or two!",

However, I know that some of them can be very good, and I respect that. This one in particular wasn't bad. As the movie began, as with most movies, I already knew who I liked the most, and this time, it just happened to be a secondary character. Regardless, I much preferred the nicer characters to the not so nice characters, but that's just the way I am. The major battle scene closer to the end of the movie, even though I knew it was coming, was fairly surprising. It made me a bit nervous, considering the way it started with that single first arrow that seemed to come out of nowhere. I was mainly fearful of the baby that they had in the stagecoach with them (I found the baby utterly adorable from the second it first came on screen), because I knew that there was the possibility of it getting hurt or killed, and that would have been horrible. Overall, it was not my favorite movie I have ever seen, and not even my favorite movie that I saw in my movie class this semester, but it was pretty well done, and gave me a few laughs and a few thrills along the way.",

However, this film will gladly prove you wrong! Stagecoach delivers the classic essence of western films that we all know very well. The form this film takes brings us into the middle of the old west and soon before you know it-BAM! You have these characters thrown together all for separate reasons but for all the right reasons. The cinematography is one of the most outstanding parts of this film and really helps you capture the feelings and emotions sought out by the director and creators. The acting is actually very precise and outstanding. Keep in mind I have not seen many movies like this one but i know excellent acting when I'm on the edge of my seat fearing whos going to shoot first. Without giving away any spoilers there is plenty of action in this film, action that seems to pile up more and more until the ending. While the film is rather slow to progress at the opening, the middle half makes up for it with enough attention to detail and character dynamics to keep the audience running through this film. Stagecoach will let you ride shotgun across the old west and experience true movie magic in this 1930s film.",

            "content": "Rounding out our 1939 discussion of John Ford, alongside Drums Along the Mohawk and Young Mr. Lincoln, is Stagecoach, far and away the best of the three, and still eternally referenced by filmmakers themselves as an unimpeachable classic. Orson Welles famously viewed the film over 40 times to engender the proper headspace in order to craft his own masterwork, Citizen Kane, calling it a \"textbook example of filmmaking\" (thanks, IMDB). While it may be harder these days for a modern viewer, accustomed to a medium possessed of far more glitz and explosivity, to appreciate the craftsmanship on display here, I like to think that a strong emotional core, and a great story and characters, tend towards the timeless in any medium.The story, shockingly, is centered around a stagecoach, and follows a band of characters as they take a trip across the ol' American West for reasons as different as the characters themselves. You have a whiskey vendor, a drunken doctor (the combo of which, naturally, leads to some comedic interplay), a gentlelady far along in pregnancy, a mysterious gentleman scoundrel, a banker on the take, and another woman strongly intimated to be a prostitute, kicked out of town by the \"good people.\" John Wayne joins the cast a little down the road as the infamous Ringo Kid. Complications arise as a Comanche threat looms on the journey's horizon.While there's a lot that can be said for directorial choices like shot composition, which is fantastic throughout, I won't bore you much with technicality... this time. What really makes this movie work, and stand the test of time, is its strength as an ensemble narrative. The characters are all tremendously well-drawn, the acting is superb, and their interplay creates a nuanced, thoroughly humanistic meditation.For instance, there is the aforementioned comedic juxtaposition of the drunken Doc Boone and the whiskey vendor, a nebbish individual played by, of course, Donald Meek. Perfect casting. Easy laughs, perhaps, in a different film, but it serves to highlight the grace and humanity of what everyone assumes to be a belligerent, fallen man, in the doctor, as even with a reserve of drink at hand, having been outcast by the town, he rises with aplomb when needs must. Special kudos to Thomas Mitchell in the role. It's one of his very best, and he dominates his scenes, inhabiting a character that is also representative of the film's thorough, and yet understated, comedic tone.Concomitant with the doctor is the archetype of the Fallen Woman, Dallas, played by Claire Trevor, ostracized and similarly banished from town. She is treated with disdain by everyone besides the doctor, and later, the Ringo Kid, another \"undesirable.\" Within these two characters, Doc Boone and Dallas, there emerges a theme classism, if you will, or at the very least the often blind nature of human superiority, as, without wishing to spoil anything, she also displays a touching and ineffable humanity. These two characters, specifically, are beautiful, flawed souls that transcend the archetypal modalities of station and shine at the heart of the film.We also, of course, have John Wayne, in the movie that made him a star. If you're familiar with John Wayne, well... he plays John Wayne. You know what you're in for on that count. His swaggering machismo, however, does not feel parodical, such as it can seem in some of his later work when he became an icon, and this is precisely because the film is not just a \"John Wayne Movie,\" but because he is a cog in a greater machine, a distinct color in service to a full palette. His burgeoning relationship with Dallas, moreover, is representative of something I always love in a movie, if done well, in broken people finding connection, and a sort of fullness, together, and it's through them that the movie earns its ending.FINAL TAKE: Stagecoach retains its status as a cinematic icon. That's a tough thing to do, given 82 (and counting) intervening years. While John Ford puts on an early cinematic masterclass in technique, the real treasure here is the interplay of the ensemble, and the narrative weaved from the characters they impeccably inhabit. While not as well-known in general conversation as other classics of the era like Gone With the Wind, or the aforementioned Citizen Kane, it really, really deserves to be, and stands at the apex of the Ford canon alongside The Grapes of Wrath.",

They all had their own reason for traveling to get to Lindsburg. It was produced in 1939 when many good movies were produced.

            "content": "Stagecoach was released in 1939. It is the story of a stagecoach traveling to Lordsburg, New Mexico during an Apache uprising. The passengers are from all walks of life and are heading to Lordsburg for a variety of reasons. The drunken doctor and the outcast woman are forced out of town by societal prejudice. The whiskey peddler is heading home to his wife and children in Kansas City (Kansas, not Missouri, as he often points out). The banker is sneaking out of town for mysterious reasons. The other woman is going to meet her husband, who is in the cavalry, and the gambler boards at the last minute to protect her. The driver wants to turn back for fear of the Apaches, but the sheriff riding shotgun won't let him stop his pursuit of an escaped convict. Last but not least, John Wayne, the convict, called the Ringo Kid is picked up along the way. He busted out of prison and is going to Lordsburg to avenge the murder of his father and brother by Luke Plumber. These are the main characters, but Stagecoach also has many memorable supporting characters. My favorite has to be the Mexican man at one of the stops who always ends his sentences in \"I think\" (\"Si senora, I think.\") I'd forgotten about him over the years.The film boasts an ensemble cast, most of whom were much more established actors than John Wayne at the time and some of them would go on to be regulars in his later films. Andy Devine, with his always recognizable pre-pubescent like voice, plays the driver. Thomas Mitchell, who plays the doctor, always did the best drunk, it seems like he played one in all of his films. And Claire Trevor plays the outcast woman. Fifteen years later, Wayne and Trevor starred in another film together, The High and The Mighty. This time their star status is reversed. Trevor is an aging, once well- known actress, while Wayne is at the peak of his stardom.Stagecoach is a significant film for a number of reasons. First, it was John Wayne's breakthrough role. He'd had his first starring role in 1930 in The Big Trail, but then spent to next nine years making low budget B westerns and serials. Stagecoach was another chance at an A list film and one that finally earned him some notoriety. It was also Wayne's first starring role for director John Ford. He had done stunts and bit parts for Ford as early as 1928, but Stagecoach was the real beginning of a lifelong friendship and famed working relationship. They would go on to make another thirteen pictures together over the next twenty-four years, along with various television projects. Stagecoach was also the first time Ford shot in his beloved location of Monument Valley, where he produced a total of nine of his films. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, many consider Stagecoach to be the film that raised, not only John Wayne, but the western genre from B movie to A-list status. And lest you think I overstate the films influence, it is said that Orson Welles viewed Stagecoach around forty times before making his masterpiece. Citizen Kane.Several years ago, I had a discussion with a co-worker about American History X and its use of black and white photography during the flashbacks. Apparently, the director had said that you always have to have a good reason to use black and white, before explaining his reasons. I accepted this as at the time, but I later began to question it. Why do you have to have a good reason to shoot in black and white? It's not a flaw that technology fixed with the advent of color, it's an equally valid art form. In fact, Welles once said \"You know what I say about black and white? It's the actor's friend, because every performance is better in black and white. Name me a great performance in color.\"What does this all have to do with Stagecoach? This viewing of it was the first time I've gained a full appreciation for black and white. I'd never realized how much more beautifully pronounced light and shadows can be in black and white. Paying attention to the shadows in the interior shots of the film was quite mesmerizing.I recently read a journal entry of Roger Ebert's in which he states: \"Two of the most wonderful props in film noir were cigarettes and hats. They added interest to a close up or a two-shot.\" Though not a noir, I found a perfect example of this in Stagecoach. The stagecoach is traveling through some major winds. All the passengers are bundled up with their heads down to fend it off. Just the top of Wayne's hat is shown. He looks up at Trevor, his face still half concealed by the hat, and she looks back at him briefly. It's a wonderful shot in a brief but important moment between the two characters.Though not his masterpiece (which is debatably,The Searchers), Ford directed Stagecoach masterfully. He utilized Monument Valley perfectly with many beautiful landscape shots. The way he shot the ending is ingenious. The entire climatic shootout is only heard off screen. This may seem like an odd choice, but it is the unexpected and greatly adds to the tension of the scene.Thanks to time, experience, and Criterion's wonderful restoration, my appreciation for Stagecoach has increased exponentially. I suspect I'll be revisiting more of Wayne and Ford's great movies soon in hopes of a similar new experience\u0085Check out this and other reviews at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",

            "content": "This is a shortened review. For my full length reviews, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/Stagecoach is a relatively simple film from a plot perspective. Nine individuals are on a stagecoach trip from Tonto, Arizona, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Along the way, they have to deal with personal prejudices, weather conditions, a baby being born, and the dangers of traveling through Apache country while Geronimo is on the warpath.Claire Trevor, a fairly successful and \"name brand\" actress at the time, had top billing and one of the largest roles as Dallas, a prostitute who is being forced to leave Tonto on the coach. The ladies of \"The Law and Order League\" are trying to clean up their town and also send the drunk, amiable Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) on his way. He joins Dallas on the coach, along with a whiskey salesman (Samuel Peacock, played by Donald Meek), the pregnant Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt), a Southern gentleman and card shark (Hatfield, slyly played by John Carradine), and Ellsworth Gatewood (Berton Churchill), the town's banker who's recently embezzled $50,000 and is fleeing the scene of the crime. Driving the coach is Buck (played by the wonderful Andy Devine) and Marshal Wilcox (George Bancroft) is riding shotgun.Along the way, they come across the Ringo Kid, an escaped fugitive played by John Wayne. Ringo seems to be a nice guy who simply got himself into some trouble, but he also broke out of prison with the lone goal of killing Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler) and his brothers as retribution for killing his own father and brother. There's a long history between the families, but the audience is only given the slightest information - just enough to keep us wondering just what kind of men Ringo and the Plummers are.Wayne is rather good in Stagecoach and impressed me with his relaxed manner in some scenes and quiet intensity in others. Ringo is a complex character and Wayne is able to play all the angles really well. Wayne had been toiling away in \"B\" pictures - as everything from a crew member, stuntman, and actor - for over a decade, but Stagecoach was his big break. Ford insisted on casting Wayne, even refusing to change his mind after numerous studios passed on the film because of Wayne's attachment. Luckily, Ford eventually got to make his film the way he wanted, and cinema history was changed forever. Wayne, of course, became one of the biggest stars of all-time and spent the next three decades entertaining millions of people, eventually becoming a true Hollywood icon.Wayne's character isn't introduced until about the twenty minute mark, but it's a fantastic introduction. Some terrific editing and a quick zoom add up to a shot that I'll remember for ages. Ford seemed to be saying, \"Here's John Wayne. You don't know him, but you'll never forget him now.\" The rest of the cast is in fine form, too, especially Mitchell, who has probably the showiest role as the habitually intoxicated Doc Boone. There are definite comedic moments at the expense of Boone's alcoholism, but Mitchell never plays it too far over the top, so there's always a human side in sight. Mitchell gets to shine in both funny and serious scenes and went on to win the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for the role. It was a well-earned award, no doubt.I'd also like to highlight the work of Andy Devine as Buck. I've only recently discovered Devine (after watching The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance), but after seeing him in these two films, I'm excited to see more of his work. Devine has a very unusual voice, but it instantly lends pathos to his performances and helps him create interesting, uncommon characters. In Stagecoach, Buck is a bit of a coward, ready to turn and retreat at the first signs of trouble, but once the trouble arrives, he doesn't shrink away. Devine's folksy performance immediately pulled me in and I rooted for Buck during the entire film.The lone performance that I think fell flat was Churchill as the scheming banker, Gatewood. He just comes across as a little too one dimensional and I didn't really care about him one way or the other, unlike the rest of the characters, who I were emotionally invested in. Gatewood seems like a stock character and nothing more. I think the blame for this can be spread in three different directions: To Churchill, Ford, and the screenwriter Dudley Nichols. Churchill gives a mostly lifeless performance, but he wasn't aided by his director or writer. There are a couple of moments near the beginning of the film where Ford lingers on closeups of Gatewood, hitting the audience over the head with the message \"This guy's no good and can't be trusted!\" Both shots really struck me as odd and hurt the film's flow and made Gatewood seem like a silly character. And Nichols just didn't seem to put much work into the character, unlike how he handled the other eight main roles and even most of the supporting roles.All the technical components of the film were absolutely fantastic. Everything from the cinematography and editing to the art direction and costumes were first rate. The totality of all these aspects is what makes Stagecoach such an enduring classic, I think. It doesn't just do one or two things well; it does everything at a high level. The score was especially well done and added nicely to the film, rather than distracting from it like some scores do. The music was used expertly to underscore intense or romantic or comedic moments, but never was overbearing. In fact, the score was so good that it won an Academy Award.Stagecoach is certainly one of the best westerns I've seen and the American Film Institute agrees, ranking it as the #9 western film of all-time, a distinct honor considering all the films in contention.",

            "content": "Stagecoach is a Western style film produced in 1939. This film was directed by John Ford and it stars John Wayne. This film, common to Western styles, is extremely fast paced. The cinematography is a majority of constantly moving shots. They're are rolling backgrounds which gives the look of a moving stagecoach. During one of the final scenes, in which a battle takes place, the stagecoach is \"moving\" extremely fast through the desert while engaging in combat with the Apaches. Although the coach isn't really moving on set, the backgrounds are moving which gives the appearance of a fast chase scene that was extremely advanced at this time. Another element that I really enjoyed was the camera cutting out when John Wayne's character Ringo shoots at his enemies, this makes for a really nice suspense camera trick. To match the fast paced cinematography, the music throughout the film is very lively and fast paced as well (this is true for most aspects of such Western style movies) The majority of the music is played by a piano, in one scene however with Mrs. Mallory, the music is slowly played- almost like a lullaby. The acting throughout this is well done. John Wayne is constantly flashing a coy smile paired with a set of calm eyes. This body language to me makes him seem that much more dangerous. Claire Trevor has a constant nervous attitude and always observing eyes. Her acting, next to Wayne's, seems confident yet respectful of his main role. Dallas' character is high spirited yet caring and passionate. This cast of actors/actress' are well suited for their parts and to act with one another. As an example, as Ringo and Dallas embrace towards the end, it is heartfelt and sincere. These two play well together and well off of each other. Although this film is a Western (typically not one of my favorites) I enjoyed it very much. I appreciated the pace of the film, it kept me interested from the beginning to the very end.",

Clearly, this movie is a national institution, helped establish a film genre, became a pictograph of part of our history, and made the careers of more than one actor.  However, it was watching it again this morning that I came to realise how some scenes are masterfully composed. I am not talking about Monument Valley, Utah, the scenes most associated with John Ford. The compositions I was impressed by took place early in the story at Chris' stagecoach stop. Chris was the Mexican proprietor with the Apache wife (\"They don't bother me..., I think...). Recall the moment at night with the Vaqueors sitting around a small fire. Each of them is wearing a broad brimmed hat (not quite a sombrero) and a serape'.  One man has his foot up and is holding a guitar. The scene appears to be lit solely by the fire (a skillfull illusion in the days of \"slow\" black and white film!). The camera remains still on thise scene for a moment. It almost looks like a painting by El Greco or Velasquez.",

John Ford's use of the doctor, the stereotypical hispanic, and many of the other characters to stop the movie from feeling overly dramatic or depressing (with the impending doom of local savages attacking)also shows the true western feel. what i found truly amazing was that the film crew actually filmed large portions of this movie out in the west, and the beautiful natural landscape added a feeling of actually being there that is not possible with a Hollywood set. i truly believe that the decision to film this movie in it's actual setting is what really helped to push the movie to its legendary status.",

Yes, in reality the Apaches would have shot the stagecoach's horses. Further, it's unlikely the Ringo Kid would have either met such a caring, father - figure sheriff or survived the final gunfight. But let's not get sidetracked. This is a lovely film with diverse identifiable themes, interesting characters, wonderful backdrops of Monument Valley, just the right amount of sentimentality and John Ford's renowned detail.

We meet nine strangers who are forced together by faith, you could say, and the nine were all very different, whether it be their social class or other flaws like being an alcoholic and greedy which separated them. What makes the movie interesting is the interactions between these characters, they are all so different but have no choice but to be around each other and help one another. We also get to look at the development of the characters, see the good in the \"bad\". Characters like Dallas who are low on the totem pole, but by the end we see that she really has a heart of gold, and of course Ringo (John Wanye) the misunderstood criminal. The movie doesn't focus on clich\u00e9 western shoot outs but the developing relationships within the characters. But it couldn't be a western with out the good against bad, so there was a chase scene the good guys, our nine strangers, and the natives chasing them on horse back. Over all I enjoyed this western mostly because it wasn't about guns and cowboys, but instead about people and relationships.",

Strong, thin wires were fixed to a metal post anchored in the ground, while the other ends of the wires were attached to an iron clamp that encircled the legs of each horse. A horse was then ridden at full gallop, and when a wire's maximum length was reached--just when the rider was \"shot\"--the animal's legs would be jerked from beneath it, causing it to tumble violently and throw off the \"shot\" rider. A rider could anticipate the fall, but the horse could not, resulting in many horses either being killed outright or having to be destroyed because of broken limbs incurred during the falls. The use of the \"Running W\" was eventually discontinued after many complaints from both inside and outside the film industry.",

From being chased by Indians to an outlaw becoming a hero, it was interesting to watch the lower class citizens in the stagecoach become the most important. It was an interesting look into how society viewed people from a variety of walks of life. Dallas was looked down upon because she was a prostitute but the banker, doctor, and southern bell were treated differently, despite being drunks and having other ailments that made them no good.

Orson Welles watched Stagecoach over 40 times while filming Citizen Kane and incorporated scenes with ceilings (a practice rarely used). Akira Kurosawa was inspired so much by this movie he went on to make The Seven Samarai. Stop and think about this for a minute, Stagecoach was responsible for two of the greatest movies ever made!!

This film, through great acting, outstanding directing, and a little help from technological advances in film, was able to spark interest in Westerns once again.The film was interesting in the way in progressed and was delivered. \"Stagecoach\" chose to favor action and looks between characters to advance the film. Subtle looks characters gave one another easily took the place of dialogue in many instances, as well as seemed more organic than over-done or cheesy lines.The film is considered, as \"Learning about Movies\" on YouTube puts it: \"Stagecoach is basically a Grand Hotel movie\", which he goes on to describe the scenario of many movies we've all seen before; a crew of people all conjure in one place, and their individual struggles and difference all being sorted out acts, in my opinion, almost as a co-main plot. In this case, facing danger from Indian tribes chasing them is the other main plot.There are several typical Western scenes to be seen, from train robberies, pistol shoot outs with incredible accuracy in shooting, danger from savage Indian tribes, and cowboys. However, this film does it all in its own way, and as a result, it saved the Western genre, and allowed it to say alive for a few more decades (and even with the occasional successful Western still being released today), as well as just overall being one of the most influential films of all time.",

His character displays the personality traits that any good person should hand want to have. The personalities of all the characters are either scripted to be rounded or very forthright. Stagecoach offers a deeper look at women and the line between black and white becomes very gray. The virtues woman in the movie has her faults just like the saloon girl. The aspects of the saloon girl are further explored and John Ford (director) looks deeper into why she has the life that she does. She is treated poorly and shunned by the \"good\" people of the town and the stage coach. But John Wayne's character is the kind of man/person that looks beyond labels and at the people behind them. And the \"rules\" of society are broken by the small things like a married woman who is a little bit interested in the gambler; or the well to do banker who is a thief. The story line is written really well and depicted beautifully by John Ford. Every camera shot that was filmed was natural and done smoothly. From the close up shots to long-shots, actions shots and \"quiet\" shots, each was done with the intention to make it feel as real as possible. Even the lighting done to hide the faces or to cast a heavy foreshadow of what was to come.",

Ringo, an outlaw and criminal in the eyes of the law, is seeking revenge and is apprehended. Though he attempts to escape, his realization that he and those he is traveling with are surrounded by Native American's who are known to kill all who are not them fills him with a sense of honor and integrity, as he voluntarily stays with them and helps fight back the tribal warriors. Dallas, a former \"lady of the night\", is harshly judged by her companions. They view her as less of a person because of her past. But she is one of the kindest of the group, and helps Mrs. Mallory's baby and tend to her. And one of the seemingly upstanding citizens of the group, Mr. Gatewood, turns out to be a criminal who robbed a bank prior to making the journey. So, as stated previously, this film clearly sends a message to the viewers as to not judge someone prior to getting to know them. The kindest may turn out to be the most sinister, and the harshest may be the most trustworthy.",

The characters the film follows each encompass a unique social position or personality, which the actors portray wonderfully. The film's focal concentration is on an alcoholic doctor, prostitute with \"a heart of gold\" and a cowboy seeking vengeance; they are fleshed out by their counterparts; a cold and pregnant aristocrat, a mysterious love-struck gambler and a nasty banker. It is easy to see why this movie changed the very way westerns were viewed before its release (as cheaply made \"B\" movies) because everything about it was so \"on-point\" and tightly presented.As the coach travels through the beautiful rocky desert landscape (impressively enough it was actually shot on location in Monument Valley) the characters interact in the small, cramped space unable to ignore one another and everything we may have thought about the characters is broken down. Their real personalities are revealed. The prostitute is more than just a depraved individual (as movies usually present a lady of the night) but a woman with more warmth and \"breeding\" than her rich and snobby counterpart. The aforementioned woman ultimately cannot even be troubled to thank the prostitute for saving her infant's life, and watching over her in her time of need. Stagecoach is not just an action-filled saga, but an interesting depiction of the \"human condition.\"",

The cast of characters in this movie is most wonderful. Among the character who partake in the adventure of the stagecoach my favorite is by far the drunken Doctor. The scene were the other men are trying to sober up the Doc by splashing him with water and forcing strong black coffee into him is hysterical because it really shows the age and is a nice comedic break away from the drama of the story.

            "content": "If hell is other people (as one of Sartre's characters said in No Exit), one level of hell is certainly other people on a stagecoach careening through a dusty stretch of desert where lurks an army of angry Apaches. Stagecoach is a classic and for good reason. A bunch of strangers, each with their own murky and complex motivations, are jostling around on the stagecoach trip from hell.The beauty of it all is that each person, more or less, has their polar opposite along for the ride. There's the morally upright and pregnant wife of a cavalry officer off to rejoin her husband, and her antithesis, a \"fallen\" lady ready to end her ways of harlotry; but will society let her? There's a drunken, flamboyant, disgraced doctor \u2013 beloved, but run out of town for his incompetence, and his opposite, a meek, mild mannered, easily forgettable whiskey peddler. There's a ramrod straight sheriff who can't see fit to bend the law, and his counterpart \u2013 Ringo Kid (John Wayne showing why he would become a star) who has escaped from prison to avenge a wrongful death and is a criminal, even though he has justice on his side. Rounding out the motley crew, a smooth gambler with impure intentions, an embezzler and Andy Devine as the stage driver, bringing his peculiar voice and comic relief to tie it all together. And it works beautifully.This was 1939 and director John Ford was pulling together what would become standards in movie language \u2013 the hooker with a heart of gold, the against all odds love story, etc. It may seem trite now, but it was likely revolutionary in those days. The natives, sadly, were basically cardboard cutout characters, and it seems many horses suffered in the climatic running gun battle, but fans of westerns should see this.And there's one more character worth mentioning \u2013 the landscape. Much of Stagecoach was filmed in Monument Valley and even though their linear trip inexplicably circles past the same buttes repeatedly, the back drop is amazing. It must have been a revelation in those days when seeing that part of the county was less straightforward than clicking on the internet. We had the good fortune of staying at The View hotel overlooking Monument Valley (go there if you can) and the buttes and mesas featured in the film. We hiked the only trail into the now-protected land circling around one of the most familiar outcrops (bring water!) and the movie was even more enjoyable as we saw them traversing the same country we walked through.--www.cowboyandvampire.com --",

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939, John Ford) is a classic western, and plays out like one. The acting is good, the characters are rounded and interesting, and the directing is commendable. However, some of it is a little messy, such as when Mr. Hatfield apparently has an unexpected idea to keep Mrs. Mallory from a painful death. The representation of this is a bit unnatural, so the climactic moment is rather poorly executed. I'm of the opinion that when something that meaningful happens, it should be made a little clearer exactly WHAT it meant, so the audience (myself included) doesn't sit there for the remainder of the film wondering what they missed. Otherwise, the plot is thrilling, and the classic western horse-riding chase scenes are wonderfully exciting, spurred on (pun intended) by heroic music. The scenes are very well shot and edited, too. My favorite shot was when Dallas runs down a narrow alley to the bright \"light at the end of the tunnel\" which is, needless to say, a great example of photographic symbolism. Dallas's turning point comes later, when the social significance of her role kicks in, and it is revealed that the point of her story is to prove that a person's life can turn around, hence her going from a prostitute with a heart of gold to a happily engaged woman. After finally getting around to watching one of John Ford's films, I can say now that I understand what the fuss is about. Definitely worth watching if you care to get a feel for this type of film, and Ford's work in general.",

It is said to be a one of a kind movie, that inspired many Hollywood and Bollywood movies later.\nThe film has brilliantly showed how different backgrounds can create a rift between a group of people.

The shots of the stagecoach running, and the chase sequences have been shot with utmost precision. Apart from that, the locations are mind boggling.\nAlso, what really impresses the viewers is, how the story develops. Each character has a lot of depth. How their relationships change, what drives them to do what they do, has been shown with a lot of detailing.\nBut what outshines all these aspects, is the acting performance.

Sometimes you may have to do things that you may know aren't right but you do them because you have to get by. \"Stage Coach\" made the point just because you've done some lousy things in your life that doesn't make you a bad person and sometimes the upstanding member of society is the villain. You going through the movie with a few upstanding citizens on the stage coach and a few shady characters but as you go farther and farther into the film these characters start to round out. You learn this so called terrible outlaw Ringo the Kid is actually a nice guy that's just had a rough life. That Dallas who once sold her body for sex isn't some \"defiled whore\" and is still suitable for some man to marry (not really how I'd put it but I'm trying to do this from a some what 1939 perspective). You learn Doc Boone isn't just some drunken fool and when he has to can get serious and do his job. The main shocker being that Henry Gatewood the banker (the so called upright citizen) is the real villain trying to steal folks hard earned money.

Putting a very unlikely group together, these characters seem to grow and change in relation to each other, simply by being different from one another and revealing that throughout the story.The film is very stylistic, while still giving each character a little bit of their own unique atmosphere in their introduction. This makes it a little strange (not uncomfortable, not jarring) to see them together, filmed in the singular stylistic way throughout the film. It reflects a bit of what the characters must feel, cramped in a stagecoach with such different people. In particular, collisions of characters like Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt) and Dallas (Claire Trevor) reflect this uncomfortable atmosphere.Many shots are heavy with shadow, emotion, or suspense, yet there is still so much room for humor in Stagecoach. The balance between tension and humor is perfect, yet unexpected. Not until I had time to reflect on the film did I realize how strange it was to pair those things the way that Ford had done, but it was welcome, and not at all out of place. This play between fun and drama comes to a head in the beautiful series of final scenes.Between shots of Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) in the bar, Dallas showing Ringo Kid (John Wayne) her \"home\" at the Stagecoach's destination, and the coming danger the audience is made aware of, humor, drama, and romance swell to an exciting-action filled sequence: the climax of the film.

I find them to follow the same story line and drag on to no end, but with this film Stagecoach I found myself engaged and wanting to figure what was going to happen next to the passengers. I genially cared about the characters and their well being. I think why I liked the film so much was because of the dialog. The use of dialog between the characters really allowed you to get to know them as a person and not for their stereotype or label. I also enjoyed the comical character of the doctor. He kept a comedic tone throughout the film even when there were pressing matter or events taking place. Over all I really enjoyed this film and I would recommend that you watch it and see for yourself the out come of the very different passengers!",

But the ending ruined it for me...I was just left with asking myself, \"It ended like that?\" Not necessarily like it ended badly, but personally I didn't like it. I thought it was a bad direction to take the final, say, 15 minutes. Because for the original bulk of the film, it went rather fast paced and it was very interesting and enjoyable, but the ended was so slow. If you're in to watching all the old classic Westerns, check this out.",

The plot is very interesting, which is saying a lot because I'm normally not all that interested in westerns. I find the characters very likable--interestingly enough, I think that Dallas and Ringo, the two criminals, are actually the most round and likable characters. Technically the movie has many interesting elements, including a lot of shots of the horses/coach riding through the desert, which I always find really great because I like seeing a lot of scenery. It sets the mood wonderfully and really helps to make everything feel authentic. I also liked the shots inside the coach itself just because they really illustrate that cramped feeling you get when traveling a very long distance with many other people very well. In my opinion, that feeling alone makes the movie great. The idea that it can really make you FEEL something is just incredible, especially for a movie in a genre I usually quite dislike.",

All of the people in the stagecoach are very different, which makes it so interesting to see them interact with one another. Some of the characters you get to know more about then others, but it's amazing that the director, John Ford, was able to give you a little information about all nine characters in this film. The one scene I found to be a little cheesy was when they were being chased by Native American's towards the end. The whole gun fighting and what not didn't really match up and seemed a little unrealistic to me. All in all though, for a western film, it was very good.",

Since IMDB would only allow me 380 words, I am adding this note.Factual error: The state company that operated arround Lordsburg, NM was the Butterfield Line not the Overland Line.Music Score: The scene in Lordsburg where Ringo meets the Plummer brothers on the street uses a few bars of music lifted directly from the score of the movie \"Alexander Nevsky\" composed by Prokoviev. Watch the scene in Nevsky when the Teutonic Knights appear. Same few bars as when the Plummer boys start walking down the street in the dark. Alexander Nevsky was produced in 1938.

All the people in the stagecoach are strangers, but the film doesn't stop there we learn about all of their stories throughout the film. There is at least ten minutes or more in the film until the main character Ringo(John Wayne)appears with a grand entrance.The film makes Ringo seem so important at first is that he is seen as an outlaw and wanted for arrest. As the stagecoach moves from town to town the more people get in and even more there is news of Indians that will attack anyone once the stagecoach reaches past a certain town.This film uses some of the best editing and the only reason I say that is that this film uses very long cuts that use less editing and not only that but use the actual west for the film.The actual story for the western film may not be so appealing to people, but watching this film you are able to learn what censorship must be used because of the time it was created in. Most people watching the film will not even suspect the female character Lucy is pregnant because that can't be shown in the film the only time you know is when a baby is brought out to the other characters.This film does focus on the law a lot with the Indians that the army can't interfere with and let the group in the stagecoach survive long enough for the army to return and help them get to their destination. One other part is that Ringo takes care of the people that made him wanted for arrest. This film had to end with the good guys winning and the bad guys go away, or the law always win.",

I think every man in that movie smoked, but never around a woman what happen to those days. Another thing I was shocked about was that one woman was pregnant and know one knew the took me by surprise. The other thing all the Indians they killed there were 20 more in there place it's like you kill one and another one came back.

The doctor, the prostitute, the gambler, the socialite, the driver, the sheriff, and the \"outlaw\" come together to form a movie that is truly culturally significant. The beautiful and amazing shots of Monument Valley and of the American Southwest inspire your inner rancher or cowboy and projects the feeling of the open Southwest.

It was written by Dudley Nichols (Bringing Up Baby, Scarlet Street, The Bells of St. Mary) and Ben Hecht (His Girl Friday, Notorious, Spellbound) who based it off of Ernest Haycox's (Union Pacific, Canyon Passage, Abilene Town) original story. It stars Claire Trevor (Key Largo, Murder, My Sweet, The High and the Mighty) and John Wayne (The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Vance, Rio Bravo).Stagecoach is about a group of strangers traveling down a dangerous path on a stagecoach and while they are hunted by apaches, a romance ensues between Dallas (Claire Trevor) and the famous Ringo Kid (John Wayne).John Ford took a large risk with this movie. Before, westerns were b- movies and weren't taken very seriously after this they became a legitimate genre that were recognized by people as being actually good. Not only does he change a genre but he does a terrific job behind the camera particularly a chase scene between the stagecoach and the apache. This film was also very influential to that of Orson Welles (Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, F for Fake) who watched it 40 times before directing Citizen Kane.The Duke makes his big break in this movie that led to a career of typecasting of this very role that he plays in this movie. However, this is the one that started it all and he does quite well in it. He plays a cool and macho man that you believe. Despite this is the only character he ever played this was the first time he did it.I have little complaints about this movie, it is funny, exciting, and well acted and would recommend it to most.",

The action in the movie was also very good, it felt very real and was very exhilarating to watch. The setting and sets were also very well shot in that it gave the viewer a scope of how vast and perilous their journey really was.

            "content": "Stagecoach (1939) John Ford\nThis movie opens up a whole new view on life that I've never had, and that is the western lifestyle. The old lawless America that was in the presence of law but lived governed by the common people. I found the Ringo Kid played by John Wayne to be the best character in the movie solely based on his thoughtfulness and lack of greed. He had many chances throughout the movie to leave the stagecoach but didn't because he wanted to care for Dallas for which he really cared. I didn't really like the rest of the characters like Doc Boone and Hatfield but by the end I was moved by their actions. Doc Boone sobering up to help Mrs. Mallory deliver her daughter was the turning point for because it showed that he was more than just a drunk failure in the medical field. Hartfield to me was a nuisance because he was always trying for Mrs. Mallory who was a married woman but after finding out she was having a child, he earned my respect and an honorable death protecting the stagecoach.The movie's character relations were the best selling points for me because they all seem thought out. Although one thing I might not have picked up on was why Mallory didn't like Dallas. But all in all they all seem to interact with each other in a way that intrigued me. Buck constantly gets talked over because of his character or no one wanting to hear Gatewood's views on politics or his over reliance on the government keeping him safe. I also found Hanco...., I mean Peacock's timid attitude is hilarious because he constantly gets renamed and has to correct people in a shy way. From the beginning of the movie they all couldn't tolerate each other but when they crossed into Lordsburg they were all instantly at peace and worried about each other's well being. Aside from the obviously shaking greenscreen in the background of most of the rides all the other aspects of the movie were great.",

            "content": "Although this was not my favorite movie assigned for this class, I can recognize how pivotal this film was for the world of cinema. A true classic western with a simple plot that directors and producers still try and make today. We all know John Wayne now, but he starred in this film. Which brings me to my favorite part of this film. Which is that despite John Wayne being the star of the film, all other characters had their chance to shine. This allowed for the audience to really connect and root for or dislike other characters. Compared to the other films assigned in this class, I find this one unique in this way. For example, when I watched \"I am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang\", yes there were other characters but I couldn't really connect with them as most of the attention was put on James Allen.",

            "content": "Watching Stagecoach I was fairly forgiving of the somewhat forced and awkward moments stemming from the rather exaggerated stereotypes of the characters. Granted, one cannot deny the stunning visual scope of this film, which is yet another great epic from the magical year of American cinema, 1939. However, when the Apaches attack and the Carradine character Hatfield decides to commit suicide I was confused as to his motivations. Was he a coward, or was this somehow a heroic gesture? Was it meant as some kind of allegorical statement about the final end of the  Old South in light of the future of the Union? Did he kill himself to be spared death by an arrow or anticipated torture? If so, then what of his previous chivalry towards Mrs. Mallory, wouldn't he want to stay around to protect her, or did he figure his job was over since the Calvary arrived? This still does not make sense to me. Did I miss something here? Maybe I will watch it again. After that, I started to be more picky about the rest of the apparent  inconsistencies and exaggerations. The doctor who goes from a totally irresponsible drunk to philosophical seriousness was a bit farfetched at times, but played masterfully. All of the potential criticisms, and there could be many, are forgivable in light of the spirit of the times. I have noticed this same tendency toward stereotypical and almost allegorical characters in other films of that year, \"Union Pacific\", for example. Generally, the power of the cinematic vision outweighs the particular flaws. In those pioneering times the vision quest and the big picture of the big picture takes precedence over attention to minute psychological detail. This would later be corrected and our standards of a great classic, or great directing, would become somewhat more demanding in that regard. Oftentimes a pioneering classic both breaks new ground, and yet, of necessity (in order to get made at all) leaves behind the evidence of its growing pains.",

            "content": "This western was the first I've watched in my lifetime, it was cool how the movie was setup. The characters all had to sit in this stage coach together. All these different characters have very different personalities which gave the story a bit of humor. With that being said, whenever a predicament came about, each character wanted to settle it there own way which caused even more problems. But by the end of the movie, they all seem to have a stronger friendship. It's very realistic because when one goes through a bad experience with someone they've never met, they have to work together to get through it, which gives those a sort of morality they may never have had with someone else before. It's a great lesson, when a big problem such as the one in the movie, Native American's out to kill, they must work together to get to their destination safely.",

It was put together well, it was just hard to keep my attention at times. The fighting and shooting among each other just got old after awhile and it's just something you always see in old western movies so i feel like its never anything different. The ending was probably the best because it was a little suspenseful because they didn't show you what happened between the men until it was over and it showed who came back alive. That was probably the most interesting part to me.",

            "content": "This is not a beautiful film that changes who you were going to be but it is a classic. I like the themes of the movie and that it shows people with complex stories. These characters are shown over over again in western films and shows. The Hooker, the businessman, the drunk guy, the doctor,the gun slinger, the uptight girl and the con-man. In the film though there are some genuine points. Like when they see the baby, it's true everyone reacts the same to a new baby. I love love love the action. To get a horse to fall is very hard to accomplish. Unrealistic yes, but classic none the less. I lover that they tried to have a back story for Ringo and make him have some depth but I don't think it worked. I'm not normally a John Wayne fan but I do think he is less of a cartoon character in this film then in any other one I've seen him in. I mean, except maybe True Grit.",

First off I think John Wayne as Ringo Kid did an excellent job in this movie, he acted like a real human being and through out the whole movie he kept his composure. Even though he escaped jail he was still a really content man and kept everyone in the car calm together. I also really liked the Character Doc. Even though he was a drunk he still thinks about other people, he is not selfish. Also the camera is great in this movie, the low angle shots throughout the movie are amazing for 1939. If you like Western Movies you need to see this classic.",

The best part of this film was the depth in which you learn about each character. There wasn't just one main character that we got to watch grow but a group of people who grew not only individually but also as a group. While i did enjoy the the character growth i felt that other than that the plot felt slightly boring and bland. There were little spurts of action but not enough to maintain my focus throughout the whole movie. Overall this movie was enjoyable but a little bit more action would have made it perfect.",

Wayne's performance is restrained and charming, and among his other stagecoach colleagues are an empathetic prostitute driven out of town, suitably named Dallas (Claire Trevor), the vulnerable stagecoach driver Buck (Andy Devine), an alcoholic and shameless doctor Boone (Thomas Mitchell), a cowardly whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek), a rigorous marshal Curly (George Bancroft), the mysterious gambler Hatfield (John Carradine), an unlikable banker Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), and a stressed wife Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt). With these characters--empathetic, sympathetic, mysterious, charming, likable, unlikable--all crammed in a claustrophobic stagecoach, we ultimately get a character study with Western thrills thrown in there to fill us with anxiety in losing one of them.",

The action scenes in the film and dialogue is together well. The fast camera cuts and close ups of the stage coached being chased and shot at created a good chase scene in the film. The round and flat characters work well and add comedy to the story as well like the Dr's Drinking problem and his relationship with the liquor salesman who's traveling on the stage coach. Well done film.",
