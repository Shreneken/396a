            "review_title": "What a bunch of weirdo's! Awesome movie!",
            "content": "Crash caused a huge stir in the United Kingdom. Many conservatives were outraged by the combination of sex, already an issue of danger because of aids, and traffic accidents. Dangerous driving is like smoking, a subject that you just can't touch without many moral watchdogs chasing you through a hellish puritan junkyard.I remember seeing this and a middle aged to elderly man in the theater began to quite obviously...ahem...trouser cough. This was one hell of a way to clear the cinema! That moment is pretty much like this film. Crash has weird sex and masterbation, stuff that you do not really want to see. But David Cronenberg with the help of James Ballard drags us into a world that just takes the whole 'I love cars' boy racer thing way too far! It is just not healthy...Ballard writes in a bleak monotone. A monotone that Chuck Palahniuk seeks to imitate unsuccessfully. All of his characters are alien because of their lack of emotion. Cronenberg takes this aspect and runs with it. This makes the film good not because of the familiarity and sympathy that the viewer can build with the characters. It is actually quite the opposite, the film strikes the viewer because of the sheer UNREALITY of what is happening. The complete and utter icy way that everything is presented just leaves the viewer going 'what?' Am I watching a bunch of jellyfish here?  The characters are so jaded. Trying desperately to experience emotion in an industrialized emotionless world. A world that has become nothing more than a production line. Good Ford! Sorry, Huxley joke. Nerdy but necessary.Also, Cronenberg is presenting a discourse that the famous intellectual Donna Haraway puts forward. That basically the human race has become cyborgs. The the human form is constantly changing. That machines are changing our humanity and crash seems to say that our own sexuality can mingle with the mundane machines that we hold so dear. Oh no! I am getting flashbacks of the crazed artist Stellarc...no...no...no! Besides I bet in the future, terminators would make much more money as sexual partners, rather than as assassins. Imagine that, a beautiful spouse who always thinks your right and never argues with you. I LOVE THE FUTURE!Sex is considered to be the ultimate joining of two people. The most intimate way that human beings can connect to one another. Wrong! This film suggests that sex means...well, nothing really. Procreation and a simple physical reaction. This is shown by James Spader and his wife's, Deborah Unger, relationship. These two are so jaded they tell each other their sexual adventures for attempted excitement but feel absolutely nothing. Certainly not some sought of emotional closeness to one another.This film is just so incredibly empty. But it is also a comment on the human condition. How we make almost suicidal attempts to attain pleasure. If this was a film about heroin for instance, about junkies, this film would be much more understandable. Ballard has taken this addictive, self destructive behaviour and replaced it with an everyday object. The motor car. It is a brilliantly simple idea! But look at how many people it has horrified and offended! C'mon people, are we really this stupid? Sex and drugs, sex and violence. Sex, drugs and violence. These things are all o.k. Portrayed constantly in Hollywood movies. Van Diesel anybody? But sex and car accidents, how dare you? What kind of a sick freak are you??!! Consider how hypocritical this is when you watch something like Fast and the Furious.This is also a film that features the psychological nature of fetish heavily. Instead of having the common fetish for breasts or bottoms, which again people might find more understandable. The fetish is actually for wounds and crash test dummy videos! That scene with Rosanna Arquette, ewww! Would that work? This is definitely something that no one should try at home.David Cronenberg really deserves credit for making this film. He really has some big balls and respects the intelligence of the audience, which I however do not. All of the actors deserve much credit for taking on some truly difficult material. They must really trust the director. I'm surprised no one said 'no David, you are out to lunch on this one!' This film could have become a parody so easily. Never have I seen a film where everyone in the audience seemed so uncomfortable with the material. In fact, when I saw this film without the trouser coughing, people still walked out. It hasn't been since Salo that I have see a movie upset so many people. I give this 8 out of 10 for sheer weirdness. A great moment in a   major auteur's career who is not afraid to take risks. Hollywood take note!",

            "content": "David Cronenberg's Crash was one of those \"dirty\" movies I more than likely wasn't supposed to rent let alone watch when the NC-17 cut first came into existence on video (and, if anything, the film was more than an eye-opener in my young teen state, going even further than I had seen at the time with Boogie Nights or Kids). But I didn't pay quite as much attention to the story as I should've, aside from the James Dean subplot (as I remembered it anyway, with Elias Koteas's character), and from the very dark atmosphere. It was almost TOO dark at the time, and I stayed away until recently when it was shown on TV late one night. Seeing it now I'm much more absorbed into the wretchedly but totally, sensually charged work by the actors and the crew, and Cronenberg's utmost trust and professionalism with both. It certainly has that effect on a first viewing of veering way too close into the soft-core boundaries, and even seems like the kind of thing that I used to see in that 'scandalous' section of mainstream adult films as a kid like Last Tango in Paris. But the psychology behind the characters ends up being more striking than anything, and like many of Cronenberg's films, the duality of man (and woman, apparently) comes strongly into play, and the merging of the two as usually becomes the case.James Spader is in one of his very best performances- albeit only somewhat removed from the sexual deviants of Sex Lies & Videotape and Secretary (maybe closer to the latter, however without any of that film's outright satire)- as Ballard, also the author this film is based upon. He gets in a car accident, a horrible one, that kills a doctor and leaves his wife (Holly Hunter) injured both physically and psychologically. But Ballard and his wife (Deborah Kara Unger, very good as well) get brought into this strange world that's been built around Vaughn (Koteas, perhaps in one of his top 3 best pieces of work, very creepy but somehow convincing early on, at least to his new arrivals). He is a man who is completely enveloped into his psyche of car-crash sex, and how history ends up adding a mystique to it all (hence the James Dean references, which are very amusingly pathological). But this all becomes very dangerous, if only on some subversive level, when Ballard, his wife, and Hunter's Helen Remington get involved in this underground cult.Seeing the film again, I'm a lot more struck this time after seeing other Cronenberg work how the style slips so amazingly into the content of the picture. The first time around, the style almost seemed to be just another side to the content, that it was obvious to have such a wild yet controlled technique, particularly for the sex &/or car crash scenes. This is as much a credit to Cronenberg's poetic touches to the material as it is to DP Peter Suschitzky and Howard Shore's music, which somehow rises above being too pornographic to being really touching. In fact, after seeing it again very late at night and not remembering the entire film, I may even need to see it again to let it all sink in. But really this won't be the case for all- the NC-17 rating isn't too unwarranted in this case, even if it's more a rating for the nature of the sexual contact and aggressiveness of the fetishism as opposed to something like the Dreamers where there was blatant nudity a lot of the time. I wouldn't dare recommend the R-rated version, however, as the whole point is to see it all in its un-tarnished view. It's a harsh vision painted here of people reaching out for some kind of connection through the most destructive way imaginable. One thing's for certain, once you've seen it there's no mistaking this from Paul Haggis's Crash (and, for me, this beats out Haggis's contrived good-intention machine any day).",

            "review_title": "An anti-erotic exploration of the hollowness of modern life",
            "content": "Crash is a very sexually explicit film, but if you buy or rent this movie expecting it to be an evening's erotic entertainment, you are going to be disappointed, because it is also an anti-erotic film.Even in the midst of frenzied lovemaking, the characters remain distant, their voices quiet and abstracted, their gazes directed inward.  These are people who have been told all their lives by their culture, by TV and movies, that sex is, on the one hand, the most perfect form of communion and connection with another human being; and, on the other hand, that it is the ultimate in transcendent and transformative experiences.  Instead, they discover to their horror that even during sex they still feel nothing. They crave connection, they are starved for a glimpse of transcendence, but no matter what they do, no matter who they do it with or how often, while their bodies may feel passion, their minds and hearts remain cold and empty.\nIn the more recent movie Pleasantville, the Jennifer/Mary Sue character is unable to feel anything either, and remains stubbornly black and white no matter how much sex she has, until her brother suggests that \"maybe it isn't the sex\" that is the key to moving from black and white to color, from passionlessness to feeling.  Unfortunately, in Crash, there is no one to suggest to David and Catherine Ballard that maybe it isn't through sex that they will find the transformation and connection they are craving.  So they instead seek more and more extreme forms of sexual stimulation, only to be disappointed again and again.James is hurt in a car crash, and during his stay in the hospital he meets Helen (who was in the other car) and later Vaughan, a man who like James and Catherine is in desperate search of feeling, only he looks for it in the violence of car crashes.  With Helen, at first James, then Catherine too is drawn into Vaughan's world, where sex and death (eros and thanatos for you Freudians) meet in the twisted metal of wrecked cars and the mutilated bodies of the victims of fatal car crashes and the survivors of near-fatal ones.They attend staged recreations of famous car crashes, like the one that killed James Dean.  They have sex in crashed cars, and start touring crash sites on the freeway as a form of foreplay. They begin to watch films of crash tests and fatal race accidents like other people would watch erotic films, and to have sex with people whose bodies have been mutilated by car crashes.But not even the horror of mutilation or the adrenaline rush of near-death experience can lend James and Catherine's desperate coupling the depth of feeling that they so desperately crave.Like all the people who buy expensive automobiles to give them a feeling of power and independence, only to discover that no matter how snazzy their car is, they still feel powerless and unhappy, James and Catherine have bought into one of our culture's Big Lies, that sex is the answer.  This film shows us that it is not.",

            "review_title": "This film is fascinating but definitely not for everyone",
            "content": "I love this film. I have now viewed it three times and I still keep getting something new out of each viewing. I think it's one of Cronenberg's best. It is not, however, for the uninitiated. By that, I mean those who are not familiar with Cronenberg's previous work, and those who have not read J.G. Ballard, whose novel was the basis for this film. Cronenberg excels at bringing difficult pieces of fiction to film. This is one such example.The written works of J.G.Ballard are generally, dark, dreary, and disturbing psychological fiction. The characters in them are often very disturbed and socially dysfunctional. These are people who, often due to unusual circumstances, are not in their right minds. In Crash, we are observing a group of characters who are all survivors of horrific car crashes. Like many crash survivors, they are, during their period of recovery, in shock. They are badly shaken. They are recovering from severe physical injuries, and they are disoriented, fearful, and emotionally numb. Instead of recovering in the normal fashion, (how sad that we've come to think of auto accidents as normal) these characters stumble into the car crash cult of Vaughan. Vaughan, who is brilliantly portrayed by Elias Koteas, is a scientist who believes that there is a strong connection between the violence of a car crash and the passion of the sexual act.He easily indoctrinates the other characters into his mode of behavior and beliefs. By staging car crashes for entertainment, by initiating traffic altercations with his followers and ultimately finishing with some very warped sex, usually involving cars, there is a metaphor being created. Accidents, and the viewing of them becomes foreplay. It's the eroticism of the automobile taken to an extreme.Our society has had, what is often referred to as a \"love affair\" with the automobile. This love affair has resulted in a worldwide addiction to a means of transportation that is, in reality, often very unhealthy and destructive. Aside from the aftermath of pollution and the sheer carnage of the ever rising highway accident rate, this addiction also increases people's isolation from each other. Hidden in their private shells, they move about, only interacting with one another as necessary. This interaction rarely becomes intimate until it is violent, as in aggressive driving and accidents .In Crash, the characters are all portrayed as cold hearted, numb, and incapable of true intimacy with each other(they sure have a lot of sex though). They are only capable of intimacy through their cars.This film is a bizarre metaphor for the human condition and how it is affected by our choice of technology. It is not meant to make car crashes look sexy. It is meant to draw attention to how our most familiar technology has changed us and made us less human. I love this film. Brilliant cast. Great cinematography. An excellent soundtrack by Howard Shore (multiple layers of cleanly played, very dissonant electric guitar, sounding like a cross between Sonic Youth and Brian Ruryk). Only Cronenberg would have the guts to tackle a subject as difficult as this particular work of Ballard's. I think he did quite well.Depending on your mood at the time of viewing, this film can range from being shocking, amusing, revolting, hilarious, to even just plain boring. It's a great piece of art, but you really do have to be in the right mood for it.",

            "content": "David Cronenburg's interesting but flawed film 'Crash', adapted from James Ballard's novel (Ballard also gives his name to the leading character), attracted huge amounts of controversy on its release and has one of the most striking voting profiles on IMDB that I have seen - also equal returns for every number from 1 to 10.  In fact, there's a lot of admire in this sweaty, atmospheric adaptation that perfectly captures the sense of heightened alienation that charactersises much of Ballard's prose.  While among the cast, Deborah Kara Unger is sexy as always, Elias Koteas is suitably creepy and even James Spader is kind-of OK, if you don't mind him doing that \"lost little college boy grown up to be a pervert\" thing that he first perfected as Graham in 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', a role he basically reprises here.But - and let's get real for a minute - this is a film about people who are turned on by car crashes! Now, what the hell is that all about?  If you ask me, the film is trying to say something about the need for transgression in an age with no real taboos - so its characters push at an endlessly receding door, until in the end only death itself can offer a way out.  The problem is that the film suffers from the same problems as the world it portrays - these people have no moral rules, so their actions carry no implications beyond themselves - which leaves us with an idea, with happenings, but no narrative \"drive\" as such.  Without anything to set against their nihilistic desires, 'Crash' coveys no sense of tragedy; just driving around in cars, with sex.",

            "content": "Director David Cronenberg took a wrong turn with this failed sex-melodrama about car crashes and climaxes. A young movie producer is involved in a violent two-car smash-up which leaves one man dead and his wife briefly hospitalized--and yet aroused. The producer and the woman begin a sexual relationship with car wrecks as their aphrodisiac--and they're not alone; the producer's wife is already a player in this ungainly game, and so is a local performance artist who is sexually charged by recreating celebrity crashes. Cronenberg, who also adapted J.G. Ballard's novel, was allegedly attracted not to the eroticism prevalent in the material, but rather the opportunity to delve into his characters' scarred and warped psyches (Roger Ebert called the film \"A pornographic movie without pornography in it\"). Unfortunately, the characters are a heavy-breathing group of hedonistic (or is that nihilistic?) freaks, pale and vacant-eyed like horny zombies, who seem to have the time and the energy (and the insurance!) to engage in such a lifestyle. What is Cronenberg's point--that death behind the steering wheel represents the ultimate orgasm? If eroticism wasn't Cronenberg's primary objective in tackling this tasteless project, that pretty much leaves everyone involved bumping and grinding without a purpose. Shaken but not stirred, if you will. *1/2 from ****",

The lame James befriends the widow of his victim, Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), and the sick maniac for accidents Vaughan (Elias Koteas) and he joins a world of people that feels pleasure watching and provoking car accidents, dragging Catherine with him. \"Crash\" is one of the sickest and weirdest movies I have ever seen. In the 90's, when I saw it for the first time on VHS, I liked it more than now. I have just watched again on a high-quality DVD and I found this time a pointless erotic story with an unbelievable plot that has the only intention of shocking. There is no message, no nothing but sick people having kinky sex related to car crashes. Deborah Kara Unger is extremely sexy and hot in one of her first works and the choreography of the accidents is quite perfect.

And put your dirty socks in the hamper.If you think YOU'RE warped wait until you see the characters who populate this movie. You'll not only emerge from the experience reassured, you'll wind up feeling like a paragon of normality.The story (if that's the word for it) has Spader getting into a head-on smasheroo with a car in which Hunter is a passenger. Her husband is thrown through the windshield and killed. Spader is hospitalized with various pieces of shiny steel holding his long bones in place. He finds the pain and discomfort and immobilization so arousing that when his wife (Unger) visits him it leads to masturbation. There's a lot of that sort of thing in this movie.You'd never think Holly Hunter would suffer from such a paraphilia but she does. So does Spader's wife. Hunter and Spader run into each other, figuratively, in a garage full of wrecked cars and make furious love in one of the surrealistically twisted carcasses.Before you know it, the Spader family and Hunter have fallen in with a group of -- well, there's no easy name for people of this quality. Koteas, the head of this underground cohort, is some sort of show-business stunt driver who, with a few associated, restages fatal car crashes of celebrities. Spader and Hunter are one of a dozen or two spectators who come to watch the staging of the 1955 crash between James Dean's Porsche and a Ford driven by somebody named Turnipseed. None of the men involved in the stunt wear helmets or seat belts and there are no roll bars or any of that wimpy stuff. Koteas' shiny Porsche Spider backs up, then speeds full blast into the front of the Ford. Kaboom. Sirens burping, the cops arrive and everyone scuttles for cover. It is never explained exactly how Koteas makes enough money to smash up beautifully restored Fords and Porsches. (His next big show will involve the decapitation of Jane Mansfield.) At Koteas' home they watch movies of test crashes with dummies instead of porn.Spader's wife has seemed relatively reasonable up to now but she finds herself turned on by crashes, stunt men, and the rest. When she and Spader are making love (this time in bed, not in the back seat), she asks about Koteas. \"Did you see his penis?\" Spader: \"He says it's all scarred from a motorcycle accident.\" Unger ecstatically: \"Ewwwww.\" Anyway, to get on with it, one thing leads to another -- one thing being crashes and the other being flaming death amidst twisted metal. What with everyone being swept up in the craze and wanting still more of the excitement, the only sensible way to arouse and satisfy your wife is to smash into her car and kill her, right? Two Big Os for the price of one -- Orgasm through Obliteration. So Spader continually rams the convertible driven by his willing wife until it flips over on the side of the highway. But she's not dead after all. \"I'm all right,\" she mumbles. \"Maybe next time. Maybe next time,\" he whispers to her and then does her bloody and half conscious body in the sere grass.So what's it all about, you ask? You might find that SOME people have no idea but I have a very firm answer. I don't know. At one point Spader asks Koteas why he's so interested in this stuff and Koteas replies portentously: \"It's the reshaping of the human body by modern technology.\" Gosh.It's an awesome statement but what does it mean? How is modern technology reshaping the human body? Does he mean that vehicular accidents tear it all to bits? Is he somehow thinking of the Thighmaster or simulacrum that imitate rowing or cross-country skiing or walking upstairs? Is Cronenberg really after ROCK HARD ABS? Here's what I think he's up to. It's been called self testing. It's seeing how far you can violate ordinary tastes and still get away with it, rather like a toddler who insists on wobbling along by himself until he either falls down or somebody picks him up. The real message of the movie is that there is no message. It's a highly ritualized violation of the viewer's expectations of taste. A Halloween prank.What else could it be? It's certainly not a realistic portrayal of a bunch of perverts. Where could they possibly get insurance after the first dozen crashes? And the fear and sexual responses are antagonistic, the former mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the latter by the parasympathetic. Somebody who jumps off a cliff might have a spontaneous ejaculation, a sympathetic reflex, but he's not going to have an erection.I don't mean to pan the movie entirely. Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. (There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas, but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic.) At any randomly chosen moment, the screen will show cars on the highway, cars crashing, people having sex in cars, or people talking about cars crashing and people having sex in cars. And it's neatly directed too. What shiny metal and what frangible flesh! Everything but the bodies seem gleaming and cold.My only problem was that I didn't like it. Not my perversion.",

            "review_title": "Challenging crash",
            "content": "David Cronenberg is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors (even if not quite one of my personal favourites), despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that. They are incredibly well made, and as well as being unsettling some have a dark yet subtle wit or a poignant emotional core. All these are the reasons for my admiration and appreciation for him.Of all his films, 'Crash' (not to be confused with the film that, undeservedly in my opinion, won the Best Picture Oscar in its year, over the infinitely superior 'Brokeback Mountain', but that's another story) is his most controversial, causing a stir in Britain at the time. One can totally see why, with its uncompromising and difficult subject matter being portrayed unsettlingly and uniquely, something that fascinated and disturbed many yet sickened and perplexed just as many others. When it comes to me and my perception of 'Crash', it is a bit of a tricky one and not an easy film to rate and review. Do not consider it a misunderstood masterpiece or one of his best, at the same it's far from being on my worst films ever list and doesn't crash and burn. It's certainly an interesting and well made film, but other Cronenberg films connected with me far more emotionally and had me gripped more. Especially 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly'.Contrary to what those who hated 'Crash' say, those who say that there are no redeeming qualities whatsoever (personally can never say that about any lesser Cronenberg), there is a lot to admire. As with all Cronenberg films, 'Crash' looks great, with photography that is both beautiful, almost dream-like in places, and harrowing, when at its most harrowing it really hits hard. Absolutely loved the opening credits sequence, Cronenberg always delivers in this aspect. A lot of effort clearly went into the design of it visually, it is beautiful to watch while also being very creepy. Howard Shore's score does add quite a bit, it is truly haunting stuff that also brings shivers down the spine when necessary. Cronenberg's style is unmistakable, if more purposefully clinical than usual.He does admirably adhere close to the detached nature of the source material, which accounts for why viewers were and still are left cold and why his direction is more clinical. What is most interesting about the film and why it is controversial is its depiction of sex and violence, there is a lot of both, very daring and shocking at the time (still is) and both had seldom been depicted in this way before. The violence is uncompromising and does churn the stomach, even those who have seen a lot of violent films (myself included) will find themselves deeply disturbed. The sex scenes are beautifully choreographed and filmed while also being a mix of explicit, sensual, strange and ominous. When they merge, the depiction is vividly graphic, and for quite a large number it was/is hard to take, to me it was harrowing but in a way it intrigued. The film also made me think. Despite never getting to know the characters (Vaughan is the most interesting) or care for them, that doesn't stop Cronenberg from drawing great performances from a gifted cast. Found the standouts to be Elias Koteas, quite frightening here, and Deborah Kara Unger, who is equally astonishing.On the other hand, it is very easy to see why anybody would say 'Crash' is a challenging film and hard to like. While appreciating what it set out and tried to do, the emotional investment wasn't there for me, things that were there in 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly', and there were times where the intentional coldness was overdone. Likewise with the bizarre factor, especially later on where things increasingly stop making sense until an ending that leaves one dumbfounded-ly scratching their heads.While some of 'Crash' was thought-provoking, it was not always easy understanding what the point of it was and what it was trying to say. It also became repetitive with the sexual acts and violence becoming more frequent and in some cases not necessary, some of the film was pretty uneventful dramatically, the pace was very sluggish and the film could have been 20-25 minutes shorter because there was not enough plot, which was fairly slight structurally to begin with, to sustain the film's length.In summary, didn't bowl me over and the controversy is more than understandable, but do highly appreciate the effort and can't be too hard on it. 6/10",

The themes (sexual \"deviance,\" violence, obsession) that Cronenberg was exploring are very relevant to today's post-modern society. However, this film didn't get the message across. Supposedly the book by James Ballard deals more with our obsession with fame and celebrities; that was not dealt with in the film and it should have been. It would have resulted in a more coherent piece of art. As you watch the movie, you feel like a kid watching late-night TV and stumbling upon something \"dirty\" that you know you aren't supposed to see. That's about it. As an adult, you know that there is supposed to be symbolism, an underlying metaphor or allegory, but the viewer is never really let in on the secret. Instead, we see a lot of strange sex scenes, car crashes and empty dialogue. I wanted to like this film, but it was boring, a little pretentious, and left me wanting more substance. 4 out of 10",

            "content": "David Cronenberg's most recent film. Set in Los Angeles, James Spader and Deborah Unger play a couple drawn into an  underworld of odd characters who are sexually aroused by automobile crashes. Spader discovers this when he hits Holly  Hunter's car head on, killing her husband. They become lovers, meeting in a parking garage, having (unsatisfying) sex in a parked car. Later they are involved with a clique that re-enacts famous crashes for excitement.It's a fascinating premise and it starts off quite promising. However, Spader's patented flat, emotionally dead anti-hero never shows a spark of life. Nor do any of the other characters. And yet, while there is an attempt to capture that serene surface perfected by David Lynch, the attempt fails. In the end we do not care what happens to any of these characters. It becomes an exercise in guessing who will sleep with who next. Even the final scene, in which Spader and Unger are brought back together, fails to move because we have never cared about either of them. It felt like getting the news that your cousin twice removed, who you have never met, is getting married. You know you are supposed to feel happy for them but, frankly, you just don't care.On the other hand, the movie is visually lush, and does take some legitimate risks. Spader has a gay sex-scene that, as tame as it was, is a true rarity in American theaters. Even \"Faith! Hope! and Glory!\" did not come close. One scene deserves especial mention. A group including Spader, Hunter, and Rosanne Arquette are watching video tapes of safety tests of automobiles, starring the test dummies. As they watch they become increasingly aroused. They are all completely absorbed in films that were shot by engineers. Like low-budget porn, the videos are grainy, out of focus, and have no camera movement. Nevertheless, the scene is oddly hysterical.Cronenberg also keeps close to home in another way. He always seems to be obsessed with violation. In his films this is represented literally. Here we have a number of characters whose bodies are violated with pins and braces administered by doctors. Not for the squeamish, although the scenes are not gory. But to see the male nurse just poking at people's apparatus and wounds is unsettling (recalls the Monty Python skit where the major missing a leg has it poked by his superior office, asking if it hurts).",

            "content": "There is the very real possibility that CRASH is an elaborate joke. That is the only way that this monumentally idiotic mess could possibly be explained. Certainly there is nothing in this silliness that in any way touches upon normal human behavior as most people understand it. Indeed, I even suspect you would have trouble finding any psychologist or psychiatrist who would have ever encountered the type of freaky weirdoes who populate this film -- or for that matter even have read about such freaky weirdoes in text books. The film deals with people who get sexual aroused by automobile accidents and the pain and suffering such wrecks cause. I suppose anything is possible and such people may exist, but CRASH takes it one step further and suggests that there is this cult of individuals who somehow network to fulfill their fantasies of motorized mayhem. Two such characters are played by Holly Hunter and James Spader. In a most grotesque parody of \"meeting cute\" the two encounter each other when he crosses the center line and smashes head-on into her car, killing her husband and apparently getting her hot and bothered in the process. Hunter's Helen is already into smashup sex, so, after a stay in the hospital, the grieving widow naturally rushes Spader -- playing James Ballard, the author of the original novel -- into her small band of bumper car aficionados. In addition to being wreck 'n' roll fanatics, the people must also be incredibly rich. They like to recreate infamous celebrity auto accidents, such as James Dean's roadside death. For instance, to do so, they have to buy or recreate not only a replica of Dean's rare 1955 Porsche Spyder, but also an almost equally rare 1950 Ford coupe that was the other car involved in the crash. With these and a variety of other new and used cars, we're talking about thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars for autos destined to be demolished in the name of foreplay. Talk about expensive quickies. A couple of tickets to a demolition derby would be far more economical -- and a virtual orgy. Of course, the film isn't really about auto eroticism; it is about sexual obsession in general. The fetish in question could have been about anything that inspires abnormal lust. The characters could have been turned on by, say, internet porn, gambling, bungee jumping, farm animals or jiggling Jell-O molds. But, gosh darn it, car wrecks are so much more photogenic. It doesn't seem to bother the filmmakers that they are perpetuating a correlation between sex and violence, because, well, they apparently believe such a link already exists. Nor do they seem to be aware that they are undermining their own efforts by building an oh-so serious drama around a ludicrously grim (and lame) joke. As such, the insipidness of the story is accentuated by the pomposity of the storytelling. Director David Cronenberg approaches the story as though he were Igmar Bergman directing PERSONA. Other than a few lapses, the film is cold and lifeless and empty; though it is somewhat appropriate that a film celebrating a sexual obsession with automobiles would depict sex as an utterly mechanical act. Cronenberg and crew do slip up a couple of times and inspire moments worthy of laughing out loud. One scene in particular is hilarious: Hunter and several others are lounging around watching videos of auto crash tests like they are watching porn videos; One particularly messy smash up prompts Hunter to excitedly demand that it be shown again in slow motion. Crash dummies watching crash dummies, as it were.There is an unwritten rule of movie sex: If films featuring explicit sex are fun and comic, then it is pornographic; but if the sex is joyless, degrading and dispassionate, then it is art -- or, sex as something good is dirty; sex as something bad is honest. It is this simplistic, neo-puritanical attitude that makes films like CRASH so insultingly hypocritical: Make a big deal about filming graphic, lurid sex scenes, then condescendingly shake one's finger at the audience to remind them how perverse such activity is. It's like slipping an alcoholic a drink in order to self-righteously chastise him for being a drunk. Had the filmmakers shucked the smug moralizing and openly played the material as sly satire, perhaps CRASH could have been a sharp commentary on modern romance, both between people and with their cars -- speeding as flirtation, road rage as rape, reckless driving as masturbation, the head-on collision as the one night stand; marriage as the aftermath of roadside carnage. But I don't think the film has the courage or the intellect to explore such themes. The film plays it safe, giving us a tale of obsession where the obsession is devoid of the thrill, the energy or the naughtiness of actually giving in to an impulse. It's an addiction without a high, but worse no expectation of there being a high. Here is a film that wants us to identify with a psychological quirk that is, to say the least, ridiculous, but it doesn't even make the effort to frame the quirk in a realistic fashion. How are we to care one way or the other -- emotionally, dramatically, socially or even clinically -- about people the film itself seems to regard as emotionally dead freaks? CRASH thinks it is speeding recklessly down uncharted roads, but it is up on blocks, spinning its wheels and destined for the junkyard.",

With The Fly, he remade a sci-fi classic and gave it a new spin.  And with Dead Ringers, he explored the strange dual life of twins.  With Crash, Cronenberg pushes us, but I don't know what kind of repsonse he was going for.  The story concerns James Ballard and a group of crash enthusiasts.  After his initial crash, Ballard meets up with Helen Remington and a mysterious man named Vaughn. Ballard is soon introduced to the strange world of car crashes, and the rush of sexual tension. Now I can see where there is a thin line that separates these two acts. Both bring out a strong physical and emotional reaction, but the characters in the film are too detached from life. There is sex without pleasure, and the only way these people can experience pleasure, is through the trauma of an automobile accident.  The film moves along at a leisurely pace and nothing ever really happens.  There is no dramatic need that these characters have to fill.  There is no urgency in their actions and their motivations are clouded, by what I interpret as boredom. Cronenberg has done some fine work in the past, and I think he'll come along and shock us with a truly original film.  Until then, stick with the four I mentioned at the top.",

I suspect the REASON there's no story is also the reason that none of these people have any kind of life at all - no work, no play - outside their shared fetish, and that they don't utter so much as a single line of dialogue (not even a \"nice weather we're having\") that doesn't relate directly to it.  Cronenberg simply couldn't be bothered with all that stuff.  If he can cut directly to the subject matter and show us the car crash fetishists being car crash fetishists, why should he bother showing us anything else?

            "content": "\"How many orgasms per mile can you get ?\" This is one of the catching tag lines of the movie \"Crash\". Again Cronenberg delivers a dive into human psychic, the world of dark obsession, and twisted fantasy's. The plot:A sexually frustrated couple starts experimenting with the outlines of anonymous sex. It is the husband James Ballard (James Spader) who gets into a car crash with Dr. Ellen Remington (Holly Hunter) and her husband. They crash frontally and both Ballard and Remington are seriously injured. Remington's husband dies while being launched from his seat through his own windshield into Ballards. Ballard ends up in the hospital, traumatized, trying to recover from his injuries. He gets into deeper contact with Helen Remington. Their mutual Crash-victim status brings them closer together, ultimately delivering them into the sump-oil-soaked world of the pathological Vaughan (Elias Koteas). Renegade scientist and leader of a strange subterranean group, Vaughan is only able to achieve sexual release by crashing into people on the motorways surrounding Heathrow airport. Getting sucked into his world, Ballard becomes obsessed with car crashes, and dives into the illegal world of \"thrill seeking\" and raw and hard (but mostly cold) sex.The review:To be quiet honest \"Crash\" is a very underestimated picture. First of all there are a serious amount of people who thought that the subject was laughable, and not to be taken serious, for how could you take something like this serious ? After crashing your car and being injured, having sex with the victim of a car-crash ? Apart from the post-traumatic stress that can appear after such an incident it also triggers a lot of adrenaline, which is almost a self produced drug. Cronenberg cuts a subject which is still very much of a taboo, the \"thrill seeking taboo\". You got a lot of so called thrill seekers now these days, which can result into ghost riding on the freeway, climbing on buildings without security etc. All in all the thrill seek element isn't that original. This is where Cronenberg has looked for a thrill that rushes into a perverse sexual outburst. After the shock of crashing into a car, the adrenaline, the rush of the experience becomes so real, you feel so alive that you need to let it all out, which comes into the act of \"making love\". Cronenberg is trying to paint the audience a picture of an event like this. Based on J.G. Ballards novel \"Crash\" which was quiet detached and cold, the director follows in style with the dark freeways of Canada, showing that even in your car you are not always save, and how a car can become the ultimate \"drive\" for pleasure. The problem with this film (like many others) is that it is so far out there that you either hate it or love it. The pacing is rather slow in the beginning and its hard to get into, if you don't understand the psychology that lies underneath the dialog. The movie has a solid script but the subject and material is not accessible for everybody. James Spader who often (he almost could be a stereotype) plays sexual frustrated protagonists (\"Sex,Lies,and Videotapes\", \"Secretary\", \"Speaking of Sex\") delivers a terrific performance here. His distant and alienated acting fits perfectly into the dark en and sensual story, and doesn't come as a insincere or \"over the top\". Some people felt that Koteas and Hunter performances where a little flat, but they have just the balance between low key and an over the top performance (Koteas more than Hunter). You got to keep in mind that these people are already deranged from the beginning. What you see is simply a drop falling into bucket that is overflowing. The use of light and shadow is very subtle and excellently done by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky. He really knows how to pull you into a certain world, that LOOKS like ours but feels very different. In any case I can recommend the movie if you want to watch something different. A lot of people will not understand the weight this film carries, and therefore this movie will be underrated, or simply will be put aside as boring or unrealistic. THIS IS A MISTAKE,... don't put it away, watch it, and feel the awkwardness. The result ? \"Humans really are quiet weird creatures...\"",

But Fight Club wove a more engaging neurosis; `Zed' had a stronger disturbing vision; `Bladerunner' a more thorough sense of programmed sex; `Fearless' more visceral crashes; and `Leaving Las Vegas,' more relentless characters marching to oblivion (though it is not in the class of the other films).Cronenberg has a fine visual sense, but it is not strongly individual. And the same can be said of his metaphoric fabric. So although this film is worth watching, I cannot consider it important. What really bothered me was how restrained it was. We needed stronger discomfort (like `Shadow of the Vampire'), a more radical visual statement (like `Pillow Book'), excessively greater perversions (The Coens could do it), increasingly outrageous acting style (Garafalano, where are you?). This is a pretty tepid film given its aspirations.This is not a film about sex in the real sense -- it amazes me that anyone could think so -- rather, the technology of filming sex and what works in films for an audience with escalating needs. Folks: the chief character is a FILM producer. The drivers in the club are FILM stunt drivers. The re-enactments are of FILM actors' deaths.Spader was chosen, I'm sure, because of his balance of in-your-face I'm-a-character no I'm-an-actor stances in `Sex, Lies' which also was a film about meeting the expectations of film audiences by directly phoning the sex memes. (Note how most of the sex -- and car smashes -- are from behind?)This film is a big goof on anyone who sees it and thinks it is about sex.

In the hospital, the film's forced sexuality never stops, considering a visit Spader gets from a handy blonde.  Through a series of weird events and experiences involving automobiles I would rather not get into, the film's self-important message is clear: How modern technology changes the human body i.e. car crashes.First of all, we've been presented this message in countless other ways. Cronenberg has just found a sick and explicit way to present it.  Secondly, what these characters think and do exist only to 'present' this overblown message.  They have no other duties, ideas, character traits, or appeal other than to go wild sexually in all kinds of cars, car washes, and car chases.  What is this?

CRASH was highly controversial when it was first released and many people thought it was a hilariously bad movie. I remember seeing it in the theater when it was first released and being really bored by it and that impression was the same this time. I thought I'd pay the film a second viewing after more than fifteen years but sadly the end result was pretty much the same. I'm not going to say that these types of people aren't out there. Shows like \"Taboo\" have shown that there are some pretty wild people out there. With that in mind, I really couldn't laugh at any of the people shown here but there's still no reason why I couldn't just be completely bored with them and not give two cents about what they were doing. There are certain lines that are usually not crossed in movies and this one here crosses quite a few.

I'd also argue that the only purpose of this movie was to show weird sex in as many different ways as possible. I've read interviews with the director and it's clear he had a certain thing in mind when making the film but whatever those ideas were must have been left in his mind. For the most part the cast is good but even the performances can't raise the film any higher.

In other quarters, the picture was almost universally loathed and condemned as perverted and repulsive. Westminster Council in London banned it outright. The Daily Mail and Evening Standard in particular saw the film as threatening to public morals, criticising it regularly, often on their front pages. Christopher Tookey, writing in The Daily Mail, caused outrage amongst the disabled lobby by using the phrase 'sex with cripples'. This seems to have caused more offence than by anything in the film. Alexander Walker described Crash as \"a movie beyond the bounds of depravity.\" So what's really been going on? Crash is David Cronenberg's third masterpiece. However, unlike Videodrome and Naked Lunch there is no confusion between reality and hallucination. The protagonists actually engage in even the more extreme behaviours in Crash. The characters engage in seemingly random acts of dangerous driving, crashing cars and sex but there is more to Crash than \"sex and wrecks\". The film is also a deeply disturbing analysis of the interplay between these obsessions in the lives of a group of emotionally damaged people.Crash is a movie about unsatisfying relationships, in particular the flawed relationships between the main characters. The empty relationship between Catherine and James Ballard; the strange relationship between the protagonists and their cars; and the tortured relationships between the characters and their body modifications (crash injuries).Vaughn's relationship with his car is extremely personal \u0096 he lives in it and \"f**ks\" in it. His car is described by Catherine as a \"bed on wheels\". Ballard tells his wife that it \"smells of semen\". Crash asks us: what relationship do we have with our vehicles? Is it our mobile office? Or is it perhaps our refuge from reality, a place of safety and seclusion when we want to be alone? Are we relieved when we are able to escape from daily pressures into the safety of that mobile metal womb? With reference to Crash, Cronenberg has remarked: \"A car is not the highest of high tech. But it has affected us and changed us more than anything else in the last hundred years. We have incorporated it. The weird privacy in public that it gives us. The sexual freedom \u0096 which in the '50s wasn't even subtle! So we have already incorporated the car into our understanding of time, space, distance and sexuality. To want to merge with it literally in a more physical way seems a good metaphor. There is a desire to fuse with techno-ness.\" The sex in Crash is mundane and boring, a joyless experience for all involved (\"Did you come?\" asks James of his wife as she tells him about her latest conquest. \"No\", she replies.) The participants seem distracted, cold and distant. They rarely even face one another during sex, with the action being mostly from behind. The characters seem distracted, looking off into the distance, their eyes dead and empty, such as when James and Catherine have sex and discuss Vaughn. There is a third person involved in their actions.The cars end up as twisted and damaged as the people involved. The wreckage that Vaughn and company leave behind symbolises the wrecked and soulless relationships they have with each other. After a crash, the driver and passengers are removed, effectively removing the car's beating heart. Vaughn and his companions inject temporary new life into the wrecks by reclaiming them, either as drivers or as a place to have sex in. Conversely, the broken and smashed vehicles seem to give life to their new inhabitants, who only seem to be really alive and able to connect with their feelings when they are either behind a wheel or having sex in the back.As an uncompromising comment upon how our lives and behaviour have been affected and altered by modern technology, Crash is exceptional in its bravery and honesty. The film's characters find their bodies being altered and twisted by modern science in the form of cars. Advancing technology, Cronenberg tells us, alters us, and will continue to do so as it becomes more integrated into our lives and our personal and collective consciousnesses. Our world, our behaviour and our bodies will continue to change as technology invades our flesh and our minds.These themes of metamorphosis, mutation and 'treacherous flesh' have been explored by Cronenberg in practically every one of his previous movies, perhaps most successfully in Videodrome (1982) and The Fly (1986). Videodrome considers the impact and influence of broadcast media on human behaviour and sexuality and implies that \"you can actually change what it means to be a human being in a physical way\" (Cronenberg, 1997). The Fly studies these same themes, but replaces technology with disease. The potential of illness to transform the physical shell is contrasted with the changes forced on our bodies by the aging process. \"We're used to our bodies changing. First we grow up, then we grow down. There's only a moment where there are a few years of the illusion of stability. It doesn't last long\" (Cronenberg, 1997) This singularity of vision confirms Cronenberg as an auteur with imagination, single-mindedness and power, as well as a disturbing new vision of the world. Indeed, 'Cronenberg-esque' has become a term describing a specific and unique genre, one that is unlike any other associated with typical horror cinema.",

            "content": "Crash, as everyone knows, is about a group of people who find their most insatiable sexual arousal from bloody car crashes. But it's more than that. It's about the nature of fetishes. Are fetishes good for us or bad for us? They can replenish sex lives when they're becoming a bit too concise, but they're like any addictive pleasure. They can go too far. They also don't have to be harmless in and of themselves. It's not just dressing in leather and feeling the brief sting of a small whip resembling the things that cheerleaders shake. It can be anything that taps into psychological basis of one's sexual urges. The story takes us through the life of a man who realizes the underworld of people that share his extremely dangerous fetish and, as his motive is to only utilize his fetish to improve sex with his wife, he and other participants grow obsessed with it and it becomes a lifestyle.I praise the film's daring exploration of one of the deepest, darkest, least communicated subjects, and the last line and the following closing shot are both emotionally haunting, but that aside, I was disappointed with David Cronenberg's deviation from his usual style, an unmistakable emotional involvement dominantly glimpsed in the musical score. Crash has his quiet, slow-flowing atmosphere but without its punctuating verve in the cinematography and music, both of which are like that of a movie made for television. The film is successfully black and blue, and the music hits the right notes, no pun intended, in the evocation of sexiness and seduction its jazzy saxophone and keyboard were going for, though it sounds perhaps synthesized.The high points of the film are no doubt its sex scenes, beautifully and realistically choreographed, for the most part avoiding Hollywoodization. Characters sweat, hump, intertwine, and lust. The laconia of the main character's sex with his wife and the single- minded, desperately passionate lustsex are very clear in Cronenberg's discreet way.",

            "content": "\"Tagline: the most controversial film you will ever see.\" Uh, I think I've seen more controversial before and since. What I settled on was: the most bizarre and plot-less movie I've seen.While I'll admit, I honestly didn't really get most of what 1996's Crash is all about, but the jist is: female nudity, swingers and sex, mostly around vehicles.Here's what I did get out of it: an open-relationship couple James (Spader) and Catherine (Unger) not only get around, they compare notes with each other. I'm guessing they're so unsatisfied with each other, so depressed in life, that they need the company of strangers. That all changes (or advances) when James \"accidentally\" crashes into a new sexual awaking, involving steal, metal and automobile demolition with a head on collision. We're asked to not necessarily accept one's unique sexual desire to be at its peak during a car crash, but acknowledge to each their own \u2013 a philosophy I live by, unless it harms another living being. This, however, leads into one of the problems I had with the movie: the lack of realism. While stunt-driver/James Dean lover Vaughan (Koteas) isn't all there upstairs to begin with, Helen (Hunter) is all-but non-responsive when her husband is killed in the same crash that James caused. In fact, her only reaction is to get better soon enough, so her and James can have sex in a car in the airport's parking garage. Okay, fine, again to each their own, but you have to suspect the sanity of some of these character who are so detached from natural human instincts whether it be shock, anger, hatred, fear, love, depression, something, anything.The rest of the movie generally gets stranger and stranger as all characters in the movie push forward into more graphic and mechanical sex until their addition demands more. And that's what this is, right? Sexual addiction, whatever the means that turns these people on and like all addictions, it's progressive. One must keep feeding it to get that \"high.\" For whatever reason these people feel its necessary to mix intercourse with intersections, it's highly dangerous to themselves and others. This is where I pull back from the \"each their own.\" When someone is so selfish in their own desires, they ignore others that could be hurt, maimed or, of course, killed.Regardless of their self-centeredness, there's really not much more to this story. You could've easily been watching yet another film about drug addicts and watch how their lives alter from when they were just a social druggie to $600/day degenerate. And though I don't agree with the \"controversial\" comment (and if that's the only reason they made this, to make a controversial film, then I lost all respect for the filmmakers) you almost have to admire these people for making a very original film, albeit based on a very uninteresting subject. Side Note: I did have to laugh out loud as this movie reminded me, strangely enough, as a line from Student Bodies. I could imagine any one of the characters from that movie saying in Crash, \"Cars make me hot!\" or \"Wrecks (or wrecked cars) make me hot!\" I guess, this means I didn't take the movie too seriously, and why should I when you get one (probably) unintentionally silly scene after another. Yeah, this did push my so-called \"open mind\" to other's unique hobbies a bit far.",

If you want to make a provocative and shocking film, you should set it in an at least vaguely realistic world, so that there can be a contrast between the \"normal\" and the \"shocking\"; if your world is warped from the beginning, the impact just isn't the same.

I couldn't get into the characters, the story seemed forced, and nothing seemed to match what I remember hearing about when it was released. So, I decided to watch it again when I was older and wiser in the cinema world. I thought perhaps my perspective would have changed and this would be a better film. I had seen other Cronenberg films, so I was ready for this. Sadly, it was no better than the first time.I rented it and watched it, then suddenly returned it. I was unimpressed. Perhaps because I have seen scenarios like this work better in other films, or maybe it was just as I had described above. The characters seemed to just randomly do whatever they wanted, the story seemed forced and definitely not plausible, and finally there was just nothing spectacular about this movie. I really wanted Cronenberg to chisel his way into the human psyche after a traumatic accident like this occurs, but instead he resorts to a border-line sex film. While favorites of my like James Spader and Holly Hunter decently act their way through this film, there was nothing that made me excited about their characters. Their chemistry seemed basic and their on-screen connection seemed dull. They were not the best choices for this film. I felt as if Cronenberg was catering to the Hollywood community with this film. Overall, I needed a darker story, less sex and more character, and more Cronenberg. He has done better work, and I don't know why he gave up on this film. Perhaps he should take some lessons from David Lynch that may get him back on the right track.Grade: ** out of *****",

When they meet they pretty much immediately have sex, even with their injuries.

He drives her to the airport and they have sex in the front seat of his car after discussing the bad traffic situation. He then goes back to his wife, and they get frisky. They apparently have an open marriage. We then meet a guy, Vaughan, who is obsessed with car accidents. He even reenacts the James Dean crash from 1955 with the same Porsche. Rosanna Arquette is Vaughan's prosthetic wearing friend, and we are given plenty of strange sexual quirks, such as scar worship.

Provocative adaptation of J. G. Ballard's controversial novel has a hypnotically cold allure to it like the best of Kubrick, defined by a sinister compulsion that nearly cripples its compact cast of characters, throbbing with raw, unconventional eroticism not meant to titillate, but fascinate and even repulse.

The performances all strike the appropriate note of chilly remoteness; there is no romantic feeling in the various couplings, just the trance of their impulse, as partners are swapped regularly regardless of commitment, correspondence or gender. Challenging, to say the least, and certainly not for all (or even most) tastes, but those willing to align themselves with Cronenberg's uncompromising vision will find much to respond to, much to admire, and very little to emphatically enjoy.84/100",

Actually, I reacted like a part of David Cronenberg's fans whereas it's the kind of film that requires a second vision. So, I watched it again recently and I changed my mind about it. If before this screening I tended to put Cronenberg's opus in the place of loser and to underscore its pretentious character, now I would label it as a winner and I would substitute the mentioned epithet for dour.If my memory serves me well, \"Crash\" caused a lot of controversy when it reached the streets ten years ago in some countries including Great Britain. Adapted from a novel written by J.G. Ballard, I think it sharply contrasts with some of the director's precedent works. In these works, the Canadian filmmaker let his taste for bloody horror show through, especially his early films like \"Shivers\" (1975) or \"Rabid\" (1977). However, in some of his films, he managed to shelve these excesses for a more thrifty style. I think of \"Dead Ringers\" (1988). \"Crash\" could rank in this category. There are no bloody sequences. Anyway, it's easy to see why Cronenberg was interested in Ballard's novel. It offered him the opportunity to deepen his set of themes like the degradation of the human body and everything harmful that can happen to it but also the fusion between man and technology (here, it's epitomized by its most trivial symbol: car). What's also amazing from him is that he succeeded in eschewing any didactic style to be as objective as possible. Dialogs are minimal and are mostly self-explanatory like this key cue pronounced by Vaughan: \"the remodeling of human body through modern technology\".So, the main thrust of the film is that the car crash enables to boost man's sexual life. The supposedly love affair between man and the car reaches here its climax. Vaughan even goes to associate car crashes with sexual orgasms. To a certain extent, the clandestine shows in which he reproduces famous crashes constitute a way to follow for people who are unsatisfied with their sexual lives. The Ballard couple whose sexual life is reduced to a series of overnight love affairs realizes it and enjoys this dangerous game in which death could happen before the second part of this design: sexual act. Cronenberg's film goes beyond this to arouse major issues: could technology swallow man? Can the two elements live together? Could the latter lose his identity? There's one sequence I find very strong. It's the one when Catherine and James go to buy a new car and Catherine has hidden her scars under an appearance made of leather and metal. As I said before, Cronenberg opted for a thrifty and sober style. This perspective is shown straight at the outset during the opening credits to the sound of a startling music. Then, the film takes a leap into a dreary universe with a metallic coldness and a gloomy cinematography that Cronenberg never tries to embellish. Relationships between man and the machine are assessed in a hard-hitting way and the characters often speak in a detached manner between themselves. Could car crashes make warm human relationships subside except through sex? Of course, to watch such a difficult film like this one takes guts but for the ones who haven't discovered it yet, \"Crash\" isn't a succession of erotic sequences interspersed with crashes. It's more subtle than that and if Cronenberg chose a more straightforward approach, it's precisely to enable the audience to understand his film and to make us think about the issues he developed here. So, the first vision might leave you baffled so be prepared for a second screening.",

For example, Brotherhood of Wolfs, an action/karate French flick of no artistic value was about 7.1 when I last checked, and The Cell, a movie with great cinematography and fairly good but not THAT good, also had a rating above 7! I keep getting disappointed by some IMDB users. For God's sake, they are so idiotic that immediately after watching a movie in theatres, rate it 10 or 9, they are so compelled and much later they consider their idiocy. For example, the cute but just cute My Big Fat Greek Wedding, was so ridiculously praised, that when it was first rated, the average was 8.3, Jesus Christ! (Hopefully, it isn't so high now, but yet a 7.1 for just a cute but soooo ordinary movie. Imagine, I'm saying that, being Greek!)",

What can I say...  where do I start...James Spaders character gets into a car accident one day and ends up meeting a select group of individuals who get erotic stimulation from car crashes.  This group of people is headed by a guy who his wife finds intensely charismatic.  He recreates historic crashes like the one that killed James Dean, with himself in the car.  His 1963 Lincoln he says has been crashed so many times and he restores it just to get it running cause he doesn't want to give it up, and he wants to crash it again.  He takes photos of accident scenes and is obsessed.With this obsession, involves a lot of sex.  And EVERY avenue is explored. Heterosexual, lesbian, homosexual etc..  I would consider this film to be more of an experiment in an idea than a story about people.  Cronenberg makes you believe that there is a lot of similarity in comparing a car crash and people's fascination with the automobile and sexual desire.  The actors are excellent, the concept Bizarre, the look of the film is great.  Is it a masterpiece?  Hell no.The only thing I really liked in the film was the music score which had this guitar arpegiation which sounded really cool.  Also it played during the opening credits which were real neat.  I am not a fan of Croneneberg but, with all the good and bad I guess I remained neutral about it.\nRating 5 out of 10.",

Even though I am a fan of David Cronenberg, and of J.G.Ballard, who wrote the novel on which this movie is based, I cannot truthfully say that I ENJOY watching this. The main reason being is that Cronenberg has faithfully captured the cold, clinical feel of Ballard's book. 'Crash' the book is a difficult, and totally unerotic look at sex, and the movie is the same. Unless you share the main characters fixation with car accidents and find them sexually stimulating (?!) you won't get your jollies from this movie. Cronenberg has to be applauded for filming another \"unfilmable\" book, but 'Naked Lunch' was a much freer, more imaginative adaptation of an equally difficult text. 'Crash' is a movie one can admire, but not one you \"enjoy\".One thing that must be noted is the violently negative reaction that this movie has stirred among many conservatives! Just what raw nerve has this equation of sex with violence touched?? Makes you wonder!",

This movie would have been more disturbing if it didn't have such a sense of humor. There is a nasty scene in which Spader is about to rub his willie against a long puckered vagina-like scar on the luscious Roseanna Arquette's leg. She wears an outfit that is a combination of leather bondage gear and handicapped leg braces. A truly weird flick, with good sex scenes but not for a first date unless the girl likes SM and looks at copies of that full-color British magazine featuring motorcycle racing showing the racers proudly displaying their often horrid scars and injuries. Yikes. Well, if you liked Secretary, and if you liked Cronenberg's other flicks and his orifice obsession and general grotesqueness, you'll like this. It has a similar tone vis-a-vis humor as Secretary and some of Videodrome. The title credits are exemplary and some of the shots are marvelous. The scene wherein the camera lovingly rolls over Spader's leg brace after his accident is stunning. I am happy to say that there is no amputation in this flick at least.

Anyway James Spader is James Ballard a film director who in his spare time likes having sex with Asian ladies as his wife Catherine(Deborah Kara Unger)is somewhat of a bore to him. Well after James becomes involved in a near fatal car crash the incident leads to a meeting with Dr. Helen Remington(Holly Hunter)and soon the two develop a passion and an erotic attraction it's now a cat and mouse game of car sex and this underground underworld is a culture of raw violence and raw sexual conquest(Note I really enjoyed the scene of Holly in that silk satin sexy purple colored bra!) This film is clearly different as it explores erotic means and sexual ends in a raw and different way from the norm yet it proves and shows that people's attraction and energy is not the norm when involving sex and passion. \"Crash\" is one cult classic film that stands on it's own.",

Then one day James is driving along the freeway and loses control of his car; he ends up in the oncoming traffic and crashes head on with another car. He survives, the driver of the other car is killed and his wife, Dr Helen Remington, appears to be aroused. He meets her again in the hospital and she introduces him to a man named Vaughn, who he'd previously thought to be a hospital worker. It soon becomes apparent that he is part of a strange subculture of people aroused by car crashes... so much so that he and stuntman friends recreate various infamous celebrity crashes; his latest project being the crash that killed James Dean. Soon the Ballards are caught up in this dangerous world.When this film was released it was considered controversial... which probably led to more people watching. Often when that is the case as the years pass one grows to wonder what the fuss was about but this is still quite disturbing. It isn't just the subject matter but the way it is filmed; there are numerous sex scenes but there is something sterile about them; almost as mechanical as the cars many of the scenes take place in. This is clearly deliberate and serves to make the scenes more disturbing than erotic. The cast do an impressive job playing characters who are for the most part cold and detached; the only one who seems to show real emotion is Elias Koteas, who as Vaughan, is most alive when he is about to be involved in potentially fatal car crashes. Overall this is a hard film to recommend but that isn't to say it isn't a good film just one that won't be to everybody's taste.",

            "content": "Or \"How I Learned to Appreciate Cars With Bad Safety\". Or \"How I Love to See You Die In A Car Crash While My Girlfriend Unzips Me\". This movie is what you get when a director of horror films gets into a mid-life crisis. Exactly what Cronenberg was thinking when he decided that Ballard's book has a great premise, is anyone's guess. The absurd premise that people can get sexually stimulated by car-crashes, scars, amputated limbs, and scratches on cars, is so ludicrous that the movie can at no point be taken at all seriously. The fact that the viewer can neither identify with the characters nor their laughable and idiotic obsession makes it even harder to watch this and not chuckle a bit.Let's now meet our lovable, life-loving, happy, though a little moody, pack. First we have Spader; he plays a man bored with his money, jet-set lifestyle, and quick in-outs with ready-and-willing young Asian camera girls. So a true improvement is introduced into his life-style when he gets crashed into by a horny Hunter, who wastes no time in masturbating to her unsuspecting victim, while they both bleed. However, the victim, Spader, soon learns to appreciate the not-oft recognized sexual qualities of metal and steel, and joins Hunter and her deranged car-freaks in an odyssey of self-exploration (not to mention self-mutilation). Then there is his perpetually horny girlfriend, Deborah K. U.; this woman thinks with her vagina all the time - to the point where her brain is in a constant comatose state (hence her slow and pointless utterances). She is so horny that even an (intentional) accident can't put her off sex; this happens at the end, when Spader goes at it like a bunny, but not before asking her \"are you alright\". \"Oh, why not... Just because I have multiple injuries, scratches, open wounds, and blood all over me doesn't mean I'm not in the mood for it, darling...\" she must have thought. After realizing she is in (relatively) okay shape, Spader then gently reassures her that next time they will be \"luckier\". Really romantic stuff. Then we have Koteas, who overacts in his portrayal of the leading psycho of this sorry bunch. He babbles about his \"project\", and eventually decides that women just aren't interesting enough so he goes at it with Spader; needless to say, the absolute low point of this wanna-shock-society piece of nonsense. (I had to fast-forward this scene. I'm a little disappointed that Cronenberg's mid-life crisis got so out of control that he decided to live out his gay fantasies with this unwatchable scene. (It's one thing to ask for tolerance for what homosexuals in the privacy of their four walls, but it's an entirely different thing when that \"action\" is shoved into our faces: \"Here! Two gays having sex! Watch and learn!\")) We also have Holly Hunter, an actress with an inferiority complex (and rightfully so, I might add); Hunter was probably ecstatic to finally get offered a role where she is a sex-object, and gets to show her pitiful pair of breasts. Sorry, Holly, but that accent and speech impediment don't exactly make you any sexier, either. And let's not forget Rosanna Arquette; a woman who, unlike Hunter, probably never did a film without showing her breasts. She plays a half-cyborg half-human with an enthusiasm for spare parts unrivaled in the Western hemisphere. This film makes \"Naked Lunch\" look like a kitchen-sink UK drama.A sequel in the planning: \"Crash II: Cars Aren't Interesting Anymore: Let's Cause Nuclear Devastation And Unzip Each Other While Millions Burn And Perish, My Love\".",

When James gets into a car crash he begins an affair with the woman whose husband he killed in the crash.  The affair is based around the thrill of injuries and crashing.  Both James and Amanda get involved with Vaughan - a man who leads a group that stages famous car crashes and watch crash footage as if it was pornography.In the UK, Crash was greeted as if it was the anti-Christ.  All the papers hammered it, critics called it beyond depravity etc, it had few friends. Despite this it got passed uncut by the BBFC and perhaps got more attention that Cronenberg films generally do.  However the film that Crash is, isn't the film that the tabloids got terrified of.  The story is interesting in it's concept, however in practice it is little more than a long series of sex scenes intercut with dialogue and the odd crash.  The end result is that this is semi-porn, however it could have been worse without the director.Cronenberg gives the whole thing a cold detached air, this has a good side and a bad side.  The good side is that the sex isn't glamourised - it is cold ad unattractive, making it hard to call this pornography in any way. Unfortunately this cold air also makes us not care about the characters. By using a cold eerie score and using flat detached characters, this is hard to get into on an emotional level, so even when the ending sees the reunion of the two lead characters - it doesn't mean much because we don't care enough about them.  However the overal effect is beneficial - with a tackier approach this could have been soft-porn instead of a film.However what does it all mean?  I don't know - is it a cold look at the sexual mores of society against the longing for a steady relationship?  Is it a message about the consequences of infidelity and perversion being the same as a car wreck?  It's not clear because every-time the dialogue starts we have a sex scene...it covers the point up well!  The film isn't gory and it's not porn in the traditional sense.  The sex scenes and the crashes are sometime unpleasant but they certainly aren't titillating (although at times you wonder what purpose they serve if not to titillate, eg Hunt and Arquette sexily snogging!).The cast are good despite thew fact that they are all remote and dull! Spader does OK, but really I would have liked more emotion from a man on a journey into the dark bits of his soul.  Unger is OK but appears to only be in it because she's sexy.  Arquette is not given much to do, but Hunt gives a good emotional performance.  However the stand out of the film is Koteas - one of my favourite actors.  Here is a man who can make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles good when he's onscreen! So here he's by the best, his cold border-line insane role is perfect and his character is by far the most interesting.Overall, this film isn't the monster that the papers painted it - it isn't going to kill us all in our beds! It is interesting but the cold detached way it is made makes it hard to bet inot, and the flat characters don't help either.  Yes, there's lots of nudity and different sex, but if that's all you want then there's plenty of films that have more enjoyable nudity. Not one of Cronenberg's best, the point is lost deep inside the flesh.",

But like in the book, it is the same sexual fantasy and its variations repeated over and over again. It did get pretty tedious after a while. Ballard wrote this in the introduction to his book - \"Crash is an extreme metaphor for an extreme situation.\" Well, I do spend time at work browsing through pictures of supermodels with whom I would never get to sleep. And I do hold those women up as the ultimate standard of beauty. So that is a bit of an extreme situation as it could lead to disillusionment.

Now that's not saying that I particularly liked the film.  Half way through the film, I starting asking myself, \"What exactly IS this film about?\"  My original answer was \"sex and car crashes.\"  But by the time the film had reached its conclusion, I realized that \"Crash\" is a lot more than that.  It's 25% bizarre, 25% disturbing, 50% erotic, and 100% ingenious.  I've concluded that there is no REAL plot to the film.  The characters just go around and have sex.  But, at a second glance, I realized that \"Crash\" is not simply about people with strange sexual fetishes, but it's a psychosexual journey into the minds of these people.  Everything that Cronenberg shows us is completely relevant to the characters.  And while the expression of his creativity is done in a blatantly pornographic style, the truth of the matter is that there is absolutely nothing pornographic about the picture.  Aside from the numerous explicit sex scenes, it's a profound and concise psychological drama.  The sex scenes are merely the vehicle in which Cronenberg gets his point across.And what is the point of a film that has no point to begin with?  Exactly. There is no point.  All that \"Crash\" does is take us into a deep world of sexual disturbance at the hands of numerous sexually disturbed characters.James Spader, Holly Hunter, and Elias Koteas all give performances that are hard to describe.  It's like watching actors in a silent film, but still feeling that deep prophetic wisdom that seems to be emanating from them. Though there is nothing wise about their characters' choices or dialogue, just the way they carry themselves provides the film with a self-assured aura that is neither pretentious nor ostentatious.Throughout everything, Cronenberg's film manages to become a mesmeric masterpiece of unexpected profoundness and dramatic brilliance.  \"Crash\" has nothing to do with anything, and it most certainly is not a likeable film. I respect the film for its courage and deep understanding of the human sexual psyche, but this one is seriously not for the average viewer.

            "content": "Despite its subject matter CRASH may be Cronenberg's most subtle shocker. The narrative is a sinking into an underworld. A group of injured people who have all at some point suffered automobile collisions, falling for each other, returning and fetishising the experience of the car-crash. Unorganised and organically forming in the wake of their individual near death experiences (of the car crash) to be lived over and over like a mantra. Sex has again become the animal act it once was with decisive promiscuity at the heart of the film. Often criticised for cold and emotionless lives I believe the story offers a highly deep level of human relations. Physical contact with one another. Forceful sex is just as common as a loving embrace in this film. An unofficial support group who take on their fears head on and look death strait in the eye.There is a violence coupled with sex. The life altering events they chose to live again and again is the car crash. Rather than question this motivation I just accept that it has become a natural choice for these characters to return there. There seems to be an understanding between these damaged figures that differentiates them from the wider community. As if baptised by accident they return to the motifs, cold broken shells and even racing bodies of the automobile. The night is theirs to experiment with impulsive, careless journeys around the roads and highways of the airport. It is theirs to be reunited with the crash.For a film so violent it is comforting to know there is no villain. There is no bad guy. The closest thing would be dissatisfaction but that can be solved with a forward sexual act. Following desire seems to be the best therapy for this group. Led by a confident character called Vaughan, played by Elias Koteas, the group follows a pattern part bohemian part wild pack of jaguars. Vaughan has a vision with no conclusion. His infectious energy creates a cult around him as he forges ahead with not only returning to the crash over and over with photographs, scrapbooks and diatribe but as literal performance. In perhaps Cronenberg's masterstroke of the film Vaughan re-enacts the James Deen crash for real at high speed with another vehicle. This set piece on a strip of bitumen, topped off with walky-talky organised choreography, is performed in front of an outdoor grand stand filled with a curious audience on the fringe. A late-night theatre lit sparsely with floodlights is a car crash.James Ballard, played by James Spader, is to become Vaughan's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Under his wing Ballard enters a world after having his own car crash. Ballard seems perfect for this incestuous group, as he already exists in an open but apparently functional relationship. The car crash has shifted his presence to this world or community where he will now function out his promiscuity among the fellow survivors. He will learn from Vaughan and eventually become him.The film achieves a certain blue tone, an icy cold feel, as the days are overcast and the night roads shiny with rain. Great attention is taken to how things are shot. We are made to look at the automobile in a different way with camera angles that force closer inspection of the everyday motorcar. Its hard metal exteriors shaped like raging animals and its sexy interiors perfect soft places for gratification. A musical score winds repetitively through the film. Howard Shaw's theme reminds us of the cycle as it returns with chilly electric guitar prompting the swift lane changes and casual swapping of sexual partners for new experiences.This is Cronenberg's best sci-fi. A distillation of JG Ballard's explicit novel, which is turned from internal monologue of the book to passive observer. Sci-fi that is barely that because it is about concepts of culture. Possabilities more so of humans reacting to the technology than of the technology itself. A grey existential and subjective view. Expressing the highways as arteries and the car as a means to travel if not exist in the modern world. The beating heart of the airport, a city within a city, pumps concrete and electric life to its surrounding earth. A concentration of energy that supports all kinds of existence. Left to interpret the actions of the film an audience can go either way. The chain of sex scenes and car drives as a narrative may be inaccessible for some or intriguing to others. You can shut off immediately and dismiss the story or remain curious and open. The latter may give you a very rewarding experience.Mike Retterhttp:/mikeretter.tripod.com",

            "review_title": "Endlessly fascinating, absolutely mesmerizing, deliciously daring - phenomenal!",
            "content": "What a premise! What a cast! What a score - lush, dark, reverberating chords from composer extraordinaire Howard Shore that are peculiarly tantalizing! David Cronenberg once again demonstrates an outstanding eye for shot composition, and guides his cast into dazzlingly tight, emotionally complicated performances that boil over with intense passion and forcefulness. And in himself adapting the source novel, Cronenberg finds subject material that's bizarrely perfect for those topical areas he has covered time and again to such tremendous effect: a twisted amalgamation of body, mind, sex, and transformation. Scarcely has the movie begun and it's oddly captivating - for many readily apparent reasons 'Crash' won't be for everyone, but this is a drama like no other.The detail and ardor poured into every shot and scene is absolutely exquisite. Whatever the focus is at any given time, everyone involved puts marvelous care and attentiveness into every slightest inclusion. This holds true for the graphic, explicit nudity and intimacy; the footage of car crashes, bodily harm, and all-around jolting violence; close-ups emphasizing small gestures or expressions of characters, spotlighting in miniature their mental states; driven, imaginative, thought-provoking conversations; and so on, and so on. Inanimate automobiles have never been so terrifically vibrant or given such vivid spirit in how they were depicted; the nearest comparison to come to mind is John Carpenter's 'Christine.' Neither James Spader, Deborah Kara Unger, Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, Rosanna Arquette, nor anyone else in the ensemble have ever given performances of such rich, mesmerizing, simmering nuanced range, tangled personality, or hauntingly deliberate physicality. And by Jove, I've barely started to describe this picture - there is so very much to take in at any given point that the viewing experience is altogether bewitching.The cinematography is pristine, and the camerawork meticulous. The costume design, and hair and makeup work - including instances of blood, gore, wounds and shrapnel, and medical devices - are exemplary. The filming locations! The set design! The photographs and sketches! The stunts! In every regard Cronenberg demonstrates his mastery of the medium as director - and his adapted screenplay is plainly intoxicating. Sure, we can talk about the depth and complexity of the characters, the enthralling dialogue, the energizing vitality of the powerful scene writing, or the fiercely alluring magnetism of the absorbing, compelling story. All this is true, accurate, significant, and essential.Yet it's what all these many wonderfully, painstakingly conjured aspects build and explore that is the real heart of the writing and the feature at large. 'Crash' dives stupendously deep into the thoughts, feelings, and fundamental mental and emotional profiles of people whose sexual kinks, and personal obsessions, far surpass the common and ordinary. One concretely emphasized line from Vaughan says much, highlighting how the tale examines the notion of \"the reshaping of the human body by modern technology.\" Again, Cronenberg has delved into these ideas in one way or another with many or most of his films - one can trace a line from this, through to 2022's 'Crimes of the future,' and back even to his low-budget sophomore film of the same name from 1970. However, every last one is a beast all its own, and 'Crash' feels extra personal and sharp as the brilliantly particular configurations of characters grow ever more fervent. This is genuinely fascinating in a manner that few works of cinema could ever claim.Before I sat to watch I quite expected I would enjoy it, but I don't think anything can entirely prepare one for what this movie is. Ferocious potency courses through the conjuration and execution of each and every element, and the moment I think to cite one or two specifically, in the next moment I realize I must necessarily speak of the others. Rousing in its sex, but not pornographic; jarring in its exhibition of violent injury, destruction, and death, but not exploitative; 100% committed to the study of people who are like no one else, but not judging - I'm inclined to think 'Crash' clinches it: David Cronenberg is one of my very favorite filmmakers. No matter the precise genre, any time a movie scrutinizes what goes on in the heads of its characters, and how the course of events shape them, I'm fully invested. And this may be one of the most engrossing, rewarding, and still outright spellbinding psychological dramas I've ever seen. Major content warnings are necessary for the sex, and the violence, and heavy trauma, but if these are no obstacle for a potential viewer, then frankly 'Crash' is a must-see.",

I was thoroughly impressed with the form. The way that cinematic language is used to bring you into a scene is masterful. Cutting on action to mirrored reflections, in combination with provocative slider shots, allows the film to take on a kinetic and seductive energy, as it moves from one situation to the next. It's a style that works nicely in combination with the film's inherent hypersexuality. The fact that its structured like a porno flick involving sexually charged deformities who ritualize and fetishize the scars that embroider their skin is fascinating, and the subject matter is for sure in the right hands. Ultimately, it felt too subdued to fully grip me, though, and while I remained intrigued throughout, I never felt fully connected to the psychology at play. Cronenberg never fails to fascinate me, but in this case I almost wished he had gone further.",

            "content": "It is perhaps one of THE greatest misconstrued films of all time! For anyone to give it less than 7 or 8 out of ten is criminal and they have surely missed the whole point of the film! Because of my love of all things directed by David Cronenberg (quite possibly THE greatest director to have never been truly recognised in terms of awards gained for the work that he has done and continues to do) I gave the film a resounding 10 out of 10! The camera work is absolutely amazing and is done so beautifully it draws you along and into what is being shot perfectly. You end up feeling EXACTLY what David Cameron is wanting you to. Feeling that is also helped by the superb acting of the cast, main and support. They took to the film like a duck to water and bring out the best of the wonderfully written script. This film never over-states anything without reason and in general it subtly under-states and your mind is almost playing catch-up as are your thoughts. This is not a bad thing and you don't actually realise it is happening as it is exceedingly subtle but it all adds to the wonderment of the film. The film is about a man that almost loses his wife in a car crash after he is pulled out of a nasty one (that is a head on collision) barely alive and it is whilst recuperating in hospital that things get stranger for James Ballard. His sex life already empty with his wife, and in search of new ways to put the excitement back in it he meets the other driver, the driver that caused the head on collision by driving straight towards him on the wrong side of the road, and she convinces him to attend one of her meetings with her. From there on things for James Ballard get very strange indeed as he thinks there could be something in the principles behind the meetings and in what the meetings are all about- finding the connection between sex and danger and the closer to death one can get the more exciting things can become and the more sexually turned on one gets. It's a bit like the way some people get really turned on by and gain huge orgasms from the intensity of being strangled during sex because the closer they get to having all of their breath squeezed out of them the bigger their orgasms are. well in this film substitute having one's neck squeezed (strangulation/asphixiation) for car crashes. After visiting the group a couple of times and thinking they can help James gets his wife involved. Where once the other members in the group also led empty passionless sex lives James can see they don't now, the only problem is one of increased severity; they realise that little accidents don't turn them on like they used to. It gets to the point where bigger and bigger and nastier and nastier crashes are needed all the time to get turned on. This doesn't just relate to strangulation, it relates to bondage as well in that if one only need 6 of the best with say, a ruler to get turned on, sometime soon one will get numb to that and need more. Either more strokes with the ruler or 6 with something heavier or both.This is a must-see film of the highest order and all those that don't rate this film 7 or 8 out of ten or higher well they have completely missed the point. I didn't want to spend to much time on it as I didn't want to ruin your enjoyment of this masterpiece!",

Try \"off- road\". And then some, for Cronenberg's Crash is a perverse, surreal and psychosexual illustration of the apparent links between danger, death and sex with clout that, for all its scandal and sexcitement, ultimately fails to get into top gear. James Spader plays horny TV exec' James Ballard who, following a near fatal car crash with an equally horny Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), finds himself lured into an uncanny cult where ex-crash victims are bound together by a kinetic lust for the very machines, circumstances and imagery that disfigured their bodies and minds. Taking contentious themes and stretching them to their outer limits such as scopophilia, sadomasochism, serial monogamy, self mutilation and homosexuality, Cronenberg crafts and explores a world driven by auto- eroticism, sexual-oddities and libidinal hungers that feeds on the messages, morals and conventions of the mainstream. A move that'll come to the delight of some but, inevitably, the complete and utter disgust of others. Those who fall into the latter camp: don't bother with Crash. You'd do well to last twenty minutes. The former: sit back, interpret and try to enjoy. With seemingly more scenes of a sexual nature than dialogue (I counted three in the first two minutes), Crash is not for those who bare a faint or chaste heart. It's a prude's worst nightmare. It's provocative, distinct and sexy; a libidinal indie smash of Bunuel-cum-Lynch-like verve whose characters have somewhat idealistic and incalculable sex drives superior to those of a celibate sex addict set loose in Amsterdam.

Yeah okay there`s a nice in-joke of having the main protagonist named after the author of the source novel , but this is sandwiched in between three sex scenes that make up the first five minutes of the film . Three sex scenes divided by five minutes doesn`t go because three sex scenes divided by five minutes never = good movie , and the more the movie drove along at an erratic pace the more I found my interest colliding with questions , things like don`t accident investigators investigate who was responsible for fatal crashes ? Don`t they take away all personal items like photographs during an investigation ? Don`t policemen and firemen stop ghouls smoking and taking snap shots at pile ups ? Are Elias Koteas and Christopher Meloni the same person ?It`s impossible to talk about this movie without talking about the controversy it stirred up , and as always the controversy and in some cases bans are totally unfounded . There`s nothing here that will turn a rational sane person or even a slightly deranged one into a sex crazed hell driver . As the real experts ( ie registered IMDB  members ) have pointed out this is a boring uninvolving character study full of unsympathetic characters on the fast track of a nihilistic highway with a dead end .

Ballard novel tells the story of James Ballard (James Spader), who gets into a horrible car accident that actually has a stunning effect on his life, in particular his sex life. He and wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) find themselves now inexorably drawn to the violence and destruction of car crashes and even the effect that such crashes have on the human body. They soon discover an underground group of people that celebrate this creepy fetish, led by the intense Vaughan (Elias Koteas), who with the help of stuntman friends recreates famous crashes involving celebrities (such as James Dean).Cronenberg is obviously a perfect choice to direct this sort of story, which obviously is not going to appeal to a lot of people but may very well intrigue some. It never gets too far into the heads of its characters, but doesn't really judge them, either, and illustrates how these individuals obsess over creating some sort of meaning in their lives and how human beings can attach a sexual element to just about anything.The weather in this Toronto-shot film is appropriately gloomy, matching the mood of the story telling, while the blood and gore is actually never overdone. Cronenberg keeps the focus on the sexual nature of the story and characters and with the help of his very willing performers creates some very erotic scenes, of both the heterosexual and homosexual variety. There's some caressing of vehicle damage to go with the caressing of human bodies.The deeply committed cast, also including Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette, helps to draw you into this tale; Koteas is a standout as Vaughan. Howard Shore supplies a music score in his typical grandiose, full-of-foreboding style.The film isn't perfect overall, as has already been mentioned, but it may keep some viewers watching due to the sexual frankness and explicitness on display.

That says something for a film that borders on being soft-core pornography, or does it?Despite its graphic depiction of human sexuality (most of it taking place behind the wheel, rather than in the bedroom), Cronenberg is actually striving for something bigger here, which is how people are transformed, physically, psychologically and SEXUALLY, by the car crash (and to a greater extent, how human beings are being transformed by technology itself). \"Crash\" examines this by peering into a world that examines the cathartic sexual release granted to some by automobile accidents. It's a premise that will certainly make people think twice about getting behind the wheel again, and is a premise that also caused a huge sensation when the late author J.G. Ballard published his controversial novel - from which this film is based - of the same name back in 1973. (Quite frankly, it's very easy to imagine how unnerved some people might have been in 1996 after viewing this movie in the theater, and then thinking about the drive home afterward.)In the words of one observer, the characters in \"Crash\" \"are their own potential killers, who make themselves vulnerable to death every time they climb into their conveyances.\" Set in Ontario, Canada, bored film director James Ballard (James Spader, an obvious stand-in for the author of the original novel) seeks greater sexual experiences than the mundane pleasures offered to him by his crumbling open marriage to his wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger). One night, Ballard gets into a serious, near-fatal car accident - a head-on collision with another vehicle - and winds up in the hospital, horribly scarred and with his left leg in a rather scary-looking contraption that I'm only guessing is a leg brace of some sort.While recovering at the hospital, he learns that the accident killed the driver of the other car, but left the passenger, Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), a widow. He also by chance meets Dr. Remington's associate Vaughan (Elias Koteas), a car accident-obsessed, slightly mad rogue doctor who leads an underground sub-culture that re-stages famous car crashes - the September 30, 1955, car crash that killed Hollywood movie star James Dean gets a lot of special attention here.Vaughan's special little \"project\" aims to examine how the energy of a car crash is not only a form of sexual catharsis, but is also a trans-formative, or \"fertilizing\" (rather than destructive), event for the crash victim - something that happens to liberate the victim from the boundaries of (what we consider to be) normal sexual experience, which, of course, is provided they even SURVIVE the crash in the first place. Himself a badly scarred car crash survivor, his re-staging of famous car accidents is a ploy to open up new sexual horizons for others, and he's pulled Ballard, who is by no means an unwilling participant (in fact, his initial car accident was a baptism, of sorts), into his dark world of \"auto-erotica\" in an effort to gain sexual satisfaction from his marriage to Catherine. Sex happens a lot in this picture, most of it in cars (hence the spin on the term, \"auto-erotica\"), between men and women, women and women, and men and men; it shows that Cronenberg doesn't like to play favorites and since his movie is about pushing boundaries, there's also some \"scar play\" in there, as well - look at what Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette) is wearing to the party.As a long-time fan of David Cronenberg (\"The Fly\" still remains his masterpiece to me), I've waited a long time to see \"Crash,\" as it shows that he was gradually moving away from the so-called \"body horror\" that defined much of his early career and also like the characters in this film, he was seeking new horizons to explore. Of course since the beginning of the 21st century, Cronenberg's profile has gone increasingly mainstream and he has been heavily involved in making thrillers of various types - \"A History of Violence\" (2005) and \"Eastern Promises\" (2007) come to mind - that have explored new thematic territories but his boundary-pushing auteur style and philosophical fascinations of bodily destruction remain largely unchanged.\"Crash\" is a controversial (albeit needlessly so) film, no doubt, from a controversial, yet endlessly masterful and fascinating, filmmaker. It's dark, it's sexually explicit and grotesquely violent in many areas, but like all of Cronenberg's work, you just can't turn away - no matter how repulsed or disgusted you are by everything that you're seeing. \"Crash\" is by no means for those with a weak stomach - heed the \"NC-17\" rating, folks - but it is something that can open your eyes and stimulate your senses in ways few filmmakers are willing to do anymore.8/10",

Everybody know that what appeared torrid in 1995 is undoubtedly tepid by today's 2007) standards. The admirable quality of this film is Cronenberg's decision to film Ballard's book which has 3 most venerable elements known to human civilization:cars, closeness between a man and a woman and James Dean. No one will ever venture any inane guesswork that a film featuring the above elements can ever remain unnoticed. As human beings are always engage themselves in perpetual search for thrills in their hollow lives they end up doing things as portrayed in Crash. According to my understanding of this film, I reckon this is the unofficial message which David Cronenberg wishes to give out to the whole world.",

The film might not appeal to all as the story and characters are cold and detached. Also it can be a little 'too far out there' for some that the concept may be difficult to grasp. However, 'Crash' is a well crafted interesting little film. A married couple, James (James Spader) and Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger), experiment with anonymous sex. Things take a drastic turn after James gets into a serious car crash which injures Dr. Ellen Remington (Holly Hunter) and kills her husband. Soon after their release from the hospital, both James and Ellen meet on a regular basis at the airport parking lot to have sex. Eventually hey discover an underground sub-culture (headed by Vaughan (Elias Koteas) of scarred, omnisexual car-crash victims who get off on car crashes. Through this medium James attempts to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife.The cinematography and lighting are terrific. Cronenberg successfully maintains an atmosphere that is dark, detached, gloomy and cold. He's also extracted some excellent performances from his cast. Spader is no stranger to playing sexually frustrated characters and he does nothing short of superb here. Deborah Kara Unger is terrific as James's wife. Holly Hunter and Elias Koteas downplay their parts with skill. Rosanna Arquette is chilling.'Crash' is definitely different from the usual Hollywood thriller. It's chilling to watch these characters, who were already so detached from the world, to get lured into this 'alternative' world of danger that knows no boundaries.",

In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.When I watch a film, I like them to have plots and developments and characters I don't spend the whole time despising for one reason or another. Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.Alas, Crash is a film that just wants to shock. It's like an eight year old child that you get in stores or any other public place, begging their parents for more of what they already have and making a really big deal about absolutely nothing for no reason; it's like the attention hungry child who wants everyone to notice them or the co-worker who 'bigs' themselves up to the point where you just don't care because you don't believe what you're hearing \u0096 in Crash's case, it's 'hearing'. A film critic or maybe they were a film theorist once said that: \"Cinema is a way of looking into other people's lives \u0096 people who only exist on screen and have no knowledge of the camera and us.\" In essence, this is what Crash is: it's a portal into the lives of James Ballard (Spader) his close to constantly naked wife Catherine (Kara Unger) who always talks like she's just had a shot of heroin and they're relationship which breaks up a little when James finds time to hang out with a bunch of equally annoying freaks in the form of Vaughn (Koteas), Gabrielle (Arquette) and a few other dregs whose main turn on are car crashes. This is one portal I wished I hadn't looked through.Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on. Needless to say, it misses that particular mark by an absolute light year. There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not. It's the scene when James and Vaughn are driving slowly past a crash site as Vaughn takes pictures of various things; getting off over the blood, the death and the way the victims are trapped: the camera shots are close ups of numerous things such as the still bodies, the blood on the door and the way the pliers are applied by the firemen as they crank down and break off the metal framework blocking them from rescuing the victims \u0096 this is not only disturbing in the sense it's supposed to be entertaining but odd that the film-makers assume that we even care about what's going on and think we will like these characters.Crash is a film that fetishises car crashes and glorifies them as if they're as desirable as sex is. In fact, take away most of Vaughn's dialogue and some scenes involving characters talk about nothing in particular and the film would be pornography. Pornography doesn't need to have a plot but when it does, I'm sure it's at a very basic level with minimal character development and talking; again, Crash fits these two descriptions and it's absolutely shocking \u0096 Crash is quite easily a wreck of a 'film' and probably one of the worst I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I take my hat off to original films like this, Cronenberg, his most daring work yet, where he's moved off from horror here. A trio of sex scenes for starters convinces us of that. A t.v director (Spader-adequate, but I really say, more miscast) has a head on smash, with another driver, the female passenger Hunter, oddly caressing her open breast, in the wake of the collision in full view of Spader. They meet up again, days later, Spader back in the driver's seat. He becomes drawn into a secret world of crash victims, who are sexually stimulated, by having sex in cars. Bringing the sexy and sexually unfulfilled wife, (Unger) into the group, could be an answer to their dry spell of a sex time. Wild card actor, Koteas, one of my favourite thespians, is flawlessly cast as, Vaughn, an adrenaline junkie driver, one of the very scarred, while also working as a doctor, who lives in his car. His wild rage exit at the end is smashingly great. One scene has him picking up a woman at the airport. He has sex with her, a sort of menais de trois, with out the third, a stiff driving Spader. A funny scene, has crippled Arguette, another of the group, trying out this new car, or more correctly, trying to see if she can find a perfectly designed car, fit for a perfectly designed body, while tearing up the upholstery, where Spader in the background, is trying to suppress his amusement. The best bit of Crash, of course, is the re-enactment of the James Dean car crash, truly authentic, these supposed stunt guys not mucking around, Vaughn, of course sitting in the drivers seat of the late great film star, while observers of the group watch from a stadium. Whatever your fancy, Crash, is different, one of the most original films I've seen in a while. It's style of originality is it's own self, where I recommend you see it once, then make up your mind. The sixty five page script is descriptively great. Don't confuse it with the Academy Award winning film of 2004 or the Michael Biehn film.",

The characters are living the boredom, even with their extremely violent behaviour, and we don't know whether it's a failure on the production's side, or a failure on the viewers' side (for not understanding it), or whether it was just meant to be boring. Sex, Lies and Videotape (also staring Spader) comes close to this, but in that film you could at least enjoy the sexual aspect of it. Oh it was erotic, a fine pornography with brain. But as for this one, nothing is attractive. I believe this deserved to be banned, not only because of the morally deteriorated presentation (which I agree it is), but more so because this film contributes nothing to the audience.So what do we learn from this film? 1. Drive safe, 2. stick with your spouse, and 3. do not dance to the music which the media plays (and I suspect none of these lessons were intended anyway). Reminds me a bit of the lesson I learned from Princess D** na's tragic accident.Because there are plenty of controversies tangling along on the surface, the viewers are welcome to read almost anything into it: affirmation of sexual depravity, cynical view of (post) modern set of value, critique of whatever else, you name it, you'll find it.

            "review_title": "Crash was once described as a pornographic movie about a fetish that nobody actually has. It's an apt description...",
            "content": "David Cronenberg's 1996 film version of J. G. Ballard's novel Crash was, at the time, arguably one of the most controversial films ever released. Banned in some parts of the world and shown in theatres with security guards posted outside in others, it prompted moral outrage from certain tabloid newspapers in the UK. Exactly what about the film is so outrageous however is not quite as obvious as it might first appear.Crash, like Ballard's novel, follows film producer James Ballard (named, as in the book, after Ballard himself) and his wife Catherine, as their open relationship takes an unexpected new direction when a road traffic collision leads to an encounter with a certain Dr Robert Vaughan, the unofficial leader of a sort of sex cult of men and women who are turned on by car crashes and the injuries sustained in them. The obvious conclusion that anyone who has never seen the film is that this bizarre premise is the reason for the film's controversy. But the truth is perhaps not that simple. Roger Ebert described Crash as a pornographic movie about a fetish that nobody actually has. It's an apt description and his use of the word \"pornographic\" hints at why the film met with such puritanical outrage.The opening scene is a sex scene, and it is one of many. Crash is probably one of the most sexually explicit \"mainstream\" films released during the nineteen-nineties. And it does at times feel like a porn film. The sex scenes are lingering, gratuitous and exemplified by one between James and Christine during which she asks him a string of questions about Vaughan's cock. The only reason that this scene doesn't look quite like a product of the sex industry is that Peter Suschitzky's cinematography is too impressive. Even Howard Shore's score seems to pay tribute to porn films.And so what we are left with is a film that partly resembles an unusually high-quality skin flick and partly resembles a \"typical\" Ballard dystropian nightmare of a world in which people's (mainly men's) obsession with cars results in high-octane collision being the ultimate aphrodisiac. If Crash is made like a porn movie, then it is made like a porn movie with an unusual number of action sequences, Cronenberg handling the high-speed car chases and crash sequences with enormous technical skill. A hint of what the film - and Ballard's novel - is really about is perhaps provided by Vaughan's line, \"The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.\" Does the story, perhaps, suggest that humans can fetishise anything? Or is it more profound, a suggestion that technological development has changed mankind forever? Probably it is neither, since Vaughan later describes this line as a \"crude sci-fi concept\" and says that, actually, it's all about sex.Whatever twisted message - if any - lays buried at the heart of Crash, the film ends up being a fascinating, deeply weird experience that perfect weds the work of Ballard with the body horror aesthetic of many of Cronenberg's previous films to create a disturbing, bold, and occasionally morbidly amusing collision of sex and death. Presented with such bizarre material, the cast members give admirably naturalistic performances, especially James Spader (who has made a career out of playing odd balls and eccentrics) and Holly Hunter as Dr Helen Remington. Elias Koteas is perfectly cast as Dr Robert Vaughan; so convincing is his performance that the audience can believe he truly is aroused by car crashes, and the same is true of Deborah Kara Unger as Catherine. The nature of the film means that it is virtually impossible to empathise or even sympathise with any of the narcissistic characters, all of them entirely obsessed with their own peculiarly niche sexual gratification. But they do manage to be memorably interesting and often weirdly charismatic.In the hands of a lesser director, Crash would have been, as it were, a car-crash of a movie. But Cronenberg - who wrote the screenplay - directs with such precision and skill that it has the all the sterile, clinical beauty of a spotless operating theatre. The concrete freeways of Toronto - Cronenberg's default location for shooting his films - lend themselves well to the stark, dystopian bleakness of Ballard's vision, whilst the make-up and prosthetics are so convincing that a wound that resembles a vagina looks convincingly repulsive rather than absurd. Crash is fascinating but repellent, absurd but never silly: Ballard reportedly thought that the film was better than the book and it is easy to see why. This is one of Cronenberg's most flawless and fascinating pieces of work.",

            "content": "Crash starts as film producer James Ballard (James Spader) is involved in a car crash in which he is badly injured, a man dies & his wife Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is also hurt. James becomes fascinated with cars & car crashes, he then meets up with Helen who also has a thing for crashes & they start to have a sexual relationship. They meet up with a guy named Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who is the founder of a small group of people who stage car crashes for their own sexual fulfilment, they listen in on emergency service channels & turn up to car crash accident scenes & take photo's, they get turned on by watching video tapes of car crashes & get off on looking at pictures of people badly hurt in crashes...This Canadian British co-production was written, co-produced & directed by David Cronenberg & is a difficult film to analyse & at times is a difficult film to watch. The script was based on the book Crash by J.G. Ballard first published in 1973 & deals with people who have a fetish for car crashes, I have no idea whether there really are people out there who get turned on by such things but it wouldn't surprise me it there was, & in that respect it's quite a difficult film to relate too as I can't really put myself in any of the character's situations. Cronenberg is a meticulous filmmaker & he knows how to develop character's, how to write dialogue, how to shock & Crash is certainly an extremely well written film with brilliant characterisations. Crash is very much a character driven film rather than an events driven one, the character's dictate the on screen action rather than the other way round. There are some disturbing scenes but the film is never overly graphic or exploitative, people describing car crashes to each other as they have sex, getting turned on by someone else's injuries & voyeuristically looking at real life car crash accidents are strange notions & ideas to try & understand. While watching Crash last night the time flew by, in fact I couldn't believe how quick it went even though it's a relatively slow film so in that respect it certainly grabbed me & drew me in. I'm not to sure whether I enjoyed Crash or not which sounds odd I know but I just can't quite make up my mind whether I did or not & maybe I never will.Director Cronenberg is a top filmmaker & Crash has lots of style & is as artistic as a film about car crashes can be. There's a fair amount of sex both straight & gay plus a fair amount of nudity although it's not gratuitous, there's no blood or gore so forget about anyone having sex with dead bodies or open wounds. Crash was an extremely controversial film when it was released, here in the UK the national tabloids really laid into it & several councils up & down the country banned it although the notoriously strict BBFC passed the full uncut 'Unrated' version intact & is now freely available on DVD here in the UK uncut, personally I think it's the notion & ideas behind the film which are more shocking than what is actually seen on screen. Cronenberg's response to the controversy was brilliant & clever, he simply said 'there are two versions of Crash, one that exists on screen & one that exists in peoples heads' & that to me is the perfect answer because it's so true.With a decent sounding budget of about $10,000,000 Crash is well made, it's striking to look at & Cronenberg is just a great filmmaker & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Shot on location in Toronto in Canada. The film won the Jury Special Prize & the Golden Palm at that years Cannes Film Festival which apparently raised a few eyebrows. The acting is very good from a solid cast.Crash is a difficult film to analyse, sometimes a difficult film to watch but it's never less than fascinating & absorbing in a disturbing sort of way. I'm not sure I can recommend it as I'm not even sure I liked it myself, a real curiosity from Cronenberg.",

We'll I'm sorry but for me I found the film to be slow, pretentious and devoid of any real message at all. There are people who have reviewed this film saying how it's a strong look at sexual perversion, a film that isn't afraid to take the viewer deep into the character's psyche and make the viewer confront their own sexual fears. Well once again I'm sorry, but all Crash showed me was that perhaps there are a small group of idiots out there who are so wrapped up in auto-erotica, that the final stage is to actually crash you're car, and the immediately have sex. Maybe I've missed the point (if the film has a point at all) and if you think I have then feel free to point it out to me, but as far as I can see Crash is as dangerous as an episode of Lamb Chop (and nowhere near as intelligent). David Cronenberg has always struck me of as an interesting film maker, but also a film maker of limited vocabulary, he seems to take great pleasure in recycling the same notion of man's metamorphosis with machine that began with his eighties classic Videodrome. He says nothing new here, but does prove he has an interesting take on filming the proceedings. The film looks great, with a very cold and detached atmosphere, and a production design of predominant cool blues, but he has no idea what he's talking about with the story. The acting is below par, the actors (Deborah Kara Unger springs immediately to mind) give very pretentious performances, but what else could they give trying to blurt out Cronenberg's terrible conceited dialog. Another thing about this film is that every single woman in the cast appears in some stage of undress at some point in the film, with Unger and Holly Hunter providing full-frontal shots, what with the camera lingering slowly over the shiny metal of a sleek sports car, then dissolving to a pair of naked breasts it's clear that Cronenberg is trying to market this film solely to upper-middle class high earning males with too much time on their hands. Crash is not a dangerous film, nor is it a complete waste of time, It's nothing more than a below average film that provides nothing more than pretentious (there's that word again) fodder for would be intellectuals or some disturbing kind of \"thinking man's porn\". 4/10",

What's the matter, you don't like thinking? Because all of this feedback can't be attributed to the more sensational elements of the film... one doesn't have to look far to find a film with more sex, violence, or grotsequerie... and therefore the film must be considered successful in its attempt to provoke thought and debate. It makes sense that the audience which enjoys mindless, hackneyed, contrived, by-the-numbers Hollywood idiotfests like 'Armageddon' would resent a film which challenges them to actually (gasp) think about something, especially something which doesn't fit into the acceptable subject matter of literature and cinema. To those poor close-minded viewers, my advice is to stay away from anything which says \"Directed by David Cronenberg\" or \"A novel by J.G. Ballard\" and stick with \"Starring Jim Carrey\". As for Cronenberg and/or Ballard fans who were disappointed by Crash, yikes I can't imagine what you were hoping for. Ballard himself considers Cronenberg's film a work of genius, saying that it's captured all of the necessary elements of his novel. Crash is a milestone piece of cinema, equal in daring and psychological scope to Pasolini's Salo. Both films are similarly polarizing in that they're difficult for conventionally-minded audiences to accept and recognized as classics by those who are up to the psychopathological challenges they present. If you fall into the latter category, my advice is read the book, see the film. For those who enjoyed Crash, I can highly recommend BFI's Modern Classics serie",

This was a film made without compromise and you have to watch it at least twice to see all the subtle visual innuendo's and metaphors. It's not an easy film to understand and wasn't made to appeal to everyone. Obviously, a lot of people hate it and call it unrealistic, failing to grasp that art merely mirrors life and that if you can think it someone has done it. There are people out there who really do act and think this way. Crash uses the fetishes and sex to illustrate how people have become so distant from their emotions, libidos and each other that they have to use drastic measures to reconnect.Watch it if you want to see something different and daring.

            "content": "\"Crash\" remains Cronenberg's most controversial movies. Permeating with sex and obscenity, coupled with obsessions of both bodily and mechanical nature, it was born on shock factor. Film producer James Ballard (James Spader) and his promiscuous wife Catherine (the voluptuous Deborah Kara Unger) lead a life of mutually accepted sexual ventures, searching for ultimate satisfaction by indulging into various affairs. A car accident featuring Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) introduces another level of compulsive sexual mania - where sexual desires and metal mesh together to form a hybrid of death, car crashes and orgiastic pleasure. This introduces both James and Catherine to the Vaughan (Elias Koteas) and their common spiralling search for fulfilment, where boundaries are pushed further and further, while sperm leaks by the gallons...A story less about the addiction to sex or dangerous driving, but more about the growing infatuation with the mechanical, as it slowly overrides bodily desires to entail technoorganic fulfilment. As a car becomes a subject of desire, craving and our bodies seem to merge with its leather seats and metallic odour, Cronenberg shows a new phase of humanity. One devoid of emotion, cold and ever expanding, as desire becomes limitless to the death. Taking the issue of automotive obsession to the extreme \"Crash\" manages to pack an uneasy wallop, one however that is overlong and for half its running time directionless. Once the premise is clear characters indulge into sexual deviance to sexual deviance with each passing scene pushing themselves further, when the previously passed boundary no longer satisfies the growing need. Although the gist is evident the tirade of weird sex and masturbation becomes tiring and fails to add any further layers to the story.It is hard to blame Cronenberg, as the execution fits the story. Bleak, detached from emotion, jaded and monotonous fulfils the goal of presenting the lingering disconnect of characters, which are so lost in lack of feeling, whilst trying to discover fulfilment. Especially apparent when Ballard and Catherine have sex - physical pleasure is achieved, but emotional fulfilment is non-achievable. Therefore the search for emotion (one induced by the adrenaline rush of a crash) triggers a longing for more of this natural drug, but at the same time increasing the level required for satisfaction. This self-destructive behaviour is so natural, so human, but achieved through such dehumanised means...A tough piece of fiction, which is hard fought to be called pleasant, but definitely a shocking piece worthy of reflection and afterthought, not necessarily admiration.",

            "content": "David Cronenberg has matured from a director of good films, to a director of mediocre ones. It's a huge shame that this has happened as the man definitely has talent, but recently he's been wasting it on films such as 'eXistenZ, 'Spider' and now this. Crash is a film that has the story to be a provocative tale, detailing obscure sexual tastes, but instead it's nothing more than another lame drama that is empty when it should have been deep and complex. James Spader plays James Ballard; a man that is involved in a car crash, and later finds himself involved with a bunch of weirdo perverts that, for some reason, take pleasure from car crashes. These people recreate famous car crashes, such as James Deans', for fun, and find taking pictures of car crashes, and the fact that a car crash mangles people's bodies, arousing. The fact that it is never explained why they do this is most probably meant to be a commentary on sexual tastes, as many people have certain tastes for no particular reason...but it falls down because as we don't know why they do it, the premise fails to be fascinating.This film oozes a deep and arty feel throughout, but it's really just a cover for the fact that this film is hollow and empty; and devoid of anything resembling art. Cronenberg has packed the movie with sex scenes. These are, obviously, relevant to the plot and, at times, are even quite erotic but due to his poor characterisation, we have no reason to care about anything shown; making this a glorified porn movie. In a movie named 'Kissed' (also released in 1996), we are presented with the subject of strange sexual desires. Kissed deals with a more outlandish subject material than this movie, but it never indulges in showing us sex scenes; putting the focus firmly on the subject material, the character and the fascination they hold for their desire, but because this film does indulge more than a little bit; it doesn't get inside it's subject material, rendering it a rather trite and pointless viewing. Especially since if you're watching a proper porn movie, you don't have to suffer the talking scenes in between the sex. All in all, this is not recommended viewing.",

It starts off promisingly enough but then the middle part of the film just seems to be an endless succession of everyone screwing everyone which I found rather tedious. It seemed to me as though the film was trying TOO hard to be shocking. Not having read the book, I can't say whether this is the fault of the film or the book.Koteas is excellent as Vaughan as are Deborah Unger and James Spader. For me the real star of this film is the superb music written by Howard Shore - electric guitars playing complex melodies over shifting chromatic harmonies. The music is instantly memorable.The film is worth watching as there is an interesting surreal atmosphere to be enjoyed and some highly charged, inventive dialogue.

            "content": "The tag-line of this movie reads: 'The Most Controversial Film You Will Ever See'. Well, not only was it controversial to the extent to which it was subsequently banned in cinemas throughout the UK 11 years ago, but the narrative and plot of the film was as ridiculous as it was distasteful. The idea of people getting turned on by car crashes didn't just sound stupid and lame but also sick. I for one am not the reader of the English newspaper the Daily Mail. I am not even middle class myself and so therefore, my views on this film in no way are based on or influenced by some tabloid press but rather from a personal point of view. Thus, what I dislike most about Crash however is that it has a stupid and inane premise and the fact that it was such a terrible film in itself.The plot of Crash revolved around a couple whose husband played by Spader ends up paralysed in a car accident. Of course this doesn't stop him and his wife from doing it with each other and even with other people. Spader's character has him having sex with Holly Hunter, in addition to this he even has a homo-erotic encounter with a guy (not that I have anything against homosexuality whatsoever that is). In fact, one of the main problems with Crash is the rather daft plot- its all about sex, sex and sustaining injuries and losing control of their libido by dangerous driving and that its all done in a cheap, tacky, demoralising and distasteful manner. When they have sex, they don't do it out of love for the other person but rather out of sexual arousal, out of desperation and out of weakness. They couldn't really give a toss about the other person's feelings, or the people they hurt. If anything those characters in Crash come across as being selfish, as well as perverse.Another problem is the actual point of this film- what message is this trying to evoke to its audience? What can the audience themselves take away from this viewing experience? And is there a point to all this? The answers to those questions can only be answered by those able enough to come up with meaningful answers. But unfortunately, they have not been addressed or tackled whatsoever within this movie.I failed to see how I could empathise with or feel remorse for the main characters. In fact, I utterly despised watching this film, that I was thinking as I was seeing the events take place, 'What the hell was that?'. I'm sorry but getting aroused at the expense of others and endangering others by getting involved in car collisions doesn't make for a good movie. It looked so tacky and on screen, the scenes would've offended those of whom were lucky enough to survive a car accident or two.There isn't really a moral to this silly story because let's face it, with a complex and controversial subject such as sex, in Crash with car accidents and people having sex with each other and other people, how on earth can there be one, for sure? David Croenberg has come up with some very strange concepts for films- hell, we often watch scenes in TV sitcoms and dramas for instance where the character is a novice at driving the car, or is attempting to drive the car and the other guy says something like 'imagine that this car is a woman and you're in a relationship with her/it' or some silly crap such as that. However, this one takes the biscuit as it has become a step too far. Crash was a terrible waste of a film and in Spader, Hunter and Arquette- of whom are three undeniably good actors, their talents were virtually unseen in this so-called diabolical 'porn' fest. For me, it was a nonsensical piece of garbage.",

JG Ballard's controversial novel CRASH seemed an unlikely prospect for a film, so dark were its explorations of the outer zones of excitation and their relationship to near-death events. But Cronenberg worked through making Ballard's visions visual and his screenplay based on Ballard's book is more about interior dialogue and visceral sexual encounters as they relate to trauma.James Ballard (James Spader) is a successful TV director who spends as much time as a lothario as he does making film. He is married to Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) whose own sexuality leads her into stray paths. The two seem to connect physically but the fire is diminishing: they both concur that encounters with other partners enhance their sexual experiences. James is in a car accident and survives with a broken leg and scars, but the other car's male driver was killed and his surviving female companion Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is hospitalized with James. While in the hospital both encounter a strange, scarred, limping male photographer Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who takes photos of the scars and trauma results of both James and Helen. Catherine visits James in the hospital and seems to find excitement in the scars and orthopedic paraphernalia binding her husband.Once James is released from the hospital he is strangely drawn to the car he wrecked and finds Helen in the same mindset. The two move into physical attraction as well as an emotional attraction to Vaughn. Vaughn is obsessed with auto accidents, having been in many, and he stages famous car accidents (James Dean, Jayne Mansfield, etc) for a captive audience - which includes James, Helen, and Catherine. Vaughn insidiously draws the three into his obsession, sharing his 'actors' and fellow travelers - including Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette - with both legs in orthopedic mechanisms), Colin and Vera Seagrave (Peter MacNeill and Cheryl Swarts) and those who help him stage his 'accidents'. Vaughn explains that he is exploring how to achieve that sensation of terror one feels during a car crash and equate it with orgasm. The odd group of folks all sexually interact with abandon: the crashed car becomes the bedchamber for bizarre sexual acting out. And how this all plays out in the end is the part of the film that simply must be seen to feel the experience.This is clearly NOT a movie for everyone. The CD contains both the NC and the R rated version: I watched the NC version and while it is graphic and focused on sex it is oddly uninvolving emotionally - we care little about the people we meet. Perhaps part of the story here is that with the progressively dehumanization of man in his symbiotic relationship with machines, relating to fellow humans on anything except the sensual gratification is something we are losing. That is the kind of powerful statement Cronenberg shows us with these passionate yet cold people. The cast is exceptional, especially Koteas whose warped character is wholly three-dimensional as opposed to the oddly uninvolved characters Spader, Unger, and Hunter portray. A dizzying experience!

            "content": "\"Technology is us. There is no separation.\" \u2013 Cronenberg (For Part 2, see my review of Cronenberg's \"Stereo\") While \"Crash\" and \"Existenz\" revolved around technology, Cronenberg's \"Eastern Promises\" suggests a return to the corporeal. Flesh and blood are the recurring motifs. A throat is sliced, an umbilical cord is cut. A mother dies, a baby lives. But in the end, we seem to be left with machines. Cyborgs, completely scrambled.This disorientation stretches across Cronenberg's last five films. In a sense they reflect both a very postmodern schizophrenia and, in a very loose sense, the market's shift from exchange to competition, the traditional antagonism between capital and labour redefined out of existence such that \"the new man is an entrepreneur of himself\". He is flesh as capital, his body the source of his earnings. As Deleuze says, \"man is no longer man, but a body in debt\".This fragmentation extends in other directions. Firstly, in the technological sense, and this is what \"Existenz\" explores, Cronenberg recognises that mankind has moved from a \"society of the spectacle\" - the great unitary spectacle has been destroyed - to a society of participatory and interactive media. We are no longer passive, voyeuristic spectators, instead we actively give ourselves over to surveillance and eagerly scrutinise both others and ourselves. We fragment, multiply, and network ourselves and whatever we encounter. This no longer falls under the dipolar schema of subject and object, but rather has the form of a network in which everyone and everything is a node.Secondly, we are in what Baudrillard calls the \"third order simulacra\", images/codes/signs etc now bearing no relation to reality, the various elements of art's critical traditions reduced to signs devoid of context. In this media-laden condition, we thus experience \"the death of the real\". We live our lives in the realm of hyper-reality, connecting more and more deeply to things that merely simulate reality. The whole idea of a true or a false copy of something is increasingly destroyed: we cling to simulations of simulations of simulations and art that is often itself nothing but cannibalised \"pieces of pieces\". Again, think Cronenberg's \"Existenz\", in which no ground zero reality seemed possible, just more \"levels\" nestest within \"levels\".Concurrently we have moved on from representation to simulation: instead of trying to capture the Real, we actively produce, to quote Seven Shaviro, \"fragments of a reality that is directly composed of images, the real micro-produced and virally disseminated. Every imaginary simulation therefore becomes altogether real, even as every reality is dissolved in simulacral multiplication.\"Thirdly, this digitization, fragmentation and atomization extends outward from technology to infect all social and domestic relations. For example, ignoring the rise in divorce and the collapse of \"traditional families\", families themselves are increasingly atomized, children locked in their own rooms, family members no longer watching the same television programs, listening to the same music or sharing the same interests etc. As all desires are catered for, everyone localizes around their own desires.Fourthly, this \"outward fragmentation\" extends inwardly to the human mind itself. The works of Marx, Freud and Lacan have done much to expose the largely misdirected and naive belief in the sovereign Self. The Self is not to be found. There is no inner unity, no unified \"I Am\", only relations with arbitrary and fuzzy boundaries which we hopelessly attempt to turn into unity. Man is alienated from himself and the death of self, or ego death, is a rift that can never be healed, the subject never knowing himself completely, always separated by The Symbolic. In our increasingly rapid-fire age, man therefore clings desperately to (or mimics via impersonation) the ready made or archetypal identities foisted upon him by the media, advertisements, religion, art, friends, family, corporations etc. In other words, these increasingly \"throw-away\" identities help us anchor ourselves or resolve our fragmentation in the same way the belief in God once did. We no longer define ourselves in relation to the God \"out there\", but the ego-God \"in here\".Fifthly, the outcome of this is what is known as \"the waning of affect\", a whole new type of emotional ground tone comprised of contrasting, bipolar like intensities (extreme highs or lows). Here, the general \"depthlessness\" and \"affectlessness\" of postmodern culture is countered by extreme moments of intense emotion, such as is typically aligned with schizophrenia and a culture of addiction. And so with a narrative that jumps from one unsatisfying sex scene to a next, Cronenberg's \"Crash\" recognises technology as machine-man's ultimate drug. Here we see a culture that now can't be excited unless tech is involved, man combating anhedonia by (like \"Existenz) desperately plugging into machines. For the film's cast, sexperiences are only real unless they \"crash\" into movie stars, and desire is a drive which gets more and more accelerative until it morphs into total desensitisation and then sadomasochism, man now imputing pain to create space for pleasure.As desires are insatiable, Cronenberg's humans become desensitised to crude corporeal interactions, and promptly seek out increasingly new hyper-experiences, until they literally begin to reach out and merge with technology (like the motion capture Frankenstein monster cast of \"Avatar\"). They misguidedly want to \"unify\" with the cinema screen, fck the machines, go beyond bliss, suck on their better-than-reality augmentations, as though this unification (an impossible transgression) will bridge the Lack and lead to contentment. When \"Crash's\" cast become part of this grotesque, hybrid man-machine wreckage, you then get Cronenberg's \"Existenz\". Cinema as the dominant techno-drug, in which there is a split between spectator and object, morphs into to the pleasure-networks of New Media, in which there is a perceived connection...but not quite. Today Cronenberg's \"crashes\" take the form of broadband speed, latency and internet lag, always accelerating...faster...and...faster. Significantly, all the characters in \"Crash\" are filmmakers. Cronenberg sees cinema, like technology, as a means of dangerously sublimating desire.(For Part 4, see my review of Cronenberg's \"Spider\")",

            "content": "Car crashes happens accidentally or sometimes deliberately, sometimes people get killed and other times not. But most of the times it's a shocking thing to see one and think about what happened and why happened and who got injured or died. And of course we know that there are people who likes to live fast, die young, leave themselves a beautiful corpse quoting James Dean. In David Cronenberg's film \"Crash\" we see a different kind of people: those who like to get involved in car crashes and/or have sexual relations after a car crash or inside of a damaged car. Here, James Ballard (James Spader) is a film director who got involved in a fatal car crash that killed a man and injured a woman, Helen (Holly Hunter) and they both start a strange relationship (I don't know if I can say if they're friends, lovers or something similar). He is married with Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger) but here's another awkward thing between these couple: they're unfaithful to each other and still they don't find anything wrong with that. And more, they find this factor something more exciting to their relationship. Helen presents to James a different world when people enjoy re-enactments of famous car crashes (such as James Dean and Jayne Mansfield accidents). Vaughan (Elias Koteas) is the leader of a group who enjoys these re-enactments and he present these famous accidents along with some stunts. Serious things, they smash one car against another to feel more live, or sexually excited. Vaughan introduces James into this new world where there's no limits, everything is allowed including induce an accident in a highway filled with another cars (by the way James's wife is included in these \"accidents\"); plan re-enactments; switch sexual partners and other bizarre things.An interesting point in this film is that there's no limit of what characters want sexually from each other here. Vaughan is sexually attracted by James and they have their moment together and so the female characters with each other. They got so involved in share their feelings, their emotions, their sexuality, that they don't stop what they're doing and they go along. And yet no one can label these characters as gay, bisexual or lesbian, no, they're only share an experience. This might work for some viewers. In fact the whole movie might work well for very few people. It's a deep film about the complexities of the human mind, looks very much like \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (I choose compare this films because both are stories of people you don't see everyday and their strange and peculiar worlds. Besides that it's almost impossible compare these two films). All characters are sick people but they just don't know that and the more danger they get, more closer to death they get the more they liked it, the more closer they get to an orgasm or a different sensation. It's very similar to the movies featuring a psycho killer that feels pleasure in what he does and he can't stop doing it because he feels better this way. Vaughan is a dangerous psycho killer in a certain way. Those re-enactments are dangerous things and he jumps in the car knowing that he might die by crashing with another car, face to face with death but after the crash he only lift his hand to the audience and says: \"And that's how James Dean entered to immortality\" and everyone is applauding. For the common viewer it's difficult to see some of the images (more about sex and not the car crashes), and even to follow Cronenberg or J.G.Ballard's idea (who wrote the book). Sometimes it might look a shallow and pointless movie but it has something more, something appealing for those who like twisted obsessions, or for those who might feel that the characters behavior is a normal thing. Once again another great and controversial work from David Cronenberg. Good performances here too (most notable Elias Koteas for his terrifying portrayal of a strange person and James Spader). Such an unforgettable movie but don't get confused with \"Crash\" (2004) directed by Paul Haggis. Lucky that both movies received an subtitle in my country so it's almost difficult to confuse them: Cronenberg's was released under the name of \"Crash - Strange Pleasures\" and Haggis's \"Crash - Living on the Edge\". Both are great but this film is far more shocking and great. 10/10",

            "content": "One of the great qualities of this film is the ability to constantly astonish with its relentless, shocking strangeness. \"Crash\" is most likely to leave viewers speechless, even those who are used to \"weird\" or unconventional. None of the scenes are gratuitous however, and \"Crash\" looks extremely stylish, as well as twisted enough to make one uneasy. Fortunately, this isn't 'cheap shocks' and the usual exploitation fare filmmakers throw in to stir some \"controversy\".Perverted addicts leading corrupt lives never been more fascinating. These people are craving some basic fulfillment, but are doomed to never achieve it in life. Metaphysical allegory? Probably. It's also a cold analysis of self-destructive compulsion. What's offensive is that these characters never even stop to consider the moral implications of their actions - hurting others who don't share their \"hobby\". Even if they did, it wouldn't make much of a difference, because they simply can't stop. Like Lynch, Cronenberg doesn't spoon-feed the \"message\" to the audience, so there are no answers, only uncomfortable but equally valid questions. I guess it takes guts to ask them. Dialogue is minimal and clever, and keeps the characters sealed. The narrative is filled with long pauses, eerie metallic riffs, empty glances directed inwards. Physical encounters are depersonalized and compulsive. There are always people around at the scene of sexual encounters or car crashes, and yet nobody bothers to notice or intervene. It's a surreal landscape of urban alienation that associates with voyeurism. Steel-cold (the unsettling score hits the right note as well), clinical in its depictions, \"Crash\" has a clean sharp edge that only a handful of directors could walk on with such elegance, insight and a sort of detachment that has a dream-like quality.All the actors are fearless and did a splendid job, especially James Spader, who is great as usual. He was born to play this role, with his other-worldly, strangely absent stare and androgynous beauty (It's surprising David Lynch never worked with him!). Spader's surreal performance is mind-blowing, as he gracefully carries along that creepy Cronenberg vibe. This is the same Spader who stole the show as the intriguing voyeur in \"Sex, Lies and Videotape\" and who would later do it again in the offbeat \"Secretary\". His other roles just didn't do justice to him. Likewise, Deborah Unger manages to turn into an abstraction, whispering her lines, floating in the same trance of addiction.The sexual scenes are elegantly choreographed. It's bizarre, disturbing and at times funny altogether, with a pretty sick sense of humor that's absolutely fantastic to a minority of people who can appreciate it. \"Crash\" explores sexual compulsion in a sterile environment, you can almost taste the metal. This is Cronenberg's best work and one of the most fascinating, audacious films ever made. Clearly not for everybody, but for those who enjoy the Absurd in all its complexity. Unforgettable cult classic to be watched in the uncut version.",

            "content": "Adapted from J.G. Ballard's novel of the same name, David Cronenberg's Crash has over the past decade and a half become quite the divisive piece for cinephiles and general audiences alike. After watching the NC-17 cut of the film, it's easy to see why, as the film sees the director bringing his intrinsic approach to a particularly unsettling world, an underground subculture of fetishists who equate car wrecks with sexual pleasure. The images aren't particularly shocking, at least not for anyone familiar with his previous work, but they certainly resonate deep in the viewer's mind. He takes a perspective similar to the characters themselves, exploring the automobile as if it were it's own sexual organ.Cronenberg shoots the mechanisms, not only vehicles but medical designs as well, with the same kind of intimacy that a pornographer would shoot the human body. It's an interesting approach, but undeniably one that could alienate any given viewer. Also potentially alienating is the lack of a conventional narrative structure in the film, instead focusing primarily on conversations between the characters and especially their physical interactions. The tone that he establishes here is quite fascinating, giving the whole thing a very cold and distinctly non-intimate atmosphere, where the audience becomes as dazed as the characters are. It's an interesting way of getting us into the head of these characters, but for some viewers it could shut them out early on. If you find it as fascinating as I did though, there's much more to unfold within.In this world of the emotionally blank, Cronenberg explores a culture who aren't interested in the meaningless interactions of daily life, but instead are obsessed with their fetish, their need for sexual release within the design of an automobile. They live in a dangerous world and you can constantly feel the looming presence of some great terror coming closer and closer, thanks in part to the magnificently haunting musical score by Howard Shore that lurks in almost every scene. Cronenberg's cast, featuring skilled actors such as James Spader, Holly Hunter and Elias Koteas, are able to fulfill the director's vision to his maximum intent, bringing a stern believability to their characters and their motivations. It's hard to play these kind of desires, ones that most would not even begin to think of in their daily lives, with the realness that these actors are able to achieve here.What Cronenberg achieves in doing here is something of great skill, a dissection of the American obsession with the automobile as displayed through the use of sexual impulses. It's a fascinating study, and delves into many other themes such as the iconography of the automobile and the relation between the human body and modern technology, a theme that Cronenberg has often explored in his work and yet somehow is always able to bring a new take on it every time he comes back to it. It's a film that can make the viewer want to look away, but somehow manages to hypnotize them in the same instance. There's an almost dream like quality to it, a skill that Cronenberg accomplishes in most of his work. Crash is a film that could easily alienate most viewers, but those who allow Cronenberg to sink in the way he intends are sure to find much fascination in his study.",

            "content": "I have no idea what this movie is meant to be about - but here are some of my thoughts anyway.The movie is definitely erotic and meant to be so. The scenes between Catherine and James Ballard and Vaughn are just about some of the most highly charged erotic scenes in the history of cinema.Of course - this is discomforting - the basis of the erotic charge between these characters are brutal car crashes.There is a particularly disturbing scene where Vaughn photographs an accidental car crash and Catherine and James wander around, dazed, but clearly aroused by the situation and each other's responses to it. The nexus between violence, machinery and eroticism has never been such an explicit subject for a movie. There are plenty of Hollywood mainstay movies where violence and sex are put together implicitly or as titillation - but its always in the context of a thriller or a crime drama - not the main-game, more the dirty little secret reason why people would go to 'Basic Instinct'or that movie with Glenn Close as a bunny boiler.It interesting to me, the reactions of the audience and the critics to an honest and up-front depiction of this sex and violence duo. A lot of people will say that they look away. But - as in the case of car crashes - if we are to be honest with ourselves - we look. We look because we are fascinated with the human condition. We look out of pity. We look to see if we can help. We look to take in a lesson.We look and then look away because we are ashamed.Then there are the ravings of Vaughn who opines that the car crash is a 'fertilising rather than destructive event' and that he is fascinated with car crashes because they somehow 'unleash' in one powerful moment the sexuality of those involved. Its bizarre. And totally unbelievable until you see it played out. And then you somehow become complicit in that belief. Yeah - the Rosanna Arquette character's femoral shaft surgery scar and braces are sexy. The tattoos of car related insignia on Vaughn and Ballard are too. The whole car crash as erotic thing starts to make sense....And you start thinking... gee how did I get here? Am I a sicko like Vaughn who is two parts repulsively slobbering madman one part charisma and sexy leather jackets and rough grace? As always the erotic is confusing and fascinating, repulsive and attractive, of the self and of the other, enslaving and liberating, sick and healthy.So - all in all - a more honestly sick depiction of human sexuality I can't think of. That doesn't make for an uplifting or soul expanding movie and unfortunately, if you come from a wholesome and moral place in your movie approval schema it won't rate highly.Aaargh! So therefore I am in two minds! If I like it I admit - I'm a sicko. If I don't, I'm basically saying I'm a moralising do-gooder.Impossible!",

            "content": "One way to register this is as simply weird and depraved. As completely senseless.You can choose to dwell on just the hazy atmosphere of interminable grey roadscapes and brooding night. Or settle for sex as the main ritual. Or as though tender shock was the whole point.Alternately you can pick up as the main axis a few metaphors about cars as new artificial means of hurling into ecstasy.And there is always the option to consider this from the angle of one man researching and putting on a show about violence that is staged to be real and confounds the audience, one that connects back to dark undercurrents in glamorous old Hollywood.Additionally you get to note that our protagonist - a film producer himself - fascinated with this new subculture is called Ballard. The idea being that he is inspired to turn the strange encounter into a book upon which is based the film we see.Now most filmmakers just want to tell you a story, if we're lucky one that reveals some part of common destiny. Cronenberg belongs in that more erudite group who can sketch mechanisms of those stories, and is able to do that with visual panache. He imagines visually. Framing these to resemble bits that we know from movies - softcore porn in this case, a more popular thing then - is his way of reflecting on the mechanisms being internal, nested in the mind. The depravity that we know him most prominently for was always the top layer going in, we're told so here. Only the means of engaging our gaze. No, there was always sense in the fleshy folds, growth across abnormal lines.So it is not a matter of does he have anything to say, but how well he can structure. It's all the difference between M. Butterfly and Lunch. The material is as above, similar to what he's done before. Once more the point is a ritual about the dissolution of the self. The race once more against destructive mind, and how to probe into a world more pure and further than the mind has mapped as real. How to invigorate the senses so the world makes sense again. This has been Cronenberg's project for a long time. Elsewhere he illustrated how the mind fails us. Here he aims for transcendence. The resolution: we're still struggling with wounds from that desire to transcend. That is only fair.I posit that Cronenberg knew that this was going to be his most risky venture to date, that he would be required to surpass himself. He gambled, and I applaud him just for taking the chance. In preparation, he orders the layers a little more sparsely this time. It is important there is rhythm and exhaustion, that thought is quiet and we pool into shared self. He needs all these, as well as images of some purity. The bottom layer that he's diving to reach is the emptiness that generates form and sense. Surely He would have known that every major branch of thought maintains this level to be unattainable. We can only illustrate in film the space around it, and every filmmaker who is worth anything has tackled this challenge. Cron fails, but fails where only three filmmakers have succeeded to my mind.",

It's got the quality of pretension certainly - an odd idea that only a minority can relate to, told by a director with his own particular manner of doing things. In this case it's the charming story of James Ballard (James Spader) who gets caught up in a car crash involving Helen Remington (Holly Hunter). Both are injured but the near-death experience has a fascination for them. To this end they meet with the strange Vaughan (Elias Koteas) whom introduces them to a group of people who can only find true sexual fufillment in the shadow and danger of car crashes. Cue a lot of sadomasochistic scenes, graphic (for cinemas) sex, and bizarre ponderings on death, flesh and sexuality. Also cue a lot of `huhs?' and `what's the point of this movie?!' from myself.The basic problem with the movie is that I just don't care what happens to the characters. You can't, they're entirely unsympathetic. Vaughan is just portrayed as a heavy breathing, scarred freak who goes around looking moody and intense (and little else). Spader's character is played with an annoying lack of facial expression - sorry a blank look doesn't convey much here James. Most of the performances here seem to be about arcing bodies around, and cavorting flesh in a most uninteresting manner. It's about as titillating as a hernia.From a directorial point of view, we once again see Cronenberg's obsession with organic nature of machinery that can be seen in other works like `Cronos' and `eXistenz'. The damaged cars indentations are treated almost like injured creatures, caressed like flesh. There's also his use of darkness and mood, a sombre tone to the proceedings.None of this can help the fact that I'm left puzzled as to why Cronenberg bothered in the first place - I don't care about anyone here, the story's an uninteresting shambles (sex, mangled cars, sex, mangled cars, blah blah) and it's left making him look like incredibly pretentious.

            "content": "Crash rails at the sensibilities.  It's a fascinating study of outlandish sexual fetishes and behavior put on film.  Some users have made comment that the characters were too emotionally detached.  I'm of the school of thought that this was done on purpose by the director.  Taking the focus away from character development allowed the audience to absorb the utter grotesqueness that was the hallmark of this movie.  The premise, though outlandish, was not looked at through a jaundiced eye.The acting was outstanding.  A lot has been said about the performances of James Spader, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette, and Elias Koteas.  Deborah Unger's performance sent chills through my spine, as possibly the most seductively sensual/sexual portrayal I've seen.  She more than held her own with the aforementioned players.  This was the first film I had seen her in, and after seeing her since then in two other films, I don't understand why she possibly isn't a bigger star than she is.  Each of her characters has an undercurrent of intense sensuality that literally leaps off the screen. Certainly, her character in Crash was the most sensual of all.Crash is for broad-minded people who like movies, and who enjoy seeing what well-made movies with different ideas or premises can be.  Outlandish, yes. Outstanding, and certainly memorable, yes.",

            "content": "Producer James Ballard (James Spader) and his wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) have an open marriage where they share details of their various encounters with passionless sex between them. When James is involved in a vehicular collision that kills the husband of Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) this opens the door to a macabre subculture of car crash fetishists who, through a sleazy character named Vaughn (Elias Koteas), escalate to more extreme combinations of sex and vehicular violence.Crash is a 1996 adaptation of the 1973 novel of the same name by author J. G. Ballard that explores an underground culture of car crash fetishists. With its mixture of sex, violence, and the taboo, you can certainly tell why it attracted director David Cronenberg who previously explored the relationship of sexuality and violence with his previous film Videodrome. The movie was controversial and divisive (as was the original novel) with its premier at the Cannes Film Festival met with boos and walkouts and vocal disdain by Jury president Francis Ford Coppola. While the audience and critical reception was mixed, the book's original author J. G. Ballard was a very vocal supporter of the film even going so far as to declare it better than the book. The movie's still as divisive and repellent as it was upon initial release, but its in service of a fascinating character study that utilizes its taboo imagery to do an in depth portrait of escalating sexual fetishism.The cast all create fascinating characters as we go on a strange journey through this fetishized subculture of vehicular collisions with Spader and Unger quite compelling as the bored wealthy married couple who stumble into this world by accident. As they're guided through this subculture by their guide Vaughn played in a deliciously unpleasant performance by Elias Koteas we're taken through greater and greater escalations of grotesque displays of sexuality mixed with reckless driving and collisions that leave the viewer unnerved because there's always the feeling \"how far are they going to take this?\" lingering in the back of your mind and making you unnerved that the scenes will turn bloody or deadly. Crash isn't an easy movie to view especially in how unlike VIdeodrome there's not really much in the way of plot for the audience to grab onto and its more a series of escalations that build and build until the ultimate crescendo. But for those who are able to stomach the graphic displays of sexuality both homosexual and heterosexual interspersed with lingering shots of bodily injury, you'll find some of the most repellent but ultimately fascinating characters you've seen in an erotic thriller from around this time especially in comparison to others like Color of Night or Body of Evidence that were just sleazy not all that interesting mysteries with some sex added in for shock value.Crash is a movie that will disgust some viewers and I can't fault anyone for disliking or even outright hating this movie. It's a movie filled with ugliness and excess but presented honestly as portraits of an extreme type of sexual fetishism. If you're interesting in this type of no holds barred character study that's well-made and well-acted, you'll find a compelling piece of cinema that dives into ugly repellent areas where safer movies wouldn't dare travel.",

            "review_title": "Lesser Talked About Cronenberg Film with Interesting Subject Matter",
            "content": "This is one of the David Cronenberg films I haven't seen yet and that it came out after his heyday in horror. You don't hear a lot about this one, but it was on my list of horror films to check out. Having seen it, it doesn't necessarily classify as a horror film, but it is dark enough that I can see the reason to include it here. The synopsis is after getting into a serious car accident, a TV director discovers an underground sub-culture of scarred, omnisexual car-crash victims who use car accidents and the raw sexual energy they produce to try to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife.We start with a woman in a hanger. She is Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger). A man is with her and he puts his hand up her skirt. The two of them make love. It then shifts to a set where it looks like they're filming a car crash test footage. They're looking for the director, but he's no where to be found. We end up seeing that he's the camera room with the cinematographer. He is James Ballard (James Spader). He's married to Catherine, but we see later that they have kind of an open marriage where they tell each other about their sexual encounters while also making love to each other.Things all change when James gets in a horrific car accident. He isn't paying attention to the road and veers off into the other lane. He collides with Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) and her husband. The husband goes through the windshield into James' car, killing him. She oddly flashes him one of her breasts while they're sitting in the wreckage, waiting for help.James has to recover in the hospital with a large brace on his left leg. Catherine visits him there and it turns out, Helen is there as well. The two of them meet in the hallway along with Vaughan (Elias Koteas). He used to do work at the hospital, but is now obsessed with car accidents. James and Helen spark up a fling that takes them to a performance Vaughan is putting on with two stunt drivers reenacting James Deen's fatal accident. It actually ends in a real car accident.The two of them descend into this group that also includes Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), who has some large scars from her own accident and she has to walk with a full body brace. James tries to pull Catherine into it as well, but it becomes darker the more the deeper they get into this interesting fetish.Now coming into this, I expected more of writer/director David Cronenberg was known for, which was body horror. We do get some of that here. I normally hold off talking about effects, but I will cover that and get it out of the way. This film isn't graphic in this department like The Fly or Videodrome. There are some interesting scars though on James, Gabrielle and Vaughan from previous accidents. They look quite real and painful if I'm honest. The film is also shot very well, including making these car accidents look realistic.What caught me off-guard though was when I went to start this film and it asked me if I wanted the R rated or the NC-17 cut. I tend to enjoy the most graphic version of the film, so I watched the latter. The thing that I noticed early on is that James and Catherine are sexualized from the start. I don't see an issue with their marriage set up if both parties agree. It is intriguing though that after James descends into the madness with this group, that we see it effecting Catherine. She's interested at first. Once she gets a taste though, she's not into it, but she seems to go along with what James wants which includes the ending. It does seem she both parties know there's something wrong with their relationship.This odd cult of people is into some really weird things. I'm not here to kink shame them by any stretch, but what I took from it is that their horrific car accidents made them feel alive. From then, they aren't really into men or women, but just the pleasure. It is also interesting to see people interact with them who are 'normal'. The highly sexualized nature intrigues them and definitely seduces. I took from it that the need to feel alive after they survived this trauma is what is driving them. It also drives them back to car accidents as well.I'll move next to the pacing of the film, which I thought was good. It doesn't take long to get it into it and then when it did, I was interested in learning more about what was going on here. Seeing a couple like James and Catherine getting sucked into this was fitting, but despite their relationship, it is too much. It is a descent into madness of the sorts that's shown differently for the two, but makes sense. I thought the ending was fitting for what we got here. This film really isn't exciting per say. It really is more a character study of sorts.What really carries this film is the acting. Spader I thought was really good, as he brings a sense of arrogance to the role. At first I didn't like it, but we are shown his life and how it changes after the accident. Seeing the depravity that he needs was interesting to see play out. Hunter was solid as well. Her and James meeting is feeling a kinship from what they went through. The only thing would be to see her before the accident would have helped me to see if she was like James and Catherine or not. This actually might be Koteas best role I've seen him in. He is so crazy here that I thought it worked great for the movie. Shout outs to Unger and Arquette as well, they along with the rest of the cast. They rounded out the film for what was needed. We also get to see pretty much all of the women I named nude if that interests you.Now with that said, this is an intriguing film for sure. It really feels like Cronenberg transitioning from his horror roots to the more arthouse films he does now. This is really a dark tale of desire and descending into depravity in the sense of what is accepted. Some could question if this is horror, I would say you would probably be right, but I can make a case for how this feels and what these people do could be considered that. It is paced in a way that intrigued me, but I wouldn't say it is exciting. The ending was something that I really liked and worked for me. The acting is great across the board. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but the scars and car accidents do look quite real. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but fit for what was needed. I will say that I don't think this is a great film; it definitely explores some interesting things though. Can't recommend this to everyone, but if you like more art films, I'd say give this a viewing.",

Jagged, cold, useless metal of smashed cars, jagged, deformed human bodies. More importantly, deformed, cold,  useless souls.Cars coexist with humans on highways.

It's a clinical look at human sexuality, shot with all the clear, sharp focus you'd need to film an autopsy.There is a lot of humor in this film, but it's always mixed in with tension--usually an uneasy apprehension about an impending crash. You want to laugh because it's absurd, but you keep quiet because Cronenberg has forced you to be a voyeur watching some of the deepest, darkest sex fetishes people could possibly have. It's a made-up world, of course, but the rampant realism makes it seem deadly serious. But it's not.And the James Spader / Elias Koteas kiss is the hottest male/male kiss in all of cinema.",

The more disturbing art is the more you hear people discussing it - more and more people asking other people not to watch this because it is 'sick and twisted and disgusting'. But I for one, am pretty sure there is nothing pretentious about this movie. Hacks don't make movies like CRASH which barely receive any mainstream attention - they release movies like TWILIGHT and sit back and watch the money roll in. The movie is about a bunch of people trying to find the ultimate pleasure - and what is more pleasurable than a climax right? They have everything they need - good bodies, cars, jobs, good looking people around them and all the things people think are necessary and yet they find themselves feeling empty. All of a sudden, they end up becoming obsessed with car crashes and victims of car crashes. They feel like this is the way to get what they are lacking. But no matter how far, how sinister - how truly invigorating their experiences are, they cannot find happiness. That's what this movie is about - the quest for happiness - for that feeling of knowing joy of some kind. And whether or not it is possible to find it.",

            "review_title": "Equally Disturbing and Fascinating",
            "content": "David Cronenberg is known for his disturbing mixture of psychological and body horror, his films are always slickly made but with a real seediness to them that actually gives them a unique edge. For all of his work however Crash is the film that most people think crossed the line because it is simply too sordid and repulsive, causing massive controversy on release and still carrying infamy the this day. The fact its based on the novel by JG Ballard (whose work is always deeply unsettling) should give you a clue about the films nature. I think the film is very gripping, not just because it is extremely well made and acted, but because the ideas behind the film are a lot smarter than most give it credit for. Firstly the biggest issue people have with the film which is the plot. It is effectively about people who are turned on by car crashes or the thoughts of being in a car crash. A young TV director named James Ballard gets involved with a group of people into this form of fetishism when he himself has a car crash. I will admit that the premise is very far out there and yes Crash is very disturbing at times, but its no more as troubling in a graphic sense than most films based around sexuality and I think people are more troubled with the idea itself that the film. The sex scenes are extremely graphic and unnerving, the scene with the scar tissue is downright horrible, but I think that they do work given the context of the film.Then you have to look at what the film is trying to say. Cronenberg's works (and Ballard's) have always had links to the loss of human feeling because of the technological world we live in and that plays a large role here. The film is certainly a comment on the human condition, how people have become so empty that the only way to feel intimate is to risk ones life doing something so dangerous. Many of these very simple ideas work fantastically, the fact that something as everyday as the car plays such an important role or that the fetishes of these people are something completely out of the ordinary. There is also the way in which the car is used to stalk people and used for sexual fantasies that links into this clever idea. I also don't understand the anger towards the more graphic areas. Violence, sex and drugs are put together frequently in films with little fuss made, yet add something different to the mix and people lose their minds. If you swapped out car crashes for heroin or cocaine addiction then nobody would even bat an eyelid. I think the cast deserve a massive amount of praise given some of the stuff they have to do. For me James Spader has always been a very interesting actor and here he is very effective in a brilliantly understated performance as Ballard. Deborah Kara Unger is also excellent as his wife, between this and The Game she really deserved more starring roles, and her chemistry with Spader is surprisingly believable. The groups de-facto leader Vaughn is excellently played by Elias Koteas, especially given the difficult borderline nature of the character. The always great Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette give solid supporting performances too. The characters here are extremely distant and cold, which understandably turns off many, but they are made that way to reflect the story and not because of a lack of character development.One area where the film truly excels in is with Howard Shore's score. This is easily one of the most atmospheric and haunting scores of its time, fitting the film so perfectly it is hard to believe. The opening title song is just incredible, the jagged dissonant guitar is so powerful and is used to underpin the score throughout. The film looks fantastic. The colour scheme is impressive, with the daytime scenes having a mechanical grey look that adds to the dullness of the world and the night scenes having an icy sheen that gives them a strange beauty. The car crashes themselves are very well done and look like you'd expect real car crashes too. There are many memorable moments littered throughout, the car wash scene is very well shot and the cryptic ending is actually quite profound.So for me Crash is a film that gets unfairly hated on, mostly because its premise is daring and very out of the ordinary. It is frequently disturbing and at times bordering on repulsive, but it carries itself in such an unflinching manner and with such great ideas that you understand why. Its comments on the world are deceptively brilliant, whilst I think to acting and score are both superb. Cronenberg shows himself as a truly talented director once again, as he knows from the very start what he want to achieve and everything that takes place leaves an impact because of that. It is a film that is difficult to like, but one that almost has to be admired.",

He went off the road and his car collided dead-on, accidentally killing the male passenger. While trapped in the fused wreckage, the driver, Dr. Helen Remington (Oscar-Winner:Holly Hunter), her husband is accidentally killed by James. Weeks has passed, while James and Helen left the hospital and suddenly find themselves turned on. While James was nearly caught in a car accident again with Helen as his passenger. Slowly, James finds himself in a different world. Where a group of people are sexually aroused to car crashes. When James meets the mysterious Vaughan (Elias Koteas), a renegade scientist shows him the world in a different light and which Vaughan is overcome by the excitement of car crashes.Directed by David Cronenberg (The Brood, The Dead Zone, Scanners) made an genuinely, unpleasant odd drama with explicit sex although this feature is anti-erotic. \"Crash\" is a fascinating movie, which for some viewers is extremely difficult to make any sense from this feature. But what keeps it alive are the cold performances from Spader, Unger and especially Koteas in one of his best roles. \"Crash\" is divided into two separate audiences, some will watch this for the intriguing story and the other audiences would watch this for the strange sex sequences (Which some are truly memorable). Cronenberg is certainly no stranger to controversial movies. \"Crash\" is sometimes shocking but Cronenberg gives intelligence to this unusual movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound. \"Crash\" includes the original \"NC-17\" version and the re-edited \"R-Rated\" version. Although, i never watched the \"R-Rated\" cut. It is better to stay with the original version. DVD also includes the original theatrical trailer as well. \"Crash\" is certainly strong movie to watch, although it is tough to take for some tastes. Cronenberg's themes are present here, some might think of \"Crash\" as one of Cronenberg's best movies. Although i am a fan of Cronenberg's work, especially with his recent features like \"A History of Violence\" and \"Eastern Promises\" are certainly his best works in years. I think, \"Crash\" is a very good movie. I don't think (For me, anyway) to be one of his better work. It is the most curio film that he ever made.

I have no idea how Cronenberg and his actors achieved this, though; I can think of no way the director could explain how the actors should move or speak and have it make any sense at all.

His name alone conjures up titles like DEAD RINGER, EXISTENZ, NAKED LUNCH, THE FLY, THE BROOD, SCANNERS, among other titles. CRASH is no different. The story of a small group of disaffected people who converge in the discovery of their fetish for car accidents, he creates what no one else would even consider since neither go together and no amount of theorizing about orgasm being the \"little death\" can sum up what happens in this movie. Of course, this is not a conventional film, neither of the actors involved are playing conventional roles -- in short, this is by far the strangest movie to come by in years, and Croneberg is no walk in the park. Anyone who considers this erotica might hit a wall since there isn't a sexually charged scene here despite their repeated, graphic inserts among the main players. Science fiction it may be but its classification as such is elusive at best. The universe of J. G. Ballard is a parallel world where new societies exist side-by-side with the 'norm' and people undergo transformations, usually intrinsic with death, metal, and leather, and independent of gender. Because of this, CRASH is too uninvolved to be anything but an intellectual experience, but one that made me think: what's the purpose?",

Both are films about people fixated on a dangerous obsession. 'Damage', the better of the two was about a man's unhealthy sexual obsession with his son's fianc\u00e9e. 'Crash' is about a group of people who have an unhealthy sexual obsession with car accidents. Which would you prefer to watch? Me too.The movie begins with a couple (James Spader and Debra Kara Unger) fixated on the thrill of sex in a public place. He gets in a car accident and the husband of the woman (Holly Hunter) in the other car is killed. The two meet at an impound lot and find that they both got off on the accident.Cut to another couple played by Elias Koteas and Roseanna Arquette. Her scarred legs are in braces and he makes a public display out of reenacting the famous celebrity car accidents that killed James Dean and Jane Mansfield. Somehow Koteas, Spader and Hunter all come together, drawn apparently not by sex but by their similar fetish.I am a fan of David Cronenberg because even his lesser films are never boring. 'Crash' is one of his lesser films. It doesn't work because I never for one moment found myself interested in what they were doing. Maybe that was the point but I couldn't get beyond their bizarre attraction to something so horrible. The movie is too slow and even for Cronenberg, hard to take I think the reason that I like 'Damage' more was because I had a starting point with the obsession that Jeremy Irons had with this son's fianc\u00e9e. I have no idea why the characters in 'Crash' love car accidents and judging by their behavior, I don't think that I want to know.",

How can somebody come up with a movie that stands on people getting horny by car wrecks, iron legs and blood cuts??? Besides, not only the characters are mad enough to like that stuff, but they actually behave strangely throughout the whole movie, in every aspect of their lives. And let's not mention the slow paced and boring script. I wasn't able to understand neither the story or the characters. All the purpose in this film is to reveal unsettling scenes to upset the audiences. It really get into my nerves to see that there's a lot of people trying to defend this silliness, which means that more garbage like this one is going to be made.It was a huge disappointment seeing this movie, i guess it was the low point for a lot of persons who happened to work on it.

Ihave two questions: 1) Is it just me or were all of us sort of hypnotized in the 90's, because when it came out nobody pointed out the fact that it was truly abhorrent, & really a sadomasichistic, psychotic porno. I remember the theater was packed and everybody acted like it was nothing. Who else thinks that a movie like this wouldn't do well today? 2) I'm going to guess that the writer & cronenberg presume that there is some deep message here, probably about society, probably apocalyptic too. Anyone mind telling me what the message was. (Funny how after all my liberal arts education I don't know. I guess nerdy film directors with pseudointellectual musings know more than the rest of us.

Similarly, the directors who made Bad Company, The Professionals and The Wild Bunch were trying to breathe life into a moribund western tradition: instead of doing John Ford scenes in Monument Valley, they moved the oater in new directions for a new audience.So Cronenberg takes a genre, Science Fiction and Fantasy, that we had feared forever lost to George Lucas and his cutesy robots, and blends it with European-influenced pornography, to the consternation of many (judgeing by the comments below). If you don't want to think about the correlation of orgasm and crash, death and desire, then don't watch Grand Prix, 9/30/55, Days of Thunder, bullfight pictures, etc. etc. For me, there are some lovely scenes in Crash: The James Dean reenactment; the group watching the videos, like the dead in Cocteau's Orphee; the carwash sequence with Spader, Unger and Koteas.",

I fell in love with the movie not with the idea though.I loved the taking and the bottom line \"to what extent one can go to have a fantasy fulfilled\". The fetish is abnormal and is named paraphilia. I don't know if any body does that in real life or even has such fantasy but David Cronenberg the director seems to be fantasised by such a fetish and made a film out of it. Extraordinary situations demand exemplary acting and thats what we have in here. Cronenberg stands all amidst directors in terms of boldness, bringing surrealism and making us believe that somethings may exist. He just makes me succumb to the believability of his themes and therein lies the greatness of Cronenberg. Now, this film is more like a fantasy fable and even the way it is presented is such. The interesting part comes when this fable seems to be a reality. Yes, paraphilia exists, yes people want to have fun in absurd and weird circumstances and this reality is married with a fable making this a really wonderful film. James Spader seems to be holding a bunch of sex driven films to his credit. Be it \"Sex Lies and Videotape\" or \"Secretary\" and is aptly cast as James Ballard. I do not think, Cronenberg might have been rejected by many other actors, to whom this role was offered. Nevertheless, Spader seemed to be in the right shoes for the role and he has done a commendable job. The film is a challenge coz it marries, the psychology of the brain to the physical desire, a dire necessity of many humans and creates a layered and textured form of a fantasy which is rare and yet so absorbing. David Cronenberg took this challenge from the novel of the same by James Ballard. To write, anyone can write anything, but to make using a publicly accessible medium in a way that it is acceptable is one thing that Cronenberg should be applauded for above all. I stand by this film and admire many things which are extremely challenging and even introspecting and appreciate the courage of the writer-director David Cronenberg. The editing gives us the right dose or romance of romance and action. The cinematography sets the right environment. The music creates the right mood. Now, in such a film what more can you ask for. Thus, I suppose it's one of the most challenging assignments that was accomplished with an aplomb by a director.I thank my friend \"Raghuveer\" who acquainted me with the film and I am happy to have seen this.

A man is in a car crash that kills one of the other passengers, he begins a strange sexual affair with his wife, who also survived the accident. Author JG. Ballard, survived WW2, as documented in Stephen Spielberg's \"Empire Of The Son\", an autobiography of the authors youth, but considers this his most personal work; the main character is named Ballard.Ballard then meets up with a man who is obsessed with re-creating celebrity car crashes, and makes up multiple explanations for his actions which all sound vaugely reasonable, but like The Dark Knight's Joker, all of them are flimsy names for what is basically unexplainable chaotic impulse. Whether he is explaining Crashing as a \"fertilizing rather than a destructive event, mediating the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity that's impossible in any other form.\", or discussing the time honored back-seat boogie as \"reshaping of the human body by modern technology,\" its all just ego making excuses for Id.More sex is had, and Ballard's wife, and several other people come into the general swinging mix of things.The performances are emotionally stale even during sex, eternally alienated, everyone's looking for greater and greater kicks, and the story moves like any porn should with escalating extremities building toward climax, but if there is a climax, and I'm not totally sure there is one, it comes a little too late, and doesn't leave us with enough intellectual or emotional denouement.In the end everyone is as automatic and mechanistic as the cars they operate, and are forced to collide in order to create spontaneous human contact, but we get that within the first 30 minutes, so why the additional hour sex? A beautiful body is it's own reward, sex has become meaningless, who cares why not, are all decent enough answers, so you can pick whichever sounds best to you.That being said Cronenberg is as much a masterful director of the body and the human form, here as he was ever, veering between unease, violence, the grotesque, and the arousing eventually into a wreck, but a flaming wreck of a film, that fails, but does so in manner that can generate arguments and interesting thoughts, not a film for everyone, but for the minority interested in literate cinematic porn, there may be something amongst the debris.",

There are no hidden or implied mainstream values here that I could see; viewers are asked to accept the characters and their oddball sexuality based purely on the film's visual glamour and the deliberate, calculated performances of the capable cast. For the intuitive viewer, the film can impart a chic veneer to the concept of self-destructive behavior and provide some unique moments of humor.

This movie should really come with a warning label, if you've ever been in a nasty auto accident, witnessed one first hand or dealt with the survivor of one you may find this flick severely disturbing.

There is not too much blood & guts horror, that was not the negative issue here, its just disturbing on a different level. I suppose you could actually create a movie about the subject of sexual fetish related to deadly car accidents and pull it off, but I did not find that to be the case here. Fact is that car accidents don't give me a hard-on and if they do you. you've either never been involved in one or you should seriously check out psychological counseling.",

            "content": "James and his wife Catherine are sexual active, though they have an open relationship, sharing their sexual activities with strangers between one another. One night James loses control of his car and veers into the other lane, smashing head on into the car of Helen, killing her husband. After both have recovered from the accident, though still bearing the physical and emotional scars, they are drawn into a sexual sub-culture of people how relish on sexual stimulation through car crashes. Lead by Vaughan, who recreates famous car crashes of famous celebrities, he believes there is a sexual stimulation that only can be created through crashes, and is better than the real thing. While James is taking this fetish that is heightening his relationship with his wife, who also has been sucked into this, their lives become endangered when Vaughan takes it to far.In the vain of Cronenberg's other film, Naked Lunch, Crashed is based upon J.G. Ballard's book, which you would never believe would be made into a movie. Though Cronenberg once again brings another strange book to life and makes a believable world for these sex addicts. Crash is a very quiet film, there is no much dialog, making this very hard to access. If the people are not having sex in cars or watching car crash porn, they never really converse with one another. While you get some information about these people through their actions, they're to far withdrawn from reality that you can't really connect with them. Yet that seems the entire point.Crash has a surreal dream scape feel to it. Day shots seem stuck in a twilight while the night shots evoke a ghost laden landscape. During Vaughan's reenactment of James Dean car crash, there is something so haunting to it, being heightened from the dream scape feel. It seems the Conenberg wants you to watch these people, yet your not to interact with with, as there is a real distancing presence, making the world these people inhabit very cold.Not a stranger to presenting characters with over confidence and looking to comfortable in his role, James Spader relishes in the role of James. The rest of the cast; Holly Hunter, Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas and Rosanna Arquette all bring mysterious performances. You can never understand their motives or never know what they're thinking, which would have made Spader's role more interesting if he removed that over confidence.In true David Cronenberg fashion, Crash is strange, emotionally distant, perverse and quite a hard and challenging watch.",

            "review_title": "\"...sex and car crashes\" Plus: Cronenberg, one of the most daring of all older filmmakers",
            "content": "Every few years a movie like this comes along that is like no other, probably only one filmmaker could have made it, is made with fresh audacity and seems utterly confident.One of the criticisms the film got was that, \"sure it's daring but it has no point.\" I would rarely ever say what a film's point is -- it's different for all of us -- and I often find that when a film is so obviously made only to illustrate a point or reflect something in modern society that it really misses the mark on what filmmaking is all about. However, is the film only about \"...sex and car crashes,\" like Janet Maslin would have us believe? On a somewhat superficial level, I'm sure this movie is about just that -- people whose fetish happens to involve wrecked cars. The sleek, metallic surface; the revving engine; the Pulsating Power of the Pistons turns them on. On another, attached, level it's about the link sex and cars have had since the 40s or whenever cars became a popular location for teenage coitus. It's also about the fetishizing (it's a word) of cars, and machinery in general. It may also be, as a reviewer on this site mentioned, a comment on film sex.The film briefly addresses car crashes and a more normal impact they have on the driver. Spader says, \"There seems to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.\" In Spader's first drives after the accident, Cronenberg really captures the tense unease of post-crash driving. Soon after, however, the characters are driving recklessly down freeways, bashing into each other.Someone also criticized the film for having no character development. Now, I'm all for growth and change, but isn't it more likely that a character will stay basically who he is? I mean, I speak the same today as I did yesterday.Some people have also noted -- and I agree with them -- that the characters in the film aren't really heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, that they're just sexual beings looking to get off and that the gender of the partner (or their own) doesn't matter. I think the film is sexy despite itself. It's as if it tries its damnedest to show graphic sex and have it be completely anti-erotic, that we're lifted onto a platform of intensely erotic sexuality. I can completely understand why people would be bothered by this and the film. I mean, we've got Unger describing the scene of a car crash to Spader as she manually jerks his stick shift and Spader and Koteas licking each other's car-related tattoos. And autoeroticism (hee hee) isn't enough for these characters, they actually have to re-enact famous car crashes. And for all the hubbub made about Spader and Koteas' sex scene, Hunter and Arquette also have a go at each other in the backseat of a car.The actors here are all brave and they each have their distinctive qualities. Hunter looks as if she's missing something (or someone) and substituting sex for whatever it is she's lost. Unger reminded me of Patricia Arquette in that damaged type of innocence. Koteas is the most evil-looking of all the characters, probably because of his long laceration scars. Arquette (that's Rosanna), has her screwed up legs and Spader, amongst these people, is the most attractive of the bunch. He's got his usual seediness and sexually ambiguous secrecy.Aside from the fact that it may be the most famous celebrity car crash ever, the James Dean crash in the film holds a special significance, I think. For anyone who's read up on him and is familiar with the rumors of sexual deviance, the film, I think, draws an interesting parallel with the film's characters and him, most likely unintended. (Or maybe intended -- I've read and seen Cronenberg speak in interviews and he's practically the film world's biochemist -- I'm sure he thought out every avenue.)\nNow, I haven't read Ballard's book so I don't know if this is based somewhat on actual events, or if naming characters after him and his wife was a joke or if it was a metaphor for what was going on in Ballard's brain. As if he named the characters after himself and his wife because that's who he is in his mind, just unwilling to actually act out on his fantasies.The look of the film is silvery and gleaming, mixed with purples and blues and reds that look like the bruises on Spader's face. The way Cronenberg films the cars driving -- often with the camera attached (I'm assuming) to the front side of the cars -- is memorable.Cronenberg made this film when he was in his early 50s. Here's someone who doesn't mellow as he ages, he just becomes more polished. The coldness of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick, I thought, and specifically \"A Clockwork Orange,\" probably because of the sex in either film. His dedication to disease is like Lynch and I felt the presence of Atom Egoyan in a few of the frames, someone who's probably influenced heavily by Cronenberg. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in Cronenberg, weird films, or anyone interested in seeing cars go fast and get banged up. If that was the film's tagline, I'm sure it would have made twice as much as \"Speed\" or \"Gone in Sixty Seconds.\" And this one's got sex to boot.***1/2",

If you're too delicate to watch the R version what are you doing watching this movie in the first place.  Anyway, I'm still not sure if I liked this movie or not.  The characters were not in the least appealing but I think the movie's premise touched on a bit of a morbid, sensational appeal that is part of most people's personality.  Maybe I feel a bit of guilt because part of me enjoyed this movie and part was turned off by the hedonistic, nihilistic personalities portrayed.  I try to believe in an overall goodness in society but recognize I am involved in gaper delays.  There were good performances in the movie by James Spader and Holly Hunter.  Elias Koteus was really creepy.  Deborah Unger and Rosanna Arquette were there for their physical appeal.  They did a good job.  The Holly Hunter character kind of disappeared halfway through the movie.  I think that is one criticism I can make about the movie.  The characters were not as important as the sensational story. (Maybe a SPOILER could be derived from the following.) James Spader's and Deborah Unger's marriage was portrayed as a wreck.  Their need for external stimulus drove them to more and more extreme measures to get excited.  Their lives would end in tragedy sooner on later and that was how the movie ended.  It was not an uplifting end.  (SPOILER warning defunct.)  Overall this was not a happy movie and its character depiction was disturbing but it touched on a morbid aspect of one's personality.",

            "content": "To put it mildly, Crash is a movie that you can either accept or you can't. You are either able to see beyond the trappings presented on the outside, or all you see is the outside. I'm not going to say that you either get it or you don't, because that would be wrong. However, Crash is a film that has been polarising since it was screened for the first time. With that comes a certain idea of what the film is, and all I can say is that the people who take the negative view on Crash are selling the creative mind of David Cronenberg criminally short.If you heard that Crash is all about sex and car crashes, then you heard correctly, but you also heard wrong. The sex and the car crashes are windows into the true story that Cronenberg wants to tell. The ideas he wants to examine are laid out for the viewer through the sex and car crashes. To look at the sex and see only sex, or to look at the car crashes and see only car crashes is to deny what is under the surface of the entire film.What is under the surface you ask, emotion and what it means to us is the simplest answer. That's the problem with this review, I'm doing my best to keep this review and not be long winded. Crash doesn't make that easy, it is a complex and thought provoking film, the type that I could write about for paragraph after paragraph. I am fighting the impulse to break the film down in a massively thorough style, but at the same time I hope that by holding myself back I'm not giving the movie the short end of the stick.Okay, that slight case of being sidetracked is behind me, let's get back to the point at hand. Crash is about emotion, the emotion that we experience in our everyday lives. Sex is nothing but heightened emotion, and on that note so are violent acts, death, and so on. Sex is a deeply emotional and personal act, but that doesn't mean it is an act that is individualistic. We get a charge out of sex because it involves more than just ourselves, the same is true of violence. There is an animal power in both, an animal power driven by the emotions and the people present. Crash asks a few simple questions, where do we draw the line on acceptability and should there be any line?Cronenberg directs Crash so that it is dripping with sex. What he does with atmosphere is brilliant. There are moments when the movie isn't sexual in any way, but he has so ingrained sex into the atmosphere that the audience begins to ascribe sexual connotations to every moment of the film. If, as we try to tell ourselves on a daily basis, sex doesn't dominate our lives then why do we so easily view non-sexual scenes as sexual? The camera also fluctuates, at times Cronenberg lets the camera play the role of an observant stalker. At other times he unleashes the camera like a predator on the hunt. The camera ends up leering and slinking about just as much as it is on its hind legs ready to strike. This creates an interesting quandary for the viewer. We are left without steady footing, Cronenberg is constantly jostling us around, never giving the viewer a moment to think they are safe and actually understand what is going on or what will happen next.Fighting the urge to go more in-depth with my analysis is very hard, to counter that impulse I'm going to try and touch on a few more things and then call it a day.There is a connection between sex, cars and violence. In real life this connection rarely, if ever, happens at the same time. There are people who jones for sex, violence, violent sex, cars, violent car crashes or sex in a car. Crash is very real in some aspects, but it doesn't concern itself with staying real or honest. Cronenberg isn't interested in exploring what real connections may exist between sex, violence and cars. Rather, he is interested in exploring what those three say about humanity when they are heightened to the next stage in their evolution.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the acting in Crash. It would be very easy to watch Crash and come away thinking that the cast doesn't bother to do much. That couldn't be further from the truth, and I dare say that I have seen very few performances that match that of Elias Koteas as Vaughan. He is a haunted man, but he's an intelligent man, a man who can't be figured out and doesn't stop to allow the audience to understand him at all. Koteas may be the highlight acting wise, but the rest of the cast delivers as well. Deborah Kara Unger is icy cool, monotone at every second, but her brain is always working. She isn't dull, she functions on a higher level, dissecting all her experiences beneath her stoic exterior. Holly Hunter is the true thrill seeker of the bunch, always looking for her next fix, the where and the how doesn't matter, her character trembles in anticipation of the next \"act.\" James Spader is aloof, and maybe that is just the character Spader plays in every role, but it fits perfectly in Crash. Lastly there is Rosanna Arquette's Gabriella, who enjoys her handicap. She views it a badge of honour and as an exhilarating way to explore more of her sexuality. I'm not saying for a second that you have to like any of their characters, but the performances behind those characters leave a lot to like.",

The answer is \"no\", because you only have to observe the characters faces during sex to understand this....Cronenberg has portrayed sex as a meaningless, everyday act by which brings no satisfaction. This is also the reason why both Ballard and Catherine are trying out other people, in hope that something can come of a poor sexlife.Do the character's become perverts? No again, it is sexual frustration that forces them to explore other sexual acts, a perfect scenario for the director who brought the first properly edited exploding head, mutated Jeff Goldblum into a Fly, had parasitic humans turn the world into an apocalypse and make James Wood stick a gun into a vaginal wound in his stomach! ..but what these new cravings become merely is an eye-opener, nothing they do truly satisfies them. \"Maybe the next one, darling...Maybe the next one...\" James utters to Catherine at the end of the film after what should be there car crash that fuses them together, but merely fails to deliver and reinforces frustration.On the surface the characters seem shallow, but they are all conclusions of a failed destiny. Vaughan seems to crave violent car crashes, and is trying to expand his mind using famous people (James Dean/Jayne Mansfield) but no crash seems big enough, or powerful enough for satisfaction, he is a guy so destined to make the ultimate crash happen that it is only the end of the movie he realises that that full on buzz can only come from the death of himself.All the characters in this movie were cast perfectly from Rosanna Arquette (Gabrielle) to Peter MacNeil (Seagrave). To me the characters seem meaningless and insignificant in there existence of life, yet they are the foundations of society once you get past everything that is fun and happy, and that is what makes Crash so dark and disturbing, how far will people go for the things they crave so much!\nCrash is a deeply harrowing film, agreed not for the many, but to purely deem Crash 'rubbish' or 'porno' is ridiculous and without thought.",

The sex scenes approach soft core porn, as the characters paw and grope each other, and there is rampant fetishism as well. However, I was unable to care about the characters. Casting James Spader as the lead guarantees a performance of flat affect. This sometimes works (as in \"sex, lies, and videotape,\" when he plays a weird voyeur), but when he is the main character and I can't begin to like him or feel sympathy for him, it wrecks the movie for me.The problem with the film from my point of view is that I'm never given any reason to identify with these people and to care about their drive for this particular form of fetishism. I suspect the sex aspect of the film was too difficult for the director and/or the actors (including Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, and Deborah Kara Unger) for them to develop their roles fully.

Oh yeah, and then we see them having sex at home.Conclusions: These people must really like to have sex.Then, Spader's character gets into a car accident with a half-naked woman (played by Holly Hunter) and some other guy who gets killed, so he takes to also having sex with her on a regular basis. Oh yeah, and then they meet this guy named Vaughan (played by Elias Koteas) who hires Spader's character to drive him around so he can look for woman and have sex with them in the backseat while Spader's character cruises along under Highway 401.Conclusions: These people must really like to have sex.In addition to these people, we also find out that Vaughan really likes performing re-creations of famous car crashes. His friend (I forget what his name is) ends up getting killed in an auto accident while dressed up like Jayne Mansfield. There is also a woman (played by Rosanna Arquette) who seems to have trouble walking, and she has a giant gash on her leg, which Spader's character proceeds to have sex with at one point. Oh, and every member of the cast has sex with everyone else at one point or another in the film.Conclusions: ???Needless to say, the premise for the film is very shallow and very stupid. All of the characters act in silly and immature ways, including sleeping with each other's spouses, a man chasing after a couple on a busy highway (and subsequently getting killed after going off the guardrail), and reckless endangerment of themselves and other civilians.What's probably the worst thing about this film is how it utterly fails to deliver on the promise of the \"crash\" culture. We see that these few characters like to have car accidents and have sex in wrecked cars, but is there anyone else who is doing the same thing? Yes, there are some people at the event where Vaughan recreates the James Dean crash, but for all we know, these people are just passive observers who have nothing better to do. As a result, the main characters look like total car fetish freaks.Bottom Line: I'm sorry, this film is terrible. It's completely worthless, has terrible acting, a foolish concept, a ridiculous plot, AND the way it ends is stupid as well. I give this film a 2 out of 10, because it's David Cronenberg.",

Not just eating junk food while 'entertaining' yourself inside the theater ? But actually remembering the Movie for a long time and having the right to your own opinion and own happiness ?

            "content": "Despite a lot of explicit sex, a number of car crashes, and the depiction of ghastly physical injuries, David Cronenberg's movie, based on a J G Ballard book, tends to leave the viewer cold. But this is the point of the film - to portray a group of people who are cold and empty of normal emotions. They retain the sexual impulse, but can only gain gratification by combining sex with car crashes, re-enacted or genuine. One might perhaps see these people as suffering from an extreme form of sado-masochism; but Ballard and Cronenberg are surely making a broader statement about current obsessions with sex, cars, violence and voyeurism. Cronenberg achieves his detached effect by requiring his actors to speak quietly and move slowly; by avoiding any superficially striking visuals (except perhaps for the horrors of the injuries); by making the sex scenes as unerotic (ie unarousing) as possible; and through the eerie theme music. For instance, there is a scene late in the movie where a naked Deborah Unger is lying on a bed, with James Spader looking at her; it is initially unclear whether or not she is dead; her appearance is that of a cadaver on a dissecting table; his regard is as dispassionate as that of an anatomist.\nThe overall problem is that although Cronenberg may have made his (or J G Ballard's) intellectual point, the film doesn't provide much of an emotional experience for the viewer. I would have preferred, for example, a more openly satirical, sensationalist approach (Dr Strangelove-style), though this might not have been as faithful to the book. In fact, there are scenes where the film almost tips over into absurdity, eg the scene where all the main characters are feeling each other up while watching a test-crash video, which would have provided good material for a more enjoyable film, while still staying on Ballard's message.",

We treat cars as sexual objects, we fetish them all the time.I can't understand the perspective that the characters in this film are not realistic, or are freaks, etc... when has realism ever been an issue when watching a movie?The narrative in this film is clear, and the storyline is easy to understand. When the character Vaughn is talking about James Dean and racing to death, he is clearly stating a popular view. We do treat James Dean as a sexual icon of manhood, and we do glorify his death.So why do people hate this movie so much?Well when someone goes into see a shrink and they end up hating the shrink we usually call the transference. My theory is that this film starts to bring to consciousness all these unconscious drives. For example the latent homosexuality in the love of the movie star and the automobile.The reviewer says the films obsession with cars could be replaced with any other sexual obsession.

            "content": "J.G. Ballard's original novel, set in the London of the seventies, has been moved to modern day Toronto with James Spader giving a deliciously subtle performance as Ballard's main alter ego protagonist (to whom he even gave his own name). David Cronenberg has taken Ballard's formless meditation on sex and car crashes and fashioned a strong narrative for this always interesting exploration of the meaning of sex in an age of technology: if we don't need it for procreation anymore, what's it there for? Spader and his wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) are tortured by that question as they try to breathe life into their dampened sex life, taking it as far as joining a cult of people fascinated by the connection between intercourse and automechanics, led by the mysterious and sexy Vaughan (Elias Koteas). Much to the surprise of those of us who are her biggest fans, Holly Hunter is quite dull as Helen Remington, Spader's other companion in his journey through this obscure nightmare, and the dialogue does get a little too unbelievable in its eloquence sometimes (other times it's just plain ridiculous). On the other hand, with all the controversy that surrounded the film upon its original release, it is forever a must-see experience. Peter Suschitzky's photography is gorgeous, giving the whole film a look like it's reflecting off the metallic chrome of a new car, and Rosanna Arquette's scenes as bionicly-recreated crash victim Gabrielle are the film's best moments. Unger is also excellent as Catherine, a woman who is perturbed by nothing--she can hardly be bothered to throw her eyes sideways when something kinky happens (like her husband leaving her alone to go have sex with a man in his car after she just did it with him), and something about her detachment is really thrilling. Unsettling for some, this is not for all tastes, especially for anyone turned off by massive sexual content (though there is an edited R-rated version that Cronenberg insists makes no sense).",

James Spader(\"Sex and Lies on Videotape\"), and his wife Deborah Unger(\"Payback\"), who were preeverts before, are taken udder the wing of an even larger preevert, played by Elias Koteas(\"Prophecy\"), his mangled girlfriend(Roseanne Arquette, \"Desperately Seeking Susan\"), and a twisted accident victim/doctor(Holly Hunter, \"The Piano\").  They re-enact famous death crashes, like James Dean's, run each other off the road with gleeful abandon, and have sex with each other almoost incessantly.  Because everyone involved is such a preevert, it's tough to identify with any single character; Cronenberg seems to be saying that there is a little Freudian preevert inside all of us, just awaiting the right stimuli to come along and flick the sickie switch, but it's hard to imagine the cownection here between erotic stimuli and car crashes.

When the chase between Vaughn, James and Catherine is happening, and Vaughn smashes into the back of the garbage truck, the driver just keeps going along without even so much as honking his horn!  I know Canadians are not as violent as Yankees, but I don't think they are THAT much more tolerant as to allow people to smash into their vehicle without getting p***ed off.2. When our fearless trio arrive at the crash scene on the highway, they easily drive up along the shoulder passing all the stalled motorists with impunity!  Then, they meander around the crash scene, taking pictures and getting in the way of the rescue team without even so much as a word from them.  I mean, come on!

It wants your hate, just as Andy Kaufmann wanted your hate when he played his most despicable characters. I can't understand giving it a low rating. It may be detestable, but it's a good piece of filmmaking.David Cronenberg is a filmmaker who requires a great deal of intellectual participation from the viewer. When you watch his movies, you can either sit there and say \"God, this is stupid\", or you can take up his challenge. \"Crash\" is a good movie if you just accept one thing. It doesn't take place in our universe, but in a parallel one where the connection between cars and sex is far more explicit. Auto-eroticism has a different meaning in that universe, and the darker side of this fetish involves automobile accidents, which really turn some people on.James Spader is in a distant marriage which seems barely held together by the two of them having affairs and turning each other on with the descriptions of their outside liaisons. When Spader has an automobile accident, he finds that his wounds and breaks have become erotic objects for his wife and others. This widens his interests to a cult of accident survivors who obsess about their scars and braces, about famous crashes and cars, etc. For light entertainment, they all watch public safety films, and masturbate over the crash dummies. As you can imagine, they turn rubbernecking into a science, and pore through accident sites feeling the hot metal, tasting the blood, and photographing the aftermath. Since they live in an alternate universe, police and paramedics and firefighters simply ignore them.Cronenberg uses this imaginary universe to explore some facets of our own:* the replacement of humans by machines, in this case symbolized by Rosanna Arquette and her mechanized body which is barely distinguishable from the car Spader mounts her in. Is he inflamed by her braces or the transmission?* flirting with death as a sexual stimulus (it's no coincidence that Cronenberg also directed Burroughs' Naked Lunch, since that novel is about the death-wish as much as anything else)* the impact of sexual obsession on other facets of life* the contrapositive impact of shared non-sexual obsessions on sexual attraction. Once people are drawn into this cult, they want to rut with everyone else in it, same sex or not. The obsession transcends all other considerations. It's no coincidence that they mention the Kennedy assassination. That obsession is the perfect match in our world.\nIs Cronenberg a looney tune? Absolutely. Is he brilliant? Absolutely. He illustrates perfectly the fine line between genius and madness. The movie is well performed, masterfully photographed, sustains its mood perfectly, and is an aesthetically pleasing replication of its own cold-steel emotionless Bizarro world. There is no love or warmth in this world, only obsession and stimulus. There are no children or kittens, or anything else which might soften the hearts of the denizens. This movie is like Andy Kaufmann's comedy: it never winks and comes out of character and tells you everything is OK. It wants you to hate it, because if it is authentic you should hate everything about it, if you are a normal person. This film might repulse you, but you can't deny its imaginative power.",

When Spader has one(in quite a disturbing and violent scene), he kills a woman's husband, then proceeds to have an affair with the widow.)

There are scenes that will absolutely give you the proverbial chills.SPOILEROne scene in particular which I cannot get out of my head is the entire group of car crash fetishists siting in Koteas' apartment, all watching car test dummy footage, and feeling each other's genitals, treating the footage as pornography.

Crash made me appreciate the liveliness of almost any life in comparison to the characters in this film.  By being devoid of even the slightest expression, the film highlights the possibility of expression and life in things one might not normally notice.  Cronenberg has said that Crash is about people who have had all the previous contexts of their life yanked out from under them and have to willfully re-assign meaning to everything.  It seems that these people's lives are so empty otherwise that car crashes and sex are enough to cause this.  They're not merely looking for depth of feeling, they're looking for meaning and truth in anything.  It's a given that, metaphorically, Crash touches on these themes in a broader sense (see Ballard's introduction to the French edition of the book), but a film so burdened with existential issues can very rarely have a point sharper than its atmosphere.

            "content": "I just saw this utter piece of crap on HBO. Yes, it was the fully uncensored NC-17 version. My partner had recorded it for me just to show me how bad it was. He was correct.While my feelings about it are not quite as strong as his (he says that everyone associated with it should have been shot), I came on here hoping to find an average rating of no higher than 4.0. I cannot believe that it has gotten an average rating of 5.9! The fact that more than ten percent rated it a 10, and another ten percent or so rated it a 9, shows that there are some really sick and disturbed people in the IMDb community. Much worse than that, though, that means that there are this many people out here that obviously have no discriminating taste in films.Being gay and a proud liberal Democrat, I consider myself to be very open-minded, especially when it comes to art, literature and film, but the fact is that this movie is crap. It is well-made in some scenes; however, that means that it is just fairly well-made crap! I know, David Cronenberg really made a film about sexual obsession in general, using sex and something completely unrelated to do so, yadda yadda yadda. Other than that, IMDb Community, what the *beep* was the point of making this? My well-considered answer: there was none.For one thing, all of the main characters are sick, uninteresting people. They get off on being involved in car crashes. In fact, this entire film is like a car crash: you watch it for morbid curiosity's sake, but you eventually want to turn away. I didn't turn away; no, I made sure that I watched it through to the end. But I kept wanting to turn away from about the 40-minute point. I know that Rosanna Arquette pretty much had no career at this point and needed whatever paltry salary she got for doing it. But what the hell was Holly Hunter thinking??? She had just won the Best Actress Oscar for The Piano just three years earlier! Just like my partner, I would not dissuade anyone who REALLY wanted to see Crash (1996). However, be forewarned. And....PLEASE do NOT let the ridiculously high ratings for it on IMDb fool you!",

Unlike Lynch's works, which pull you into a sick and twisted underworld that feels all-too-real, Crash and Naked Lunch invite you to watch and examine human behavior from a cool, analytical standpoint.That's why his characters, especially in Crash, tend to show so little 'acting'. They are not asking you to identify with their weird fetishes, morals or motivations. I think this is why so many people are confused and lost or bored when confronting Crash. We have been so conditioned by narrative cinema to expect to be drawn into the film, to identify with the hero and expect a certain plot to shape up, ending with a climax. Crash is not about this.We've also come to expect sex and violence to be depicted in a certain way. Somehow, it's become perfectly acceptable for the hero to brutally kill many people. Blood and gore are commonplace. But how often have you seen normal, healthy sex depicted in an erotic (not pornographic) way?My point is that Crash and its world and David Cronenberg are not normal, nor are they trying to be. They are true to themselves, internally consistent. And that's why I think they are so great.",

            "content": "After watching Couple of Cronenberg's films I got to the conclusion that probably he wishes to deliver some sort of improved version of Antonioni's nonsense. Generally his movies are within 100 minutes time frame yet the scenes related to the final resolve of his movies are far less, probably 20%. I say improved version not by his genuine intention. He works in Hollywood so he has to deliver something viable for investors with Hollywood mindset. \"Crash\" does not follow the acceptable Hollywood clich\u00e9 which has been created for a reason, to make movies dynamic. The screenplay follows the 10% rule which has to offer the hero an opportunity out of his ordinary life but after that its free ride of total nonsense. Too many unnecessary and irrelevant scenes and rather disgusting emphasis on body fetish and pornographic to lure audience, make it erotic enough to follow the nonsense. I am not against pornography as long as it contributes to the final resolve of the movie but to squeeze such scenes into the movie to lure the audience, I find it insulting to the intelligence of the viewer and that is exactly what Cronenberg does. The movie is boring and hard to watch in one piece with lots of whispering hard to hear dialogue so I recommend watching the movie with subtitles although one would lose nothing if miss some of of the dialogue due to poor audio management. On short, the movie is about bunch of accident victims who developed accident and trauma fetish and that's it from start to finish, some grotesque scenes and too much sex, irrelevant sex.",

Although I suppose the acting was as good as possible based on the script, the plot was just not a good idea for a movie.  The idea is better for a novel, not a film.  The film was centered on a group of nuts that find a sexual turn-on in car accidents.  Some members of this group have dedicated their lives to this obsession, and others get somehow caught up in it (almost like some freak cult brainwashing).  The film had no real meaning, not much entertainment, and the only remaining aspect, the notorious sex, was intentionally a turn-off.  The characters engage in sexual acts many times, yet always seem hollow, distant, and uninvolved.  Although the film received the NC-17 rating in the unedited version (the one I saw), the sex scenes only resembled a late-night HBO soft-core pornography, yet at least in those the characters seem attracted to one another, while in this, the characters lick one another's tattoos, car accident scars, and there is even a sex scene with Rosanna Arquette playing a woman with artificial legs.  If you haven't picked up the main message of this review, here it is: This film is a silly escapade too focused on a plot that is very original, yet doesn't work for a movie.  If you are renting this for the sex, you will be disappointed, as the characters are either gross or distant--there are no hot and sexy sex scenes.  Anyway, I don't recommend this film, but if you like the sound of the plot, and are desperate for a freaky Cronenburg film, see it.",

Crash is an extremely twisted and difficult watch that I could only appreciate once it had ended, when I could stop intermittently looking away from the screen and my stomach finally stopped sinking in the way it does when you witness something truly disturbing. To summarise the film in an undignified way - it's a car crash sex film. Our main character, James Ballard (James Spader), is a pretty kinky guy from the start; him and his wife get off on telling eachother about their sexual experiences with other partners. However, his extreme fetishes evolve dramatically after he's involved in a head on collision which kills the other driver, an event that ultimately introduces him to an omnisexual group of car crash victims who gain sexual pleasure from violent and often fatal road collisions. The narrative leaves a lot to unload but, to be honest, I don't think I'm fully equipped to unload it. I didn't enjoy this film, I endured it. Roger Ebert admired Crash and essentially called it pornography devoid of anything a viewer could consider remotely erotic, therefore creating a pure and abstract observation of the human mind and sexual compulsions. I was able to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of the film after reading his insights, allowing me to make some sense of the sickening sequence of events I'd just reluctantly witnessed. The cinematography and script was impressive but definitely didn't make it easier to stomach; again, this is a far cry from a conventionally enjoyable viewing experience.Crash completely disturbed me as I watched it and when the credits finally rolled I had no idea how to feel about the challenging weirdness of it all. I probably wouldn't recommend this film to anyone I know. That being said, once my initial shock and disgust wore off, I was able to better appreciate its boldness and production. Cronenberg is a one of a kind director who never fails to evoke a perverse excitement from a viewer through his presentation of the grotesque.",

But the results are very mixed.Looking back, I suppose the acting was good, but it was hard to get over the absolutely freaky storyline. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. I just can't relate. To me, a car accident isn't a hot date, it's an appointment with my insurance agent. Stupid.",

Ballard, I can honestly say that it's a story that worked better in book form than in film. Somehow the idea of people so emotionally detached from their own selves, finding solace only in the orgasmic chill of a near-fatal car crash just doesn't seem to work on screen as it does on the page. The book actually manages to keep you intrigued and want to keep reading in spite of the lack of emotion exhibited by the characters. In the book, it didn't matter that you didn't care for the characters because as a book it read more as a theoretical guide on the link between near-death experience and orgasm. This is not a strange idea since it has been theorized before that the brain experiences certain chemical reactions as a result of both death and orgasm. However, this film is not a documentary. It is a fictional drama (insert ironic laugh here) about people who are so out of touch with themselves on a sexual and emotional level that they involve themselves in mostly deliberate car crashes to reach the high of the ultimate orgasm. Sound intriguing? It's not...at least not in this film. David Cronenberg is a brilliant director with a unique style that can only be matched by certain other directors (two other David's come to mind...Fincher and Lynch). But somehow, he had the idea that this would work as a movie. The viewer ultimately do not care about the characters or their emotional desolation. The viewer does not find their acts of self-destruction interesting or attention-worthy. The viewer does not find their meaningless near-death horniness interesting to watch, nor does the viewer find the sex anymore enticing. It's literally a movie where everybody f**** everybody...but it just doesn't seem worth it. Controversial? Yes...but in a good way? No. The only saving graces are the visual style (which is both ludicrous and grotesque, but would work better as a series of disjointed images if it weren't for the attempt to put a story to it), and the outstandingly eerie score by Howard Shore (the man behind the score for \"Seven,\" \"The Game,\" and won an Oscar for \"Lord of the Rings\"). This is the kind of movie to watch if you need your faith in modern cinema destroyed. If you're looking for something that will reaffirm your faith in human dignity...this is not it. Point of order...READ THE BOOK INSTEAD!!! The book is interesting, whereas the movie is just...unnecessary.",

It's that dark side of the mind that J. G. Ballard explores in Crash.Ballard is messing around with all the forbidden stuff - rubbing our nose in it. Scar tissue, car wrecks, death and pretty graphic sex, all wrapped up in some very stylish photography.The characters eagerness to relive the trauma of the car crash and the, admittedly, sick - but nevertheless exciting - mixture of sex and death is quite effective. These people SHOULD be in grief, fighting to get back to a normal life, but instead they return to that strange moment of fright and sexual arousal, in the second before the cars smash into each other.The movie doesn't try to explain anything - it just tells the story.

            "content": "If you ever have read a work by JG Ballard (Author of 'Crash', 'Empire of the Sun', and several science fiction novels from the 60's) you will notice something trademark and reoccuring: Ballard's characters.  They are mostly shallow, empty, and unlikeable.  That makes him a tough author to adapt to film.  Here's why: as you can see in David Cronenberg's film, his direction attempts to take off into a twisted world of a cult's arousal from means violent and vehicular.  Problem is, it's depicted without particular detail of character.The characters all seem lost in their own worlds, which complements Ballard's style, but are not followed through by Cronenberg.  They are unmistakably original and interesting twisted characters that need development to explain why they act the way they do.  Take for example, James Spader plays the lead, and he is drawn into this mysterious world. I didn't come across any trace of an attempt by the usually brilliant filmaker David Cronenberg to immerse himself into this character and eventually explain this attraction into a cult that shares the interest.  Spader is almost like a robot as he goes through this world.I really don't think Cronenberg is to blame however.  The fault is the material he chose to adapt.  Yes, Ballard's fiction works are fascinating and haunting, but his methods of character development are in the world of his stories and really cannot be portrayed in film.  His characters are inexplicably empty, to be portrayed they would look, as I said earlier, like robots functioning in a way unexplained;  when really his characters have a signifigant amount of depth, while continuing a shallow existance at the same time.  That is what makes Ballard brilliant, but the film \"Crash\" a misfire.Another problem is that the film does not involve it's audience nor interest them in what is going on.  Scenes of gratuitous sex, although not unnessicary, are actually the least exciting in the movie, which is not surprising when looking at this film.  Ballard's brilliant devices are seen here as boring and intangible.The effort is understandable, but Cronenberg really doesn't seem to know how to complement Ballard in a way that satisfies the balance of the film. To do so he would have needed to create his own version and not try to stick so close to the novel so he himself could be creative with it.  Ballard's a difficult one to adapt and a filmaker would need to take on their own understanding of his characters and the way they are developed before establishing their project.",

            "content": "I should start off by saying that I'm an enormous Cronenberg fan. In fact, Crash is the only Cronenberg film I've seen that has really disappointed me. One of Cronenberg's greatest gifts is the creation of characters who, despite having an assortment of extremely unusual characteristics and enduring most surreal situations (turning into a fly, being fed hallucinations over a TV signal, etc), are nonetheless deeply human, evoking compassion and often pity and even sympathy. This, or rather the lack of this, is the primary flaw in Crash. The characters are wooden; they do not seem attached to their motives or to have any sort of life or personality outside being a vehicle for their motives. After the first 20 or 30 minutes, I just didn't really care what happened to any of them.I also tend to agree with the other reviewers who felt that this movie wasn't the shocker it's often portrayed as. Cronernberg has given us some mighty visceral imagery over the years, but fails to serve up anything really gut-wrenching in Crash. That isn't to say Crash doesn't have its share of sex, violence, and violent sex; it certainly does. But such scenes don't have the impact they should; like the characters, they come off as wooden and fail to engage the viewer's emotions. In a sense, you could say that Crash has many of the standard elements of Cronenberg's film making, except the spirit.Fortunately, Cronenberg has more than made up for it since; Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005) rank among his best works. Even the brightest of geniuses must be allowed a slump every now and then, and Crash is such a slump in an otherwise brilliant body of work.",

I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something.\" Crash 2005 is a blockbuster on the controversial subject of racial tensions in Los Angeles. Crash 1996 was just plain\u0085 controversial. A decade ago the British press ran a series of front page appeals for governmental pressure to ban a new film which they'd described as \"Beyond the bounds of depravity.\" The 1973 J.G Ballard novel, on which the film is based, had long been a favourite of mine but as the controversy raged on throughout the summer of '96' it became apparent that the film may never be shown in the U.K. Crash had already been released in France, so by the time this idiocy hit the point where an audience of paraplegics were invited for a special screening to see if they were offended or not, I had no choice but to leave for Paris where exactly one year later Ballard's 'cautionary tale' of car crash celebrity deaths would reach an apotheosis of sorts in an underpass at the Pont D'Alma.Described by its author as \"the first pornographic novel about technology\" the book is about a group of car crash survivors who, led by deranged T.V scientist Vaughn, see the car crash as a new form of sexual perversion. Vaughn's ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with the actress Elizabeth Taylor who, throughout the 60's and 70's was the Princess Diana of her day; constantly hounded by the press and ultimately crucified on the beam of her own celebrity. The film adaptation, directed by David Cronenberg, avoids the heavy traffic of 'serial bride' Liz's potential legititive clout and instead becomes 'a futuristic love story set in the present'. James (James Spader) and Catherine (Deborah Kara-Ungar) are a married couple so filled with inertia that they are desperate for some emotional connection by any means necessary. After a series of extra martial encounters they find themselves attracted to a group of disturbed members of a bizarre car-crash sect who enact famous car crashes for kicks. The pair soon find themselves willing accomplices in a tableaux of violence and desire until finally they attain some provisional approximation of actual love.Kara-Ungar's portrayal of Catherine exemplifies perfectly the icy detachment of a woman who appears to be observing herself from another galaxy. Unfortunately, the film hinges on a moment where the groups leader Vaughn, played by Elias Koteus who explains his philosophy of auto-geddon as a fertilising event rather than a destructive one to his disciple James. Koteus' delivery is addled and Spader (understandably) laughs; blowing the scene and almost the entire film with it.Nevertheless Crash is, above all, a brave attempt to explore an almost un-bearable subject \u0096 the death of affect and our unconscious desire for violence. As we're bombarded with pseudo-events and war entertainment - designed to make us consume in ways that are of optimum benefit to multi-national conglomerates who really (forget governments) walk where the power is \u0096 Cronenberg's Crash is as much a road sign warning of our impending emotional bankruptcy as it is to the sexual ambiguity of the highway pile up.",

It sounds like the heartbeat of a cyborg.I was expecting to be more shocked by this film than I actually was. The injuries are not particularly stomach churning. In the original novel by J G Ballard, the hero (whom he named James Ballard after himself) suffers a scalp laceration and some kind of stomach injury that involves a description of what happened to his bowel contents.In fact, the novel contains a lot about bodily fluids, including a poetic description of vomit and much, much more. This element is rather lacking from the film.I saw the film before I read the novel, so I was not sure what to expect from it.The characters never get out of their depths. I wondered if one of them would find himself or herself stuck in a situation he or she could not handle: too badly injured, or in too much pain, but that never happens.Given Cronenberg's history as a director of horror films, I did wonder about one of the characters actually dying and wondered what sort of afterlife they might find. Again, any concept of the afterlife was missing.Reviewers often bracket this together with two of James Spader's other films, \"sex, lies and videotape\" and \"Secretary\". I think one of the big differences between this and those films is that in them, there is a heroine who breaks through the barrier Spader's character has erected (pun intended) around himself. In \"Crash\", his character stays firmly in his own weird little world.It is odd that he shares his first name with the character he plays, but that can only be coincidence.I am not sure if the script girl we briefly see near the start of the film is fully naked, but of the main cast, Deborah Kara Unger is the only one who is completely fully frontally naked.I wasn't very impressed by the film the first time I saw it, but there is something about it that is quite haunting.

It seems a lot of people have missed the point, thinking that Cronenberg is purely trying to shock in order to keep his viewers watching. I agree it is shocking, but my reaction purely made me intrigued and these characters are carrying out these acts for a reason that is structured and understandable.\nThe performances are fantastic and produce a great ensemble cast, that fits the Cronenberg style. Spader is wonderfully controlled and carries the audience through his journey. Hunter is completely arresting in her poise and passion, as is Korteas - particularly after the James Dean crash! Unger is also beautifully cold, her physical control aids the disturbing sexual scenes to fantastic affect.Howard Shore weaves in and out of the film, always complimenting the scenes and never intruding.

But most of the time after you hit someone's car your chances are nil. Thats what makes this movie interesting. Its odd factor. There are some really disturbing shots in this film and some awkward love scenes, but like a good car accident you won't be able to take your eyes off of it. The characters are detached and zombie like while the fetishize about the strangest of things. Lots of allusions and reenactments of famous car accidents, Cronenberg did his homework. The characters in this movie are bizarre to the extreme. Rosalina Arquette shows that handicapped women can still be sexy. Holly Hunter is the woman in the business suit gone wrong, and Debra Kara Unger is detached and catatonic to the point of creepiness. Wonderful performances all around especially by Spader and and Koteas as well, as the portray characters hypnotized by obsession very well. If you want to see a disturbing yet always interesting film, in Cronenberg-esquire perversity, check this one out!",

The most interesting thing about this film is the way it is just ageneral criticism on America's obsession with action (car crashesin movies) and sex.  Cronenberg just takes the next logical step incombining the two, somewhat a la George in Seinfeld with foodand sex. Some of it definitely drags, especially the love scene betweenSpader and Koteas that for some reason feels too long before itever starts. The re-inactment of celebrity car crashes that they go see isdefinitely cool though, and somehow realistic of a potentialmodern fetish.  Still, I like Crony's old stuff much better.",

The premise of getting sexually aroused by car accidents and bodily injury is just ridiculous. Plus the sex scenes?

I wonder how some viewers that have suffered great injuries, or had loved ones get hurt, or worse, die, feel about this movie.Shame on James Spader, Holly Hunter and Rosanne Arquette for performing in such a piece of garbage.

I thought he was right about the film being anti-erotic. It is anti-erotic but its very fetish oriented. What i thought the film was about was the lack of purpose in american culture. They feel empty and being american and told happiness is for everyone and in fact is our right, they can't figure out why they are not. they have great bodies, great sex, great houses, great cars, and great jobs but it amounts to an empty dead space inside of them. You can see this is every frame of this movie. It shows with every line about the trafic getting worse and every scene of dialogue where the characters try to connect but know they dont have the words. The next level is not really a next level at all but an extension of the culture we live in. what other than sex do we worship. We worship cars and movie stars and so these thing get combined in a sort of bizarre foreplay and sexual deviance.Nicks, dents, gashes all become parts of a cars flesh. It takes on an emotional identity to the characters. They treat the cars as if they were extensions of themselves and in fact the metal and chrome of the cars does start to become part of some the characters in a backwards way(rosanna). She is part machine. This movie to me is a metaphor for longing. It examines in an extreme way our desire to be filled and not feel so empty inside. The people in this movie live in a deeply religious state and are even willing to die for it. They want to die for it in fact. They want salvation. The people in this movie are consumed with the longing for salvation from their empty lives and the fear its not there at all.The question people ask alot is why are they so empty? why don't they join a church or something? I think the people in this movie already have gone that route and found it lacking to say the least. I think this movie is far bleaker than most reviews i read so far. I think it is saying. we are headed for the big meltdown. We are driven by desire than cannot be fulfilled. The end result is desire and faith turned into violent obsesion and sorrow without end. A Disapointment so big that it drives you to death. By the way im not this bleak but i thought the movie was. And yes i did like it alot :)",

Only because probably no one has this addiction and if they did their lives would be short at best.  But that's where the average movie watcher and critic goes wrong, judging the film on what their seeing not what it's saying.You see everyone has a fetish or two, but most people think they can control it when their only fooling themselves. The characters in Crash aren't fooled as their lives revolve around what turns them on, car crashes.  And that's probably where the average person's stomach turns and out of the multiplex they go, thinking how strange and perverse the characters are. But are they?Crash won Canada's version of an oscar, and I think that's a tribute to Canadian cinema. There's no compromise, no diluted material to be found in the film. Great films aren't always liked by audiences because they weren't made to be liked. That's why hollywood recycles scripts that producers know are well liked by a wide variety of people. That's why David Lynch can't seem to find American producers to back him. The result is bland movies that try so hard not to step on anybodies toes that they fail on any and every level of what cinema is.I was surprised by the average 5.5 rating given to such a well written and acted movie. I was going to give it 9 but had to go for a 10 just out of anger at the low score. I mean this was one of the best movies of 1996, and if voters are just going to give it a 1 because they can't view something outside their morals then they shouldn't vote.

Even though I haven't read the book, I think the film blows (no pun intended). James Spader and Holly Hunter give minimal performances, and Elias Koteas is just plain weird. The only actor who was remotely tolerable was Deborah Unger (that scene where she and Elias Koteas are in the backseat when Spader goes through the carwash must have been hard).

I don't know what the National Highway Safety Commission would say about this movie -eh, eh.Still it was a fascinating topic and well done.

I didn't find that it panders to the typical Hollywood formula. It really was different and there was a certain fascination watching it which was not unlike passing the scene of an accident and looking to see what horrors had transpired.The cinematography was very good (lighting, camera angles, etc).The musical score was well thought out and it set the mood for the sombre, manic, desperate, and sad lives of the characters.Having said all of the above the whole thing was very confusing. There was no logical flow from the initial crash (Spader, Hunter and dead husband). I didn't understand the relationship between Hunter's character and Spaders... it simply didn't make any sense.Perhaps because of the confusion, I found myself wishing all of those people had died in their respective crashes. By the end, I definitely found myself wishing they all would die in a big crash that would decapitate them all. I didn't feel any empathy or understanding for the whole lot of them. Holly's husband was the lucky one... having died early in the film.The whole sexual excitement thing over maiming and mutilation as just too strange.I did not appreciate the subdued, trance-like voices that all the characters used.

I really did not know what to expect so I continued watching in the hopes that I would get something out of it.As I go on, I am convinced that this is really a weird film. There goes James Ballard and the rest of the characters with their own fetishes motivating their sexual lives (not to mention Vaughan who is really in love with his art called car crash). Basically, the only interest I had in this film was the eroticism (even with the absence of love). So I decided to wait for another boring scene so I could get rid of it. But then, something interesting is brought up--Vaughan (Elias Koteas) expresses something magical about the SEXUALITY of the people who suffered (or died) in car crashes. I figured that there seems to be a connection between \"manipulating a sexual life\" and \"driving a car\". It goes without saying that both, if not maintained, could result to one's doom.Without a doubt, there really is an interesting metaphor that should be thought through. But this film is not intense enough from cover to cover that one would stop exploring the depth of its theme (at least, that's what I think).",

That can be cool too... if you're attracted to the person who's getting turned on. By that metric, Deborah Kara Unger steals the show (if you're attracted to girls). She's the first and last woman we see in the movie, and the most sexual. I can't imagine why Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette wanted to compete with her in a sexual movie, unless it was to learn. The woman can find sexual tension staring at traffic from an apartment balcony.By the way, the movie is beautifully photographed.

            "content": "I really love the works of David Cronenberg. His idea of cinema is really wonderful. The kind of atmosphere he creates while delivering his stories is simply fabulous. Recently, i watched his film 'Crash' (1996). Unlike, his other works like 'The Fly' (1986) or 'Videodrome'(1983), i was slightly apprehensive about this one. This was because of the mixed audience response this film had got. No matter, how much we claim that we do not care about the thoughts of others, we are all guilty of basing our reaction after considering others.Nevertheless, i did end up watching 'Crash' and can safely conclude that anyone after watching this one would either love it or simply hate it. It's seems hard to imagine any other kind of reaction considering the subject matter of the film. The plot involves a group of individuals seeking sexual gratification from an unusual source that is a car crash. The film revolves around the character of James Ballard who after having survived through a horrible car accident ends up undergoing a shift in his attitude towards such incidents so much so that he begins getting sexually drawn towards these incidents . This happens after he ends up meeting with a women who was also the victim of the car accident in which he was involved.She introduces him with a person named 'Vaughan' who seems to do nothing but plan car accidents so that he can derive pleasure from them. James ends up getting to be a part of Vaughan's gang. The arousal through these activities ends up improving the sex life of James and his wife who earlier were having passionless sex. As is quite understandable a plot like this would invariably attract wide variety of reaction both positive and negative.For me the important theme that this film tries to portray is based on how an incident like a car crash which is generally associated with tragedy can really be turned into something highly sexual in nature. 'Crash' is the study of human psychology and shows how easily it can be transformed from one particular kind of reaction to another of the same event by just changing the outlook. The incidents of car crashes in this film try not to evoke sympathy from the audience but they actually try to sexually incite the audiences through such incidents.Eventually, whether this film does or does not work for you will depend upon a particular reaction it evokes from the viewer. If the thought of blood,sperm, shredded glass,dirty car etc. together disgusts you then this movie will surely not work for you.",

Typically for this morbid connoisseur his work is not out to leave viewers settled and comfortable, but to arouse, alert, provoke. Some of his favourite subject areas are lavishly caressed in Crash. The themes of addictive sex and deviant pain were mined in Crash, directly echoing their study in some of his other works, such as Dead Ringers, with Jeremy Irons and even The Fly.In this way, Cronenberg fans may be disappointed by the calm style of Crash, including a virtually happy ending (!) Crash certainly is less painful to view than many of his films. The film-making is great. A relaxed enjoyable pace allows a sleazy narcotic ambiance, almost as if Cronenberg had conceived his own idea of a better made, stylish \"9 and a half Weeks\" but done to his palate, with his twisted tools.I was amused by the film for its easiness to watch. A drifting mad movie, with James Spader looking excellent, walking through a very well made film by a unique director. The James Dean scene will be a classic one day, as will other scenes. The negativity about this film seems somewhat silly. It is just another valuable Cronenberg production, of a piece with his fantastic, often disturbing catalogue.

Crash does not attempt to fabricate an alternate envisioning of the future or the present. Interpreting this movie on the basis of reality is a mistake that rescinds its potency as an exploration of the autopsyche. Kronenberg's Crash is a marvel of cinematography as well as modernist psychoanalysis. His chilling insights into an emotionless, mechanized society definitely do not attempt to mimic reality, but they do reflect aspects of the collective subconscious that exist in the minds of every user who trashed the movie like Vaughan's car. If Crash seemed excessively violent and unappealing, it was Kronenberg's folly to release the film to American cinemagoers who seem unable to identify and appreciate the societal messages present within this dangerously stark movie.",

I'm totally seeing that one day.\" So here I am, with my fancy college degree, so many years later, having just finished viewing the film. And yes, it was totally friggin' nuts.It's incredibly well directed, superbly acted (except for Deborah Kara Unger, who barely moves her lips the whole damn movie... oops, I meant to say she barely moves her UPPER LIPS, b/c the 2nd set gets a workout in this flick... more on her later, though), and overall, not a total waste of time by any means. Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Patricia Arquette were appropriately creepy, although the only reason I can think of that Holly's name gets billing over the other two is her marketability during that era of Hollywood. She's in like... ummm 10 minutes? So. I'm thinking to myself, really, no one could possibly go into this movie thinking it's going to be a good time. If someone said, to the average moviegoer, \"Hey, wanna see a movie that explores the link between sex and car crashes, and along the way eroticizes death and scarring???\" he or she would probably get a negative response. Not that such movies aren't valid or shouldn't be made, mind you, it's just that I can't see how anyone expected to get a whole lot of respect or money for putting a freakish amalgam of T&A and twisted metal, with a dash of homo-eroticism, on the screen.I get the point. It's actually kind of eloquent and well thought... but the necessity to film it somewhat eludes me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.And onto the hot mess that was Deborah Kara Unger. She registered like .032 on the charisma scale. She freaking looked like a sleeping cat. And if my agent ever were to tell me that it was a good idea to do a film with a monologue like her tirade about penises and semen, I'd fire him or her, on the spot. That was just total crap... but I don't entirely blame her. I'm not sure there was much you could do with that turkey of a speech right there. I kept wanting James Spader to smack her and say, \"B*tch, you are SO ruining my mood.\" But I mean, hey, look how HER career took off after this blockbuster. Who the hell am I to talk? Anyway, I guess my point is, that there IS no point to the controversy surrounding this movie. Sure, there's a copious amount of chick parts, some guy on guy and girl on girl action, but it's nothing you're not going to see on the Real World on any given day. It's worth it if you want to check out a controversial and well made film, but other than that, I don't see the point.
