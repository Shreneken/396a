            "content": "If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons.\nI still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.",

This movie has a no nonsense plot which is entirely focused on the operation that was conducted for URI. The best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary romantic scene. Another best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary talks, cuss words to show the army's behavior, unlike other movies in past where half of the time is use to convince the audience why the operations are necessary. This is a must watch movie for everyone.",

            "content": "Cinematically flawed yet a praiseworthy attempt to depict an event previously unheard in India's military history. Vicky Kaushal portrays the lead perfectly. Our films do project over emotional or chest thumping Army Officers but Vicky's character is a perfect blend of suppressed emotion coated with a sense of duty. His performance undoubtedly is the greatest asset of the film. Paresh Rawal's character which is based on the lines of NIA chief Ajit Doval keeps the story moving forward. Although I feel certain dialogues like \"Surgical Strike karte hain\" in a closed door meeting with the PM and other top notches or \"Halke halke badhate rahiyega\" could have been better conceived. The Drone selection scene where an intern makes the DRDO chief look like a fool and earn Paresh's compliment \"Son you may have just won us the War\" seemed to be an attempt of comic relief. But only an actor of the calibre of Paresh Rawal could have pulled it off and he did it with a natural candour.There were other plot loopholes. The main mission was made too easy. The strikes were picturesque but the climax lacked nail biting sequences. You are in the enemy's territory furtively and wiping out a selected bunch of dreaded terrorists!!! This is where a Black Hawk Down or a Hurt Locker scores. In the end the resolute of one who decided to overstay to kill the last man standing proved that after all it's Bollywood.Apart from Vicky and Rawal's performance, casting and cinematography deserves a thundering applause. Army thrillers tend to be multistarrers and hence there's always a pressure on the script to accommodate everyone's heroics. Uri is free from this defect and therefore the actors successfully become characters in the plot. Coming to the photogenic part, Uri is visually brilliant. The long range shots of valley, the stretches of Baramulla, the night scenes were wonderfully shot.Overall, definitely a one time watch.",

In reality, while India and Pakistan's version of this 'surgical strike' have always differed, the film-maker mixes fiction with the facts available in public domain to present a gripping narrative about this covert operation. Without resorting to forced patriotism, the emotions flow naturally in the film.On the flip-side, the film-maker spends a little too much time in building up the drama to establish a personal connect with the characters in the first half of the film. This tends to slow down the pace of the narrative leaving you a bit dry as you eagerly wait for the action to begin.Vicky Kaushal is in a terrific form as the man in uniform and proves yet again why he is one of the best from the current crop of Gen-X actors.Mohit Raina (Mahadev-shiv) makes an impressive transition to the big screen and has a commendable screen presence.Yami Gautam's character begins on an interesting note. However, Aditya Dhar fails to explore more sides to it....yami's role is dull..!!Cinematography is neat and leaves you at the edge of your seats especially in the last 20 minutes of the film.Stefan Richter's action sequences are top-notch and well-choreographed.Every time, Vicky Kaushal's Vihaan screams, 'How's the Josh?' to his battalion of soldiers, you feel the adrenaline rush as you hear, 'Very high, Sir.'Uri manages to make your heart swell with pride for the armed forces who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the nation.",

The stunt work is very good and if you are faint hearted you may have some issues watching this. Just because certain things have to be taken with a grain of salt, does not make them less appealing.

The subject is something which is close to the heart of every Indian and from that stand point it is a must watch.However, if you look at the movie in isolation, well...I must say I was disappointed. But let me point out the positives first...1. The background score is good\n2. The music is decent\n3. There were atleast 4 occasions in the movie when the audience started applauding and you could feel how close the subject is to the heart of us Indians.\n4. Vicky Kaushal is good\n5. Make up of a few actors to make them look like Narendra Modi, Manohar Parrikar, Rajnath Singh & Arun Jaitley is outstanding.Negatives:1. The manner in which we've dealt with the subject looks very superficial. I don't think any real research went into making of the film. From whatever I've read on the surgical strikes, many details provided in the movie are factually inaccurate.\n2. Dramatization in the movie is unnecessary & predictable. I personally felt a little irritated towards the end.\n3. Yami Gautam's acting in the interrogation scene is outright poor (to say the least). I can think of many other actors who could have done a far better job.\n4. Kirti Kulhari looks lost in the movie and her role is absolutely irrelevant & unnecessary.\n5. Paresh Rawal is a let down as well.\n6. The person incharge of the operations giving vital Intel to the commander in Kashmir from an Auto Rickshaw in Delhi with the driver listening to him is hilarious & the low point in the movie.\n7. Dialogues are bland & doesn't evoke any emotions.Overall, if you don't look into the technicalities, you should go and watch it. Our emotional connect to the subject might make you like the film.",

Paresh Rawal deserves a round of applause for his nuanced performance as the NSA. Mohit Raina gets an interesting character to portray and he justifies it completely.

It was the first time in history India attacked a country first. Despite the film's long run time, it was fast paced with never a dull moment. It was exciting from the beginning, and never overstayed its welcome. The action scenes are incredibly well done, and the film also has deeply emotional moments. Vicky Kaushal is excellent as protagonist Major Vihan Singh Shergill.The film reminded me to some extent of 'Eye in the sky' and '13 Hours', only this was much better. 'Uri' is a fascinating film based on actual events. The cinematography is awesome, and the score fantastic. This is a top-notch production and an instant favorite.",

And the rest of the squad leaves while this is going on! 2) An intern's project being used for a real mission with people's lives at stake?Music was not that good.

To bring back every soldier alive is totally a different story.I don't know with how much accuracy the movie is portrayed, but in its run it depicts a really mature content. I came across factors like four teams, choppers (to be bought in use) and intelligence which seem inspired.The scene depicting an Indian intern capable of designing a drone (garud) on the other hand an enemy teen unable to even recognize it appeared peculiar.Final Verdict: It is the best war movie made in India until now.

Its real and hence invokes the patriotism in ourselves and you feel proud to be an Indian which is then topped with an engaging and kickass performance by Vicky Kausal he owns this role as a brilliant war stratergist & a brave soldier. Equally good performance by the supporting actors Mohit rana and Yami gautam.The Director Aditya Dhar brings a perfect balance of action and emotion in the spirit of India army and the pride which comes with it.One of the best moments in the movie is when A small girl playing the character of Major Vihaan's niece gives out a war cry tribute to her father, it will stay with your memories forever.\nThe dailogues are great and one of them specially, if you type 'how' on Google in the first few suggestions youl see 'Hows the Josh' thats how generic its become and it will go down as one of the classic dailogues of all time.This movie has set a bar on how war movies should be it is a fitting tribute to the heroism of our Armed forces, their capability of strategising, planning and execution.

            "review_title": "Propaganda but well-made and entertaining to watch",
            "content": "I was surprised when I saw this flic appear in my local video rental shop. Whenever something rated as 18+ in Germany and I've never heard about it, the typical IMDb-rate is something around 5 and the topic is something about horror, heists. But for this movie it was a whopping 8.5! Only then I saw that it was a Bollywood production, but I thought I'd give it a try. Probably just a bunch of Indians voting it up for the dancing scenes, but maybe not. It being for adults only, the dancing might be a bit rough.What I got was a full-blown action movie with heart and a seriousness one can feel right from the start. No dancing. Not to music, anyway. And a very professional production as well (AFAICT).The movie does not have much to offer in terms of plot-twists or surprises. In fact, it walks through the whole story in a very straight fashion. Experienced movie watchers might be surprised about the lack of surprises, but I guess the main target audience is the allegedly \"simple people\" propaganda usually targets.And propaganda this movie is, absolutely. Not one Indian citizen is shown who does anything morally questionable. The perfect soldier as protagonist, who also happens to be the perfect son, uncle, and brother. The perfect superiors who show a lot of compassion, the perfect prime minister who wisely listens to everybody before making a decision everybody can not only live with but even agree upon (after having seen that this is most wise). Even the \"having to torture\" scene (reluctantly executed and with a lot of shown remorse but also with a HUGE amount of determination because we all know that this was completely unavoidable) ends in a respectful talk with the victims after they have been made to see that they need to \"do the right thing\". Killing opponents, even in a most gruesome way, even after uselessly hurting them (cutting deep into the leg of a beaten antagonist) is clearly displayed as a positive action.Also any display of the Pakistani is an endless line of clich\u00e9s. Either they brag about how they deflowered a virgin, bully their subordinates or belch constantly. They also easily get fooled into being spied upon while the Indian spies never are in any real danger of being detected.I'm not easily repelled by such simple stereotypes but I was a bit surprised on how much the film makers think their audience is willing to take.Any real confrontation with the Kashmir conflict? Any display of two-sided aggression? Any dialectic at all, any relativism of the Indian position? Nothing. Alright. I got it. That's just not *this* movie.But actually, for me that was not much of a problem. I noticed it and went on watching.The movie also has a lot of peaceful scenes where the family life of the protagonist Major Vihaan Singh is shown, the Alzheimer's disease of his mother leads to some moderately suspenseful side-stories in the second quarter, and all of this is just a tiny bit slow, but it builds up very well on the mid-film climax when the terrorists attack the Uri camp and kill Singh's brother-in-law. The mourning scene was truly touching. Great child actress. -- And then a \"war cry\" is initiated by her, and answered by the lined-up soldiers. Urgs, a bit too much again. But okay.It goes on. The retaliation for the terrorist attack is well-prepared, everything goes according to (the Indian) plan. The only slight counteraction the Pakistani try is (of course) in time found out by the Indian spies on the Pakistani side (who send their drugged and apparently drunk victim home by chauffeur to learn about the disaster of the Indian \"surgical strike\" retaliation only the next day at a hangover wake-up, which is shown as a comical post-credits-scene) and avoided swiftly by replacing the helicopter by a march. Does this delay spoil the whole concerted action of four helicopters attacking at the same time? Not in this movie.In the end *all* targeted terrorist are killed (except for the one harmless boy among them who is bravely saved from being shot by the protagonist) and *not one* Indian soldier is killed. Despite being targeted with a minigun from a hovering hostile helicopter while running through open terrain. A befriended female pilot appears just in time and chases the bad guys away. (Han Solo: \u00bbYou're all clear kid, let's blow this thing and go home!\u00ab) The movie ends with the victory cry still in the field right after the mission is accomplished. Everything is good. A bunch of bad guys killed. And in a silent aftermath we see how Singh's mother surprisingly recognizes her son once more, despite of her illness. Boy, this is all so good.Writing it down makes it sound bad, boring and stupid. But despite of the clich\u00e9-loaden and absolutely foreseeable plot, despite the absolutely single-sided view on an ongoing political conflict, the movie was very entertaining and kept me watching. I actually had to force me to pause it when the night got too late and was eager to continue watching the next day. Some movies just have the right pace, the proper dialogue and characters, good actors, and -- most of all -- the proper earnest and heart in approaching their subject.",

You've earned a sincere fan.If you're an action buff or/and a viewer who likes real-event movies, this one is a must watch. URI is handled well by Aditya Dhar who balances action and emotion very well. Don't mistake it for a war movie. It's about a surgical strike, which means a military attack carried out with the intention of damaging only a legitimate military target and to prevent a full-blown war.Action is the best thing about the film. If you're a PUBG fan, the nonstop action will definitely impress you. While most of the action involves guns, some fight sequences involving fists will also make a crunchy impact. The director has tried to avoid gore for a major part and thus it's low even in the few parts where it's present.All actors impressed big time. Vicky Kaushal finally did an action movie and didn't disappoint. Paresh Rawal's neat performance is praiseworthy. Yami Gautam and Kirti Kulhari also shine in their strongly written roles. Mohit Raina makes his presence felt. Music, dialogues and cinematography are all top notch.It was after a long time that the multiplex audience cheered throughout and clapped at the end of a movie.

No jingoism, corny lines of patriotism, Just the determination and love for the country which our soldiers would be having.Also, no super-evil Pakistanis or Terrorists. Each person is shown pretty much the way they'd be in real life. Pakistanis are not shown with evil guffaws and chop-licking, but yes, their intent to hurt India and Indians is depicted in a proper manner!There are some unrealistic scenes in the movie (esp. the part about the UAVs - such drones don't have the range or the sensors that are shown in the movie) but overall very believable.Definitely worth watching!",

Just saying.THE STORYIt is right out of the pages of history and it is stuffed with high octane \"Jai Hind\" moments. Surgical Strike was a moment of absolute pride for Modern India. It was a symbol that India is coming of age and we do not anymore wish to be perceived as cowards just to be recognised as a non-violent entity.There is a bit of what some would mistake as propaganda but aren't all Patriotic/War movies guilty of it?THE TREATMENT/SCRIPT:Could have been better told. Madras Cafe, in Indian films for example laid out the premise way better and narrated the story more than action sequence.Details of an action packed vengeance mission were missing, as is the tradition in Indian movies.The war sequence is done wonderfully, fight sequences have been represented so tactically very rarely in Indian cinema. There were a lot of bombs and exchange of fire which makes the movie more of an action than story driven initiative.Now, I have come to understand that critics are slamming the script because the other party- the Pakistani terrorists camps seemed like under prepared props placed there to be butchered for patriotic kick. But for logic's sake- you generally do not expect others to enter Pakistani territories- it is always the other way round, then, the mission was kept under the wrap, and even if things spill out after such secrecy- you do not expect the Indian Army to invade your enclosure and shoot at you at the midnight's time. It's called taken by surprise. End could have been better manager!Cinematography was impressive. Direction could have been a bit better. Also, if you plan to make a Superhero film- Aaditya Dhar and Vicky Kaushal are your go to folks.THE ACTING:Vicky Kaushal impresses as he leads a big project for the first time. He has an on again off again support staff, crippled by the script who do not hold things together around him. Except for Mohit Raina and Paresh Rawal, no one else is given enough space to showcase their talent. Women, in particular the character that Yami Gautam played, could have been given a role that was a bit more prolific.",

            "content": "Since the 90s, J.P. Dutta has ruined war cinema for hindi films. The overly dramatic, passionate screaming and sentimental yearning for those left behind at home just became a cliche that was hard to shake off. Farhan Akhtar's Lakshya was the sole anomaly in this genre that was relatable, relevant and exemplary in its story telling. The advent of a new age of visionary artists who were past the phase of concocting stories with heroes larger than their characters has finally led to justice.\nAditya Dhar's research on the Uri attacks must be thorough because there is no sensationalism to convince us about the events. Political agendas, media coverage and public sentiment are kept at subtle levels so as to keep the viewer engaged with the characters and their motivations. A fictional account of the operation and its preceding events it may well be but make no mistake; Uri showcases the Indian Army's tactical prowess and therefore, is a heavy action film.Major Vihaan Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) has a proven track record of a successful surgical attack at the Myanmar border with his precise planning and execution. His ailing mother (Swaroop Sampat) keeps him posted in the Delhi headquarters, away from other action in Kashmir where his brother-in-law, Major Karan (Mohit Raina) is making the family proud.\nIt is easy to invest in these characters with the sincerity depicted by the actors and the viewer's acute sense of what is coming. The Mahadev actor Mohit Raina, especially creates an impact in a few scenes as he takes charge of the camp's defense against the terrorist attack. Sprinting across the screen, dodging bullets and determined to kill the attackers, we root for this army hero to save the day from devastation. The film's title makes a timely appearance at the end of this intensity only to stir you at the Army's memorial service for the fallen soldiers like no tragedy has since Rang de Basanti. The attack was especially personal for Major Vihaan who motivates his commandos with a powerful element apart from their extraordinary individual capabilities - Rage. The encounter during the surgical strike is a visceral manifestation of this anger that is accurate enough with one bullet but there is no hesitation to portray the ruthlessness with which they shoot each militant more than once. This is a different Indian army that is shaken to its core and will show no mercy.\nAs Paresh Rawal's Govind declares that with a surgical strike, a New India will tell the world that it is capable of not only entering enemy turf but also killing them on it, director Aditya Dhar's follow through on this bold statement is a far cry from the cliche, over-the-top dramatization of J.P. Dutta's army ventures. Precise to the point of the operation's planning, clinical in execution with exemplary cinematography, a tense and pulsating background score and the deployment of all modern arms and ammunition that support the valor of a spirited commando unit, Uri looks and feels like a Hollywood action film in its visual style and crisp editing.\nIt is real, visceral, slick and engaging cinema that makes you respect the technical team that enabled it all. This is a no-nonsense retelling of the events that shook the nation and how the people in power made bold decisions to restore faith and pride in the citizens.The performances by a competent cast are well confined to the tone and emotional depth of the characters in their situations. This is a critical area where a sound technical film can fall on its knees with miscasting and cliche performances but here, even a special appearance by Rakesh Bedi in an unusual role draws chuckles and not ridicule. Such is the impact of a fine cast that includes the likes of Paresh Rawal, Rajit Kapoor, Mohit Raina , Yami Gautam and the most credible Vicky Kaushal.Aditya Dhar deserves a lot of praise for keeping it relevant to the new gen audience that now demands realism when depicting true events. Uri invokes patriotism without the usual chants and long speeches. It trades drama and hyperbole for surgical execution of a script that stays faithful to its topic.\nThe victory song during the end credits is a high voltage anthem featuring Daler Mehendi of course, because who else can better vocalize passionate patriotism.4.701 on a scale of 1-5.",

Storyline doesn't lose it's audience attention from beginning to end. Script is leading the movie.Direction:-\nAditya Dhar is the director and writer of \"URI: The Surgical Strike\". This movie is Aditya's first movie as a director and he is like \"Fata Poster Nikla Hero\" with his directional skills. Direction is so beautiful. Director Aditya Dhar directs the story in way where you get emotions, patriotism, a bit drama and super entertainment. Last scenes of surgical strike are just excellent, audience feels that they are watching surgical strike live, so much real stick. For Aditya Dhar, WELL DONE!Acting:-\nVicky Kaushal is in main lead role and he just nailed the role with his performance. After watching his performance you would not believe that he is the same guy how played a young lover boy in movie \"Masaan\". Tv serial \"Devo Ke Dev Mahadev\" fame actor Mohit Raina proved his acting skills despite his role is too small. All other actors (Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam, Pink movie fame actress Kirti Kulhari etc.. ) did justice with their characters.Music:-\n2 songs one is \"Challa\" and other is \"Jagga Jiteya\" out of 5 songs, are enough powerful and energetic to give you goosbumps in theater. Background music also is doing its own surgical strike in background with its timing on scenes.Vfx & Cinematography:-\nSo much clarity in Vfx. All war scenes are so much real stick. This movies is next level in war scene's Vfx in India. Cinematography is also good specially in night scenes of war. Excellent work in Vfx and Cinematography.Summary:-\nThis movie is full of \"Josh\". A must watch movie who loves war movies. Practice how to whistle before watching it. :)",

            "content": "There are very few movies, which you show to your kids these days. URI is a must watch with full family. It gives the patriotic message in the most brutal and simple way. Here is my feedback:\n1. Cast - Very thoughtfully chosen the actors to play the characters in the movie. Vicky Kaushal and Paresh Rawal has done brilliant work in this movie. Mohit Raina was surprise and have done justice to the role. Yami is seen little different than what she has done in the past. Overall very balanced star cast. Without any superstars involved, this movie has gone past any other big movies from Khans I would say.2. Music - Catchy music, but this could have been little better. Background score during the stunts, surgical strike is awesome though.3. Plot - Based on true events, this movie gets you as close as possible to the real life attacks happening on India by Pakistan. URI showcases the journey of soldier, the risks, the danger and finally the revenge. Apart from all this, one great thing you could observe is the political backing to the army which is the highlight of the movie. It used to be India under attack otherwise.4. Direction - Aditya Dhar has done phenomenal job in this movie compared to his earlier work like Kabul Express or Tezz. He has taken time to establish in Bollywood, but it is worth it. Very promising and we look forward to his upcoming blockbusters.I give this movie 10 out of 10! It has set new benchmark in the industry.",

            "content": "This is what is called a good film. I went to watch Uri with my apprehensions because I highly doubted that a first-time director could pull a difficult film like this. But the film astonishes you at the beginning itself\nEveryone knows that the film is about Surgical strikes and is a more or less factual- fictional account of the same. It is about why India did URI attack and how it planned for it as well.\nVicky Kaushal excels in the role of Vihaan and there are no imperfections when it comes to him playing this role. He looks like an army officer and behaves like one. His dialogue delivery has improved miles and bounds since his first film. He has great expressions and like seasoned actors he takes right pauses and takes his time in saying the dialogues.\nMohit Raina is superb in the small role and makes a huge impact in the minds of the reader. Everyone almost cried and shouted when he died in the film. He has good screen presence and he is continuously proving himself to be a great actor. He was truly missed in the second half. Everyone missed him and that's the beauty of a great character.\nYami Gautam and Kirti Kulhari didn't have much to do in the film and both of them can be said to be a character artist in the film. It is brave that they did the film.\nParesh Rawal excels in the role of Ajit Doval and Rajit Kapoor plays Modi like it should be played. None of the characters mimicked the actual character and concentrated more on the character rather than doing the living imitation of the real characters.\nCinematography by Mitesh Mirchandani is absolutely brilliant and there are some shots you wonder how he must have taken. I am pretty sure it had been a difficult shoot for him. The movie looked like there was lots of hard work that was done in it. Editing by Shivkuar Panicker is also good and there are no redundant chunks which bore the audience. I didn't even know when Interval came. The film moves so fast.\nThe film does not stutter around the emotions, relations or romance mostly and concentrates mostly on one single theme - The surgical strikes. That is the thing the good films are made of. To have a single concept and let the story revolve around it. The film moves very fast and events unfold one after another. The movie is written in a book format and chapter names keep appearing to show time and event transitions. There is a prologue scene which shows how the Indian Army takes the revenge when their own people are killed and attacked.\nThere was thorough shouting in the hall and everyone was full of patriotism after watching the film, clapped and shout - Jai Hind. It was great to see so many people connect with the film.\nThe film is absolutely brilliant and is must watch for the connoisseur of good films. From no angle this is a propaganda film, this film is a great Indian Film and I am proud that Aditya Dhar made a film like this.",

It's hard to believe that this has been Aditya Dhar's first directional debut. Many will draw contrast with Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty or Clint Eastwood's American Sniper, yet stories based on true events do have very similar take on chronicle.Rarely do we get chance to see movies on Indian Army, leaving aside few like Vijeta -1982] or Prahaar -1991 most of them are plagued with forced chest thumping, flawed tactics making them not worth the time or dime. Even though the plot is based on true events on URI attack back in 18th September 2016 tailed by tactical retaliation by Indian Para Special Forces, its quite evident some liberty has been taken by the production unit for the sake of making the subject easily accessible to the civil population.A bar has been set on how the action movies should be made in India, Mitesh Mirchandani's cinematography is phenomenal coupled with a powerful title track from Shashwat Sachdev.2018 has been a decisive year for Indian cinema, where content has been given rank over no brainer star cast filled films; 2019 might witness a similar trend. The sheer effort tied with intense acting from cast like Vicky Kaushal & Mohit Raina, realistic action & haunting title score makes this a must watch experience on big screen.

In no way this movie had shades of a typical bollywood flick but rather it is a\nnew age masterpiece where a powerful narration will simply overwhelm you.Vicky Kaushal is the nucleus of this movie where he has done tremendous justice to the role of an Indian Army Officer . It didn't seem for once that you are seeing an actor but rather a real life officer . With roles like these he has already announced an arrival in the big league of Indian Cinema fraternity . Mohit Raina had a powerful role as well as he matched the same tenacity of an Indian Army Officer like Vicky Kaushal .Yami Gautam and Paresh Rawal along with the rest of the star cast all have yielded strong performances . The background music was scintillating which at times left you in tears and some times kicked your adrenaline rush to top notches .The action sequences of this flick could give any Hollywood flick a run for their money . The War Scenes were portrayed with grit , palpable suspense and realistic touch which literally made you feel like you are part of a real battleground. I would love Indian Cinema industry to make more realistic action sequences such as these instead of over the top usual garbage which we witness in many action movies .Lastly this movie is overwhelming in all aspects . There were moments when I was in tears and moments where my chest filled with pride as Surgical strikes commenced . The atmosphere in the cinema hall was electric as every dialogue and scene was cheered by the audience . I guess this is a tight slap to the Leftist and Marxist propgandists who were trying to discredit this movie . The movie doesn't has any hate towards Pakistan but takes a no nonsense attidue towards Terrorism being orchestrated from that soil .The characters of Prime Minister Modi , Rajnath Singh , Manohar Parikkar , Ajit Doval etc who made this strike possible at political level have been showcased without taking much names .I sincerely implore every Indian \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 whose heart beats for this nation to see this movie without a miss . Trust me guys you won't regret it . So How is the Josh ? High or Very High ? Mine has sky rocketed the moment I finished watching it .",

And even pakistan who is always show to have a weaker intelligence than India gets to know about this funny plan.DRDO chief was shown running stupidly for flying a eagle like looking drone which an intern created and this drone help us to win the war. Although the drone didn't work flawlessly and almost captured the attentions of enemies. But the point is drones these are used to attack and we are still struggling with creating a drone and our DRDO head doesn't even realize its importance.Well if these two things are truely depicted then I am seriously concerned about our defence and intelligence.

All thanks for PM for nominating Ajit Doval that was very well played by Paresh Rawal though I hope that Danny would have played that role even far greater perfection.Movie was very fast paced and many real details of surgical strike were not included e.g how Indian Army took care of all Pakistan Army Dogs that can sense things that humans cannot do etc. For people interested in more details of surgical strike can watch other documentatries on it.

            "content": "Uri: The Surgical Strike - This film is allegedly based on the real life surgical strikes by the Indian Army on the terrorist camps in 2016 in a bid to avenge the loss of lives of the soldiers who died in Uri. It takes off in a scintillating manner with the introduction of Major Vihaan Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) and his colleagues and soon introduces us to his family and the background why he must take up a desk job away from his border responsibilities. A slew of characters enter until the stage is set for the crisply orchestrated Uri siege resulting in a personal loss for Vihaan and he must return to his passion, this time with vengeance.It was a fabulous build up until the interval that kept us at the edge of the seat, but like most films of 2018, Uri goes downhill in the second half. Indeed, time had to be devoted to demonstrate the planning for the strikes and the decision makers' deliberations were legitimate, but director Aditya Dhar spent too much of screen time in admiration and adulation of the government actors, leaving no stone unturned to make Uri a great advertisement for the ruling party. The timing of the film's release is essential as it clearly aims at glorifying the government's courage with an obvious motive and at some time midway, loses focus of the army's valour. It does keep the interest and thrill alive till the end, but fails to tie in several loose ends, define numerous characters and their background and incidentally, Vihaan's personal vendetta becomes secondary. Vicky Kaushal gives a fantastic performance and gets support from Yami Gautam, Swaroop Sampat, Paresh Rawal, Rajit Kapoor and Kirti Kulhari. Uri finishes on a high no doubt, but sans the goosebumps and patriotism that it was perhaps meant to induce in us.",

            "content": "#URI-The Surgical Strike Movie Review by #SaltedPopcornWar movies have never been made extremely good in India barring a few. 'Border' had a feel, an intense one. LOC was pathetic. Thereafter, war movies have been made extremely boring till the time 'Lakshya' released. When I try to remember, I can't remember any contemporary movie name barring 'The Ghazi Attack' which I can tell, has crossed the 'Line of Emotions'.#URI, the movie based on Surgical Strike hitting 5 terrorists launchpads in PoK is not much of an exception.Though the movie has been made with utmost care to reflect courage and perseverance of Indian Army and has been shot very well, the basic element of a war movie, the feel, the patriotism, the emotion of 'Jai Hind' & the 'connect' with the viewers is still missing.A war movie should give you Goosebumps, it is not supposed to be plain. It has to invoke the feeling of 'Proud' among the viewers which unfortunately takes a back seat here.Talking of acting, #VickyKaushal has done a great job and has again proven his potential. Breaking his usual tone of acting, he has come out of 'decency' and has stepped ahead to become a strong character in this movie.Lastly, it's not a bad movie. Its a well intended and important movie. It's good to see the game plan of #SurgicalStrike, the determination to fight back the terror. It's nice to see #IndianArmy retaliating with its full force to gun down the terrorists in PoK. But at last, what matters is the connect with the audience which goes heavily missing in the movie.Had movie name was not 'URI' ( which is definitely unavoidable), the movie would have fallen flat entirely. It's just the name which saves the movie and compels people to watch it. Rest everything is just plain and usual. Can be watched once though for its subject and of course the acting of Vicky Kaushal.",

            "content": "The general mood of the nation is somber after the terrorist attack at Pulawa. Like everyone else, I am, too depressed. So, just to get out of the gloom, the pensive mood, I thought of visiting the theater to watch 'Uri', Which I have deliberately skipped watching so far considering it as an election propaganda of the present day Government. How wrong I was! In thinking too much about the political motive behind the making of the movie, I was about to miss a masterpiece. This won't at all be an over statement to say that this is perhaps one of the finest flicks ever made in India. The screenplay is the real king of the movie. There is not a single moment of melodrama in the entire 138 minute journey. There were ample scopes to make it a tear-jerker and spoil the slick look .But this is New India.They know how to make movies of international standard sans those age old songs and dances,jingoist war cries, hyperbolic villains or skimpily clad vamps. Contrary to the popular belief, there is hardly a scene to glorify any person or a party.It's a hardcore action movie in a warlike situation.Right from the first scene, the debutante director makes his intention clear. He has a solid story in his platter and he chooses to execute it in style.And the result is- a classy entertainer. Vicky Kaushal has yet again proved why he is being considered as one of the finest young actors of this country. At times I wondered if he really is an army man hiding in Bollywoof for a secret mission! So great is his portrayal of Major Vihan Singh Shergill, a man on a mission to avenge the brutalities inflicted on his fellow men. Paresh Rawal in the Ajit Dovalesque character is credible as ever.The others, too do justice to their limited yet meaningful roles. The cinematography is fabulous and at times make you believe that you are watching a Hollywood movie directed by some League One Director. The dialogues are crisp and soul touching. Overall, an out and out entertainer executed in classy style.Do not dare to miss this one.\nHow's the josh? FINE,SIR",

            "content": "The list of good Indian war movies is rather short with Border, Lakshya, Madras Cafe coming to mind. However, given that the grammar of Indian war movies has always been emotion and never action, compared to the Hollywood flicks, these fall short when it comes to the action sequences. Uri is, hence, a welcome addition to this list.\nThe first five minutes set the tone with a heart-stopping capture of a militant attack on the Indian army. The movie proceeds in chapters with the right mix of family and field life. The scene of the last rites of an army martyr, though predictable, is really touching and leaves a lump in your throat. By intermission, the movie is set up nicely for an action-packed second half.\nYou are glued to the screen as the squads destroy POK launchpads in elaborate sequences never seen before in Indian cinema. The cinematography and sound is spot-on putting the viewer right in the middle of the action. There is a bit of your usual unbelievable bollywood masala with the hero killing the main handler single-handedly but this is a minor blip in what is an engaging climax.Vicky Kaushal is brilliant as he moves effortlessly from playing an emotional son (particularly in a scene where he finds out his mother may be forgetting him) to donning the role of an operation-lead. His sister, niece, mother and brother-in-law have small roles in which they excel. However, the movies fails to develop the other key characters of the movie. Paresh Rawal is so out-of-place as Ajit Doval that every time he says something, you feel there is a comic punch line coming. Yami Gautam and Kirti Kullhari are just pretty faces and you would care less what happens to them. But Vicky's performances and the action scenes help you overlook these shortcomings of the movies.Contrary to what was being said in the media, there is very little Modi-propoganda and hardly any Indo-Pak jingoism. Just some world-class battle sequences and an immensely watchable movie worthy of a theatre-visit.",

This is what makes Uri: the surgical strike one of the most powerful, well-balanced and well-crafted movies of Bollywood. Not of 2019, not of Vicky Kaushal or any other actor, but of Bollywood. However, when I say this, I do not mean that the actors of the film deserve no recognition for their performance in this film. The actors did a swell job in their performance , all of them, Paresh Rawal, Vicky Kaushal and Yami Gautam. Whether it was an action scene or a scene which required powerful acting, the actors nailed it on the spot. Especially Vicky Kaushal in the scene where he is mourning his brother-in-law at the funeral and other scenes. One more thing which made this movie a well crafted movie was the fact that not a single minute in this movie was wasted. Each second you felt obligated to glue your eyes to the screen as you kept wondering what would happen next, even in the early scenes....much before the Uri attack or the surgical strike, and towards the climax as you anxiously must wait to see what will occur next. In the end, all I have to say is Uri is one of the most well-crafted movies in Bollywood with great action scenes, even better performances and each minute grabbing your attention in anticipation of what will happen next. In the end, you will feel that every second you spent on this movie was worth it. You will also feel proud of the Indian Army for carrying out this dangerous mission to avenge our martyred soldiers, a feeling that is likely to stay even after the movie has ended; I burst into an applause along with the rest of the theatre when the movie ended.",

There should be have been more of a continuity feeling but I felt it lacked it.Some scenes were not necessary and some scenes were a bit too long. At one point, it felt like I was playing a war video game rather than watching the movie.Pros: good acting, inspirational and emotional scenes. Get knowledge of all it all happened (even though not everything shown in the movie could be true, for example the devices that are shown to be used by the Indian army may not be true). Paresh Rawal as Ajit Doval was good. Vicky Kaushal and Yami Gautam's acting was pretty solid. Yami Gautam's looks were something to die for. She's not only a good looking woman but she sbould evolve as a versatile actress in the future that sets her apart from the chhichhora class of actresses of Katrina Kaif, Jacqueline Fernandez, Nargis fakhri, and so on.Cons: the movie lacked some more details and continuity. I think the movie could have had more related content that could have held the watchers to the seat. Some portion in the movie was predictable. When I was watching the movie it reminded me of the Hollywood flick, 13 hours. Comparing that to this, the former was goosebumps all the way in the end. I was hoping the same for this as an Indian.

            "content": "Uri: The Surgical Strike is a film written and directed by Aditya Dhar. The trailers of the film had me quite excited. After watching it last night, I was floored by the sheer excellence of the film.Plot: Major Vihaan Shergill leads a team of soldiers to avenge all the soldiers killed in the Uri Camp attack of 2016.Story and direction: It was in a very long time, that I found the cinema hall to be housefull for a film. From the very first scene the mood is set and the makers make it very clear that the film is not for the light-hearted. For a first time director I would like to commend Aditya Dhar and his team for bringing us a tale that not only engaged me but also made me feel something at the end of it. In each and every scene, you feel the hard work the makers must have gone through to make this fruitful. Although it takes a bit of time for the main action to start, I can give the benefit of doubt since we need to understand the characters and their mindset when they make a certain decision. There are moments when you feel worried for the safety of certain characters. Much of the reason as to why I enjoyed the film was because of the audience as they were shouting 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' when something important was happening on the screen. The writing of the film is spot on and you feel for even the minor characters in the movie. There are some sequences of comedy in the second half that bought a smile to my face and didn't feel forced. The action and combat sequences are well directed. Also commendable is the camera work which surprisingly didn't have any shaky movements when the action was going on. I wasn't bored for a single minute during the run-time. But even quoting that, I did have some minor issues. There are a character or two which I felt didn't get the justifies screen time and one thing (atleast for me) was totally guessable. Also, there is a small VFX shot that just looked fake.Performances: Vicky Kaushal is in the top of his game. Be it emotion or anger, he gave it all and I would like to see him more in solo ventures. Paresh Rawal is a powerhouse in himself. Yami Gautam too was just awesome. Kirti Kulhari I felt wasn't used well considering how good an actress she is. Mohit Raina gave an impressive performance in his debut. He has his moment to shine in the film and I hope to see more of him. Also, quite excellent was Swaroop Sampat. You just have to wait and watch for Rajit Kapur and Rakesh Bedi. The rest of the supporting cast were just great.Music: Sashwat Sachdev bought some great songs and an awesome background score to the film that not only suits the scene but also takes the film forward. Most of the songs I heard were for the first time. The one that impressed me a lot was 'Beh Chala'.Favorite Scene: The scene that surely caught my attention was the one before the interval. Vihaan instructs his unit to message the loved ones not to disturb the unit until a certain date. This scene sets the mood for what is about to come in the second half.Verdict: Uri is a film that will certainly go down in history as the one that not only celebrates patriotism but also some great film-making. I was floored after the film finished and clapped my hands after the film finished.I am going with a 9/10.",

            "content": "Debutante Writer-Director Aditya Dhar's Uri is a perfect tribute to Indian Army. The movie is based on the surgical strike operated by India in September 2016.The film mainly revolves around Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, head of the special formes in the Indian Army and he is very famous in organizing and executing fool proof strategies. After the successful mission in East India, he is back in Delhi upon his special request to look after his mother, an Alzheimers Patient. But things fall apart, when four armed militants made an attack on a armybase in Uri which led to 19 unarmed Indian Army soldiers including his brother were killed. India organizes a surgical strike which was headed by Vihaan.Even though, the plot is known to every Indian but never loses its steam whole throughout the movie. The first half of the movie basically caters the lives of Indian Soldiers but have plenty of action scenes. Dhar's Screenplay, dialogues, direction were top notch even though it follows Katheryn Biegalow's war movies. The thrill builds especially in the second half will give you goosebumps whole throughout. Absolutely brilliant Background Score by Shashwat Sachdev, Stunning Cinematography by Mitesh Mirchandani and Lighting, Brilliant Action Choreography and the blood pumping dialogues by Aditya Dhar are the major plus points.Bulky Vicky Kaushal is another big reason to watch. He performs at ease displaying all the emotions of a war hero. His screenpresence was noteworthy. Paresh Rawal performance was also good. I felt like Yami Gautam & Kriti Kulhari were wasted.How is the Josh??\nHigh, Sir.One of the best war movie made in India, made by India and made for IndiaDon't miss this",

He does bring out the hero that the storyline portrays him to be. All other characters, though, fail to impress.

            "review_title": "Understated Wonderful Film-making",
            "content": "The action opens with the Indian Army convoy ambush by the NSCN terrorists in Manipur in 2015. The bullets sound shriller in the untouched beauty of the north-eastern state. While this has been routine in Naxal / Terror infested areas of India for some time now, the hot pursuit of these elements into Myanmar is new. This sets the tone for the film apart from establishing Major Vihaan Shergill (Vicky Kaushal) as a celebrated special forces officer with a reputation for great planning and execution in the field.The movie unfolds into a straight narrative of the Uri attacks and India's response in the form of a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. The film excels in that all aspects of film-making here are in the service of the story. The dialogue writing is crisp and relatable. The movie speaks like regular army soldiers / officers would, occasionally overtly patriotic but seldom jingoistic. The editing is very tight and the story doesn't lag at all. In fact one feels it is shorter than the average Bollywood film which at 127 minutes it is not. The background score is effective without calling attention to itself. The music / songs add a lot to the atmosphere of the film especially because it is used in just the right quantity and at the right moments.It makes a lot of points very subtly. In the CCS (Cabinet Committee on Security) meeting, a character throws an aside about the terrorists being the enemy and not the Pakistani people but a limited war is still an option. These are just the realities of the situation and not an ideological dove vs hawk divide. Women play a key part at the highest level both in combat and non-combat roles. But they are treated as officers like anybody else. No artificial Patriarchy vs. Feminism divide here. Muslims playing key roles in the attack in PoK is simply a reflection of the reality of the Indian Army. The simple fact that the script does not call attention to it does more service to the non-communal nature of the armed forces than any chest-beating could. It is a fact and is treated as such. The terrorists do not hesitate to kill another Muslim defeating their whole argument of Jihad and reducing this to cynical powerplay. The film does not throw this in your face but moves on with its storytelling hoping you will notice it. Organisations like ISRO and DRDO are referred to and their key contribution to the defence establishment and some foibles are depicted equally effortlessly. A lot of films in the past have been consumed by the controversy of some of these points and feel obligated to take positions once way or the other. Uri succeeds in that it treats a lot of them as non-issues in its telling of the story.\nIt also avoids the trap of depicting the adversary as a bumbling idiot. Pakistan's intelligence and defenses are shown to be quite competent including the terror camps. While the operation itself succeeds with little real tension of the Indian forces facing a setback (a reflection of how it really went), it is simply because of the completely unexpected gambit and some luck. There was a very real possibility of it going the other way. In fact the Uri attack itself was very successful from a Pakistani viewpoint possibly due to similar reasons. That does not mean the India defenses are not strong but simply that reality has innumerable variables with a lot of them not really in anybody's control and every player does their best to get the most optimum outcome.The film goes about its business with military precision with few wasted words or emotions but it has a very human core. The question of a serving officers responsibility to his own family and the family's forbearance in the face of tragedy are shown with a lot of heart. The stoic exterior is not because of a lack of emotion but despite a lot of it. As an anguished wail of the battalion's motto by Major Karan's daughter is answered by the battalion, Major Vihaan's choked war cry carries more feeling then lengthy monologues or entire movies do sometimes.\nThe acting is very competent by all of the cast. Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam et al deliver very reliably which is what the need here is. However, the script does revolve around Major Vihaan with most of the key dialogues delivered by his character. And Vicky Kaushal does it justice portraying the Major in a wonderfully nuanced manner. The best part of his depiction of the role is that he continues to operate in the framework of the film by being frugal with his words but not his emotions. I feel it is harder to add nuance to a relatively non-complex character and that's what he succeeds at beautifully.This is a movie that will bear the scrutiny of repeated watching and while it may not attain the cult status of Border (a breakthrough when it came), it is a very worthy follower of the War film tradition.",

            "content": "Aditya Dhar's unforgiving war drama incorporates the events that led to the surgical strikes as seen through the eyes of protagonist Major Vihaan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal). To make things harder for him, he has personal battles to fight at home as well.\nFirst things first, Vicky Kaushal is on a roll. Interestingly, after playing a valiant Pakistani Army officer in Raazi, here he switches sides and plays an invincible Para (Special Forces) Commando, Indian Army. Justifying the hype around him, the actor continues to grow from strength to strength. His sincere and effortless presence adds depth to this film, that otherwise lacks the palpable tension you expect from a war drama. What makes it then engaging is not its execution, but the audacity of the mission it dramatically decodes and recreates. Despite knowing the result, you watch the events unfold with childlike intrigue as the complex operation plan was classified. The rigorous process - how 80 Indian Para SF commandos managed to infiltrate PoK and destroy the terror camps, makes for an instructive watch if not gripping.\nThe film scores higher on the technical front than creative. The combat sequences, ambush, gunfire, fistfights, sniper shots are realistically shot. The camera tactfully follows the soldiers like a shadow. Sound effects are crucial to combat film storytelling, and this war drama uses it effectively for most parts. The sounds of weapons and bullets are captured well but some unnecessary sounds (loud whispers, noisy footsteps) beat the very purpose of a covert mission.Though based on true events, a lot seems far-fetched and thus, questionable. One can overlook a few creative liberties, but there is deliberate and dramatic attempt to evoke emotions in the first half. While there is no harm in doing so, the emotional manipulation could have been more subtle and less predictable. Yami Gautam, Mohit Raina, Paresh Rawal and Kirti Kulhari are effective in their respective roles.\nThe soldiers give up their today for our tomorrow and no words can signify or repay the sacrifices they make for our country. Uri puts a spotlight on the thankless job they do with passion in their hearts and fire in their bellies. The film is a fitting tribute to the Indian Army conceptually but cinematically, it's not a film without flaws.",

It could have been made even more awesome not leaning towards Hollywood but making it more realistic. Seems cliche in few shots so needed few bits of editing.",

By Bollywood standards, minimal 'masala' and other nonsense\n3. Vicky Kaushal has made a sincere attempt to portray the character\n4. Nowhere I felt that the movie is getting dragged\n5. Fair footage is given to R&AW, especially, the depiction of 'deep assets'. DRDO & ISRO normally aren't even mentioned in the already rare Indian military movies(exceptions like 'Parmanu'), this movie has overcome that fallacy\n6. The arrangement of the story in chapters is a clear way of presentation\n7. I was apprehensive about 'Border'-like surreal battle scenes but phew! Snipers watching back of the assault teams, a sniper using a soldier's shoulder to base his rifle to take out the enemy, a soldier kicking down his mate to save both of them from getting hit by bullets were catching\n8. The soundtrack is listenableDismal\n1. Incessant, loud and misplaced background score. Common! You don't need bells and gongs for every scene!!! I almost lost my patience when the preps for the surgical strike were lost in music/some song\n2. While Paresh Rawal is an accomplished actor, his acting as the (possible)NSA was sloppy and unconvincing. There's no other character in the film that makes a mark!\n3. While the action sequences are above the Bollywood standards, they fail to impress. The Pak chopper unable to hit any Indian soldiers falling back in the open, the handheld rocket launchers weren't exhibited effectively in the strike scenes, the unnecessary drama of the team leader chasing alone the terrorist lead and risking his own life and his team and so on. What the other teams achieved is left for the viewer to imagine. Such operations always have hiccups and the team needs to improvise within minutes, maybe seconds\n4. The IFS and other services who would have played a role in diplomacy, PSYWAR and other political aspects of the strike have no footageIt's definitely a one-time watch.",

Like the Malay proverb goes, 'Baling batu, sembunyi tangan' - the perpetrator would start trouble by throwing stones, but with a sleight of hand, he would fold his hands behind and join the crowd acting innocent.It is an exercise of futility cracking our heads, doing the conventional way, trying to be fair, exhausting all avenues in attempting to mete justice. Many a time, we have to depend on gut feeling and God-given intellect to deduce and do the right thing. Like the hand of a traditional surgeon, he uses his senses, makes a diagnosis, makes a precise surgical incision and removes the offending ailment and returns the patient back to health. Time is of the essence. Dilly dallying with formalities and pusillanimous inertia will just tip the feeble to the point of no return.In recent history, at least twice the Israeli integrity was put to a challenge. In 1972 Munich Olympics, when a Palestinian terrorist group held Israeli athletes hostage, the German police killed five of the eight kidnappers. Hostages perished in the massacre. The prisoners were later exchanged when a Lufthansa flight was hijacked by the same group a month later. The Israelis did not wait for natural justice to take place. Neither did it remain idle for the international community to deliberate and drag its feet to condemn and advise. The following year, the Israeli Army retaliated by bombing Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The Mossad hunted down to last remaining kidnapper and killed them in broad daylight in the 'Operation Wrath of God'. The last of the kidnappers died in a planted car bomb in 1988.Another enviable rescue mission carried by the Israeli intelligence was 'Operation Entebbe'. An Air France flight from Tel Aviv to Paris was rerouted to Entebbe, Uganda. The 100-over Israeli passengers were held, hostage. Israel managed to sneak in their commandos under the cloak of the night. How they outmanoeuvred the Ugandan radars (Idi Amin supported the terrorists) still remains an enigma till date. There are many unverified reports of how they deployed the expertise of Uri Geller and his psychic powers. In 90 minutes, the Israeli commandos killed all hijackers and rescued all but 3 of the 106 hostages.\nThis 2019 film follows the same direction as many of the new movies that are coming out of Bollywood. It combines excellent cinematography with new young actors and a new narrative as told by the young minds of New India.The India-Pakistan enmity has been going on like forever. Pakistani dirty interference has been implicated in many upheavals and terrorist activities in India. This film is about one of them. When a military barrack in Uri, Jammu-Kashmir was attacked, and nineteen of Indians soldiers were killed, India had to rise to the occasion. This story is about how the Indian Army, with the help of the latest surveillance equipment, modern warfare machines, espionage and a little help from Pakistani turncoats, managed to hunt down the perpetrators of the Uri Massacre and flatten their launchpads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK).A high octane movie of high standards. The fighting scenes are believable. The actors are young and built well for their roles. The deployment of fighter planes and military strategies appear convincing enough. 4.5/5.",

The first half of URI revolves around the lengthy backstory of the characters, especially our man Vicky Kaushal. The first half also tries to evoke patriotism amonst the audience through catchy one liners. In fact, the brand of patriotism that has been imparted is not very different from what we were taught in school about how we should respect our National Flag, our National Anthem,etc.So spoonfeeding primary school stuff would not really prove to be interesting experience for most.So summaryof the first half- An Overstretched drama!And the 2nd half revolves around the operation- the Grand Surgical Strike. The makers potray the Surgical Strike exactly as it was carried out in real. So the audience gets to see nothing new, coz we have already heard all about it in the news.I feel, a War film should be innovative, and innovation has to be brought about by adding new elements than what happened in real. That way you get to please the ones who have grown up watching Hollywood war films,the ones who know what a war film really should be like. Sadly, URI has nothing new to offer and it becomes exactly like a History Channel/Nat Geo documentary of the entire operation in the 2nd half!But for those who just wanna lay back and enjoy a mindless massy movie, you can go ahead.

It talks about actual issue, planning , risks involved in a very superficial way. The discussion and pressure felt by Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Military supremo, Foreign Minister, Cabinet and many could have been shown in more matured way. ( Remember Dunkirk - though good actors , movie did not touch on real planning and merely shows action)It's not necessary to bring heirarchical comedy especially in one of the top military organisations. It's not necessary to show undue physical fight between hero and villan when time is crucial and that too at the cost of solider's life.You can see it in theater if you like action but otherwise can wait till the time it comes on net.Story - 2 out of 5\nDirection - 3 out of 5\nActing - 3 out of 5\nMusic - 4 out of 5\nEditing- 4 out of 5\nPhotography- 4 out of 5",

The team has done a splendid job which makes you admit: \"Ye naye bollywood ki film hai, aisi movies ab banegi bhi aur successful bhi hogi\". The starcast particularly Vicky, has done tremendous hard work to get in shoes of Major Vihaan and has done it extremely well. The scenes are extremely well choreographed, use of weapons and explosives is v realistic, the movie doesn't waste a single minute on any additional unwanted dramebazi and sticks to the point every sec of it. The sound tracks are a perfect match and fuels up adrenaline even more, just that using (instrumental versions) background score more often could have given more impact, but still good job there. Unfortunately the dialogues have been replaced and some scenes seem to have been removed which reduces the overall time to just about 2 hrs and makes the film look like a rushthrough. So also, the sucess of Bravo, Charlie and Delta teams have not been shown which could have added to a more complete portrayal of the strike. The supporting casts have very small roles but that's the need of the script so point taken. The violence and gore has been kept under check (which might have been more welcome) and no use of cuss words or any country or actual persons are being called out which is respectful.Overall a must watch movie for the answer will always be, when asked:How's the josh?

On the story front, you have a atypical national revenge not often seen in Indian movies, with no fanfare, jingoism or hero-worship but more focused on the narrative with substantial realism. Sure, there were a few scenes where a hero might give up weapons to take on a villian one-on-one physically, but that's still excusable with the kind of direction & acting in this movie. The way they have depicted an army operation in this movie, tactical & precise with advanced combat weapons is quite a rarity in Indian movies. Yet, I am not a big fan of the story around and the depiction of the bird-like Drone which supposedly could operate for hours and made by an intern at DRDO. Not so much realistic as the rest of the movie was.No unwarranted romance, no over-the-top action both of which something Bollywood should try more of. Special appreciation for the background score in this movie, which is often noticed in Hollywood flicks with tense music and no unnecessary, inappropriate vocals on the top.Would love to see more like these movies, fictional or based on real events.",

From get go, I was mesmerized by the cinematography of the movie especially the fire exchange scenes. Though the family drama dragged a bit but every actor delivered, even the little girl. Vicky Kaushal acting is at finest as many top Bollywood actors like Ranvir etc go over the top that I cringe to watch. I have not watched his body of work before but man, he was great. The fictitious elements like Garuda s and high level cover operation (Hollywood style) were very entertaining. Also, the movie unfolds in chapter format like cerebral western movies. Also action scenes are not ridiculously slow motion, an overused annoying treatment. Overall, it is very well-made movie that was very entertaining to watch. Not your typical masala action but more refined version of it.",

            "content": "I usually don't write reviews. I am writing this because I feel like this whole review has been a misrepresentation either because it is influenced or it is coming from the population that will click 10 stars in the name of pretentious pride and masochistic heroism.\nLet's keep the topic aside for a minute, judging it purely from the stand point of a film:\nStoryline: Was so weakly depicted. There is obviously a withering old lady that the man has to take care of, who suddenly like bad bollywood films remembers his name inspite of a worsening and apparently \"aggressively spreading\" Alzheimer's, you know because it is the end of the movie. The nurse obviously had to be pretty one so that he could fall in love with her. Though he previously indicated that he probably had a crush on this colleague, which conveniently got dropped when he found out that she is a widow. Then of course there is a side show brother in law or brother who from the beginning you know is only there to be killed heroically when his wife is the most pregnant (because obviously) so that the actual hero can use it as a core feeling for revenge based irrational decisions which for some reason is all ignored because why not. Then there is this intern who is so amazing that after a fun but somehow perfectly working brilliant prototype, he suddenly single handedly manages a big part of the mission because you know interns are so fully equipped to handle wars.Cinematography: So shabby. They tried poorly to replicate some of the inspired hand held camera work, but they probably didn't know when to stop. You could perfectly tell at every minute what kind of equipment they were using at a particular shot and what kind of disasters were happening behind the scenes because some of it was clearly visible. The editing was clearly done in short notice possibly to get it released on time before the voting.Dialogue were severely sub par and predictable. They used brilliant actors and reduced them to no-brain black and white characters with no dept to narrate a really shoddily written script.Negative implications: The movie represents how it is suddenly good for us to become irrational assholes torturously murdering people because who cares for strategies when all we want is \"their head\". Undoubtedly the testosterone clad audience was laughing and cheering when the hero was vividly slashing the throat for the last terrorist (for the drama of course) and he screams \"Indian Army\".",

Vicky Kaushal is proving his metal day by day, one more wonderful performance pulled by him, not only him other actors also did quite well, not to miss esp Mohit Raina, he just suits a army guy himself, and again the reel screen characters are matched with their real counterparts - esp Paresh Rawal as Govind (based on Ajit Doval) and Yogesh Soman (as Parrikar), Rajit Kapoor also did well as PM, not to forget Kirti Kulhari as airforce pilot. I liked the background score too much, that high-octane music with drum beats and let me say, what makes Bollywood film makers different from hollywood ones - the style, we could never let go of style, you will find out that during climax part. The movie was well-paced and a must watch. Yes at some points it seems to take some cinematic liberty but man this movie is a befitting portrayal of our DEFENCE SERVICES, they're the one serving our motherland and only because of them we are living so safely.

The CGI of drone looked so real too. As the movie was of war-drama genre, I didnt expect a lot of good movie shots of Kashmir but that wasn't the case here. Drone shots did capture some good areas. This movie didnt go for impossible stunts that is highly make-believe. Stunts on pars, with a lot of Army Level skills by performing artists.\nThe movie has some great dialogues. Vicky Kaushal probably had 20-30 dialogues throughout the movie but all of them just hits with a Bang. Aditya Dhar did an amazing job with the Storyline and Dialogue Delivery of each and every character - Vicky Kaushal, Yami Gautam, Paresh Rawal, Mohit Raina, Rajit Kapur, Kirti Kulhari etc was well timed and used only when necessary.\nThe delivery of the movie was in Novel format.

            "review_title": "Great Tribute to Indian Surgical Strike on Terrorism With a Lackluster Addition of Typical \"Bollywood Fiction\"",
            "content": "Summary: A must watch for every Human being belonging to any race, religion, caste or gender.Plot: The plot is a mixture of life of Major Vihan and his commandos leading upto the shameful attack on URI district by terrorists attacking and killing 19 soldiers in their sleep till the first half, the second half is dedicated to planning and execution of the URI surgical strike by the Indian army commandos lead by Major Vihan.Script/Screenplay/Dialogue: The overall script is very mixed, while there are parts which are highly realistic and close to ground, there are also parts of typical bolllywood massala (mostly the additional fiction). These fictional additions are not really breaking the nature or mood of the film, they are very basic and typically seen in any bollywood movie, although the writes/directors could have done a much better job if they instead added the fiction which could be more fitting in the film.Here I will list the absurd parts, no spoilers just the names, so you will realize them as you are watching the movie.\n1. Secret Agent becoming terrorist interrogator, 2. Agent not telling about GPS for no reason until the end to ummm... show attitude?, 3. Garud drone from random kid, 4. Buildup being shown as Chapters, 5. Security officer breaking phones after each call, 6. The recruit commandos somehow already know how to respond to Major Vihan's Punch line. etc.Screenplay: Screenplay is extremely strong until the final strike, the emotions, the feel, the tension everything is spot on, and that's why the film is extremely enjoyable and satisfying. The small problem I have is that I was expecting to see some scenes showcasing the other 3 groups in which all the commandos were split, but only Major Vihan's group's strike was shown on screen. But overall everything you watch on screen will be very accurate and ensure the flow of all kinds of emotion in every moment.Dialogue: The dialogue in this movie nothing over the top, and that's a good thing. All dialogues perfectly fit in the scenario and there are a couple of quote worthy one's too, including Major Vihan's punch line, Major Karan's daughter's War Cry (extremely emotional), etc.Acting/Performance by Artists: Every single actor and actress has performed very good in the movie, EXCEPT (well you had it coming) Yami Gautam.\nTo be honest, Yami's character is a complete fill in, there is no single need of that character at all, literally. Her character is totally forgettable and does nothing to add to the story. Talking about her performance, well I don't know what is with the female artists in bollywood, specially the bigger names, they are all cast for their cute faces, and the fanbase that they'll bring to the cinemas. Her performance is extremely pathetic, she is completely overshadowed by Kirti Kulhari's performance as Seerat Kaur. Just watching the interrogation scene will make you realize how bad Yami is, and that her character overall accomplishes nothing. An extreme fill in with no purpose to the story.\nOn the other hand, Vicky, Rohit, Paresh and the others do very good job as their characters.Music/Songs/Mood: 100% spot on as required, no complains here. Although I will mention that during initial credits scene the music that is used way too high energy to begin with, so the pace kicks off right from the start.Vfx/Budget/Hardware: The specifications are not released to the public, so I cannot comment on that, the budget was estimated around 60-65 million $ and I think it does a fairly good job of using that budget to create a good overall cinematic experience.Genre and it's justification: The Genre is action/war and honestly speaking, movie has a lot of realistic action and army grade gore, ofcourse this movie is not for kids in anyway, there is blood and gore in the movie which is obvious for this genre. Genre is completely justified, except for the added bollywood style fiction.Conclusion and Should You watch it in a Theater?: This is a bollywood movie I have loved in a long time, and you should definitely watch this in a theater as soon as you can.My ratings : 7/10\nReducing 3 three stars from three reasons.\n1. Screenplay didn't involve the 3 other groups.\n2. Yami Gautam.\n3. Massala Fiction.",

There are many dramatic scenes also those make move interesting and entraining.Direction:-\nAditya Dhar is director&writer of the movie. \"URI: The Surgical Strike\" is his debut movie and he is just like \"Fata Poster Nikala Hero\" with his direction fo URI. Movie gets emotions, patriotism, a bit drama with entertainment under Aditya direction. Surgical strike scene are very much well directed, you can feel that you are watching a live surgical strike. I want to say WELL DONE !Acting:-\nVicky Kausal is in main lead role and did a fabulous job, there is no doubt that after this movie Vikcy Kausal will be in the list of top Bollywood new comers. He seems exact like a army man in movie. Mahdev Tv serial actor Mohit Rain is coming first time on big screen and he proved his acting skills despite role is small. All other actors(Paresh Raval, Yami Gautam, Pink actress Kirti Kulhari etc. ) also did justice with their characters.Music:-\n2 songs one is Challa and other is Jagga Jiteya out of 5, are enough powerful to give you goosbumps. Background music also very much powerful and its timing on scenes is very much perfect.Vfx and Cinematography:-\nSo much clarity in vfx. War scenes are awesome, this movie achieved a next level in India if we talk about war vfx scenes. Cinematography is also fabulous specially in night scenes.Summary:-\n(8/10)\nA patriotism movie with full of \"JOSH\". Must watch movie. Practice how to whistle before watching this :)",

Paresh Rawal has done fine work and all the credits have been taking by our own hero Vicky Kaushal, also has done a lot of hard work on the body.Cinematography will take there as you are also part of the war.\nSound effects are done very well, highly recommend watching in Atmos sound.",

Simply well done.\nActing - Vicky Kaushal plays his part with perfection. Others are also good. But Vicky simply steals the show.\nSoundtrack - Amplifies the emotions in the film.

Each chapter progress the story forward and many of the scenarios are covered as in real world missions always do not go as planned as opposed to some movies where everything is in place and mission goes smoothly.\nDirector Aditya Dhar make the movie as a no nonsense movie with no song or love story crawling in between. The DOP has done a great job with audience are put right in the middle of action and every scene is simple to follow even though the film covers the scene from different angles. The background score keeps you intrigued and on the edge of the seat. The song challa is also used to progress the story and does not feel like it hinders with it in any way.\nKirti kulhari has a very small role, Yami Gautam look carries her character of intelligence persona effortlessly. Mohit raina makes a debut in this movie from small screen and is a good addition to the cast. I only regret that he would have gotten more screen time. Rajit kapur carries the role of \"PM\" but other than the facial look nothing works to look like the actual person. Paresh Rawal does a great job as NDA and is like a internal director in the movie. Nothing less would be expected from him.\nLast but not the least Vicky Kaushal is the new actor. Being his first solo movie he just outshines -he is the core of this movie. Strong but vulnerable in his own sense. He carries the burden of the family but is always prepared for the service of the nation. In one scene he is standing with his eyes wet but with a crisp uniform giving a tribute to a soldier and the pause at the end is a masterstroke. the army avatar is flawless and we clearly sees the effort put in. The warcry \"how's the Josh\" fills not only the onscreen cast but the audience with patriotism. Though Vickys last scene is where you might see the fiction crawling in though the film clearly states based on fact but it's been fictionalized.\nHands down the best performance by Vicky and a must watch movie",

But i never thought Indian army will do similar activity in J & K. It's one of the proudest moment as an Indian that we have to witness ever.\nNow comes the movie. It's i believe 90% similar to the real event that happened in URI Kashmir on 2016. I believe Some details were kept in the shadow for national security reason and I totally accept it. Vicky Kaushal has poured 200% from his side and each n every one of them are just phenomenal. But true hero is the story telling and the action sequences. Its not common in India to have such vivid description on something so spectacular. I congratulate each n every member of the URI team for the success.

Movie shows how badass Indian army is when it comes to defending our nation. Whole movie is just so emotionally charged up & you are constantly kept on edge of the seat till the end. Vicky Kaushal as Major Vihaan Singh Shergill is in my opinion the most badass potrayal of an Indian Soldier till date. Vicky Kaushal is a treat to watch & you can experience as to how he has grown as an actor. Mohit Raina as Major Karan Kashyap is a worth mentioning as it's his debut appearance on big screen. Yami Gautam as RAW agent is badass & crisp. Paresh Rawal is as usual excellent as Govind or you can say Ajit Doval. Special mention to Rajit Kapoor for enacting our PM NAMO.\nThe movie is worth watch & too emotional. Movie potrays life of an Indian Soldier to its reality.

Even the subtle emotions were imbibed during the whole course of the movie. You will get goosebumps during \"Vicky Kaushal's\" incomplete(due to overflow of emotions) war cry at his brother in Law's funeral. \"Mohit Raina\" and the girl who played his daughter in the movie, had a little stint in the movie, but was equally impactful. It was overall a perfect presentation of facts and acts. Not even for a single moment, you will feel bored.This movie will also boost the confidence of Indian Army. They tirelessly fight for us in every condition, we can at least take pride in their feats.Hail Indian Army. Jai Hind!",

Which not only makes the movie boring but makes it look stupid at times. Each and every actor has done a great job. It's just the screenplay and direction that really lags and they are just trying to feed audience with stuff far from truth and unwanted drama. Without any doubt one can say that this is just a commercial movie just for business and definitely not to show respect or pay tribute to the forces. I've got great respect towards the forces.

A great movie in itself on sensitive war subject between India and Pakistan.Vicky Kaushal did great acting and Paresh Rawal is suiting for the role of Ajit Doval.There are few dramatic scenes, like using Garuda Dron from College Intern but that is to keep the spirit alive and also boosting people for innovation and technologies.Visual graphics and sets were well planned. I guess in original Soldiers used Tiger/Lion urine on their clothes to keep street dogs and other animals barking away but it doesn't matter.Watched in Orlando, US and came to know just a day before release. I guessed, being a low budget and no star cast movie, AMC theaters avoided screening but luckily we got it in tickets on the 3rd day with a house full theater.Overall A Must Watch",

Of all the movies I have seen this will surely be in my top 5 list. The direction and cinematography gives an impression of a war movie made in hollywood.

Don't take me wrong i do like hindi movies like Stree, Andhadhoon last year but i sitll think those can be watched on small screen at the comfort of my home. The lack of grandure and complelling cinematography in Indian movies just does not warrent a theatrical experience.But for URI i made an exception and boy was i so happy to be wrong. From start to finish this took me on ride of all kinds of emotion. One moment i was angry and the other moment i was crying and the very next moment i just terified. Man its a been a long time since a movie actully made me cry, but when the little girl screamed the war cry in front of her father's photo; tears started to roll down from my eyes.From start to finish this kept me glued to the screen and invested in Vickey's character. The direction and acting is so daam good, i forgot i was watching a bollywood movie. The VFX team of Thugs of Hindustan should be interning at these guys' company. Mark my words both Vicky and Aditya (director) are going to be very very big names in comming years. This is how you tell a story and keep your audiance wanting for more.The only thing that kind of creeped me out is the DRDO-Drone section of the movie. I just dont see the point of inlsuing the indiginous drone story lines to the movie. The VFX for the GARUD drones are also subpar compared the rest of the movie (but still miles ahead of any other indian movies).Please please please go and watch the movie in theater !!!!!!!",

Cheesy sentimental scenes, and hard to believe action where nearly a hundred terrorists are killed and not even ONE commando dies, after being shot thousands of times. A lot of Indian national pride in the movie and in the audience, with mostly Indian natives, probably quite biased to vote high for this film, but in reality it only shows that Bollywood is doing the same than Hollywood (or viceversa?), spending lots of money in a production but only 10 cents in the storyline - this is a super interesting subject and production budget that deserved a much better writing.

Not cliche like other typical Indian films, no sign of any cringe or unnecessary emotions, no overreacting and perfect display of what Indian army truly feels about their country. Perfect display of patriotism, leading by the movie's protagonist Vihan Shergil. By watching this movie, I felt even much more prouder to the all our brothers and sisters in army who are serving the country every single risking their lives. Hats off, this movie is a blockbuster!",

To make things harder for him, he has personal battles to fight at home as well.\nFirst things first, Vicky Kaushal is on a roll. Interestingly, after playing a valiant Pakistani Army officer in Raazi, here he switches sides and plays an invincible Para (Special Forces) Commando, Indian Army. Justifying the hype around him, the actor continues to grow from strength to strength.\nThe film scores higher on the technical front than creative. The combat sequences, ambush, gunfire, fistfights, sniper shots are realistically shot.\nThough based on true events, a lot seems far-fetched and thus, questionable. One can overlook a few creative liberties, but there is deliberate and dramatic attempt to evoke emotions in the first half. While there is no harm in doing so, the emotional manipulation could have been more subtle and less predictable. Yami Gautam, Mohit Raina, Paresh Rawal and Kirti Kulhari are effective in their respective roles.\nThe soldiers give up their today for our tomorrow and no words can signify or repay the sacrifices they make for our country. Uri puts a spotlight on the thankless job they do with passion in their hearts and fire in their bellies. The film is a fitting tribute to the Indian Army conceptually but cinematically, it's not a film without flaws.",

Loved to see so much tech shown justifiably with appropriate use. One thing that I really noticed is the sound mixing, particularly in the scenes, where not only one can hear the guns firing, but you actually hear the sound of bullet shells dropping as well.

A few \"critics\" are criticizing the story as it shows the family life of a soldier. This is not a documentary and it is necessary for the movie to show that soldiers too have family to take care. Also only one soldier's family issue is show (unlike as Border). Yet a few \"critics\" are complaining.Fight scenes: 5/5. Both Gun fight and hand to hand combat is shown with perfection. Hand held and shaky camera during fight sequences has been utilized as good as it is done in Hollywood movies.Patriotic: 5/5. A few \"critics\" have definitely been paid well to propagate the lie that Uri is a propaganda film. It shows Indian Army executing one of the fines operations done by any military in the world. It shows that this large scale operation was backed by the ruling establishment of the day. These are facts that these sold out \"critics\" must realize and stop doing propaganda nonsense otherwise they will soon lose their own credibility.In all in all, its a Fantastic movie and a Must watch!

Yes undoubtedly every Indian would be proud to know the power of Indian army and all about the surgical attack we performed . All praises goes to the director Aditya Dhar for the immense detailing and throwing up so much positivity across and make us feel great . Loved the role of Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam and Kirti. Rajit Kapoor fits perfectly for the role of Namo. While Aditya is being given high credits we should also recognise the astounding work of Shashwat Sachdev for the music composition . I'm sure without this kind of music/BGM the impact of the movie in us would be far from what we feel today. After ages we were able to witness lot of applause from the crowd during the movie for many of the scenes on the way its executed . Sheer awesomeness . IMDB rates this movie at 9.3/10 and for me that stands seriously appropriate. Just go for it before it's off the movie screens and seeing these movies at home will be brutal . just to repeat If possible watch it in theatres like Satyam with good sound system for that sound matters a lot for this movie .

And for the viewers who may not know that apart from the surgical strike shown in the movie of 29th Sep, 2016 on POK, there have been many other surgical strikes like :-> Operation Ginger. Also known as bloodiest year of 2011 to 2012 on LOC.\n-> In 2002 when Operation Parakram was at its peak and heavy pounding from enemy artillery across LOC was stopped by surgical strike by Indian Airforce with laser guided targets.\n-> Capturing of peak 5310 also known as \"Reverse Kargil\". Indian army captured the point under commanding officer (Now retired) Lt. General H S Panag.These are some of the many undertaken by Special Group/ Paracommandos and JKP SOG over past 3 decades. So this movie is a very very rich tribute to our gallant armed soldiers who can do the things unimaginable with surgical precision.

The movie ticks most of the boxes right. The movie is divided into chapters and does a very good job in building up towards the strike. Vicky kaushal's character has a lot of heavy lifting and he makes us buy those things. The direction of the action sequences is carried out with great conviction and aditya dhar makes us buy those things easily. There's not a moment when we lose interest in the film. It keeps us to the edge of our seats till the very end. Each and every member of the caste has done a really good job and have done justice to their chara ters. There is a thin like between patriotism and jingoism and thankfully the movie doesn't cross this line and touches every patriotic chord of your body. A huge shoutout to mohit raina who does a really good job in portraying hos character and does his part with confidence. But the movie has its flaws there are two moments when the lead gets into a hand to hand combat with terrorists out of these the first combat was clearly avoidable and was a bit cliche. Also initially the movie goes a bit slow but it recovers it's pace and then keeps you hooked. It also makes us realise the emotional trauma that families of our brave soldiers go through. All in all its a great movie which makes every indian proud of indian army. It's a great love letter to the indian army.

            "content": "Before I review this title let me tell a thing or two about me. I rarely watch Bollywood movies in theaters. Last few movies I watched in theater are Dangaal, Neerja, Airlift, Toilet, Padman and watched first few seconds of Race3 trailer on YouTube, closed it and never bothered about it.\nWhile talking about this movie, it is thrilling, well paced, no excess drama, just straight forward great story telling. In one word it is just \"Awesome\". You will feel the flow of emotions in the theater during the tragic scenes and the excitement when there is action and they have plenty of it. This is a really good homage for our armed forces, who sacrifices a lot protecting our borders. Some reviewers have criticized Rajit Kapoor saying that he did not fit as Narendra Modi ji, which is somewhat true. But if you look at him playing his part as a sincere Prime Minister, he also did a great job. Acting does not mean mimicking all the time.\nWhere this movie could have improved, by showing some actions from other teams as well during Surgical Strike. It is 9.5/10 from me.\nWatched this movie from the front row, that definitely gives me an excuse to go for it once again :)",

Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons. I still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.",

Those frequent Hand-held Camera Movements, those never before seen Visual effects with long range Sniper Attacks or tactically placing Drones and above all, no unnecessary Emotional Drama but Superfast-paced Cold Blooded and Gripping War flick..!\nI would say two names - Vicky Kaushal who will surely find his Stardom with this one and Aditya Dhar, the Debutant Director is a volcano of talent and his homework and research reflected totally on Silver-Screen..!! Salute to you..!!\nAnd Lastly, I don't know how much the story is exaggerated or dramatized but one thing I would tell for sure that Indian Film-making's future is in safe hands and they will march ahead with their head held high far and far away..!!!\nMy Rating is 10/10 and only rating was cut cause I wanted a bit more from the supporting characters as this film was almost a One Man Show - Vicky Kaushal..!!!!",

Vicky plays the role of a dedicated soldier, Vihaan, who is known for his meticulous strategising and planning in missions. After a successful mission, he wishes to retire from army life, as his mother needs him.Review: Aditya Dhar's unforgiving war drama incorporates the events that led to the surgical strikes as seen through the eyes of protagonist Major Vihaan Singh Shergill (Vicky Kaushal). The storyline isn't entirely unpredictable; we know what will push Vihaan to take up the mission of the surgical strikes against the terrorists.The second half focuses on the Indian Army planning the attack against the militants. The tone of the film hits a crescendo as India gets ready to teach Pakistan a lesson in bloodshed and violence. Vihaan shouts, \"They want Kashmir and we want their heads!\" The soldiers holler back in agreement. The combat sequences, ambush, gunfire, fistfights, sniper shots are realistically shot. The camera tactfully follows the soldiers like a shadow. Sound effects are crucial to combat film storytelling, and this war drama uses it effectively for most parts.In the film, there is a stark difference between the intelligence meetings in Pakistan as compared to those taking place in India. The officials in the neighbouring country constantly put down India at any chance they get. Pakistani officials are boorish, with some burp-induced humour and are shown willing to drink themselves silly, whereas the Indians are constantly alert and on their toes.Uri: The Surgical Strike is clear from the word go as to which political party it caters to, and makes no secret of it. Modi and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval (Rawal) is seen in practically every scene and is part of every meeting that involves discussions on the surgical strikes. The timing of this film couldn't have been more perfect.The soldiers give up their today for our tomorrow and no words can signify or repay the sacrifices they make for our country. Uri puts a spotlight on the thankless job they do with passion in their hearts and fire in their bellies.The soldiers give up their today for our tomorrow and no words can signify or repay the sacrifices they make for our country.

The no nonsense plot is gripping from the very beginning and calls for an undivided attention till the end. There was no unnecessary diversion from the main story and the script was super tight. There is no political inclination at all and the entire lime light was centered on the Indian Army. Stellar VFX, stunning cinematography, tight screenplay, top notch direction, amazing back ground score & brilliant performances make this film a perfect (\ud83d\udcaf) cinematic experience.",

            "content": "Uri: The Surgical Strikes is a taut thriller based on the real surgical strikes against terror camps based in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.It is technically superior to almost any other Indian war movie made to date (Parmanu & Madras Cafe weren't strictly war movies). Some creative liberties have been taken, as is to be expected in a movie, and the action could have been better choreographed - though some of the hand-to-hand combat is superbly donw - but overall the fighting scenes take you right in the middle.Movies like these are much-needed. It doesn't rationalize, doesn't sympathize with terrorism or terrorists. Is not apologetic about our soldiers. Celebrates their incredible bravery.Is it a propaganda movie? No. It would have become that much less effective had it tried to be a propaganda movie. Among real-life figures, it is Doval (played by Paresh Rawal) that the movie highlights rather than Modi. Your children need to, must, see the movie. A couple of scenes may be graphic, but no more than what kids are already exposed to. And yes, I guarantee you that there won't be a dry eye in the theater at one point.Vicky Kaushal is excellent. Paresh Rawal nails it as the NSA, Ajit Doval. Rajit Kapoor plays Modi in very subdued shades, which actually work, since that keeps the focus on the action. Mohit Raina is terrific. Yami Gautam is there for the glamour Q. Swaroop Sampat is poignant. Rakesh Bedi is brilliant in a short cameo. And the little girl will break your heart.To conclude, in the 40 or so years that I have memories of watching movies in theaters, this is the first time - EVER - that cries of \"Jai Hind\" & spontaneous applause rend the hall.",

But I guess its all about pleasing the Indian audience because of their short attention span with hand to hand combat scenes and other illogical sub-plots with the revenue in mind.

Music is so apt which complements the action and the the script is so tightly bound that even if the movie ends, you'd definitely crave for more. Undoubtedly, the movie has raised the standard of the Bollywood action movies drastically. This movie is one of the best movies that I had ever watched and it won't be an exaggeration if I say that this movie is the best Bollywood action movie that I had watched till date. Infact the action scenes are so real and direction is next level, the action scenes are close to the heels of what is shown in Hollywood movies. Sometimes, in the movie certain dialogues may smell of political propoganda but that is bearable. Truly a masterpiece and hatts of to such a real acting of all the actors and this is among very few movies/series which I have watched which has shown the Army ranks and badges more or less right. Once you get out of the hall, you won't be proud of yourself being an Indian but also of INDIAN ARMY and of the Bollywood for producing such a brilliant movie.Jai Hind",

Aditya has spread the movie in chapters, an intelligent method to set a premise for the big story, when the crux is predictable - people already know the climax, so how different is the presentation ? Matters a lot, Aditya has hit that chord, taking you on a high ride from the first chapter - attack n retaliation from extremists; emotional fulcrum of Vihaan n his mother; Vihaan with his Brother - in - law Karan; the attack and the final chapter of the covert operation to avenge Indian Soldiers during very early hours, when they were unarmed, the strategy used, planning, special forces training are the peak dots that would shrill your thoughts, Music by Shashwat Sachdev covers the whole movie with a tense tone, n low thumping rock; it worked.
