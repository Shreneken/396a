Throughout the movie you want the hero to win, the director has somehow found a way to make us feel that way. My heart was pounding throughout the duration of the movie. It is definitely going to glue your eye to the screen.\nThe direction and screenplay is out of the world. He has even managed to capture the father daughter sentiments in this all round action movie.\nThe cast is wonderful. Everybody did justice to their role.\nThe story is fantastic. Its like desi version of John Wick. I would definitely love to see a sequel.\nOverall its an outstanding movie.",

            "content": "It's fairly impossible to craft an action-thriller suited to the Tamil sensibilities without acknowledging its audience. Lokesh Kanagaraj does a pretty amazing job of staying true to the pure action genre in Kaithi. It's that action thriller with a lot of heart. As we saw in Kanagaraj's earlier venture Maanagaram, Kaithi too has interweaving storylines. But the treatment is what renders it engaging throughout. It's a long film (153 minutes or so) yes, but the story moves at such a rapid pace that the audience remains consistently hooked. To put it across in a funny way, Kaithi is the kind of film where there's so much happening at breakneck speed that a viewer who's about to open the lid of a water bottle to hydrate himself/herself may hold back from doing so, till the end of another elaborate set-piece.And when we talk about set-pieces, their crafting is stunning (though exaggerated at times). Anbariv is the man behind these well-thought-out sequences that often raise the levels of adrenaline in the audience. Sathyan Sooryan (the DOP of Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru) handles the cinematography - Kaithi has been shot entirely in the night (except for the last few frames) and yet, everything that unravels in artificial light looks good on screen. The background score by Sam CS definitely ups the style element of the film, and it's one soundtrack you'll want to check up on YouTube or SoundCloud immediately once you're done watching.There are no songs or sappy romances in Kaithi - well, that's how an action thriller ought to be. I appreciate Kanagaraj for doing away with these unnecessary commercial elements, even when there are numerous 'invincible mass hero' moments. It's wonderful how Kanagaraj has given emphasis to characters other than that of Karthi's Dilli. George Maryan, who is relegated to comical roles in most films, gets a meaty character with a fair bit of action - he does a brilliantly memorable job of it! Narain, whom we're seeing in movies after a while, is wonderfully restrained and lets Karthi shine in the scenes that are for the whistling fans. Dheena offers some comic relief in the form of pop-culture references and lightens the tone of the otherwise serious flick.At the core, there's also a story about a father who's travelling to meet his daughter for the first time. While this amps up the sentimental quotient, certain scenes such as the one featuring the crushed earrings, could have been written better (or completely subverted). There isn't any suspense as the important twisty bits are given away in the opening (half) itself, but Kanagaraj's packaging works wonders here. The action bits are strongly done, and that's a more-than-good reason to watch Kaithi. Well, how often do you see a lungi-clad hero using a Gatling gun?",

            "content": "A truck load of drugs is seized by a crack team of cops in what appears to be the biggest drug bust ever. The desperate drug gang wants the consignment back at any cost.Thus begins a narrative that is a thrill ride of events unfolding over a night with well placed moles on each side and safety of the cache as well as the lives of some top cops hanging by a slender thread resting on the shoulders of a recently released convict.Karthi brings a simmering intensity to the part of the protagonist, Dilli - both as a father yearning to see his daughter for the first time after spending a decade in prison as well as the titular macho convict rescuing the cops. Sam CS throttles the proceedings onwards with his pulsating score.After a stellar debut with Maanagaram, director Lokesh Kanagaraj (LK) delivers an above average action flick that is fairly engaging and entertaining.Overall, while it may not match Maanagaram in its audacity, Kaithi, despite its flaws, is a neat action entertainer.",

No metal cutters, electric saws etc; not even when there is 900 crores worth of drugs at stake. They spend the whole night hammering at the gates with their bare hands and just at the last hour, they hit upon the brilliant idea of using their vehicle to smash down the gates.And the police station doesn't seem to have any guns in the armoury, so the old cop waits to face them with a sickle in his hand.Worst still is the fact that even when the key gang members (Anbu and Adaikalam) are both in the custody of the old cop, it still doesn't occur to him to tell the goons to back off by threatening to shoot them down.",

The protagonist more or less looks like a immortal being sent into this plot who could survive infinite amount of melee attacks and could also survive several stone attacks on the back of head.One part of the plot that revolves around the police station was too good to be true. When a bunch of youngsters who are detained in police station for drunken driving in a normal world wouldn't involve themselves in acts that could potentially prove to be fatal. But, the director defies the norm here. The detained group of youngsters (read as good samaritans) decide to help a old cop who has been transferred to that police station that night keep vigil until the protagonist along with the senior cop arrive there. As one would expect, the police station that has rogues filled in it and parasitic thugs who try to jail break the police station from the outside finally butcher one of the detainees.Just like his previous film, \"maanagaram\", lokesh kanagaraj has made this movie with logic defying stunts that are absurd to say the least.

Finally, I have got to see it and everything said about it is true. It keeps you glued on the seat from start to finish. The best thing of the film is its bgm which helps the film to not become dull and makes it worth a theatre experience. Screenplay of the film is watertight despite many things happening around. Performances of everyone is perfect. Karthi once again proves his versatility as dilli. His acting in emotional scenes were amazing. I loved the voice of anbu character (not sure whether its dubbed). Special mention goes to that police constable character who can be called as the second hero of the film. Tamil cinema is famous for family sentiments. Kaithi too has a daughter sentiment and it was very touching. Kudos to karthi and the child. And finally the action sequences. Though unrealistic and bit over the top it was very powerful. Film ends with a cliffhanger making you eager to know about dilli. On the whole, kaithi is a must watch for its interesting plot, tight screenplay and many thrilling moments. Waiting for its sequel.

I still don't know why they pushed the truck in jungle than ran to it and stopped ... 80 km distanced felt like 800 miles also the fished that college kid with stick and 4 idiots were watching them until he got killed ... Lame ...\nDirection script acting all were really really bad.... Am writing this while I am watching climax ....",

There's not even an female lead because there's no need for it. I liked all these elements in Kaithi. Karthi did an excellent job and carries the film on his shoulders. The direction and screenplay was also very good and the movie will not bore you anytime even though its full action. The bgm was also cool.

But I will mention one of it. ---Mr Karthi being hitted by 3 stones thrown at his head and attacked by knife at his back. Still, he wakes up and kills all goons singly!The story was well thought of, 3-4 sub stories mixed into one. But presentation was disappointing. A good story wasted just like most other Indian movies. One likeable character is of the new appointed police in Commissioner residence. He is good throughout the movie. The whole thrilling set up didn't even went to the average level. And finally, I thought of its message. Why was this movie made? Just a group of goons with murderous behavior being destroyed by another guy. And all that bloody episode. The movie would have been great if presented with reality. And the BGM, the rock type is just not helping.Tamil movies are becoming worse gradually. It needs to filter plagiarization from its Industry. Needs some thought and maturity in the moviemaking.",

But, KAITHI (Prisoner) has definitely a fresh approach among Tamil movies. Since the happenings are of single night events, the hero wears the same costume (that too very dirty) and with more of believable scenes.Towards the end, possibly the director is lured by typical (cliched) scenes, too familiar in most of the Tamil movies. Surprisingly, the important segment of the hero's life is told in words from the mouth of the hero, without flashback scenes. No melodrama (but for the very last scene, which is required to show the bond between the father and his beloved daughter), no songs and no stupid comedy scenes.The attack on the police station, though reminds us of old Hollywood movies, the director has modified the scenes suitable for a Tamil movie. Karthi, a main stream hero of Tamil film industry, is to be certainly appreciated for his selection of this role. Director Lokesh Kanagaraj definitely deserves to be appreciated for his overall presentation. Apart from Karthi, other actors like Narain,George Mariyan and the boy who acts as the cook and tags along Karthi, are to be definitely appreciated for their performance.Overall, a neat thriller for your weekend.",

Director Logesh Kanagaraj has mixed in the right amounts of stunts and fight sequences without going overboard like most masala Tamil movies, keeping the script in focus. Especially loved the restraint the director showed in not going into Karthi's backstory with any elaborate, action-infused flashback sequences (as is the norm), but instead revealing it in pieces in well-enacted conversations that Dilli (Karthi) has with a fantastic Dheena as the hapless lorry-owner/caterer Kamatchi.

Beyond a certain point, they become monotonous.Coming to Kaithi, it has got many things right which other action films usually don't. One is the fact that it does not lose the plot badly. The director is smart enough not to include any lousy action scenes, flashbacks, and pointless comedy. The action is limited and doesn't get repetitive. For an average Indian, it may look grim and goresome, but for fans of this genre, it may seem mild.I didn't like any of the characters. They are not good enough to love but not bad enough to hate either, i.e, they lack depth. Action is not top-notch, it's just okayish. Plot-line is thin but it's not a bad thing at all. But for an action movie, 140 minutes is too much for my liking.And now the big question is, is it worthy of 8.6/10? Well, just as much as Thadam and Ratchasan. It's high time we stop promoting mediocre films. Many Tamil/Telugu movies in the last 5 years have got ludicrously high ratings, this one is no exception.

But I kept and kept on waiting. Alas nothing at all made sense! This movie is such a waste of time and will kill your brain cells. I can't wrap my head around the ratings of this film. The actor looks nothing like a hero. In fact looks so ordinary that he would need to fight to even be a background extra in a Bollywood film. Apparently people are happy that there are no item songs and only regular scenes that printed the story. But what kind of story is this? Amateur hour at it's peak. Even the direction is not great. In fact it's such a mediocre production. Poor acting, shoddy screenplay, worst writing, this film has all the bad points. Not one god one. It was so boring that I would not mind one two unnecessary songs. At least it would have been more interesting than the crap scenes which were in the movie (even purely average tunes).I haven't watched a worse and time wasting movie than this ever in my life. I do badly wish I'd get my 2 1/2 hours back. This is the worst ever thing. The absolute worst and I hate Indian audiences for having such bad taste for liking such rubbish films.",

            "content": "Kaithi (2019) :\nBrief Review -A Hollywood Remake converted into a 'Blockbuster A Grade Action Drama' in Tamil Cinema. Among all the South Action films i have seen till date whether it is on Television or on Mobile, most of them had insensible and unreasonable action sequences to please masses therefore i don't have much interest to watch such films. Somehow, Kaithi made it to my watchlist because of High Rating in IMDb and Bollywood Remake announcement. Now i can say that, Yes, South can make Sensible Action Films with right contect, well executed Action sequences and perfect emotional touch. Kaithi is a fine example of A Grade Action Film (not a thriller at all) which is far far away from those unrealistic and non sense action flicks where any thin hero could take on 40 healthy villains and make them fly high with unseen hidden punches. Apart from Action Kaithi also takes care of proper plotting from the start to the end having all the conflicts at right places. The leading role is amazingly portrayed by Karthi. He was into the character from the first scene and never took it out of him whether it is action sequence or emotional scene. It would be hard for me to forget his image and see Ajay Devgn in Bollywood Remake even though Ajay Devgn is a Great Actor. Rest of the cast is okay but no effective impact from anyone. Lokesh Kanagraj direction is matured which is rare in this genre because he kept the essence and content alive. He did not fall apart for adding comedy and make it just another masala film, rather he made it thrilling which is rare. And despite little dark tone the film became a Blockbuster success which proves that Director's vision to make an original flick in an unoriginal genre was right. Finally a relief from senseless Action flicks in South Indian cinema since Bahubali and KGF.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

A full-blown massy entertainer that to my utter surprise had a rather courtly take.Seeing the trailers and skimming through all the rave reviews, I got super excited, needless to say, I tuned in with bucketloads of expectations. However in the early stages, things weren't looking tight enough, if truth be told, it took a substantial amount of time to get into gear but once it does, you barely get a breather.And a lot of it has to do with its simple yet effective narration. The writers had managed to find a middle ground between melodrama and naturalism. Hence, irrespective of one's personal preferences; there is something for everyone here. Nothing too perfect though, as numerous issues had troubled the execution, like the dearth of character backstories, or the more pronounced inconsistencies in its pacing. However, the story or to be more specific, the sheer presentation of it more than makes up for its excrescencies.P. S. Karthi wielding that Gatling gun (M134) with his bare hands and the pure chaos that ensues; peak 'Paisa-vasool' moment.",

            "content": "Kaithi begins with a superbly economical setup. A team of cops, headed by Bejoy (Narain), has confiscated a record amount of cocaine, which is hidden in a secret cell under the commissioner's office. The drug mafia manages to put almost every police officer in the place under sedation by spiking their drinks. The injured Bejoy, has to enlist Dilli, a life-term prisoner who has just stepped out of jail on parole and is hoping to finally meet the daughter he has never seen, to save the situation. Meanwhile, a few college students find themselves stranded in the commissioner's office with a line constable for company, and prevent the gangsters from breaking in and rescuing their boss.Lokesh Kanagaraj gives us all this in the first 20 minutes of Kaithi, a tense, impressively shot (Sathyan Sooryan is the cinematographer) action thriller. The director gives us a pure genre film minus the frills, like songs and romance, that we are used to in Tamil cinema. Even though we get two hours of action scenes, we hardly feel exhausted (the excellent action choreography is by Anbariv). Like in a video game, Dilli has to cross challenges of varying difficulty as he transports the cops to safety. We get different kinds of stunts - a chase, a couple of fist fights and just when they seem to be getting monotonous, a glorious shootout. The fact that the entire film happens in the night gives it a unique flavour, as we are unsure what danger lurks in the dark.Lokesh also comes up with an interesting bunch of characters, like the temperamental brother of the gangster (Arjun Dass), the intrepid constable (George Mariyan), the resourceful students, the spies in both the camps and the expectant daughter. The performances are solid all around. Narain lends the right amount of vulnerability, Dheena, as the hapless young lorry owner, adds some moments of levity, while Karthi, whose beefed up look feels like Dilli could be a slightly older version of Paruthiveeran, puts up a muscular performance. He also moves you in the scene where he narrates his past in a lengthy shot.If there is a fault, it is that the film feels overlong for its genre, with a couple of action blocks getting over-indulgent. But when it is action that we have signed up for, we cannot complain much about that.",

His expression towards his daughter is just show off emotion, as if not much serious about anything. In some points, Karthi's acting is worst, some expressions and actions make no sense.

What a direction, not a single second is being flown away, I was screaming in the entire movie.Karthi Sir has done phenomenal job, each and every expression, right from talking with cops, eating bucket full biryani, when he hear his daughter's voice first time, crying, his craziness, each and everything, and the most loved scene is GUNNING DOWN WITH MI34 IN LUNGI - JUST BLASTING EVERYTHING I LOVE IT VERY MUCH.I love the Anubu also, I love his voice, he is the real terror in the movie.What makes this movie more interesting is the emotional part WITHOUT ANY FLASBACK, WITHOUT ANY VOICE OVERS, just from start to end it is having each and every thing and completed in one night. The struggle inside the commissioner office by the single constable and the college student, creates intense moments which makes you bite your nails.I really loved it, and I am very damn sure Remake of this movie would be very tough.",

            "content": "Man, what a movie.This movie begins with a little girl at an Orphanage, wondering who's going to come see her, and then cuts to the seizing of drugs that are beings transported by a drug lord, by inspector Bejoy (Narain) and team. When the drug lord takes revenge by poisoning the alcohol of a gathering of the police-inspectors, Bejoy has to take the responsibility to transport the fainted inspectors to a clinic that's in a nearby town, while also facing the threat of the drug lord to return back the seized drugs which will kill the guarding humans, who guard the police station which stores the drugs. A lorry is needed to transport the inspectors, which is where Dilli, played by Karthi, comes in to the picture with a swag, who desperately wants to meet his long-lost daughter. To do that, Dilli has to drive the lorry containing the bodies with Bejoy (who vows him his daughter), and the owner of the lorry (who exists for comic relief) to the clinic and then to the police station to stop chaos. That is the main plot of this thrilling film filled with well-choreographed action. To say more is to just destroy the thrill.To be frank, this is probably one of the best Indian films to come out this year, and probably the best career choice which actor Karthi has ever made.\nTalking about the acting, Karthi's screen presence is so good that you want more of that pump-into-the-lungs kind of heroism, and George Maryan, as the newly transferred police officer, is the true hero of this story, no doubt. The cinematography, man, is praiseworthy. The mood and tension that is set by various obstacles that these trio encounter is pure cinematic awesomeness. Though, the fight scene involving many people being fist-punched by Dilli in the second-half is kinda unbelievable, I had to give in to the motivation that gives him the strength. And the climax is Diwali Dhamaka, which I will not describe it, just watch it.10/10 for the attempt to do a Mass-Action film with no masala elements or songs. Only Police and Prisoner working together to save the day.",

We get connected to each and every character and situation. The theme songs , BGM , action , slo mo everything is amazing but some action scenes I think is over shown because getting so much injured after that he is continuously fighting but police officer gets unconscious at a single punch.

            "content": "In cinema across the world, when the story revolves around mafia, corruption, police and a common man striving to help the right and be just, we have always seen that it never goes wrong. In Kaithi, we witness the same.In a gripping story on how the police lay their hands on multi-crore drugs and what ensues henceforth till the audience is left with a cue when the end credits roll that something more will happen, Kaithi is a power packed film which grips you for 2.5 hrs not allowing you to rest. It is an edge of the seat thriller where you cheer and root for the protagonist to be successful in whatever he has set out to accomplish.#Karthi is powerful in the role as Delhi, a screen name and role that will not be forgotten in the near future. He is rustic, raw, and convinces you easily as a convict who has been released from prison a good four years before he completes his life imprisonment sentence. Who knows why did that happen and if at all that was the reason. You will be left with this question when the true motive of the protagonist is left for the audiences to guess. And we just smelt a second part with that last dialogue.Karthi is that star who is an actor too and understands what works with the audience. It is very evident with the kind of scripts he selects and ensures that the message reaches the audiences without fail.The second hero of this movie is the terrific background score which keeps you restless and at the edge of your seat throughout. It is that nail biting tension of what will happen next, which makes this movie even more enjoyable.Kudos to the director for not succumbing to the usual pressure of committing to song and dance sequences trying to give the hero a role that suits his image. This song-less thriller will do wonders with the sole reason that the thriller genre has actually got one solid candidate in a very long time in the form of KAITHI.While other departments like action and stunts, cinematography, and art direction are also commendable, I wish the screenplay and writing was a little more crisp and avoided few glaring mistakes which could added more depth to this thriller. Since the audience have already smelt a sequel, I hope these are addressed well enough in the next part.Be prepared folks... Karthi is going to be back with a sequel and I cannot wait for that.Go and watch it now, else you would regret later for having missed watching this thriller in a cinematic atmosphere.",

With the entire lot of gangsters in the place after them, can the prisoner save the day?\nREVIEW\nThe film revolves around a prisoner which is released from the jail.. who is named Dilli. The entire film runs in one night.. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT it runs in one night just like Lokesh kankaragan Managaram. It's a very gripping and action thriller which hooks us completely.. Karthi shoulders the film where no actor in the movie does.. ONE MAN SHOW. Like most of the Indian Films do.. there is no any type of masala added in this film.. it's completely different from other films.. in terms of cinematography and the music. The cinematography was very good and engaging throughout the movie.. the cinematographer painted the film perfectly with his tools. THE music by Sam c.s was excellent and stupendous. It elevated the film and the hero. The technical aspects of the movie was good. The director grabs the attention through his art of taking movies.. The emotions which Karthi potrays in this film is heart touching. You can see different Karthi through this film..\nOVERALL VERDICT - YOU HAVE TO GIVE A TRY.. OTHERWISE YOU'LL MISS SOME WONDERS..",

The guts can only come from tremendous confidence in the output and Lokesh Kanagaraj emerges successful once again with his Karthi-starrer , Kaithi. Similar to the screenplay style of Maanagaram, Kaithi also has multiple plots running in parallel, where all gets connected towards one common cause.The movie opens with a big drug bust operation led by Bejoy (Narain) where the lower level mafia group is detained. Irked by this operation, the mafia leader's brother fixes a huge ransom in return to decapitating the 5 police officers involved. Unaware of the insiders from the drug mafia, the entire police force is in a party where drinks are mixed with harmful sedatives. Bejoy now has the task of transporting the entire unconscious police force to a safe medical facility without alerting media, other officials or the mafia. His only option is Dilli (Karthi) who is brought into custody for an anonymous investigation, since he alone can drive the lorry to carry the officials. Whether Bejoy-Dilli were successful in carrying out the operation or did the mafia get hold of the drugs is the remaining plot.The movie holds the audience under its clutch right from the first frame. What is surprising to see is Karthi, an otherwise experienced actor in dialogue deliveries, has been given very little dialogues and yet he manages to steal the show by his mere body language and rustic attitude. Each time Dilli manages to escape the ploy of the mafia, it is literally a case of our blood pressure shooting up. Sam CS has terrified the audience with his BGM score. Another notable highlight is George Maryan along with the college students guarding the IG office forte from the mafia. While his comedy roles in movies such as Kalakalappu made him famous, this for sure will show him in a different light.Well, the ending definitely suggests there could be a sequel/prequel to this. We can't be more excited!",

The aspect of the film which worked so brilliantly was the beating emotional core that everyone could understand: a father who simply wants to meet his estranged child. Tamil cinema should cease producing garbage star-powered vehicles such as 'Theri', 'Mersal', 'Bigil', and 'Viswasam' and start producing stylish and classy films like this.91%",

If you are an indian movies follower, does it sound boring to watch a movie which doesn't have a female lead or any songs to tap our feet? Huh. If you have any more of such doubts, take my answer. This movie is utterly impressive and absolutely worthy of your time and money. Lokesh Kanagaraj who made Managaram which again was a thrilling tale of few characters in one night. It was perfectly casted and made as a complete film and hence all eyes were on Kaithi.\nLokesh had just arrested me with his screen writing and treating every scene with so much conviction to blow audience's mind completely. The cast again was topnotch. The constable Napolean (Maryan), Anbu (Arjun das), Inspector (Naren) and every little character was so tailor made for everyone respectively.\nIt gave a fresh sense of viewing the movie as the buzz it creates right from scene one was perfectly fitting.\nExcept for a slight (very minimal) slump in second half which was actually unavoidable to have the story completed, the movie was amazingly well crafted to it true genre. Loved this movie and look forward to next avenues of Lokesh as he seem to be one of the greatest asset to Indian cinema already.",

Kudos to all the artists who have given very good performances especially Narain and the lorry owner guy, who was humourous in between the exasperating thrill ride.On the downside is the absence of few logical loopholes.1. How is that when an entire police station is being brought down by the drug peddling thugs no police force arrives to neutralise the situation.2. Karthi is at times portrayed as someone who is superhuman who rides again and again bashing the villains.I understand that these movies are to be enjoyed without us dwelling deep into the details, but given that Lokesh is really talented and a director with a mesmerising craft, he could have made the story even more believable which could have propelled the film to an even more higher standard.Nevertheless the film on the whole is a blast and is not to be missed and we need more and more of these kind of films and more directors like Lokesh.",

The entire story focuses on just one night. When massive consignment of drugs gets siezed by Inspector Bejoy,Anbu & his drug cartel begins a war against police department in order to regain their consignment. Dilli an ex-convict is released after 10 years & was misunderstood as a criminal by a police officer,gets cuffed and later on as the clock moves forward coincidently gets stuck in a war between drug cartel & police department. Now he is assigned by Inspector Bejoy to rescue police officers and must take them to hospital with the help of a truck. On the other hand an another part of story also goes on simultaneously at comissioner office where a new constable & 5 college students gets stuck coincidently.The film has Karthi as Dilli an ex-convict eager to meet his daughter almost after 10 years,Narain as inspector Bejoy was nicely portrayed & Arjun Das as Anbu ,the Drug Cartel leader was a great choice.Director Lokesh Kanagaraj has made a fine action thriller with an emotional subplot. The cinematography is kept dark as entire movie is set in the night. Aniruddh has composed a solid & hard rock background score which makes action scenes more entertaining. Combination of Hollywood style background with a Desi character was a great creative idea. Its background score is it's plus point.Overall movie is fine & serves as a mediocre dum biryani (Lokesh Fan will understand)",

Thus begins the cat and mouse game with moles in both police and gangsters activated.The whole movie is shot in night as the story happens over a night. The cinematography and background score are superb and mesmerizes you.Spoiler alert: In order to stop two gangsters from communicating, a loud music is played. The music belongs to different genres like romance. All the actors have emoted anger and frustration while the background score is romantic. I have never seen such a superb film making to date.Hats off to the team for doing such a wonderful film. Do not miss this one, this movie sets a new benchmark for tamil movie making.",
