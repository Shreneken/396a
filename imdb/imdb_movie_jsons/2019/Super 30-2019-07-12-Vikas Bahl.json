The film makes you cry, laugh, feel delighted and helpless at the state of affairs in our society. The direction is great and except for 15-20 minutes in the second half, where the film is a bit slow, there is never a dull moment.Casting is fantastic as it is and Hrithik Roshan has once again proven that he is arguably the best actor among all the superstars of Bollywood. Pankaj Tripathi has again delivered a great performance in his limited role.All in all a must watch movie. After all it is rare to see a superstar delivering a content driven film.",

It's not complete biopic of Anand kumar as I think.. many things are missing in movie, as it shows a raivalary between big coaching. But Anand kumar is about a Mathematics lover who can visualise you the complex math problems as anything like living world.. as story sometime show in movie. He can show you more in any single chapter than a book... By an large today's teachers follows his vision on Mathematics as copy paste. But he is a Pioneer of this methodology. You are just Great Anand sir, and Thanks Hrithik to play such a brilliant role..",

I enjoyed when it showed his struggles to get money to go to Cambridge and then tutoring the rich kids with then realising the issue with how the poor kids are unable to pay for education so he starts up the free coaching.The film loses me in the second half where I did not feel the power packed punch or I was not caring much of what happens. It all became very familiar where it was the good (poor people) vs bad (the big education institution) I found the film not gripping enough and the climax scene where the kids protecting Anand in the hospital just seemed very unrealistic to me and silly.Hrithik Roshan did a great job but I felt the screen play was not on point for this film. Not the great movie everyone is telling me about. I must have missed something ?",

He gave free coaching to students and guaranteed them a seat in IIT.Anand (Hrithik Roshan) literally rises to his dreams, but story doesn't touch upon the certain controversies surrounding Anand Kumar which have been reported in the media, focusing on his struggles and glory instead.Super 30' has several heartfelt, inspiring moments.But in the second half, the film's lengthy,, And some of the plot points come across as far-fetched and overly dramatic.The makers claim it's based on a true story but some of the episodes of the second half seem fictional.Hrithik Roshan pulls off a solid performance essaying Anand Kumar.\nWhen you exaggerate the extraordinary, it looks ordinary.\nThe narrative does have its flaws, 'Super 30' is a human drama and the story of a teacher with many challenges that life throws at him, to set an example for the world to see.

I couldn't even believe that it is based on true events.\nThere are many things that raised my eyebrows during course of movie which I want to highlight.1- In reality, Mr.Anand Kumar simultaneously works at Ramanujan Classes & Super 30 but in movie, rift between Excellence Caoching &Super 30is shown just to glorify Anand's image.Nothing is wrong in working for a sum of money.2- When Anand goes penniless, he sells everything in the house but still kept the maid in house, whom he brought into his home for his mother's help during his financially stable days3- When Super30 students are uncomfortable in English, Anand tell them to perform a play outside Excellence Coaching for 30 mins. I mean seriously and then they sing a song like NO NO NO NO.....4- Anand may have faced several attacks in his real life but in the movie it is depicted as if Thanos is coming to snatch infinity stone from Anand. All students gather and fight with goons with actual guns and bullets with just the help of physics.5- Students without any formal education are able to design Gobar Gas Plant and 3D projector for their hostel6- Romantic angle were deliberately added. There was no need for that. Songs are really bad except first one. Hristhik Roshan, Pankaj Tripathi and Amit Sadh are total miscast for the movie.",

            "content": "More like a fantasy tale, Vikas Bahl's \"Super 30\" rather takes you to a scientific journey of hardship and rebellion in the age of so-called democracy and freedom. Written by Sanjeev Dutta & featuring Hrithik Roshan in the lead, the film looked all set to be truly one rare case of a perfect film. Though, the case really wasn't that even if the film was good as a whole.Why? Probably the writing & a bit of direction, which took the word \"hardship\" way too seriously and provide as much spicy and happy (at the same time) as possible. While acknowledging the struggles of Anand Kumar, the climax yet seemed to be very unrealistic at times. But don't take anything away from the film yet because it's still good & fabulously inspirational, especially for the poor. However, the tone of the film, pacing and dialogue writing were all top-notch and easily understandable at the same time that all in all, ignoring that little hiccup at the end, I believe the film is worthy of all the praises. And partially, Hrithik Roshan deserves a huge chunk of credit for that as well.Without Hrithik Roshan, I cannot really imagine the huge success of Super 30. He played the key role throughout the film & nailed it as Anand Kumar in every single aspect. His character was partially one dimensional but the development over certain period unlocked the path for Hrithik to showcase his potential at the very fullest. However, let's not forget the fact that the side-casting of the likes of Pankaj Tripathi, Mrunal Thakur, Virendra Saxena, Aditya Shrivastava & others also accompanied Hrithik Roshan very well. A few characters and their attitudes were really unnecessary and highly unrealistic at times, even though that was partly due to the construction of the film using the same old formula, taking away anything from any actors would be unfair. Therefore, \"casting\" can't be doubted but I've my reservations for a few characters though.As for the technical division, I believe it's one underrated aspect of the film. Cinematography by Anay Goswami was absolutely spot-on as he simply magnificent in capturing the very essence of Bihar. At the same time, color grading & editing also accompanied him as well as the director in the perfect manner to add new dynamics to the film. However, the songs were disappointing for ears but not for the health of the film. The songs were truly situational & provided depth and intact pace to the film even though they weren't necessary. Ajay-Atul surely deserve a lot of credit for that!And so, with all those predictable storyline (as expected from an adaptation) & something different from an usual-Akshay-Kumar-type-film, \"Super 30\" is an absolute cracker of a film as well as a fine medium of inspiration for the aspirants of any age, race, religion & society. Carrying a simple message, the film somehow managed to be complicated enough to open our ignorant eyes and mentality.",

Though Hrithik is not his attractive self, he is charming in a different way. Though he is struggling to get the perfect Bhojpuri accent in his dialogues, still he has managed to perform it well.The second half of the film is lengthy, and some of the plot points come across as far-fetched and overly dramatic. Here, you see the director Vikas Bahl losses his command over the narrative as well as the screenplay.The film does run longer at more than 150 minutes. Some reduction there and simplification of the over dramatic scenes could have made the taste simpler for us.Overall Super 30 is an average movie, however acting performances of Hrithik, Mrunal and Pankaj Tripathi are good.",

            "content": "Movie name : Super 30\nGenre - Biopic / Drama\nRating - Very good 3.5/5I was awaiting the release of Super 30 ever since it was announced as I knew about the fantastic efforts taken by Anand Kumar in creating the Super 30 program (only 30 students are eligible to be part of it to crack IIT-JEE) and am glad that my patience gave in.Super 30 tells the story of young Mathematician, Anand Kumar (played by Hrithik Roshan), who assist under-privileged kids in gaining admission to IIT through his Super 30 program in Bihar.Directed by Vikas Bahl, who earlier made the memorable film Queen and the forgettable one, Shaandaar, Super 30 begins in a flashback mode, focusing on Anand Kumar's struggles right from the financial constraints for which he could not seek admission to the Cambridge University, his father's untimely death to selling papad to make the ends meet. The first half is outstanding and few scenes will give you goosebumps.The second half begins with a curiosity but is tagged by uneccesary scenes which dilutes the impact of the film. The supposedly English skit performed by the Super 30 students on Holi festival, is poorly executed followed by the over-the-top and cannot-believe hospital scene where Super 30 kids use their mathematical concepts to ward off the goons while Hrithik Roshan is being operated in an ambulance as he is hit by a bullet. Also, none of songs are tuneful and can easily be forgettable once you leave the theater and is uneccessarily placed in the film. The editing could be trimmed to make to more impacting while screenplay could have been engaging in the later part of the film.Nevertheless, the art direction and cinematography is delightful while the background score is nice. Dialogues are superb, especially \"Ab Raja ka Beta Raja Nahe Banega... Ab Raja Wahi Banega Jo HAQDAAR Hoga\" and \"Jab Zaroorat Parti Toh Avishkar Hota Hai\". Vikas Bahl does a good comeback after the disastrous Shaandaar though Queen will remain his best work.Coming to the performances, - I cannot imagine any one apart from Hrithik Roshan playing the role of Anand Kumar. The actor breathes the character of the Mathematician as it was tailor made for him. Other support comes from Pankaj Tripathi who is equally brilliant as a corrupted politician. I liked Aditya Srivastava as Lallan Singh, Mrunal Thakur who plays the Anand Kumar's love interest and Virendra Saxena who plays Anand Kumar's father.Overall, Super 30 is inspiring and motivational film to watch as it right message about the importance of education in our life.Ketan Gupta",

            "content": "Direction: Controversial director Vikas Bahl has directed this biopic movie based on life of Mathematician Anand Kumar. He did brilliant job behind the camera as it will give your intense flavor of struggle of Anand Kumar and his team Super 30.Performance: Hrithik owns this biopic drama as he acted as USP of this cinema. His looks, body language and accent will give you some surprise as this type role is quite challenging for him. Super 30 is great movie because it has great supporting roles. Virendra Saxena did phenomenal job in the role of father. Aditya Srivastava looks good in negative role. Pankaj Tripathi delivered another brilliant performance in small role. Mrunal Thakur also did the justice with her role. Amit Sadh is also good entertainer for the audience.Script: Sanjeev Dutta has tried to pen down each and every detail related to the life and struggle of Anand Kumar. We must appreciate his effort. However there are some additional play which can be cut short or remove as it derail the momentum gained by script in first half. Sometime over melodrama does not help the movie because audience feel disconnect from the script.Visual Effects: Some good effects added more value to the script. These were really demanded in this type of script.Music: This department let down this movie as Ajay-Atul failed to mesmerized the audience. There is no song which can be consider as chart-buster. \"Basanti No Dance\" was pathetic one.Box-Office: It opened with 11 crores. Second day it collected 17 crores which means huge jump for this type genre. On Sunday, it has earned more than 20 crores despite having Cricket World cup final. By this next weekend, it will cross 100 crores tag.Last Words: Go and watch and tell me your review.",

            "content": "WARNING: *SPOILERS*Super 30 looked good. The trailer was promising and could've easily been executed better if it wasn't for the Bollywood masala.Super 30 follows the story of Anand Kumar, a mathematician who created the Super 30 program to help poor and less fortunate students get a position at IIT.The first half was good. We got introduced to Anand Kumar and saw his struggle in his life in a realistic manner. The first half kept me engaged due to the realistic approach the film took and helped me connect with the protagonist more.The cinematography was great and made me feel like I was in Patna. The background score went over the top at times as it felt like it was trying to force you to feel the emotion instead of the film doing it visually. Hrithik Roshan's acting was good. Some may be bothered by his accent but it didn't affect me. Pankaj Tripathi was good with what he was given since his character had the basic label of a villain and not much else to it. Same can be said about Aditya Srivastava's character.The second half is where the movie falters for me. I'm not sure what happened but writer Sanjeev Dutta and director Vikas Bahl decided to go on a more Bollywood-like route and make the film dramatic as possible. The second half really ruined the experience by focusing too much on the villain aspect of the film instead of focusing on the main story about Anand Kumar and his students. We barely get to learn what the students are like and as a result there wasn't really any character development surrounding them.I think if Dutta and Bahl continued the more realistic approach, then this film would have been solid but continuously fixating on the villains instead telling the main story in its real format made the experience much less inspiring.I still honour the effort that went into making this film and spreading a story which needs to be told. I just wished it wasn't told in an overdramatized and unrealistic way.",

This movie is all about how he makes you believe that he is Anand Kumar, a teacher, who at first is dealt an unfair hand in life, one who gives up in front of the adversities he faces and then later on succumbs to the same greed that led to his downfall in the first place. He makes you believe in the realization he gets when he recognises that he's giving into the charm of money and that it is possible to give up everything for the greater good of the unfortunates like him.If you haven't cried so far in the film, then just wait for the climax, because that my dear friends, will just tear you right up. I was fighting with myself to hold back my tears, but one Mr. Hrithik Roshan got better of me and tears just started rolling out of my eyes. You cannot watch this man cry and not cry yourself, I don't know what he does to you, but first in Koi Mil Gaya, then in Guzaarish and now here. This performance of his will go down as the best of the best in the Indian Film Industry. If you feel this is an exaggeration, go watch it yourself.",

Coaching poor kids who are already smart is not a great task either.\nThe movie puts Anand Kumar on a pedestal and the focus is on Hrithik all the time and poor kids are just props. The movie is so predictable and the dramatic scenes are unnecessary. The only interesting bit was his father s scene as postmaster. The Sholay scene is cringeworthy and the contraptions shown in the climax to save 'holier than thou' teacher are just boring. Same old movie tropes and cartoonish bad guys drags the movie.

            "content": "Well, what more should I say here?\nFor an instance, even I wondered, why so much applauds for a Bhojpuri movie? Ah well, then I reminded myself, because it is Bangalore. This is where most of the IITians have settled after graduation.\nI guess the admiration, claps and enchore was justified for its sheer brilliance. I guess, one amongst the audience must have been a student of super30.\nI don't know, but from the noise of the crowd, I guess there might have been more than one. Such was the bonding between audience and the screen.By the way, I am not Bihari. Having said that, I loved the movie. I wouldn't go into the authenticity of the story, because I can't vouch much, as only handful of my colleagues are from super30. However, it did have such a profound impact, that I couldn't resist myself from writing this review. (PS: I rarely Do. )The best thing about this movie was the genuine portrayal of Bihar, and of the environment which creates the smartest engineering brain of India.\nNotice the scenes where graphics are used to explain, how ordinary people see things and how engineers see things, like the angle of the slingshot for a perfect parabolic motion.\nThen the question which engineering mind are supposed to focus, which ordinary minds often ignore - the number of handshakes, a permutation and combination problem.\nFor non-engineers it might be mundane, but for engineers, this is how we actually see things! Only in numbers and equations. Honestly, once you churn into that IIT-JEE, it gets so much into your system that, words confuse you, but Mathmetics comforts you. That's the level of preparation which is required to crack the exam, and needless to say, it has been perfectly represented in the screen.Following In that order, I will say was the performance of the lead actors and supporting actors. Hrithik Roshan has so unapologetically portrayed the role of a Bihari guy, and so has efficiently grabbed the accent, that you forget that he is an elite Bollywood star. This role, by any standard wasn't easy. To tone down yourself to such an extent, to be a character you, in fact any Bollywood actor, has never been is not as simple as he made it look. By far, it is his best performance till date. Acting as a Cancer/AIDS patient is so mainstream. But how does one act to be a Bhojpuri hero, where he doesn't belittle or even patronize with the character, instead take immense pride in who he actually is? Well, never ever has anyone in Bollywood risked so much. You can watch that holi scene in loop (waiting for its Netflix & Amazon release). To Hrithik, hats-off. You did something, which at the surface looks way below your standard, but when peeped deep has rare treasures of cinematic brilliance. You gave Biharis, the Bhojpuri language, the rightful respect they DESERVE.Third in the order, in my view, is the screenplay. It was not clich\u00e9d, where typical protagonist trying to create tension. Nothing was forced, or deliberate. Notice the change of heart for the protagonist, Anand kumar, after the party. How Hrithik rummages the pages of a dish cleaning boy to check what the kid was studying. There are dozens of such scenes.In the end, needless to say, I am just waiting for the Digitial release of the film.This one is definitely going to be in loop for many like me.Cheers.",

Another unbelievable instance is competition between super 30 and Excellency students, why super 30 get lower marks is spite of they were better. Also speaking English for 20 minutes task by Anand Kumar to his student tuned into dancing is looks like stupid thing and not matched with movies' subject. However, climax is again interesting. Comical scene by Pankaj Tripathy is best sequece. We see corruption in current education system, helplessness and poverty of poor students their and intense wish to get admission in IIT and a teachers genuine hardship to teach his fellows.

Questions were raised on Hritik's casting choice and skin tone, but he has failed to deliver a convincing role even otherwise. I in fact felt like looking at glimpses of his Koi Mil Gaya face in a few scenes where he is trying to portray self as kinda Mathematics maniac.Dramatization was such that one just could not digest, few starkly frustrating sequences were:\nBoy crossing rapids and river in a raft on his own to reach PatnaGoons openly challenge to kill Anand Kumar and 30 kids still no one protects them. They come and attack with loaded guns and kids defeat themOne boy ran away from the class and didn't appear for the exam yet all 30 passed for IITDoctor blatantly refuses to treat injured Anand Kumar, nursing staff is able to treat a man who is shot and bleedingSo many such instances which threw me off, Not watching Vishal's movies ever!",

            "content": "There were a lot of things that could have gone wrong with this movie. A few did. For example, Hrithik Roshan's \"Indian tan\" and accent. Still, the flaws were not unforgivable. In fact, mistakes are inevitable in any effort worth its salt.\nBut, there were a lot of redeeming features as well.The very fact that abject poverty is catching bollywood's eyes again , is itself an encouraging sign. Hrithik Roshan, all said done , delivered a fairly decent performance ( except in some scenes where he still seems to be smitten by his role in Koi Mil Gaya). The screenplay , perhaps a tad melodramatic , is however, not boring. And the story, being inspired by actual events, is interesting.So what went wrong and when?The answer is almost everything after the intermission. The director and storywriter decided to uproot the film from the soil of relative reality. While, one could catch glimpses of melodrama and incredibility in the first half, nothing prepares the audience for the way the movie flies off the handle.One would expect ( and rightly so) that a movie on the subject in question would have for its climax a riveting amalgamation of drama and emotion.\nHowever, no one would have anticipated that preceding any such things would be a Home Alone kind of a scenario, where teenagers fight with goons out to kill their mentor, using \"practical science\" and their previous vocational experience ( please watch the scene where a chap smacks down a goon the way he used to gunny sacks while working as a day labourer).The movie that could have been decent sinks unceremoniously by this rather senseless injection of incredulity, to say the least.Anyone who would have left the movie hall for a quick washroom break, would have been bamboozled by the turn of events when he returned to his seat to witness kids shooting incendiary materials from a slingshot.Having said that, it must be said that movie's heart ( if they do possess such a thing) was at the right place. While the issues it raises are serious and the story it tells quite relevant, one feels that the director should have been more\ngrounded .And that is all that can be said about this movie. I recommend watching it for the macro message.",

It was overwhelming.Anand Kumar was a mathematician but IIT entrance required study of physics and math's as well. It would have been nice if how that was handled was shown. Despite that whatever was shown complemented with someone like me (once an entrance candidate).There is a scene in movie where Anand decides to overcome fear of privileged English speaking students psychologically. I feel once you get your dream you can learn anything later. It's the same way how some cricketers learn to address something like press conference.Hrithik in this movie gives a tough competition to someone like Aamir for acting in main lead. The only thing is he dint look like real Anand Kumar. Acting from supporting cast was justified as well.Final Verdict: The goods like teaching under privileged providing them with study material and even food along with the factors like student- teacher relation filled with emotions make this a treat that you can watch with family and friends.",

The money making engine of coaching classes and the political goons who make money out of it, are all brought to the fore front.Though the greased Hrithik Roshan puts a fair show as the real life Anand Kumar, I was thoroughly impressed with rendering of Virendra Saxena who caps the Father character.The journey to the IIT with 30 slum kids on board, is marred with poor living conditions, Hunger, stressful competition, humiliation and man handling. The journey however concludes at the gates of a prestigious IIT - not sure which one in particular.Mrunal Thakur appears as an embellishment but noticeable. Vikas Bhal's problem is much complicated than the IIT entrance exam itself, he has to present the journey to the audience and hence there is a fair attempt to make the tough parts as a real life application. Well, in my view abstract parts are slightly difficult to handle but I must say it was handled well.Having read about the Super 30 in Rashmi Bansal's non-fictional publication \"I have a dream \", I was a day ahead in booking the tickets. Very eager to see the cinematic version of how it all happened, my dreams were squashed when NDTV rated the movie 2 on 5. I read through the review and was cursing myself for not able to control the urge. But, I paid for the ticket and I had to watch it by dragging myself into the theatre.It's a movie for all the kids. It's a movie for all IIT aspirants. It's a movie for all thugs of the education system of India and it's a family movie too.When I said Dynastic vs Deserving: I meant \" A prince will not necessarily be the King, the one who deserves will be\" . If you are wondering how, watch the movie.I am going with a 4.5 on 5, and I care two monkeys to the NDTV review.",

In real life, Anand Kumar runs a coaching centre to prepare candidates for the IIT JEE, but inducts 30 economically backward students from among them into Super 30, a school that has won many accolades for the humanitarian approach and its academic excellence.In the movie though, Anand (Hrithik Roshan) faces the impossible task of chasing his dream to attend classes in the Cambridge University due to his family's poor background. When his father dies, Anand has to forego his ambition and resorts to selling papad to make their ends meet. He enjoys a brief flirtation with money and fame when an education tycoon picks him up from his personal nadir to run his coaching centre, but soon gives it all up due to an inner calling to alleviate poor but ambitious students to achieve their IIT dreams. Super 30 is Anand Kumar's trials and tribulations in this journey.Hrithik Roshan is powerful in his discharge of the responsibility and puts in his heart and soul into the role. But playing this character was never going to be easy, especially with the small town attributes. This is where Roshan falters - his gait is the usual trademarked one, and the accent is gravely inconsistent. Beleaguered director Vikas Bahl makes Super 30 a commercial hash with some gimmicks including a prolonged and ridiculous take on a Sholay song and a contrived hospital rescue of the hero. I wish he had spent more time to help us connect with the 30 underprivileged students or developed the underdog theme to a more powerful essay. Pankaj Tripathi as the education minister and Aditya Shrivastav as Lallan Singh are wasted. Mrunal Thakur has precious little to do. Nandeesh Singh, Virendra Saxena, Amit Sadh and Surinder Kaur are impressive though. Music by Ajay Atul is ordinary.",

            "content": "SUPER 30 REVIEW :-\nSome film usually makes it to your watchlist so easily just because you know the content has a potential to come out as Very Good feature film product. Super 30 could be one of those awaited films having a Brilliant story and Strong content, but does it deliver? Yes it does. But not completely still enough satisfying for medium level expectations. An extraordinary story told in ordinary manners leaves Super 30 as a Good Film.Coming towards the story, we all have read something about Anand Kumar and his life, so the script might be predictable but the actual scenes deserves to be watched as we haven't seen or read it before. A story of a Genius teacher who struggled a lot for his own career then enjoyed a fame and then again quit all the lavishness just to bring the change in Business minded educational system of our country. Anand Kumar has done so much for the poor students and we can connect with his Passion quickly, and Fully unless some over-dramatic sequences force you to lose the interest. There were so many things in story such as Passion, Struggle, success story, political propaganda and Social awareness etc. all these things could have been explored and crafted in proper Cinematic manners but unfortunately the opportunity is lost now. May be this is the only reason why Super 30 never connects you throughout. You really feel and want to connect with it but it keeps losing the grip on alternate occasions.Talking about the acting, Hrithik Roshan delives a fine performance breaking his greek god image and moulding himself into a regional, local villager character. Mrunal Thakur has less screen-space but she looks deliberately cute on screen. Pankaj Tripathi is Hilarious, he eats up the entire scene whenever he comes on screen. Child artists and other cast members are decent. Ajay Atul have given a proper situational music to keep the pace intact. Removing Typical Filmy scenes and being more realistic, simple would have helped the screenplay but let it be. Direction is the weakest part here, any other intelligeent director would have connected the emotions more deeply.Overall, Super 30 is a story which deserves to be told and the message has reached safely. Some things are missing though, one can still call it a Good watchable film. That long time impact might have not been there but the it will be remembered as an honest attempt to aware society on educational issues. Super 30 should taste a Critical and Commercial success and people should be happy after watching it unless expectations are damn too high which is unlikely to happen with\neveryone.RATING - 6/10*",

Great acting.Shows how exactly our education system is a factory, creating engineers or doctors or whatever out of donation at one point. Deserving candidates sit at home and money gives education.I don't know why critics didn't like it. May be Bollywood industry pressure, or expecting a lot from a 2 hour movie. Yeah there was more scope. They could have shown some more angles to story but who cares it's already a great movie.Some really great directed scenes. Emotional at some point, entertaining, funny and more importantly motivational.Movies doesn't get boring at any point. Full to entertainment. What are you doing reading my review?

Super30 is an emotion we all have being suppressing inside but unable to vent it out. Carrying a beautiful thought of \"Padhai khatam, Ladhai Shuru\" which symbolically means we need to stop with gaining education and now we need to fight. Fight against all these social evils, these thoughts which are making us discriminate, fight for the right and make the deserving one become the KING. Sadly we all are just gaining knowledge and dumping it for our own good and still we aren't doing as much good as we expect for ourself. The movie shows Extremely dark state of society presented in a light humorous and delightful way. Top notch Direction and technical team has just created a dinosaur out of nowhere. The best part is Hrithik. He best piece of work till date and he deserves every bit of appreciation for it. Very good casting and the kids have done a great job as well. Its an Extremely very well written movie with top class Direction and Super acting taking it into Hall of fame of modern cult movies like 3 IDIOTS, Munnabhai, Dangal. Its a must watch movie and it should be screened in all the schools compulsorily. You just cannot afford to miss this one.\nSuper 30... for you\n#svjreviews #super30 #hrithik #mustwatch",

He is the one who has to be blamed for the wrongdoings in the story, however, I always felt pity.

Audience is loving her presence.\nI love the face of between Aditya Shrivastav and Hrithik in so many scenes. It was like Kante ki takkar. Pankaj Tripathi plays his character well. Kids and others are supportive too.\nExtraordinary use of VFX and Background music. It was lovely to here Udit Narayan's voice after a long time in a romantic track along with Shreya. Music is given by Ajay Atul, while Lyrics have been penned by Amitabh Battacharya. Basanti Song was good, too. Paisa song was the best one for me according to the story. It came on the right time. And the film got pace.\nBest thing about this film is its film-making. It is simply fantastic. I think it is Vikas Behal's best directorial product. However, I felt confused in the climax, whether such type of incedents happened, or it was fictional. Story was good, but not the best. Screenplay lacks that passion. It was more of a melodrama. People watching non-Hindi and English films may not be able to attach with this film totally. But aam janta will love it.\nI must say that, Anand Kumar surely had a tough life. Those threats, even till last year, on both Kumar brothers, are shocking. Education is not a business. People on top should understand this. Kudos to Anand Kumar and his supporters for opening Super 30 batch for poor but ambitious kids.\nThe hall was packed. People were clapping and cheering throughout the run. It was the last scene which got many of us. Along with Hrithik, many viewers had tears. That scene surely defines how good he is in acting. It will be a sure hit. Take your family and enjoy this film. Get inspired to learn something and give it back to the needful.",

            "content": "Raja wohi banega , Jo hakdaar hoga (has been fully justified)Anand(Hrithik Roshan) is the most brilliant mind in Patna. He is eldest of two son's of the postman of the area. He is in love with the most richest man's daughter in his area, Ritu(Mrunal Thakur).The movie starts with one of Anand's students Mr. Fugga Kumar(Vijay Varma) receiving an award at an International event for his contribution in aeronautics. In his thank yo speech, he thanks the people who made the same possible, and started narrating the story of the most important person in his life.On winning the 1st prize for a debate competition in the area, Minister Devraj praises Anand for his intellectual and promises any and all assistance for any requirements in the future. But, the time comes soon, when Anand gets an admission into the esteemed Cambridge University in London and they reach out to Devraj for financial assistance, but is turned down for the same. In the process of trying to acquire the funding for his education, his father (Virendra Saxena) passed away.With no food in the house, the family has resorted to selling pappad to make ends meet. It is then when Lallan Singh(Aditya Shrivastava) offers Anand a job to teach Mathematics at his IIT coaching institute in Patna callled the Excellance Coaching. This changed lives for Anand and his family. The coaching center started minting money and rising Anand as the authorized signatory of the institute. But then one night, he got a reality check from a cycle rickshaw wala about the unsaid patriarchy which intertwines the life styles and the education system. \"Raja ka beta raja aur tangewala ka beta tangewala hi banta hai. Yahi duniya ka niyam hai.\"He remembers his father who used to stay \"Ab raja ka beta raja nahi banega, raja wohi banega , jo hakdaar hoga\". Anad quits his job at Excellance Coaching and with his savings he starts a coaching center with hostel servcies completely free for poor kids who cannot afford the education they deserve due to their pathetic living conditions.Being a biopic on Anand Kumar, the mathematician who won the Rashtriya Bal Kalyan Award, the rest of the movie shows his struggle to keep the institute up and running and the challenges he faces financially, physically and politically for the same.",

The stories like super 30 muatbe told to a larger audience and for that they made it in an entertaining way. But that doesn't remove any emotional connect of the film. The climax is such a fine one that everyone will feel it. Hrithik delivers a strong performance and he made everyone believe he is Anand.\nLoved the movie.",

Nandish Singh should be termed as unsung hero of the movie, Mrunal Thakur is honest with her limited screen space, Aditya Srivastava looks fresh and does the role with perfection, the only disappointment is the limited space given to the utmost talented Pankaj Tripathi.Direction of Vikas Bahl was great and a strong comeback by him after the disastrous 'Shandaar'. The movie is great but the second part is little slow and could have been little better.Overall one of the most inspiring movie and the best part is now Bollywood is making such kind of movies.A must watch.",

Coming to the casting and performances of the film - Hrithik Roshan went way out his comfort zone to deliver this character which is very commendable, I liked his performance very much but he definitely wasn't the best fit for this role, the casting of the students and the other supporting roles were also on point. Mrunal Thakur had a very little amount of screen time but managed to do wonders with her role and it was very pleasing to see Aditya Shrivastava back and Pankaj Tripathi, with his unibrow, was a breathe of fresh air to the film. The movie was filled with little stupid but funny gags which kept the momentum going. The movie is narrated by Vijay Varma who also has a cameo in the film. I had a tough time to get used to the background score of the film which was sometimes like a fairytale and sometimes like a war movie, which made sense as the film was based on IIT. The film did get a bit dramatic and surreal in the second half. At the end, I thought the movie was wonderful and we have to give the credit to the makers.",

If only the movie had stuck to the original story - it would have been a very good movie.Ps: One big point the movie makers failed to understand in their exuberance to make a Rich/Poor themed movie, is that 90 % of students who pay hefty fees in big coaching centres especially in Rajender Nagar, Kota etc are not from Rich families but from Middle Class backgrounds with dream of landing good jobs.",

            "content": "One of THE very best films I have seen from anywhere in the world in my whole life!Yes, \"Super 30\" is THAT extraordinary.Best of all: it's real.\"Super 30\" presents how one Common Man - Anand Kumar, himself a mathematics genius from an impoverished low caste family who won graduate admission to Cambridge University yet saw his own dream crumble when not able to raise money for the airfare to UK - dedicated his life to helping other gifted but underprivileged children attain their dreams. 'Anand-ji' each year since 2002 selects 30 such disadvantaged students - the Super 30 - to whom he provides intensive *free* coaching for the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) which are perceived as the 'golden ticket' to top-level high-status high-paying jobs in India and globally around the world. \"Super 30\" the movie shows how the real world Super 30 came to be, and how it triumphed (and continues to triumph) against entrenched elites who have fought hard to ... in effect ... keep the downtrodden 'in their place.'As the film makes clear, \"Changing the world, 30 students at a time\" for such brilliant but impoverished children changes not just those 30 individuals but everyone in their whole extended families, and by extension thousands of similarly disadvantaged people in their home communities, whose life options now have opportunities and scope.\"Super 30\", indeed, is a message of Hope for not just India but our whole planet.Anand Kumar himself briefly appears (in his real classroom) at the end of the movie, side by side with the Indian superstar actor - Hrithik Roshan - who deftly portrayed him here.And WHAT a performance!I have always respected Hrithik as that rarest of creatures: a film star who is also, truly, a great actor. He has no limitations. His proven range and scope are phenomenal. But for \"Super 30\" he bravely sheds every last scrap of the usual 'filmy' glamour to embody a real person still living, who might have been thought the physical antithesis of himself, so powerfully that the audience is swept into complete belief and engagement. Hrithik as Anand invests us, the audience, not just in his character but in the broader stakes and the outcome. He makes us feel that it is OUR outcome, too - our very own choices and daily decisions which contribute (or not) to a better future and a better world.Entire star cast gave outstanding performances. But truthfully, it is the 30 students themselves - non-actors all, selected from 15,000 applicants across Bihar and Uttar Pradesh - who with Anand Kumar win our hearts and minds. Their victory, becomes our victory.Phenomenal work by all departments. A special 'shout out' for the terrific screenplay (by Sanjeev Dutta) which maintains excellent pace yet explores such complex issues with power, depth, and compassion.It is a curious fact that, despite India's more than 100 years of cinema and vastly prolific film industries spanning the whole range of its ancient languages and regional cultures, to-date India has never yet won the Oscar for best foreign language film. \"Super 30\" could be the very thing to break that barrier, offering all that 'Oscar' seems to love in that category: crisp writing; sharp direction and brilliant acting; heartfelt, compelling (and true) story fully honest and 'authentic' to its home culture while presenting universal themes and issues that resonate across ALL cultures.HIGHEST recommendation. See it. See it again! Let \"Super 30\" bring inspiration and hope to your life, too!",

Super 30 takes a calculated risk of protagonist's Tryst with Destiny. Played by Mr. Hrithik Roshan, 'Anand' is unsure of his path marred by heavy obstacles and ill fated turns in his life. Super 30 takes you through an out of turn events in the first half and tests your adrenaline level during the second half.\nAnand is a brilliant talented, 'one amongst youths' but unable to fly high despite dreaming big. Despite initial hurdles Anand is able to scape through majestic academic laurels as a proud mathematician topper of the town. After a series of disappointments in his life, the dream to surge further through his professional aspirations cost him nearly his destiny.\nBut upon a 'chance' meeting with the possible mentor, his destiny now hands him the mantle to become a teacher at a local coaching institute. Anand is now back to full life-force helping his mentees to dream big and ride away with 'excellence' the coaching center offers through his mathematical stature.\nThe final twist in the destiny yet again takes an interesting turn when he ventures to teach kids who otherwise cannot afford to study. A wave is created to attract young talent at the cost of free education plus limited food. Many aspirants land up at Anand's place with the hope of dreaming big. The movie then surrounds the protagonists struggle to stay afloat in competition & survive the ordeals, plus the challenge of helping his Super 30 team to scape through the entrance tests! The movie is well managed through good screenplay and script aided by local dialect. Super 30 is yet another 'inspiring story' based on the real protagonist's life and his struggle to emerge with flying colors in the society.",

Hrithik Roshan by casting off his Casanova image, gets well into the skin of Anand kumar's character. with his perfect Bihari accent and brown skin, Hrithik succeeds in wining audiences heart.The movie clearly shows how in India education is business and parents are ready to pay hefty to secure that their wards get into best institute.

            "review_title": "A melodramatic depiction of a famed educator's life",
            "content": "Like with almost every big-budget commercial release, I was apprehensive going into Super 30. Especially considering the slightly underwhelming trailer which had inadvertently revealed all the major plot points. The bronze tanned skin, the Bihari accent, the gimmicky visual effects and the romantic subplot seemed disingenuous to me from the get-go.\nIf you didn't like the trailer, you almost certainly won't like the film. Conversely, if you like your films filled with drama and masala, Super 30 is made for you. Interestingly, I did gradually warm up to the film's idea and main motive - appealing to high school kids, their parents and state governments to make the film tax-free. It is what it is: a simple, inoffensive portrayal of Anand Kumar which also acts as a pseudo-statement on India's coaching mafia.\nEverything's been designed to appeal to the commoner's sentimentality which makes it difficult to criticise the film. With its heightened emotions and thumping background score, you're bound to shed a few tears throughout the film's runtime. Characters have been painted with broad strokes....black and white seems to be the scriptwriters's prefered colour palette because the Anand Kumar and the downtrodden kids are good while the rich kids and everyone else is bad, right!? Anand Kumar hasn't done any amoral thing in his life, RIGHT? Leaving his lover without any proper reasoning is completely justified in this movie. Moreover, the film just brushes over the (in)famous educator's unethical actions and assets.\nEveryone seems to have forgotten that there was a massive uproar against Mr. Kumar's not-so-open money avenues, which led to this film getting delayed. But who cares, right? The man has to earn. There's no harm in it but then he shouldn't be portrayed as a saint, no?\nReal-life issues aside, the acting is generally pretty solid but stumbles in some vital areas. Hrithik Roshan for one, in my opinion, tries to compensate for his lack of physical resemblance to the real Anand Kumar by doubling down on his acting. He tries so damn hard! You can see him tapping into his Koi Mil Gaya phase with that really fake and tedious sounding Bihari accent and that tan.....oof! Baaki, there's Pankaj Tripathi in this film so automatic +1 and Abhijeet from CID (Amen to that) also does a decent job covering a thinly written antagonist. The child actors were all pretty perfunctory in their roles....delivering dialogues in an anthemic-kind of manner. Interactions at times feel really forced and superficial but then, there were moments of genuine warmth and emotion.\nAnd that's the thing: the banner of 'motivational film' has carried it to unprecedented heights with anyone criticising it on technical levels being tagged as anti-children, anti-education and the like. This has in part led to a so-called awakening (read: wokening) of the audience as purveyors of conscience and logic. But that's a conversation for some other time.\nRegardless, now that I've spoken my mind about the film's weaknesses, I would like to point out some positives which have weighed somewhat disproportionately on my final score.\nFirst off, while it does follow a traditional narrative, it is engaging throughout. There was not one moment when I was bored. Director Vikas Bahl manages to portray the journey of a damn teacher with such effectiveness that the effort is admirable, if a bit cringe-worthy. The special effects team has clearly worked overtime because the various tiny animations (the engine, train etc) do help break the monotony of ordinary teaching methods. While they come off as gimmicky and may not hold true to Anand Kumar's actual way of teaching, they are certainly cinematic liberties.\nI dont particularly like using the word 'wholesome' to describe a fim but for Super 30, only that adjective does justice. No matter how reckless the ending is, it's an effective culmination to a film which is a mass-entertainer first and an inspirational film second. It's a complete package not just for students, but for entire families. Most will enter the hall, watch the film and leave with a few tears on their cheek and a broad smile on the face.\nI really believe that societal impact is something to be considered and just on that basis, Super 30 gets extra brownie points. And no matter how surface-level its depiction of the coaching mafia was, it would certainly make thousands of parents aware about the malpractices &. Obviously, education and awareness is never a bad thing.",

Imitating that person's Body Language, Linguistic Expressions, Verbal Annotations is something that's easier said than done. Many of them failed to being realistic and justifying to the real life person! But I'm happy to say that's not the case with Hrithik Here!He has done tremendously well with his character. With his emotions, expressions and language ; Everything felt relatable and believable.Camera Work, Direction, Sound Score, Screenplay all the things have justified the premise of the film. But In some aspects some things have fallen apart even for a little bit of time.The main problem lies with the Character Development of the other characters except the main Lead Anand Kumar. His family, His rival or His group of students. Everyone's part in the story felt underwhelming or should I say restricted for the sake of Hrithik's Character being the center of attention.All the focus have been diverted to the Main Lead and his life struggles, Achivements, Vulnerabilities etc. But we never got the same treatment or could connect well to the other cast members at all! Though they gave their pretty best respectively.Just for example the group of 30 students who should have been the sole focus of the film have been left out in characterization department. None of the students among them shined or would be remembered for their own backstories and weaknesses. The makers summed up the whole group as one and wrote the Screenplay accordingly.Kind of Unfortunate If yoh take my opinion as it had so much promising aspects in it.Another issue here is its longer duration, I don't usually have complaints about the runtimes but If they are not being utilized properly then the unnecessary scenes must be cut short so that the story itself feels more compact and tighter on the scale.In the end, As a Biopic it's a really good one, For the Hrithik Fans it would be a Treat for sure. And For the Casual Movie Goers ; Might not be the best but would not bore you either I assure.",

            "content": "Inspired by Mathematics whiz Anand Kumar, who has seen an astounding success rate for IIT admissions year after year with his batch of 'Super 30' kids, the film charts his motivating journey as a fictional account. A life dotted with controversies and hardships, Anand Kumar (Hrithik Roshan) literally rises from the rubble to mould his dreams. The story doesn't touch upon the certain controversies surrounding Anand Kumar which have been reported in the media, focusing on his struggles and glory instead.Son of a postman, a young Anand clinches an admission at the Cambridge University owing to his brilliance in mathematics. But when he has to let go of this opportunity of a lifetime solely because he is unable to afford the fees, life hits him hard and breaks his spirit. But that doesn't last for too long, since he gets picked by Lallanji (Aditya Srivastava) to become a Mathematics teacher for affluent students at an IIT coaching centre, run by him. But soon, his true calling and passion catches up with him and he realizes that he must use his skills to give lesser privileged, bright students a fair chance at life. Of course, along the way, he faces opposition and obstacles one after another, but never loses sight of what he sets out to do.'Super 30' drives home the message that education is truly the privilege of those who have the access and economic resources. Unfortunately, for many it remains a distant dream, but if given the same opportunities they have it in them to shine equally bright. There are many moments in the movie that will move you - after starting his Super 30 classes, Anand has to literally scrape through - with often the students barely having anything to eat. But their real hunger is for better education and a better life.'Super 30' has several heartfelt, inspiring moments that touch a chord. When Anand says at one point, \"Aapatti se aavishkar ka janm hota hain\", you do believe him, especially after having seen how driven his batch of students are, leaving behind their impoverished lives and literally daring to dream big.Hrithik Roshan pulls off a solid performance essaying Anand Kumar, capturing his character's sincerity and determination very well. While his physicality many not be entirely convincing, his performance more than makes up for it. Nandish Singh is earnest and well-cast as Anand's brother. Mrunal Thakur is effective in her limited screen time. Pankaj Tripathi as the unscrupulous politician is brilliant and Aditya Srivastava matches the villainy of his character to the hilt. Overall, the performances elevate the film.While the narrative does have its flaws, 'Super 30' is a human drama and the story of a teacher who triumphs over the many challenges that life throws at him, to set an example for the world to see. Just for that it's worth a watch.",

On the other hand, a film is a commercial venture and they need to make a profit so perhaps that justifies the masala style from a business point of view. Ironically this film is also about how education is BIG business, controlled by a powerful lobby.Whoever did Hrithik's make up ? It was so mediocre, the patchy brown face paint was so obvious. Hrithik also had some very weird expressions at various times during the film, though he acted ok for the most part, as did all the other characters especially the underprivileged students. Pankaj Tripathi was of course the perfect politician. He rarely disappoints in his movies.Well whatever, the story of Anand Kumar and his incredulous achievements surely deserves to be told whether through a documentary, a realistic biopic or this typical Bollywood film.Super 30 is interesting and watchable but its not brilliant.",

If you're not, don't bother.The action scenes would fit very well in an A-Team battle. Kids using their homework to fight off armed baddies. The 3d animations aren't great: the ones in the classroom are terrible, and some other scenes (such as the train scene) suffer because of it as well.The acting is mediocre. A lot of overacting, very little character development, cheesy dialog. Maybe some jokes were more funny for Indians? The main character makes 1 decision in the entire movie (to quit teaching the rich). The plot is about as predictable as it can get, although seeing 30/30 students from the slum without any selection process make it into a top-notch university makes everything rather unbelievable.On top of that, add some of the cringy Indian musical-style songs in the middle of the movie (Question Mark, anyone?). And I don't get the purpose of the intro and outro, that was totally unnecessary. I think a 5/10 is in place here.",

Some of them are --- the war between goons and students,Students performing an act in english, they making scientific projects so quickly, all of them entering IIT with no strong reference regarding criteria. But the performances are fine. HR is not perfect as the typical north Indian guy. Others are good.There are both impressive plots and plot holes in it. But still, a movie with inspiring and motivating theme, i.e education reforms in India. Really India now needs the implication of Mr. Kumar's vision. Right one deserves ! A full 71/100.",

The trailer made that acceptance looked really dicey, but 10 minutes in the movie and you start focusing on the subtle storytelling rather than how the protagonist is delivering his local Bihari dialect. Never been a fan of Hrithik Roshan, but indeed this is one of the better movies of his. Casting in the movie is almost perfect. Whether it's for cameo roles, or important roles. By the way, it's a pleasure to watch Abhijeet (yes CID wale Abhijeet sir) in a different role.The movie itself is inspiring and a little entertainment has also been added for the general mass looking for a mild Bollywood style action and song sequence. Albeit that was the reason for me to not love the second half of the movie. But when you come out of the cinema hall with a little smile on your face, you know it was good if not the best. And that's what this movie is, a good motivational flick. You can watch it, you might not love it, but you won't hate it either.",

Got me into the movie easily.Then the movie started unfolding it's theme. Education for everyone, not just the privileged.Pankaj Tripathi struck gold in his small character role as a minister. Hrithik did a very good job as well even though it is a familiar Hrithik role.Educational inspiration was delivered reasonably well as well. There were a few overboard scenes as well, but much less painful than the delivery scene from three idiots.The challenges that Anand faced while trying to do his good work has also been represented well in the movie.Inspiring.

Amazing skills.It was like you, yourself are going through each & every bit of emotion that he is feeling, it just felt so real !\nHe's definetly going to be a strong contender in all the award ceremonies this year and certainly for the National Award !After a long time,I would be carrying a huge part of a movie with me for, may be, the rest of my life.\nThank you Vikas Bahl, Thank You Hrithik and Thank you to the whole team of Super 30 !If you haven't seen this masterpiece, just run to the theater & experience this beautiful, beautiful movie, the goosebumps, the emotions, the inspiring vibes it possesses, all just make for a \"MUST WATCH\" piece of brilliance !",

            "content": "Within the society there has always been an invisible line which has clearly segregated the haves from the have nots. The haves relish riches, privileges and respect while the have nots are doomed forever. The society's laws, traditions and ways have always worked to maintain this order. But time and again there have been mortals who have caused a stir, raked up a storm and unsettled the rusty framework.Vikas Bahl's latest directorial venture \"Super 30\" deals with one such rebel who fought successfully against the society's norms. The film is a biopic of Anand Kumar, the brilliant mathematician and educator from Patna, Bihar whose \"Super 30 Programme\" enabled underprivileged students to crack the IIT-JEE examinations. The film exquisitely portrays Anand's journey wherein at the very onset we get a glimpse into the inequalities which exists in the societal structure even in respect of something as noble as imparting education. Young Anand secures an admission to Cambridge but is forced to abort his dreams due to lack of money. He carries out menial jobs just to make ends meet till a chance encounter lands him in the World of \"Tuition Business\". He earns money and fame under an elite banner by mentoring students from rich backgrounds who pay hefty fees to secure ranks in IIT-JEE.Then one night realization dawns on him and the genius mathematician resolves to train Ekalavyas instead of Arjunas. There begins the relentless struggle to groom, sustain and realise the dream with his band of 30 children and that's what the movie is all about.The film retains attention throughout courtesy some smart direction and acting performances. After Queen, Vikas again proves his mettle as a deft storyteller. Editing is also top-notch. Music didn't have much to the contribute to the plot and none of the soundtracks would be remembered for long. Regarding the acting part, Aditya Srivastava (Avijit of CID fame) is really impressive as the antagonist and so is Pankaj Tripathi as a corrupt education minister.Did I miss someone? Ahhh. There's this man - Bollywood's very own Greek God who has to sport a make up to look ordinary. He was going through a bad patch which seemed interminable but this time he has really made that giant chalang (leap) to regain his stardom. Undoubtedly Roshan Junior's stellar performance is the film's strongest asset. The character demanded a lot of make and break stuff which Hrithik delivered without going overboard. However I didn't quite like the scene where Supriya (Mrunal) walks away and Anand appears abnormally unaffected. It was quite pointless to exercise such stoicism. Moreover in the end, the group didn't have to turn into INA to combat the goons. That's where the film falls a prey to the very evil it was propagating against - Commercialization. This also explains why Hrithik Roshan got to play the titular character and not Pankaj Tripathi despite the latter's physical resemblance with Anand. Who wants to lose the prospect of gaining an entry into 100-200-300 Crore clubs?Overall a pretty satisfying achievement.",

The film feels REALLY stretched in the second half with a very over the top climax which is laughable more than impactful. The film limps to a very predictable ending but much to my dismay, the level of drama is intact even upto then.\nHrithik Roshan does a really commendable acting job, so do Mrunal Thakur, Aditya Srivastava and of course Pankaj Tripathi which are the major reasons I gave it 4 stars.\nThe movie could have been a lot better had there not been this much drama but then again it's Bollywood, so what does one expect.....",

Kudos to Hrithik for being a teacher and nothing else.This was Hrithik's attempt at doing something he was not comfortable with, and he did it admirably. I was getting Pursuit Of Happiness vibes throughout. Never did he break into super-graceful dance moves or a pandering display of his physique. He was faithful to his role. This was probably a project that he did to convince himself about his acting skills more than anything else.Good Job Hrithik Roshan, despite the not-so-perfect makeup you get a 30/30 for your effort.",

Not much of character development either, especially when you think of the struggling students. Hrithik Roshan (I am a fan) was not suitable for the role and didn't do much justice too it either. But I did like the actors playing his brother, mother, and girl-friend. They were good.I wished if the writer / director had stuck to the main topic, focused more on the students, developed their characters, and cut down the masala and a few preaching dialogues making it a bit more watchable. At least a 4th of the movie has no connection with the reality and is poorly written / directed.Regardless, I must say that the movie is worth watching once.

The movie may have few issues which are just nitpicking, but still I'd rate 9/10. 1 minus for the monotonous, good bgm however I wish there were more variations. Good attempt anyway but Indian music producers need to work more hard on creating epic bgm than songs. The movie overall is a masterpiece. Brilliant storytelling, top class acting even though accents may not be accurate but you won't notice much due to sheer great performance.\nScreenplay is fine. Great job by the director. Most importantly this movie shows the shameful mindset of the society, mostly among the rich and the mockery done by the Indian education system. Education is for all and this is what legend Anand Sir believes in. But since the poor are not getting it unlike the rich he in the end chose to fight for the poor because they were helpless. Everyone should watch this movie, rich or poor, parent or teacher. This nation needs legendary modern reformers like Sir Anand. Super 30 is even better than Dangal, Taare Zameen Par, Sanju, PK, etc. in my opinion. Apart from the drama, this movie has many realistic facts and shows the problems of our education system that still need to be fixed today.",

May be people dont want to see Hrithik in simple role. Whatever Anand Kumar portrait by Hrithik was good enough. The direction and storyline is good, scripted to make it look Rancho reloaded from 3 idiots. Other all acted well. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbSong Basanti, how it changes all.

However, in doing so, it inadvertently shows that we can not escape it, not easily and hence has an irony. A man (Hritik Roshan) goes after this concept after realising that many dreams go untouched because of money woes, but eventually one must realise that the tagline that he keeps on rambling about \"A king's son may not become a king, only the worthy shall get the throne\", that's capitalism in one sentence (however, as most people understand capitalism is responsible for creating a large gap between the rich and the poor because the king's son eventually takes the throne because the pauper is underpowered) . Second thing, the story messed it up in the second half by showing the kids like they were the avengers or something, this part could have been much better and eventually leads to the bad rating.",

There is a city called KOTA, which thrives only on coaching classes for IIT-JEE. Families at times shift their to be with their child who intends to appear for IIT. Their lesser brilliant siblings too shift to be with families, it is so important for everyone in the family.#HrithikRoshan is undoubtedly one of the most gifted actors in Indian cinema and this movie is a proof of the same. After Koi Mil Gaya, he gets to show his acting chops, the other movies in between were masala entertainers banking on his greek god looks.Vikas Bahl, despite the #metoo controversy, redeems his graph post Shandaar.#BasantiNoDance seems trivial on TV but on it grows on you on screen, bringing forward the wide chasm between castes, classes and the rich and the poor.A must family watch!",

            "content": "\"There is no bigger God than a Teacher, And There is no bigger Religion than Education\"- Partha\nSuper-30 is movie based on true story of a Teacher named Mr. Anand Kumar, hailing from Bihar, who taught 30 students for IIT entrance examination under many difficult circumstances. In a caste inflicted society like India, Upper castes reaps the benefit of society in many situations. In this system, everything comes with a price-tag even a basic necessity like Education. This film revolves around eternal struggle of poor to climb up the ladder for a better life and rich people's intervention to shift the direction of the ladder.The film may have added some drama and exaggeration on how a teacher teaches or student learn but nonetheless it is a good cinematic attempt in the end. There are few Bollywood producers who would gamble with such a story in this highly commercial industry. So, I would say kudos to the director & producers. Plus, Hrithik deserves a special mention for coming out of his usual glamour filled films full of his naked body shots and swift dance movements. This is a totally an unusual film for a person like Hrithik Roshan.Some person hailing from Bihar, may have some complaints regarding the accent or brown-facing of the character (by this I mean little dark make-up of Hrithik to suit the character). But as an audience from other territories, I would say it's a brilliant attempt to credit an Indian for all his contribution to this society. Also, salute to the strength of Mr. Anand Kumar. As a movie-lover too it has all necessary drama, plot changes to make it worth watching. It may be a bit lengthy for some audience though.Overall the film tries to show, that only Education can truly uplift a person and society. Also, inorder to gain this proper education one need a good teacher indeed. Thus...\"There is no bigger God than a Teacher, And There is no bigger Religion than Education\".",

I was unsure if Roshan with his famed Greek-God looks would be able to blend into an aam-aadmi role convincingly but to his credit, he does. Roshan delivers on the promise with sincerity and turns in an admirable performance -earthy and real. As for the accent, being a bona fide Bihari myself, I am likely to nitpick, but it would be fair to say that for the most part, it lands on the right spot. It helps that the ensemble cast around Roshan is pitch-perfect in its grasp of dialects and nuances. The old dependable Pankaj Tripathi as the grubby politician despite his brief appearance is once again a delight to watch on screen. Mrunal Thakur as his love interest, Aditya Srivastav as Lallan Singh, Virendra Saxena as Kumar's father Ishwar and Nandish Sandhu as his brother Pranav Kumar make for a good supporting cast.",

He is eldest of two son's of the postman of the area. He is in love with the most richest man's daughter in his area, Ritu(Mrunal Thakur).The movie starts with one of Anand's students Mr. Fugga Kumar(Vijay Varma) receiving an award at an International event for his contribution in aeronautics. In his thank yo speech, he thanks the people who made the same possible, and started narrating the story of the most important person in his life.On winning the 1st prize for a debate competition in the area, Minister Devraj praises Anand for his intellectual and promises any and all assistance for any requirements in the future. But, the time comes soon, when Anand gets an admission into the esteemed Cambridge University in London and they reach out to Devraj for financial assistance, but is turned down for the same. In the process of trying to acquire the funding for his education, his father (Virendra Saxena) passed away.With no food in the house, the family has resorted to selling pappad to make ends meet. It is then when Lallan Singh(Aditya Shrivastava) offers Anand a job to teach Mathematics at his IIT coaching institute in Patna callled the Excellance Coaching. This changed lives for Anand and his family. The coaching center started minting money and rising Anand as the authorized signatory of the institute. But then one night, he got a reality check from a cycle rickshaw wala about the unsaid patriarchy which intertwines the life styles and the education system. \"Raja ka beta raja aur tangewala ka beta tangewala hi banta hai. Yahi duniya ka niyam hai.\"He remembers his father who used to stay \"Ab raja ka beta raja nahi banega, raja wohi banega , jo hakdaar hoga\". Anad quits his job at Excellance Coaching and with his savings he starts a coaching center with hostel servcies completely free for poor kids who cannot afford the education they deserve due to their pathetic living conditions.Being a biopic on Anand Kumar, the mathematician who won the Rashtriya Bal Kalyan Award, the rest of the movie shows his struggle to keep the institute up and running and the challenges he faces financially, physically and politically for the same.\nCast & Crew.Hrithik Roshan - Know as the Greek god of India, Hrithik Roshan is like the portrait of perfection in a man. Now, imagine a 360 degree change to that image. That is Anand Kuamr for you. And Hrithik has fulfilled this character with perfection beyond belief. This will be probably the first time you see HR and not drool on his good looks but realise his acting potential which was not tapped for all these years. The little bit dance steps which he shows in the movie will also make you think if this was the electrifying dancer that you knew for all these years. In this movie, HR will make you fall in love with him for his acting and acting only.Mrunal Thakur - A Decent debut for the TV actress. Her screen time was very less as this was a movie on Anand Kumar. But the small part she played was done with perfection. She potrayed a cute, lovable, rich girl next door.Aditya Srivastava - Villian. A good performance.DirectionVikas Bahl - A much awaited come back as a director after Shandaar for Vikas Bahl. The movie is a good over look into the education business in our country and how a person is trying to change the same. The movie makes you feel the emotion and think about the education crisis in our country. This is where the director turns a winner with his story telling.Music\nAjay-Atul duo is know for their music magic and the songs in the movie are already trending. In the movie, it is incorporated with ease hence it plays as though a character if the movie.",

There was the motive, I wanted to see the work done by Hritik for a great guy like Anand and also wanted to educate my kid about the importance of education.I can give 10 out of 10 for the subject, 8 out of 10 for acting, 6 out of 10 for Drama, 4 out of 10 for compilation. In total, I can give 7 out of 10 for Super 30.Subject: We really need a good real-time heros to educate the younger generations. I can see that Bollywood is changing and nowadays we are getting more and more such work. I can give full credit for the subject.Acting: Acting from Hritik is outstanding and acting from all the characters is balanced except they were too much trying to Bihari Accent, I think that would be okay not to use that much accent.Drama: Subject and Storyline was very good but there were few unnecessary Drama. Like, No need to address the International Audience for telling the story of Anand Kumar through the medium of Fugga Kumar. \"No, no, no\" song was unnecessary and could be used a different way to remove gaps between poor and rich kids. Fight with the villain was dramatic, could be achieved with fewer mafias with the same ideas, remember those kids were preparing for IIT, not the superheroes.Compilation: Overal movie was sticking you on your seat through of the drama but the compilation was not good. Looks like \"Raja ka beta raja nahi banega\" became a tag line and used on multiple occasions. They could actually use actual story and actual events performed by Anand Kumar.Overall I enjoyed the show and definitely consider \"To See\" movie and my rating of 7 out from 10 doesn't mean it is okay. I just shared my thoughts here.",

This movie is so inspiring, motivational and I have completely left with it's hangover.\nBeing such a handsome hunk and having superstar aura was a challenge in itself already but he came out if his comfort zone by breaking his greek god image and moulding himself into local village character. Hrithik has completely imbibed into anand's character & soul portraying and nailing his every detail into just perfection. He sits, walks and speaks like anand and that bihari accent is just wow he pulled it convincingly. He has invested 2.5 years for this movie and we can clearly see his efforts onscreen thanks to his magnificent and sincere performance. Be it mannerisms, dialect, body language he justified and lived the character. Coming towards the movie it shows us anand's heart touching journey with a message that showcases the true education system of India and malpractices done by education mafia. The movie is so inspiring that certain scenes will make you cry and laugh with joy. Direction is outstanding with engaging screenplay, songs are completely situational like 'Basanti no dance & question mark(my fav)'. Casting director has done a good job by casting those kids they acted so naturally. Everyone has done good job including hrithik in this movie! Pankaj tripathi was brilliant! Climax scene was tearful.\nOverall it's a MASTERPIECE with excellent Acting, Direction, Screenplay, Background Music, Emotions, Story, and casting. This type of movies comes once in a decade! For sure this is going to become cult classic and will be added in the list of iconic and inspirational movies like 3 idiots, Chak de india and Dangal! Undoubtedly movie of the year. It's not the movie but an experience that will stay with all of us for lifetime. Highly recommended and must watch for everyone\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50/5",

It's hard to move ahead in life without any mental support.\n\"Super 30\" is that kinda story.\nWhere the students who never even dreamt about IIT got a teacher like sir Ananda Kumar. When one enters within the gate of his dream,there's no doubt that's his hard work and effort that help him to reach his destination. But in this whole journey, there always has the presence of another person who makes the things more easier than before.Ananda Kumar was one of them.\n.\nGreat work done by Hrithik. Really needed to put those struggles faced by \"Anand Kumar & His Students\" on screen.\nThis movie should watch by everyone ( specially teacher & students).

            "content": "Vikas Bahl's Super 30 stars Hrithik Roshan and Mrunal Thakur in the lead roles. Though the film has great performances, the lengthy run-time and overdose of drama drag it down.Movie Name:\nSuper 30\nCast:\nHrithik Roshan, Mrunal Thakur, Pankaj Tripathi\nDirector:\nVikas Bahl\nThe long-gestating Super 30 tells the inspiring story of math genius Anand Kumar, who is attempting to change the lives of meritorious but destitute students, 30 at a time. Despite the rousing tale and fine performances, the film is bogged down by the lengthy run-time and needless doses of drama.Super 30 introduces Anand Kumar (Hrithik Roshan) with a flashback. Though his brilliance gets him a seat in the prestigious University of Cambridge, he is unable to attend because of lack of money. As he goes from door to door looking for sponsorship, his father passes away and he is forced to sell papads made by his mother.In a particularly heartbreaking scene, his acceptance letter is used as a wrapper for his wares and carelessly discarded into the chulha.Anand's fortunes turn around when he is discovered by Lallan Singh (Aditya Srivastava), who runs a coaching centre for IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) aspirants and wants him on board as a teacher.However, when Anand realises that there are many Anand Kumars out there who are forced to give up on their dreams because of impoverished circumstances, he decides to give up the good life and open a free coaching centre for such deserving but poor students.Though Hrithik Roshan tries hard to look convincing as Anand Kumar, the brown make-up (the shades of which fluctuate through the film) just does not cut it. Strangely enough, though so much work has gone into giving the actor a darker complexion, nothing is done about his naturally hazel green eyes. Contact lenses, anyone?Hrithik's Bihari accent leaves much to be desired. However, if you can look past these, he delivers an earnest performance.Pankaj Tripathi as the education minister who runs a flourishing coaching business is fantastic. Mrunal Thakur has little to do, but holds her own in scenes with Hrithik. Aditya Srivastava, too, delivers a solid performance.At 2 hours and 42 minutes, Super 30 is a tad too long. Hrithik's love story with Mrunal, which has no significance to the film and seems to have been shoehorned just for the sake of it, could have been easily done away with.Certain parts of Super 30 seem very far-fetched. One student, who falls short of Anand's Super 30 by a mark, is brought in at the last minute to not just miraculously give a musical performance in a few hours but also crack the IIT-JEE despite missing out on months of training.Director Vikas Bahl unnecessarily amps up the drama, and there is even a sequence where the Super 30 students fend off a gang of professional assassins trying to attack Anand at a hospital.It is a challenge to make films on people whose lives have unfolded before us, in our lifetime. The PM Narendra Modi biopic is proof that taking creative licenses to build a compelling narrative can compromise the believability.While the reel Anand Kumar has no plan for what will happen to his educational programme when he exhausts his savings, the real Anand Kumar runs a parallel coaching centre, the fees of which fund the classes for the poor.Under the guidance of math wizard Anand Kumar, his Super 30 turned out to be miracles. Under the guidance of Vikas Bahl, Hrithik Roshan's Super 30 is far from one.",

The story doesn't touch upon the certain controversies surrounding Anand Kumar which have been reported in the media, focusing on his struggles and glory instead.'Super 30' drives home the message that education is truly the privilege of those who have the access and economic resources. Unfortunately, for many it remains a distant dream, but if given the same opportunities they have it in them to shine equally bright. There are many moments in the movie that will move you - after starting his Super 30 classes, Anand has to literally scrape through - with often the students barely having anything to eat.

            "content": "Have you ever looked back at your life, at all the different crossroads, and realize, thank God that this happened the way it did, my life would have been an utter mess otherwise? I always feel that when I think of meeting some of my teachers. They took care of me in so many ways, not the least of them being the fact that they always taught me for free, that it is impossible for me to imagine a life without them. Or maybe, I do not want to imagine a life where I could not get the education that I wanted. Super 30 is about kids who had it a hundred times worse then I had. Super30 is about their travails, their struggles and ultimately, of their triumph.Super 30 is also about Anand Kumar who epitomizes both the student and the teacher in this story. In his younger days, he was this math-loving genius who got published in an international journal of mathematics that resulted in him getting an admission offer to the legendary halls of Cambridge. But like so many others who are born into poverty, his dream shattered into infinite pieces and his life spins out of control. In the first act of the movie, Anand symbolizes the poor student, the one who could not fulfill his dream, due to no fault of his own but because the corrupt society, the crooked system failed him.The second act focuses on what could have been Anand's life if he could silence his conscience and align himself with the horribly broken, poisonous education system that India nurtures. The evil nexus of politics, business and education, the factory of IIT aspirants, the cast-away with not enough money to hop on the bandwagon- Anand sees it all, takes part in it all, and he throws it all away. He throws it all to build a boat. A boat built only of talent, perseverance, and hunger-for food, for success, to break away from the sewer drain of someone's father's, or from the slave labor of someone else's.Super 30 urges you to fight on, no matter the circumstances. It holds a mirror in front of you and mercilessly exposes all the privileges that you enjoy without realizing that those are, in fact, privileges. It inspires you, as an adult citizen of a country with the world's largest young population, to create a better world for our children. A world, where they get a fair chance to fight it out, where they at least get a level playing field, where their life is not over because they were born in a home that can barely make ends meet. A world where they dare to dream. A world where a poor student is not penalized like Eklavya of Indian mythology. A world where anyone can dream to be successful, no matter the cast, creed, or religion.Apart from some great performances by the supporting cast (Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Srivastava, Mrunal Thakur), Super 30 is boosted by some amazing cinematography by Anay Goswami. Director Vikas Bahl brings out the best from actors and also from the story, written by Sanjiv Dutta. But like so many of his movies, Super 30 stands on the shoulders of Hrithik Roshan. He portrays the joy, naivete, heartbreak, despair-each of Anand's emotions with so much ease that the audience get immersed in the story of Anand. Hrithik and Virendra Saxena create some of the most poignant moments of father-son relationship in recent memory. The kids who play the students performed their duty well, however, none really had any scope to stand out. In the music front, Niyam Ho and the Vidya Shloka are very powerful, with poignant lyrics.\nI am not a reviewer, so all I can say about Super 30 the movie is that watching this was a harrowing experience. So much of it resonated with myself, that it was almost painful. It gives you that strange feeling where you want to cry but also feel a sublime joy within. It hurts you but also gives you hope and the spirit to dream. As Rousseau said in his Social Contract, Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains. Maybe it is time we break the chains.",

            "review_title": "It's good!",
            "content": "So in this movie we have Hrithik as Anand Kumar who was offered an admission by the Cambridge University, but he fails to get required funds.The movie actually shows the real situation of coaching classes in Patna and till this part it was really nice. The craze for IITs, the business of coaching classes, manipulation of politicians around these and even the rivalries of coaching institutions are properly justified.This story is probably much real to the popular story of Anand Kumar. He actually has a friend who runs another coaching class, but in this movie, the friend was shown as his rival, under whom Anand (Hrithik) actually worked as a JEE teacher, but soon left to teach the poor. Because he was doing this for free, friendship turned into rivalry.May be the facts are changed accordingly to make an effective plot and if we do not consider the controversies related to (the real) Anand Kumar or any reality, it makes a good movie and is a one time watch.Other things I would like to highlight is that no movie or series is able to show how exactly tough is IIT-JEE! Not even Kota Factory! This movie had a huge blunder- chemistry. Anand Kumar was good in maths, okay, somehow teaches physics, umm... fine, but where the hell is Chemistry? The movie was well showing the life of people around, but the IIT part was not well defined. JEE syllabus always had chemistry, but no reference was given to it. Not even in the opening credits!Finally I would like to point another blunder. The children fighting the goons with science! Yes, that was absurd. Studying science, and preparing for JEE is a very different thing. For a layman, I will explain it in one point. While studying science, you study and understand concepts, preparing for JEE, you have to practise and solve questions. Both are different. I bet that even the JEE rank 1 cannot do those things. You have prepared for JEE, you guys are not engineers.\nSo that part was not expected by me, neither it was required, only a few was okay.Thank you",

            "content": "Okay, so I had a special obvious interest in watching this movie as I hail from the beautiful state of Bihar. I was eager to see how the director has portrayed the ground realities of the struggle of the unprivileged yet talented students in Bihar, and also, being a die hard Hrithik fan, I was desperately keen to see how much he has been able to live up to the portrayal of his role in the movie.\nDirection : Definitely kept me on the edge of the seat throughout 2 hours and 45 minutes (minus the popcorn break!) Not for a scene did I feel it was unwarranted or an attempt to exaggerate the truth. But there was a scene where the students had to compete amongst themselves, the preparation of that minor exam could have been portrayed for a few minutes. That would have been another icing on this cake! Kudos for the narration and the direction!Make up : The tanning done on Hrithik's face seemed very much near to natural, if not completely one. Every actor was presented in the apt make up required for their roles. Great job by make up artists.Acting :\nVijay Verma imho is going be a huge star in future. He is such a natural! Refined and polished! He is so blendable in any role given to him. He added those extra flavours to the plate! Looking forward to more action from him in future. And the director should have noticed when you said \"z\" instead of \"j\", and again when you corrected it :))\nP. S. : I liked him a lot in this completely short yet positive role. Dear Mr. Vijay, Please be a part of more positive / witty roles in future!Virendra Saxena: I still feel he's yet to receive his share of success, for the kind of natural actor that he is. Great acting by him! I feel he is brilliant actor with whom others are easily able to reciprocate in terms of acting.Mrunal Thakur: Simple, beautiful, can embrace some more elegance if she tries to. Still some scope for improvement, but way to go girl!Amit Sadh: What a chocolaty face with perfect timing, perfect expressions! Delivers what he's intended to!Manav Gohil: What a delightful surprise it was to see him on big screen after a long time! But I'd like to mention a small correction here. When you're trying to portray a \"to the core\" Bihari character, the director should have noticed when you said \"Invigilator\" instead of \"Inbhijilator\", to give a more desi touch to the role! Not that all Biharis speak like that, but for the role he was portraying, this accent would have been more appropriate. Have been an ardent fan since his \"kahani ghar ghar ki\" days! Please be a part of movies more often :))HRITHIK ROSHAN : What to say, how to express, I am sooo short of words!! Classy acting, humble expressions, wandering and expressive eyes (which do so much of the silent talking) :))))) Why do you always have to be soooo good!!!! Your expressions are soooo innocent, yet they bombard a huge impact on the audience! I was really skeptical of you skinning in this role when the talks of the movie was doing the rounds, for the Greek God, that you thought to be, for the natural sophistication in you. But you have marvellously blended in the role, and honestly,, outperformed it. It was so difficult to control tears during so many scenes, you brought such a life to the character. There are only two things that I feel should have been improved-\n1) The Bihari accent could have been a little more bihari..\n2) Whenever Hrithik sat on the ground, trying to evince a humbled gesture, I always felt, it should have been more desi.. The sophistication was somehow peeping from somewhere.. May be Hrithik could do a little more homework on that, given that he's originally not from Bihar.\nAll said and done.. What an amazing, heart touching performance by Hrithik.. Very well done!!\nP. S. : Your eyes speak innocence.. :)Mr. ANAND KUMAR : Every person who has their own share of struggle, can very much relate to this story, even though if they're not as selfless as the real hero of the film, Mr. Anand Kumar, the very much revered being. How many people would risk their lives or struggle so hard to do something that could benefit the unprivileged? There are many heroes in India and across the globe, who may not come in to the light, but they're still giving an authentic try to make this world a still more beautiful place to live, not only for the rich, but also for the unprivileged. Kudos and huge respect to you Mr. Anand Kumar and his team for imparting free education to so many students and giving their careers a huge leap!! God bless you..Pankaj Tripathi and everyone else was awesome in their acting , but I'm personally more fond of Pankaj Tripathi in positive roles..Overall, Amazing movie, great concept, beautiful direction touching the delicate corners of heart..\nI would rate this movie as 9/10..All the best to the team!!P. S... I'm off my work for a few days.. Kindly excuse me for writing the review at length! Had too much time in hand, and too many emotions fluttering inside me ;)",

Although based on true events and real lives within India, the film bears relevance for anyone across the big blue too. Anyone from anywhere can feel the very heart of this story through its characters. The courage and conviction of every character is raw, sometimes painful, yet heart-warming and inspiring.The story highlights some of the flaws of India's education system and the harshness of lower income life, but more than that, the film gives meaning to dreams and the work it takes to achieve them. Anything is possible. Everyone is capable. Everyone has something of value to offer each other.Super 30 drives home a message of hope. No matter your circumstances, if you have hope, you have an integral building block for laying an important foundation. With focus, hard work, an open mind, and a capacity to share knowledge and support, something worthy can be built.The film is subtle, yet straight to the point, when it comes to delivering messages. There's plenty to learn as you follow the story. The characters tell you... teach you many things from different perspectives as the story develops. It's not just a film centred around education, Super 30 educates the audience throughout. Through characters with an immense capacity for courage, the story motivates and inspires.Every character is nuanced with a rawness and honesty that you can truly feel. Nothing feels superficial about anyone. From the main leads, to the supporting cast and extras, glance into anyone's eyes during the film and you will find the heart of hope and courage. You will feel the support characters show for one another, the sharing of joy and achievement, as well as an innate understanding. You will feel the rough edges of reality and the coldness of challenges the characters have to face. You will feel their pain, fears, despair and a sense of defiance at times too. You will share in their triumph and sense of accomplishment. Everyone's performance feels authentic and relevant. This is the film's true power.The world is laden with harsh circumstances and people too. The world is also speckled with good folk and reasons to hope. Super 30 and its fantastic cast dare you, the audience, to dream... because the \"impossible\" really can be full of possibility, if only you have it in you to find it, challenge it, question it and earn it.No matter who you are or where you're from, the depth of human emotion is something anyone can identify with. The ability to dream and achieve is within us all. The capacity to learn and strive for achievement should exist without boundaries, prejudice or false notions of success. A spark is enough to accomplish anything. Brave storytelling and heart-felt acting make this film worthy of watching more than once.",

            "content": "Super 30 is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language biographical drama film directed by Vikas Bahl and co-produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, narrating the life of mathematician Anand Kumar and his educational program of the same name. Co-distributed by Reliance Entertainment, the film stars Hrithik Roshan as Anand, with Mrunal Thakur, Virendra Saxena, Pankaj Tripathi, Aditya Srivastava and Amit Sadh in lead roles. This movie Inspired by maths whiz Anand Kumar, who has seen an astounding success rate for IIT admissions year after year with his batch of 'Super 30' kids, the film charts his motivating journey as a fictional account. A life dotted with controversies and hardships, Anand As Hrithik Roshan literally rises from the rubble to mould his dreams. The story doesn't touch upon the certain controversies surrounding Anand Kumar which have been reported in the media, focusing on his struggles and glory instead.Son of a postman, a young Anand clinches an admission at the Cambridge University owing to his brilliance in mathematics. But when he has to let go of this opportunity of a lifetime solely because he is unable to afford the fees, life hits him hard and breaks his spirit. But that doesn't last for too long, since he gets picked by Lallanji (Aditya Srivastava) to become a maths teacher for affluent students at an IIT coaching centre, run by him. But soon, his true calling and passion catches up with him and he realizes that he must use his skills to give lesser privileged, bright students a fair chance at life. Of course, along the way, he faces opposition and obstacles one after another, but never loses sight of what he sets out to do. 'Super 30' drives home the message that education is truly the privilege of those who have the access and economic resources. Unfortunately, for many it remains a distant dream, but if given the same opportunities they have it in them to shine equally bright. There are many moments in the movie that will move you - after starting his Super 30 classes, Anand has to literally scrape through - with often the students barely having anything to eat. But their real hunger is for better education and a better life. 'Super 30' has several heartfelt, inspiring moments that touch a chord. When Anand says at one point, \"Aapatti se aavishkar ka janm hota hain\", you do believe him, especially after having seen how driven his batch of students are, leaving behind their impoverished lives and literally daring to dream big. But in the second half, the film's lengthy run-time begins to weigh on the narrative. And some of the plot points come across as far-fetched and overly dramatic, with the background score dominating some scenes unnecessarily. The cinematography (Anay Goswami) of the film however stands out and some of the dialogues hit home. Hrithik Roshan pulls off a solid performance essaying Anand Kumar, capturing his character's sincerity and determination very well. While his physicality many not be entirely convincing, his performance more than makes up for it. Nandish Singh is earnest and well-cast as Anand's brother. Mrunal Thakur is effective in her limited screen time. Pankaj Tripathi as the unscrupulous politician is brilliant and Aditya Srivastava matches the villainy of his character to the hilt. Overall, the performances elevate the film. While the narrative does have its flaws,",
