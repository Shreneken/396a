No words to describe his performance. Manju warrier asusual she lived her character and killed with her performance. Teejay played small and important role in this movie & I'm shocked with his acting skills. What a performer he is. Background music of GV Prakash he nailed it. One of the best background score in 2019.This movie is sure shot blockbuster and also a best movie of 2019. Vetrimaaran & dhanush combo is always a gem.Asuran - Masterpiece",

Only because he is having always cult classic n raw action drama genre. This one joins the club too. Natural acting n narrow minded straight story in linear pattern, so its easy to get with the story line. Here the plus is acting n the screenplay. Gv prakash working with Vetrimaaran after Kaaka Muttai. While hearing audio when released I feel like something is missing. But as of now after watched the movie everything is there actually. Everything crafted well. #Asuran yet a normal story with a classic screenplay. I have always wonder how this man writing screenplay for his scripts. Wow!",

            "content": "Asuran (2019) :\nBrief Review -A Revenge drama filled with action raises voice against lower class discrimination and higher class oppression. Tamil Movie Asuran has 2 strong sides that can be the 2 big reasons to recommend this film. First, it's a revenge drama filled action which is sure shot safe bet for Masses and second it has explored some serious issues like Discrimination and honour killing for Classes. The film raises a voice against the traditional higher class oppression loudly and also makes it little emotional with the addition of family values. Although, it does not favour too much realism or quality filmmaking, the overall gesture is still at par. An action flick in Tamil Cinema is mostly about entertainment and mainstream masala but Asuran tried to do a little different from mainstream masala just to see whether or not this is the time for Films and audience to move on. Luckily, the film proves it's point that yes, audience is ready to accept such film which can spread awareness and also give pleasure of watching an Action flick at the same time. The high ratings by IMDb users and Public reactions are overwhelming, i didn't agree fully though. Yes i agree that Asuran is a Very Good Movie and one those of those rare actions films having hearth and brain at right place but somehow this is not Outstanding or Extraordinary. Maybe Tamil audience feel it new hence they were overwhelmed but for rest of the audience across the nation and the globe have been through with such films long ago (and i fall in this category). Dhanush, Manju and Ken Karunas are three names to be remembered for acting in this film, rest are okay-okay. Cinematography is bit dragged in action sequences otherwise no complaints. Vetrimaaran's attempt to do an action film with Social message is undoubtedly successful. Overall, A Nice and Definitely watchable film but not anywhere close to Classic tag.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "review_title": "When violence hits too close to home! [+73%]",
            "content": "What we see at the beginning of Asuran is a father-son duo trying to flee from something/someone - we are not told why or what happened beforehand. Borrowing cues from Vetrimaaran's own Vada Chennai which had a somewhat similar opening sequence (albeit with a twist and a different backdrop), both films feel like two pieces of the same meat, cooked and conditioned differently.Power (in its simplest terms) in many of Vetrimaaran's films amount to possession of property and position in the political or caste hierarchy. It's pretty much the same in Asuran as well. The insatiable greed of upper-caste, land-grabbing rich men is the root cause of issues between Vadakkooran (Aadukalam Naren) and Sivasamy (Dhanush) that eventually spiral out of control. As was the case in Vada Chennai, lives are lost on both sides and it's time for redemption.DOP Velraj paints Asuran in various shades of brown and red, the two colours that define the flick in multiple ways. Red denotes spilt blood while brown denotes land. The film is a blood-soaked revenge saga - only this time, the violence strikes too close to home, and the man of the house (who's a pacifist) undergoes a massy, intense transformation. The pre-interval block conveys this quite well. It's an action set-piece that looks more refined than raw (Peter Hein handles the fight choreography, that speaks for itself) for a Vetrimaaran movie. It almost felt like Vetrimaaran built scenes up in his own signature style until then and then sat back and exclaimed: \"Well, here's a set-piece for the fans/masses\".Manju Warrier, who plays Pachaiyammal, is terrific in the screentime allotted to her. She can brandish a sickle the right way or the 'right-er' way when goaded. How she holds her own against a bunch of ruffians in a scene early on in the film, is a riot. Dhanush is superb whenever he's playing the senior (more restrained) version of Sivasamy. In the second half, his violent massiness is explained in a pretty lengthy flashback which also involves casteism and power conflicts. While effective, it's a far cry from the 'Rajan' flashback of Vada Chennai. Teejay Arunaasalam and Ken Karunas, as the children of Sivasamy, lend convincing performances. However, the need for voiceovers elucidating proceedings, at times, felt like a dampener.GVP's massy score for the fights is a total banger. He makes sure that viewers do not miss SaNa's compositions. Asuran is sprinkled with political undercurrents that many a commercial film (and filmmaker) usually tries to avoid. It's about redemption for the oppressed. For that reason alone, the film is worth a watch. Also, it ends with an Ambedkar-like statement - how education can be the biggest difference-maker! It may not be Dhanush-Vetri's absolute best effort, yet one of the best Tamil cinema likely has to offer this year.",

The second half loses that sharpness and drives into bog standard 80's rural potboiler area, and even the caste angle appears to be played in a very superficial hero-glorifying manner (especially jarring is the token social message about education being the upliftment of the exploited masses). These are disappointing shortcomings especially since the film has some genuine strengths, mainly in the unvarnished setting (no item numbers, no out-of-place gloss) and a genuine regard for the great Indian masala drama. Also, Dhanush gives the role his all - with his body language and mannerisms he is able to convey a much older character and in a more subtle and nuanced manner than Vikram would have done.",

I haven't watched many Tamil films, since I'm more into Malayalam films and love their style of film making. Having watched PP and seeing the high praises I felt that if this film that is being hailed as a 'masterpiece' and all sorts of bogus remarks, I did not have many expectations from Asuran, which also had high ratings. The only Tamil film that I watched apart from the usual Rajnikanth, Ravi Teja, Ram Charan masala films was Mandela. A film that I happened to like very much.Anyway coming to this film, I was completely amazed at how well made it is. This film has it all. A riveting story, beautifully drawn out character arcs, a really immersive screenplay, fantastic and realistic acting to mindblowing action sequences. The action of this film is soooooo good and so masterfully choreographed that I watched the entire film more than once. The plot is realistic, didn't find any plotholes as such. Something that I appreciate very much as they make a film hard to be taken seriously and make you feel stupid. Very realistic is there tone to this film and tackles some jarring issues faced in rural parts of the country.There's not a single thing to dislike about this film.

Their passion and dedication for good cinema and the movie success, reminds of the classic partnership of legendary Martin Scorsese- Robert DeNiro of hollywood!Vetri knows he has got good story in hand, then script writing and to bring that alive on screen with proper casting, solid narration and execution of the plot shows how good he is at his work - a master storyteller!In recent times, as much I have seen, nobody does intermission point greater than him in tamil cinema, like when to pause the show and from which point to move forward to second half, and to make it look even more gripping, Asuran sequence to the interval block(just like Vada Chennai) is a masterstroke!Dhanush as I claimed before in Vada Chennai, the best actor of his generation, delivered yet another impeccable performance in this, the rise of him from rage phew!! Such a show stopper this man!Can't wait to witness them strike again in Vada Chennai2 and many more years of them work together ! A VetriMaran film!",

Dhanush is already a great performer and has given his lifetime performance in this film. On the other hand manju warrior gave equal tough to dhanush on what all scene she appeared.

Asuran is a better film than a good film!\nThe duo's previous ventures like polladhavan,aadukalam and vadachennai proved colossal and even earned them national acclaim. What does asuran has to please the audience?First, the writing:\nAny Vetrimaran film grants the characters of the film an inamiable right to have a character arc. A character arc is just a timeline where the character has a beginning, a conflict or association(a vital one) with the plot and an ending. This just ensures that any major character has a purpose in the plot. You could've seen this in vadachennai, even though there were countless major characters in the film, every one of them proved pivotal in the moving of the story.\nAsuran has relatively less characters but still no one is an unwanted 'aani' (nail) and shape the story of asuran. The screenplay though is less appealing as compared to vetrimaaran's previous films. The interval block planned at a Baasha type of range promises it impact but fails due to a hurried narration\nAnd the second half carries the flashback of the protagonist. Even though it contributes to the tone of the film, the character arc of the protagonist, removing it from the film won't damage the central conflict of the film.Second, the acting:\nWhen there's Dhanush on screen, you can't flaw his acting especially when there is scope for him to act. Manju Warrier impresses me with her acting and most importantly her tamizh pronounciation with the nellai touch to it was so accurate which guarentees her a spot in the best debut accolades. Teejay Arunachalam in the role of an angry young lad is promising and Ken karunas too emotes in his subtle role well as there are his good portions in the first half and the climax. Pasupathy is one underrated actor in Tamil cinema which is a point to note. Aadukalam Naren,Pawan,Ammu abhirami and all other supporting cast too get their lines good and score in the run.Third, the crew:\nAsuran is half baked without the amazing crew of velraj,gv Prakash..etc. Velraj gives us vadachennai vibes from his shady visuals mostly due to the film's events happening majorly in the darkness. I so badly want GV Prakash to get back to making music again because this a V.V.Good album in terms of score and songs. The asuran theme is one of the best theme songs I've heard in this year. It literally makes my hair stand when it plays in the climax premises.One line review:\nYou know Vadachennai is a world class film. So, Vadachennai > Asuran > A good film !",

So next time I don't wanna watch any south Indian movies via YouTube.Now coming to my review! This movie is really good especially I am definitely gonna praise Dhanush's acting here. He just totally involved himself into this role, but I'll not say it's a masterpiece.. For me, it's just a good plot with fast screenplay and good acting. Overall 7 out of 10 Stars from my side. Apart from brutal violence nothing wrong with this movie so you can surely watch it with family.",

            "content": "The movie is demonized. Everything in it is. It's a story of bloodshed in a person's life. Dhanush plays the role of the farmer who had a violent history. He is settled peacefully now with his wife and three kids. Then saga of violence erupts changing his life forever. Dhanush eldest son beats up the landlord's son due to land dispute. It further outputs to killing of his eldest son. Then younger son kills the landlord. Finally Dhanush kills the landlord's entire family while protecting his younger son from them. In midst of it the movie also portrays Dhanush previous life where he was an alcohol maker which turned gradually to bloody violent episode due to injustices done to him.About the movie I will say that it's a bloody flick with raw portrayal of violence in rural India. Though there is optimism in end, still violence is at its heart justifying the title. Violence is the only gripping point in the movie. If you like bloodshed you will like it. Other's will not. Dhanush is not perfect for the role of the father. Prakash Raj is always good. The climax remains awkward. Dhanush though his entire life of blood shed advises his son to study and refrain from violence. This didn't felt real at all. Well appealing to southerners only. If rural Indian violent movies are considered then i would recommend Virumandi. Summing up the movie felt like the average action movie. 52/100 is for Vetrimann sir's work.",

Will the farmer, a loving father and a pacifist by heart, be able to save his hot-blooded son is the rest of the story.\n.\n.\n.\n.\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Review : The essential job of a director is to create a character of such depth and authenticity that it can be true to life on the big screen. Vetri Maaran is one such Director who portrays his leads in such a way and thats even more easy with his favourite Dhanush. Asuran is raw, dark, gripping and a rivetting experience highlighting differences of warring familes. Vetri Maaran is aware of his craft in displaying the rural outfits of Tamil Nadu more efficiently than hus contemporaries. The setting , BGM and Screenplay is top notch. The Pre Interval Fight Scene is one of the best moments of the movie. The poignant drama within the household adds depth in extending the emotional elements.\nMalayalam Actress Manju Warrier is outstanding as the wife of Sivasami (Dhanush), she gets the accent and dialogue delivery on point. Teejay and Ken have done commendable acts as the sons of Sivasami. Dhanush is outstanding as Sivasami, he displays vulnerability and rage with a brilliant performance. Pasupathy and Prakash Raj noteworthy in important roles.\nWith an astounding BGM, Vetri Maaran's Asuran is a rivetting watch which takes into account the brilliant and tight narrative , powerful performances and pitch perfect screenplay. Brilliant Watch\n.\n.\ud83d\udc4dGoods :\n1. Vetri Maaran + Dhanush Combo\n2. Realistic Rural Outfit\n3. Intriguing Screenplay\n4. BGM + Commendable Performances\n.\n.\ud83d\udc4e Bads :\n1.

Again and again !Dhanush is way beyond an actor..he lived as Sivasami, lived the vision of Vetrimaran. I just wish they do more collaborations just for the sake of cinema fanatics like me..just loving their work",

If you want perfection, then either use your brain and imagine it or go direct it yourself but I doubt it's gonna be anything like this lol.Seriously, I wasn't expecting this sort of acting, this sort of story or character portrayal at all and I was literally mind blown. It shook me to the core and the violence was awesome! It was needed actually, and made me sympathise with the characters a lot because this sort of crap happens irl. Obviously because it's a movie he takes down a dozen people BUT it's truly about the strength that is found in people like that--the strength that should be there to fight against toxic, corruptive people instead of falling at their feet and pleading so it's a really good message. Hey, you gotta slap people back ten times as hard when they try and play around with you. Anyway, I can't explain in words how much this movie moved me. It made me cry, it made me angry, it made me feel a LOT of things. Basically a roller coaster of emotions that I fully welcomed. Honestly, Dhanush stole the show for me (although every single actor was superb) and his character was perfect, I loved it! If there was a rating higher then 10, I'd give it that.",

            "content": "No matter how many times you are asked to control, Vengeance and Valour can't be easily controlled. Disturbed. People breaks out. This is what Asuran deals.From the start, the movie doesn't ramble, directly dips into the story, which helps us to not lose concentration which we might have as the story revolves around two time periods involving Sivasamy and Chithambaram. The part that deals Chithambaram comes in first half while the Sivasamy comes in the later. The merging point of the two characters are written brilliantly. It shows the effort of the writer. (Asuran is based on the Tamil novel Vekkai which is written by Poomani ).Asuran is not only about the Vengeance - it shows how hard to be brought in a caste based society, especially when you are under casted. Scenes which shows the privilege of wearing the slippers gives a fresh feel of how people were discriminated even though they have the strength to buy a pair of slipper. This movie gives lot of thinking. One may say Sivasamy could have easily gave up the land in the first place which might helped him to lead a peaceful life. But to live a such a life, the fact that he was a coward, giving up the land because of some monster disguised as human asked him, would remind him every night and eventually he and his family might get perturbed. More than peaceful life, he would have become a slave. So, its hard to control and I don't know what Sivasamy could have done to saved his family lives.The cast is perfect in Asuran. Each and every characters were given equal importance. Needless to say that everyone performed very well especially Sivasamy and Chithambaram. Dhanush sets a new benchmark for his acting. The next focus goes to Prakash Raj who is an attorney fighting for the weak people. It was good to see him after a gap.Stunt plays very important role in Asuran. Almost all the fight scenes bumps the adrenaline especially the pre interval fight scene. Another major plus is background score. GV Prakash nailed it. As a standalone album it felt as mediocre but when we experience the same score in movie, it makes us unleash the Asuran within us. But Dhanush as Sivasamy advices us to, be patient and let go of the bad things and concentrate on the one thing that cannot be taken by anyone from us - Education.",

There is considerable social commentary on caste, class and government structures, themes that are universal, yet the rural Tamil setting is caricatured in a way that takes the viewer close to the heart of these story.Worth a watch - absolutely!",

            "content": "Asuran is all about Siv\u00e0sami, who leads a family of wife and 4 children and incidents following a landlord asking his irrigation land for cement factory.\nVetrimaran initially builds Dhanush as a composed and good for nothing guy who always says his fierce sons to obey the landlords and not to fight with them. In a scene, he even asks villagers to forgive his son.Manju's pachaiammal too gets a rawness similar to her sons and one instance proves this fact.Vetrimaran smartly uses Pachaimal' s reactions to narrate the pain of her elder son's demise.\nI think pig catch scene ,fight before flashback and slow motion fight were structured enough for Dhanush fans.where Sivasami and son chidambaram survives heavy attack from opposition.It's good that Vetrimaran doesn't confine the climax to just another happy ending story.\nSpecial mention to art,costume,dark frames and colouring departments to make things authentic. Dialogs were spot on and suit the situations (Note that this is a story way before 2000s and it's better to watch this movie with subtitles for better understanding).Songs convey emotions aptly for the situation,but weren't enough for the viewer to carry after watching. Bgm was good enough.\nDhanush was surprisingly suitable for the two phases of Sivasami. He wonderfully portrays the change in the attitudes of both characters. Manju too shines her part (not same as Kanmadam movie) in her role.Though their characters arc seem almost similar to young Sivasami,favourable performances of son characters(Chidmbaram and Murugan) does the trick for Asuran .Edits weren't fine enough in 2nd half as 1st half where viewer may feel lag in flashback sequences.\nBarring a few elements one wouldn't expect from a director like Vetrimaaran, Asuran sums up as an excellent story of a family's fight for revenge against caste oppression and power politics.\nRating:4/5",

Dhanush as Siva Saami has done an phenomenal job entire movie, his body language and voice modulation was flawless, he his a complete actor for sure. All the performances in the movie were excellent and outstanding. The two sons of Siva Saami, did a great job. Vertimaran has given his best and his dialogues and direction was perfect, his signature shots were actively present in the entire movie. The setting of the movie, played an important role, the conditions, the discrimination, the situations were sketched perfectly. The production values were high in the movie. The film holds some bone-chilling scenes which keep you hooked. The village setting deserves a round of applause for sure, it gives us great experience.

Unaware of the law, the plight of those undergoing such suffering is immeasurable. Vetrimaran joins hands with his specialist lead Dhanush for the fourth time to deliver what can be called as an intense and raw thriller like never before. How can the duo continue to impress every single time? Touch wood!Sivasamy (Dhanush), a farmer, is a father of Murugan (20), Chidambaram(16) and a 5-year old girl. Along with his wife Pachaiyamma (Manju Warrier) and brother-in-law Murugesan (Pasupathy) he strives hard to provide for the kids. The small piece of land that he owns is under the radar of a rich landlord Narasimman, for he wants to construct a Cement factory over it. While Sivasamy wants to deal with it in cordial terms, his elder son Murugan wants to settle scores with an eye for an eye. As arguments and fights over the land become a routine, things take an ugly turn and Murugan gets killed by Narasimman's goons. Sivasamy's family suffers due to the loss and is unable to come out of the grief. The cops seem to ignore the case as Narasimman had tipped them. Now it is Chidambaram's turn to avenge his brother's death as Sivasamy is in no mood to take up violence. What happens to Chidambaram's plans and how Sivasamy manages to protect his family is the remaining plot.Dhanush donning a role is no news. But what one could witness in Sivasamy's role is sheer brilliance. The looks of the tanned and skinny farmer, the pain and suffering in the eyes, the anger in his nerves... these are just for starters. Vetrimaran has literally chiseled an oppressed villager out of Dhanush. Under one role one could possibly not imagine the scope to deliver so many shades .The stunt sequences and blood bath are sure to increase anybody's blood pressure, for they are an expression of all the suffering, that section of the society had faced. GV Prakash's background score gets us immersed. The screenplay constantly keeps us under a fear of what could happen next.This film will certainly leave an impact that will be hard to undo for a couple of days.",

This is not some kind of commercial action thriller this is LIFE of an lower caste who spent his life under someone and what could possibly happen if something comes to his family. Dhanush literally proved himself as national award winner. This is a bit violent but it does require this much of a violence. If you are looking to get heart weighed at the end and want some blasting bgm with some emotions and while lot action then DHANUSH AND VETRI MAARAN'S COMBO IS WAITING FOR YOU IN PRIME and Iam sure that it will leave stunned and it's intensity does not go much easily.",

His acting and class was just awesome. Its story goes from becoming family wars into war between one family and a whole village having law, judiciary and eveything under their control. You will start to connect to each and every emotional as well as action scenes. Even a scene when a small girl is beaten up for wearing slippers would make you cry. And the scene where Dhanush and his sons and being beaten up will make you die from heart. I loved the way of storytelling.

Even though Vetrimaaran's Visaranai is still his best movie ever, Asuran comes a close second. And that is because of its overall flawless making and also surely the acting from Dhanush. In an age where top stars in Tamil cinema like Vijay and Surya make out and out commercial movies, Dhanush comes across as some one who is willing to take risks and push boundaries. I thought he did justice to his character quite well. Also, the cast of the movie is quite brilliant. Pasupathi, Ken and Manju warrier fit their roles to the T.\nThe only downside is some of the fight sequences where the Dhanush takes down a dozen people, although the stunts have been handled realistically.",

The movie shows, revenge, squeal murders, communal riot, oppression, love, betrayal and many more. It shows a mothers love, angry will give you loss, and the education is the only tool to get of it. This movie is equivalent to Jango. I agree the plots are different, but the impact and the experience it gives are equivalent. Both gives nail biting sequences and shows what if the oppressed people turn back to resist and attack. Overall a great movie and a real experience.",

If you carefully notice beyond the blood baths , beyond the enticing forest shots , indulging BGMs ..Danush's lead role tells you exactly this . There is an Asuran in each human being . Do you want to hide him or unleash him - There is a choice . Vetrimaran is clear in each aspects - Why the within fiery self evolved , why it is hibernating , why Sivasami decides to unleash ..Dhanush takes Sivasami protected in his own mysterious grasp even when he is standing between two other actor phenomena- Manju Warrier and Pasupathi.. It is a thin line .. Manju and Pasupathi are such powerful actors , with even an eye movement or a look they could draw the screen to them. Vetrimaran's screen play and Dhanush's flawless presence made it feel like the trio complement each other when three of them are in one frame. They are unmissable if you are watching the movie in a theatre. Scenes before the intermission are amazing...you knew it was coming , you knew Vetri has these magic moments.. still you will just enjoy them with Dhanush taking us with his Asura unfolding ... Kovilpatti forest shots , family's run for life through areal shots , boar hunting scenes are awesome! It is a movie you should watch in bigscreen .. Manju Warrier , Pasupathi, Ken Karunas,Subramaniam Siva are all performing beyond the expectation .. However it is the screen play that wins the trophy.",

            "review_title": "A realistic take on caste discrimination and the violence surrounding it",
            "content": "Vetrimaaran's adapted feature film of the novel Vekkai is a realistic and raw reflection of how caste based discrimination affects a family through violence. Everyone who has acted and involved in the technicality deserves the adulation the film is garnering. The story captures most of the real issues and violence around the caste issues that the underprivileged are subject to and how deep rooted discrimination runs into the hearts of people. One good example of the ground reality is the character that often mediates the issues between Sivasamy and Vadakuran, who could never actually bring any change and often maintains silence on the activities of the villain's perpetration. This guy would reflect the bystanding attitude of the society perfectly.The music mirrors the emotions that the scenes portray. The soundtracks \"Pollatha Bhoomi\" and \"Bloodbath\" are a treat ,penned and composed to near perfection. \"Pollatha Bhoomi\" in my opinion expresses the conversations between Sivasamy and Murugan as well as Sivasamy and Sithambaram about the actuality of the disposition of a a pair of wounded, discriminated sons and their pacifist father. The flashback is placed properly and one can see the versatility of Dhanush and Manju easing into their roles in both the timelines. The fight choreography was riveting and details were thoughtful, like, where in one of the early scenes Dhanush fights to stop the gang and not kill them by using the flat side of the machete consistent with his character at that point. The cast is pretty much usual Vetrimaaran cast with newcomers Teejay, Ken and Abhirami from Ratchasan. GV has shown his brilliance, lighting and editing realistic and the screenplay is smooth. There is more than one reason to watch and assimilate this movie. Asuran is dark and gripping.",
