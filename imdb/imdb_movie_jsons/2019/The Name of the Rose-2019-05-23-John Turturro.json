            "review_title": "Disappointing",
            "content": "I had written a rather favorable review for this series after having watched the first two episodes, but after having watched the entire series, I had to remove my initial review and start all over again. John Turturro is excellent - that's just about the only part of my original review that made it into this revised one.Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose is one of the best-selling novels of all time, which begs the question of why anyone would want to muck around with the plot. The most egregious bit of mucking surely has to be the introduction of the highly improbable Anna, daughter of the leaders of the heretical Dulcinian sect. She spends most of the series slinking around the Italian forests like a female Robin Hood seeking vengeance for her murdered parents, and then very conveniently ties up a loose end at the conclusion of the final episode. Dungeons and Dragons anyone?The subplots and unnecessary back-stories create a muddled narrative, and ultimately proved very disorienting. I've read the book a dozen times or more over the past 30 years, and honestly, by the end of the 6th episode I was hopelessly confused.The series has good sets, good costuming, mostly good performances (with Turturro's being outstanding) and the basic framework of a wonderful mystery by a brilliant writer, but the unnecessary plot-tinkering by lesser writers causes it to fall very short of what it could be - what it, by all rights, ought to have been. I may reread the book and then give this series another try, but that won't be anytime soon.",

            "content": "In short: there is a reason why the central character in Eco's work is named after Occam and nods to Sherlock Holmes. It has to do with presenting complexity and then dealing with it though Occam's maxim and Holmes' deductive reasoning. Yet, the writers of this mess of an adaption seem to have not understood Eco or Rose at all and simply opted for injecting and proliferating haphazard disorder to mimic it complexity when it is just -- mediocre plot device and script-writing and. Sorry but gibberish is not complexity because it meanders, and proliferation non sequiter subplots are not semiotics just because your brain has to also work when decoding nonsense . It goes without saying as well that labyrinth is meaningless if you just proliferate blind ally diversions and don't understand it is the great classics Eco is presenting as the guide, the key.If you've got that liberal arts degree for undergrad and loved history and literature, like I did, (before having to turn to something that can make some money for grad) they you probably knew about this series planning and had enthusiastic and positive expectations. The original film version of Name of the Rose was not bad, it was a decent adaption of Umberto's Eco's intricate but certainly his most approachable book, but it certainly could be much better fleshed out in a mini series length.In addition to being a fan of Eco, I certainly am as well of John Turturro.Sadly this series just doesn't work given the source material and talent. It is a serious disappointment; in fact a jumbled mess. Instead of using miniseries length to flesh out the complexity, tease the symbolism, and give us more of Eco, the writers went off the rails as well, distracting packing in all kinds of PC nods to contemporary issues that are not in Eco's novel. And even for \"a loose adaptation\" there is a continual sense of disjointed and artificially forced elements and messages that are not in Eco's work. Most galling -- but also telling -- metaphor for the utter humorlessness in the makers of this adaption is dropping emphasis on Aristotle's Poetics; whose dramatic theory, and utilization of humor, is what Eco is using. In the book we are immersed IN the Poetics, the author has structured he work so we are, while the character searches for it, along with a solution to the crime mystery, and this is not even attempted in this miniseries.I spent about two years working in Italy and I have a high tolerance for the messiness of Italian productions, be they film, TV or contracting of goods or services. Things there are beautiful and interesting, but often don't work well. OK. I did not go into this adaption of name of the Rose expecting complete rationality or order. But there are so many artificial jumps in plot that it nears incoherence. Especially since none of it is really true to the core of Eco's work which has to do with the sequestration of knowledge, such as sublime and complex classics, and not for example some hamhanded lesson on immigration, class struggle, or violence toward women. Eco already had a strong and important social message with poverty and a church that lost its way, or whose future was being fought over. By throwing in the kitchen sink of social commentary this gets diluted to nothing.I give this a six star, even though it is a four, since part of Eco is there, even if, with united irony -- it is hidden by the script writers' own nonsense.",

Adso's sin also goes unpunished, which dilutes a key theme of the book. They also mess up the murder mystery plot, which is the fun part of the book, that is the hook for all the philosophy. For modern audiences the original story has no strong female characters. They have tried to update the story, but inserting a Mary Sue like character does it no favours.",

            "content": "Only a limited number of films that I watched during my youth managed to leave an everlasting impression on me, but Jean-Jacques Annaud's adaptation of Umberto Eco's \"The Name of the Rose\" is one of them. Even though we are 25 years later, and I've seen perhaps 15.000 films since then, I still remember practically every detail of that wondrously grim and mysterious film in which creepy monks were being killed off in a remote and petrifying old monastery. Although I tried a couple of times, I never found the courage to actually read Eco's source novel. It's just too thick, sorry. The 1986-masterpiece is urgently due for a re-watch, but instead I stumbled upon this Italian/German mini-series that allegedly was a lifelong dream-project for actor and producer John Turturro to realize. Come to think of it, it's actually quite surprising that it took more than 30 years for someone to make a new version! Seeing that Annaud's film is \"only\" a little over two hours long, I must assume that it threw a massive amount of Eco's book-content overboard. With 8 episodes of approximately 1 hour each, I'm sad to confess that \"Il Nome Della Rosa\" is too long and quite often balancing on the verge of boring. Also, I keep reading that the script differs immensely from the book, at least for what concerns the numerous sub plots surrounding the pivot murder mystery.Turturro is great, but Sean Connery's charismatic image remains stuck in my brain as the one and only William of Baskerville; - wise Franciscan friar and Sherlock Holmes ahead-of-time. All the other, nevertheless adequate, actors can't even begin to measure themselves against the quality performances of the fantastic actors in the 1986 film, like F. Murray Abraham, Ron Perlman, Michael Lonsdale or William Hickey. The sole performance I rate higher comes from the fairly unknown Damian Hardung, who's portrayal of young novice Adso Von Melk is more authentic and convincing than Christian Slater's role.Or, perhaps I just ought to stop comparing this with youth's nostalgia and simply acknowledge the multiple great aspects of this prestigious mini-series. The production values, for instance, are deeply impressive. The 14th century set-pieces, costumes and relics are astounding. Also, the history lessons processed into the screenplay are far more educational and compelling than anything you'll ever learn in school, and Tch\u00e9ky Karyo has a brilliant supportive role as the megalomaniac Pope Giovanni XXII. If there's anything I firmly believe, it is that medieval Popes were exactly as deplorable and vile as him.",

            "content": "The Name of the Rose is a series based on the novel by Umberto Eco. This is an ambitious effort that has clearly seen no expense spared.The result is an intriguing and enjoyable series, that blends Renaissance politics with a crime drama. Everything of the period is infused with a religiosity that is not only philosophical but also highly political. The church and state were inseparable and this point is driven home by the fact the key figure, a Franciscan friar is both giver of religious truths, as well as an arbiter of temporal justice.Perhaps the closest counterpart to this series I can think of is 1990's production Cadfael, set in an earlier medieval period. So far The Name of the Rose is shaping up to offer something similar but whether it will be as polished as this earlier drama remains to be seen.Beyond this the acting is best described as solid to excellent from all of the cast and the stories are well told. I do think its quite an accomplishment to take a book of this kind and transform it into a series.So far The Name of the Rose looks promising. 7/10 from me.",

John Turturro is great, as always, and the supporting cast includes stalwarts such as Sebastian Koch, Rupert Everett, and Michael Emerson. But you might want to hold off on making the popcorn. The Name of the Rose is a big book, but Jean-Jacques Annaud showed us that it's possible to present it on film in just a couple of hours or so; nevertheless, this series has been expanded to 8 one-hour episodes. You might expect the producers would want to explore plot points from the book in greater detail, but that hasn't really happened. Instead the writers have been busy updating Eco's masterpiece to speak more directly to contemporary issues. In the first two episodes (all I've seen of the series), you can tick off feminism, immigration, torture, gay rights--you name it (perhaps your time would be better spent at the microwave after all). When it focuses on Eco's story, the series can be riveting, and I'm eager to learn more about the library. So what if Damian Hardung as Adso of Melk seems to belong to a different century?--that was also the impression I had of Christian Slater as Adso in Annaud's 1986 film, and it didn't ruin the story for me. John Turturro, on the other hand, is perfect as William of Baskerville, even if we won't be forgetting Sean Connery right away, and there's nary a hint of a Brooklyn accent in his delivery. So I guess I'm in for the long haul.",

More flashbacks later on don't help and the murder-mistery plot ends up loosing the grip it might have had.My judgment is partial as haven't watched the whole series (the last episodes are still to be aired), but I haven't been intrigued by it so far.\nMeanwhile I picked up the novel again and I'm looking forward to re live the suggestive atmosphere of J.J Annaud and Sean Connery's 1986 film version.",

            "review_title": "A solid adaptation, but dull in places and misses some of the point",
            "content": "Umberto Eco's 'The Name of the Rose' is possibly the most intelligent detective story ever written; but with it's highly complex, learned plot is a hard tale to film. This adaptation, as with the earlier film, nicely recreates the appearance and overall feel of the spectacular monastery that Eco describes so well. But it's stately in place, and struggles to convey the individual characters of each of the monks with the depth of the novel, which somewhat confuses the the storytelling; when the perpetrator of a series of murders is finally unamsked, the moment lacks the sense of revealed inevitability that made the conclusion of the book so satisfying.Overall, it's an honourable effort, but I have two gripes. The story is a tale set in a man's world: the only signficant female character is an innocent victim of a cynical (male) inquisitor for whom it's highly convenient to find someone to denounce as a witch. In this version, however, she's replaced by a pair of kick-ass female wanderers, who seem to serve no purpose except to provide some incongruous gender-balanacing. More seriously, the central moment of the tale should be the girl's execution. Our narrator, a young novice who has fallen in love, is in awe of his master, a wise, humane, almost humanist older monk who serves as the story's hero. But when the novice asks the master to save his beloved, he simply shrugs and, knowing full well the unquestionability of inqusition, remarks sadly \"she is burnt flesh.\" The girl is duly killed, the inquisitor leaves, but the murders continue, and our protagonists continue in their pursuit of the real killer. But the conclusion of their ultimately triumphant mission occurs amid a mood of melancholy: stripped of their illusions, they have been reminded full-well of what it takes to live in the world. This mood-shift is to me the crux of the entire tale; but in both the earlier movie, and in this story, the screenwriters have abandoned it, presumably as too bleak, and in so-doing, crticially weaken the power of the story. It's a shame: life isn't always a story of self-determination and happy endings; and that's one of Eco's lessons that is lost in this telling.",

            "review_title": "Somewhat flawed but still successful adaptation of very complex source material",
            "content": "I had mixed expectations about the new \"The Name of the Rose\" miniseries. On one hand I loved the book, and I loved the 1986 film by Jean-Jacques Annaud. On the other hand, I was aware of the compromises that Annaud had to make when adapting Umberto Eco's bestselling novel to the screen.Fortunately, I think Eco (who sadly died before the series went into production) would be moderately content with the new adaptation. The first episode is not very good, but the later we get, the better it becomes.Eco's \"Il nome della rosa\" is a multilayered treatise that focuses on mediaeval philosophy and church history, and is spiced up with a criminal intrigue that encourages you to keep reading. It is widely considered as one of the best novels ever written.Annaud's 130-minute film concentrated on the crime plot, and had to leave out most of the fascinating background. The new 6-hour miniseries gave the filmmakers more space to explore more of the historical and religious context, and they have made decent use of this opportunity, though they have also made a few questionable choices.The novel is written from the point of view of Adso of Melk, a young Benedictine novice, who in 1327 joins William of Baskerville, an English Franciscan monk with a Sherlockian mind, on a visit to a North Italian mediaeval monastery filled with monks from different European countries. They are supposed to attend a religious conference, but find a murder instead.Annaud's wonderful film was a vehicle for Sean Connery, who played Baskerville superbly, but perhaps with a slight overtone of arrogance, while the then 15-year-young Christian Slater struggled with insufficient material to give Adso the necessary depth.In the miniseries, the balance is restored: the young German actor Damian Hardung who plays Adso of Melk is truly sensational, and effortlessly commands the much-expanded role. The beloved quirky American character actor John Turturro (who also co-wrote and co-produced the miniseries) gives us a refined, humble, intellectual, sharp-witted yet caring William of Baskerville. The duo has a phenomenal chemistry as master and pupil, one that is rarely seen on screen.Like the 1986 Jean-Jacques Annaud film, this Italo-German adaptation of Eco's brilliant novel is shot in English, yet is cast with supporting actors from many European countries for whom English is not the native tongue.This model of Euro co-productions usually fails, but here, it is justified and works reasonably well - after all, the 14th-century monks did came from different countries, and didn't all speak perfect Latin. Multilingualism was built into the European church life in the Middle ages.While the main male characters are played by Brits and Americans, the supporting cast is mostly Italian and German, with a Frenchman and a Pole added to the mix. Alas, not all of the actors give equally good performances, and you're advised to turn on English subtitles while watching. 30 years ago, Annaud made better casting choices in a few cases - but all in all, the formula works.Eco's novel is a near-perfect literary work, but it has one significant problem - it's extremely male-centric. The sole female character is reduced to an episodic appearance. The novel gives a one-sided account of Adso's romantic subplot in form of his inner dialogue, while the unnamed Girl (to whom the title alludes) is anonymous and generic. This may have been a conscious decision by Eco, but I've always found it the book's weakest spot.The writers of the miniseries cleverly expanded the subplot of the Girl: they plausibly solved the problem of Eco not having written much for her, managed to make her an interesting character that has relevance today, and gave the actress Nina Fotaras a playground forvexploration. All that serves Adso very well, too, because we can now understand better why he fell in love with the Girl. I actually consider that decision an improvement over Eco's book - and that by itself is reason enough to watch the TV adaptation even if you know the novel well.Then come the various villains and anti-heroes, led by Bernardo Gui, the fearsome Inquisitor. With the little screen time he was given in the 1986 film, F. Murray Abraham had created an acting masterpiece. Here, Rupert Everett has more time, and uses the time well. I'm not a big family of this actor, and normally find him rather wooden - but here, he's gives a solid, convincing villain, though less memorable than Abraham's.Possibly the best part of Annaud's film was Ron Perlman's show-stealing, unforgettable portrayal of Salvatore, a babbling disfigured monk. It is difficult to imagine how another actor could follow Perlman's definitive Salvatore - so the miniseries opted for a watered-down monotone Perlman impression delivered by Stefano Fresi that works well only if you haven't see the 1986 film, and is the series' biggest disappointment if you have.For a change, the casting of Michael Emerson as Abo of Fossanova, the Abbot, is a noticeable improvement over the 1986 Michael Lonsdale role. Emerson superbly embodies the inner conflicts that the Abbot is subjected to.In an effort to provide some backstory for Gui, and to make room for some action sequences that could throw in some visual variety into what might otherwise be deemed a very \"boring\" production, the writers of the adaptation have diverged from Eco's plot in one significant way: they have invented a second female character, Anna, played by Greta Scarano.I understand their motivation, and, in principle, their effort was justified. Eco himself chose to package his exploration of semiotics, philosophy and medieval history in form of a crime novel, to make the topic more accessible and appealing to a wider audience. And he has masterfully succeeded.The miniseries expanded the female sub-plots to add both gender and cinematic diversity, and to escape some stereotypical tropes. They have done it rather gracefully with the Girl (the character already present in the novel, so the plot expansion is actually consistent with the spirit of the tale).But with the second female, Anna, that they've invented, they have failed miserably - her story is artificial, borderline ridiculous, and is written in a way that embarrassingly confirms all the stereotypes it was seemingly trying to evade. Anna's subplot is superfluous and very out-of-style for the otherwise remarkable production. This, too, is a disappointment, yet one that shouldn't be a deterrent to the viewers.There is something, though, than can be a deterrent: the terrible, misguided, utterly forgettable, heavy-handed, predictable, boring, flat and simplistic musical score by Volker Bertelmann, devoid of any subtlety. That is, unfortunately, something that did not surprise me at all, given that it is, after all, an Italian-German TV co-production. I had wished there was a way to turn the music off.Much praise must be given, on the other hand, for the way the filmmakers have treated some other aspects of the Eco novel: the central dispute about the role of the church is portrayed very well. Of course Eco's complex, encyclopedic excursions into the fine points of the different factions and their motivations have been significantly condensed, but the remaining gist still gives enough food for thought, and is rather relevant in today's context of the scandals that surround the Catholic institution.The visuals also work very well. Some CGI sequences could have been better, but the designers of the physical sets have done a phenomenal job in creating the abbey and the library - they are nearly exactly as I imagined them!The scriptorium and the books are given sufficient attention, and are an extremely pleasant sight for anyone interested in letterforms. You can even watch the full traditional process of making paper - something that I myself have seen before, but I imagine most viewers never have.\"The Name of the Rose\" is slightly uneven and has its flaws, but overall, it does justice to Umberto Eco's novel. It thrills just as much as the early seasons of \"Game of Thrones\", before the dragons, the magic and the undead have turned the political costume thriller into a fantasy spectacle.The adaptation realistically transports you back to the 14th century Europe, and gives you a taste of what the life of those outside the minority of sword-wielding knights could have been.It gives us a splendid master-student relationship that captures the spirit of Eco's book spot-on, and delivers a surprisingly beautiful love story that actually enriches Eco's writing with one more level that Umberto didn't write, but could have.It begs the question whether it was a good idea to fill some of the time with swordfights and archery, but I understand the desire to try to broaden the audience. This desire to make the show appealing to less-literary audiences is evident in the casting of the elderly monk Jorge de Burgos.In the miniseries, he is aptly portrayed by James Cosmo, whom the \"Game of Thrones\" crowd will remember as Jeor Mormont. In the 1986 film, Feodor Chaliapin Jr. was cast by Annaud, possibly due to his resemblence to the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, whom Eco jokingly referenced in his novel, and with whom he shared his fascination with labirynths and the Middle Ages. So the 2019 adapters swapped a Borges reference for a J. R. R. Martin reference. Signum temporis.But as a whole, the show's creators Giaccomo Battiato, Andrea Porporati, Nigel Williams and John Turturro, as well as the rest of the cast and crew, have not disappointed, and if they have, then only slightly. \"The Name of the Rose\" is a passable transfer of Umberto Eco's novel to the small screen, and is actually one of the better things to watch if you want to get a bit of the European mediaeval feel.",

The costumes, for a man like me, without interest in fashion questions, were fascinating, for texture and for the lovely photography. The sins - many. Maybe, the basic are the subplots and the desire of director to explain everything. The effort of Michael Emerson to save his role was huge but without real effect. A good point for Nina Fotaras job. My regret- the fight of Rupert Everett with Bernardo Gui. I am a long term admirer of Everett and I expect from him more in this case. Sure, he gives a decent to good performance but he seems prisoner of script. He remains the evil man . But, in essence, Bernardo Gui is more and Rupert Everett can give, in brilliant manner, this \"more\". The serie is beautiful and, against its sins, I repeat, I love it.

After watching the first episode, I went back and watched the movie and was surprised at how leisurely the latter felt: despite being only 2 hours long, the story developed at a natural pace. In this adaptation, so much seems to have been crammed in that it all feels remarkably rushed and overpowering.Unlike Sean Connery in the movie, John Turturro is far too pompous. Connery played William of Baskerville as someone obsessively driven by logic and reason; Turturro plays him as a pompous know-it-all (e.g. the missing horse in the first episode) and his sometimes painfully unnatural diction is immensely irritating. This feels very much like a vanity project.In the movie, Christian Slater plays Adso of Melk perfectly: with wide-eyed naivety. Here, Damian Hardung appears to have spent too much time in the gym, given the ahistorical state of his abdomen (as revealed early on in the first episode), and is too worldly-wise.The concluding monologue of the movie has now become a monologue (Adso's) with a dialogue (between Adso and William) tacked on. I don't have the novel to hand, so I can't say which is most faithful to the source, but it does feel like the writers of this adaptation haven't appreciate that less (fewer words) is more: they don't know when to make their characters shut up.All in all, this is far far worse than the 1986 movie. All involved need to do penance: perhaps by retiring to a monastery to write their memoirs in longhand, only to throw them on the fire on the eve of publication?",

Just about everything was good about that film and that's why it managed to leave an everlasting impression on me aswell. Atmosphere was great. But not so much on this mini-series. I can't help but feeling that the characters on this mini-series are modern people in historical costumes. I wouldn't blame the actors though. Even the best actors cannot do miracles if the film is otherwise bad.For me, this is like The Name of the Rose meets Game of Thrones. More action and naked skin with the expense of atmosphere and realism. There are just too many TV-series and films these days with that problem. I can't also help but feel that whoever put this thing together just wanted to raise awarness on current social issues and didn't really care about the original novel at all. He could've chosen just about any novel to work on. So why butcher this classic?This adaption reminds me of some other similiar fictional historical mini-series or films that I've seen in the past few years. Somewhat agreeable entertainment if I have nothing else to do, but a year or two later I can barely even remember seeing them. If I compared this to the book or the old film, it wouldn't deserve more than 5/10. But 6/10 is for those who haven''t read the book or seen the film. Six stars might still be too much though..",

The casting of the supporting actors was visually brilliant. A rich variation in ages and craginess of face and body. If it were a docu-drama organised by a museum curator and a couple of designers then I'd give it 8 stars.Beyond this and as an artistic representation of a stunning masterpiece of a book I think it stinks!\nThe direction was worthy of the poorest am dram first night. The pace was deadly. The screenplay was a chaotic abomination which betrays the original text with its pointless additions.\nThe two leading characters are watered down to the point of extinction. I liked watching Tarturro, he is a very charismatic man but he understates his character far too heavily. There is none of the hugely self disciplined power of Guglielmo da Baskerville. And his companion is just ...dull. Not the highly strung innocent of the book. Why they bothered to half heartedly reference Asdo's observation of the medieval door surround I don't understand. The ignorant novice's first sight of the bas relief of biblical scenes around the church door is one of the most moving moments in the book. Deal with it or leave it out !\nReally really bad direction all around. imhoFinally the sound quality!!! It is deplorable. You cannot hear the dialogue in the first scene over the monotonal musical effects ...again so so amateurish. And later in the church the effect is of one ambient mic somewhere in the middle of the space randomly picking up voices of varying volume. Really poor.\nIn addition, all of the cast spoke with flat monotonous tonality in a farcially generic \"Iyam spicking in a furrin accawnt\" pre-formed dialect which sounded just silly and became excruciating to listen to as the numbers rose. A weird mix of German French and Italian but not any of these really. Just generally trying to sound 'foreign' Why bother at all?\nThen I noticed in the titles that here was a dubbing specialist?\nIf it was dubbed then this explains a great deal of my frustration. I find dubbed films to be ridiculous and this was no exception. If it wasn't dubbed then it certainly seemed to be!\nThis series clearly had access to a huge budget and could have been magnificent with an ounce of passion and expertise in both the direction and in the delivery of all of the characters.

The plot jumps here and there, again for little obvious reason. John Turturro could have been terrific as the medieval investigator but he is far too reserved; his novice, Adso, is such a wide eyed ingenue (despite his war time adventures) that he is a wholly improbable character. That said, the acting, individually, is fine, often very good, but just lacking continuity and relevance.The set of the monastery is so obviously cgi as to make it difficult to believe in any of what happens within its boundaries. The story is a good one, this televisual adaption, poor and ultimately very disappointing.",

Unfortunately, after seeing two episodes, I have to wonder about the choices they've made with the story. They have a solid cast, a good plot to work with and exciting locations yet they chose to supplant the main story with the likes of mute forest nymphs and wailing gay Elon Musk.\nThe side stories jump around confusingly, with so many plot strings they become hard to follow and a tangled mess. I think this is also a problem with the editing as the scenes cut strangely. I honestly have no idea what is going on in some of the side plots at this point.\nWhen the story focuses on what I assume is the main story of the monk murder mystery in the abbey, the show is entertaining, yet so far this is only a portion of each episode. Having said this, John Turturro is suitable as a medieval Sherlock Holmes, Rupert Everett is quite hilariously evil as Bernardo Gui, and Michael Emerson is sufficiently creepy as the Abbot, but the rest of the story is a mess.",

The two main characters are wooden and, perhaps unfairly, in contrast to Sean Connery's film characterization, John Turturro's Guglielmo da Baskerville doesn't cut it. The females, when they appear are in full make up seem to be channeling Merida from the children's cartoon Brave.

A viewer is offered beautiful scenes of northern Italy, moving camera and fast cuts and of course lots of dialogue. There's many hours to waste before anything happens.Also the real spoiler is in the dialogue, it's no longer a mystery what is going on behind the monastery walls if it's implied very directly within the first episode. It's given away, and knowing the plot already it feels like a very boring eight hour ordeal.English actors do a good job but in my point of view this should have been italian only project with italian main actors and italian dialogue.

There are differences for sure, as one is based on real history and the other is fantasy, but certainly The Name of the Rose had similar fantastic sets, locations and production values, as did the more famous series. There's a fair whack of intense politics and interesting character development too, and not a little torture, shock and violence, so familiar in Thrones. I liked the lead, a lovely character really well played, and not really comparable to the incomparable Sean Connery in any way. This is a new vision different to the original movie. If I had a quibble it is that some of the flashback sideline stories were unevenly presented, so much so that I wondered what was going on. The main theme though is clear as a bell and works a treat. There is a lot of suspense, delicious ups and downs, and, surprisingly, the investigations are intelligent for such a superstitious and pre-science age. I think one should remember that for that age religion held the same sway and power for ordinary folk that science holds for us today. On this level The Rose is truly fascinating. I am an avid supporter of seeing good historical pieces presented by Hollywood. When Hollywood does do them these days they are usually really good. I think they are important and that there should be more of them. If you think the same as me then be assured this one won't let you down.",

Though I must admit that the story meandered on, it kept me interested to see to its end. Since I have read the novel and has seen the movie with Sean Connery, there is no surprise there. The producers have painstakingly recreated a 14th century abbey and have dressed the actors appropriately, it's interesting to watch. Also, that it has an international cast. Was surprised that Everett can do drama - since I have only seen him in \"My Best Friend's Wedding\".

Still think that an accurate interpretation from it might be forged. So far, however, this series --all the while it's not quite up to matching the novel- in some ways fills up some of the holes that the book leaves open.The 1986 movie made a good effort to bring the book to the screen, but appart from Sean Connery, Ron Pearlman and Valentina Vargas (the girl), the 2019 series cast is outmatched. Settings in some parts are better and on some other's lack; if you see both you shall be the judge. On the other hand, director's work is weaker than the 1986 movie but that's probabbly the sin of the script writers and the producers. Photography is great and really conveys the ambience of the place, a 14th century abbey.The cast and their performances are top notch. Most with the exception of Turturro, Karyo and Koch are fairly unknown to western viewers but all are quite solid performers.In all it's a highly recommenadble series. My opinion; go for it!",

In 8 episodes, the series develop some plots that unfortunately with the movie was not possible to explore due to time limit. There are however a few subplots that were clearly made up to reach the 50 minutes mark for each episode. An example is the Dolcino's and Anna's story, that was very underdeveloped and pretty much disappointing. For the rest I don't have anything to say: characters are interesting and charismatic.The cast for the most part is excellent: I was really surprised by John Turturro interpretation, he represent really well the wise William of Baskerville, and did not let me down. Like I said at the beginning of this review, is not Sean Connery, but he gets pretty close to him. I was also very pleased in seeing Rupert Everett as Bernardo Gui. I think he perfectly fits the role of the villain, and I felt much hate for him. The actor was extremely convincing. Special mention goes to Fabrizio Bentivoglio as Remigio of Varagine, which was very teatrical in his acting and Stefano Fresi as Salvatore. I was a little bit disappointed Alessandro Boni as Dolcino: he is embarrassing. I don't know if he cannot speak English without an italian accent, or if writers created the character in this way, but he is too forced and instead to empathize with him, you laugh whenever he speaks.The series has a good photography, I liked the framing, that highlights really well the mystery that surround the abbey.

Not only is it a gross cliche, but there are literal Disney villains who have managed to deal with themes of religion, misogyny and bigotry in a more subtle and nuanced manner.Furthermore, the series is full of stupid mistakes, like the characters discussing a brown horse but the camera clearly showing a black horse, and in the final episode, the big narrative climax, was left filled with horrible green-screen effects just to mention the most egregious ones, but the series has plenty of plot holes and confusing flashbacks created by the added subplots not present in the book.Lastly, while the supporting cast was decent with what material they were given, John Turturro was terrible as the main character. He's supposed to be a person so bright and colorful that the narrator follows him across all of Europe just because he's that interesting, but Turturro fades into the background of every scene he's in and is overshadowed by everyone else on the set, and that includes the previously mentioned horse.There are only one saving grace to this series, there are some pretty shots of the landscapes and environments that are beautifully lit and atmospheric, but that alone cannot save a story ruined by terrible subplots and questionable decisions.",

If you're a fan of Umberto Eco's book and the wretched beauty of the original film, you will be disappointed.Fell asleep in either episode 2 or 3, drifted back into consciousness when I heard Turturro's Brooklyn/Bronx accent drop in for a visit. Even he was tired by this series apparently.Someone made a grandiose effort to turn a brilliant novel and film into a fanfic miniseries with backstories. Too bad they crushed the pace and mixed up all their efforts.So they added preface war scenes but failed to give notice to any of the complexities surrounding the great schisms and zealous factions within the church during tge emergence of medieval Europe from the black plague and tye dark ages - a great mine of material. But they did add an Italian Joanne d'arc for a bit of feminist archetypal interest, who becomes a plot device in the end, but never developed as anything other than a story ornament.The inconsistencies are striking. The underlining tensions of wealth, corruption and censorship and revolution of the poor are made mute when Adso's love interest is transformed to beautiful princess of the woods who wears not only finely woven and dyed clothes but dainty buckled slippers, impossibly costly and fine, though her home is an open air fallen treehouse bedecked with sticks and moss. She is also clean with a shower of titian blonde perfectly styled ringlets.The pacing is at first stretched to fill time and then crammed with furious action in the last 2 episodes. Yet It's consistently tedious. At least 15 seconds were devoted to rapid cuts between Baskerville, the Abbot, the clergy and the dreaded Bernardo Gui, as he arrived in one of the earlier episodes. 15 seconds can be a very long time in film editing time. We've long since been introduced to the ponderous menace of the character and Rupert Everett's extraordinary \"acting\", which was a terrible disappointment. He could have had fun with that character, but just wasn't feeling inspired. He would have rather been in Ibiza.The series spends much of its running time on the fanfic lovestory between Adso the novice and Princess Forest Moss, with not a hint of internal spiritual conflict to complicate a nice tableau of young bodies ardor in the woods, as if their youthful illicit risk taking has a point. But Princess Forest Moss does devote herself to healing Joanna the warrior maid of Tuscany, before being imprisoned by the Ogre-Monk Salvatore.I can't say anything good about John Turturro's odd affectations, perpetually startled gaze and the script that did him no favors.Sean Connery wasn't thought of as anything other than a bombastic leading man when he breathed life into William of Baskerville. It was a brilliant role. Ive not seen Turturro fail in a role or a choice until this. He took a classic role and deflated it, with what I suspect is a great deal of help from the creators of this mediocre retread.All in all, this was a plodding misadventure in missing the point. The Name of the Rose was Adso's sled, which he still fondly remembered as an old man at the end.It reminds me of nothing so much as my sophomore year term paper on Macchiavelli's The Prince, having read the book the night before the paper was due, having not prepared, having not been to class for the lecture section on important historical figures of the Italian Renaissance.",

            "content": "Production design was beautiful, even when historically dubious. The lighting was wonderful, in places exquisite. The cinematography, with a few jarring exceptions, magnificent. Superb acting from an admirable cast.All in all... it was awful.The descent in a few strides from deep Alpine Winter to bucolic Springtime was doubtless highly symbolic but also marvellously risible, destroying my suspension of disbelief. Which only increased my ire at Adso's repeated romantic interludes which were not just an unnecessary interpolation but served to dispel the intensely claustrophobic atmosphere that should have dominated the whole story. The incessant cuts to explicative back-story and the introduction of extraneous characters to fill it out did nothing but contribute to opening broad vistas into what should have been narrowly confined. Oh, but because it's RAI Fiction there has to be extra titillation.A paper mill? One of the strangenesses is that linen paper is an unrecognised material. When this is actually mentioned it is not a deepening of the mysteries but a laugh out loud idiocy. How could paper be unrecognised in a monastery that owns and operates its own paper mill?So too the library itself. At least there is no attempt to elucidate the symbolism of the building as intended by Eco because the handsome building presented had too many floors, too many towers, too many doors and too many windows to be reasonably illustrative. (And probably not enough stairs.)Five monks died in what should have been remarkable circumstances but you'd be forgiven for not noticing as relatively little was made of this.Why they died. What secret Jorge though so important, hardly seems to matter because it is barely referred to tangentially and never brought out into the light. Someone who had not read Eco's book, or perhaps seen and well remembered the 1986 film, will come away without the least idea what all the fuss was about.Granting that Adso's rather tedious philosophising of the novel was never going to make it onto prime time television, what remained as story and drama should be a mystery and to a degree a horror story. But drama and mystery and horror are dissipated by being utterly soulless.",

Italy, 1327. This medieval thriller brilliantly mixes investigation, an adventure in the depths of the human soul thanks to a dense enigma, performers truer and more accurate than the natural, so the actors are invested by their role, it is the great strength of this series which will not fade in any way with the original movie by JJ Annaud. A superb series and this sumptuous reconstruction of the Middle Ages are just incredible, i was even amazed, with a plus ... a sustained enigma. One word: Superb!",
