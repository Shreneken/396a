            "content": "Caste n communal politics by the fascists in India is responsible for the deterioration of my beloved India.The film is beautifully-shot, superbly-acted and has a plot that is very very disturbing.Fans of Marshland, Memories of Murder n True Detective S1 will definitely like this.In rural North India, two underage girls r raped n hanged on a tree while a third one is missing. An honest cop investigates the heinous crime but comes face to face with the brutal realities of caste discrimination.The investigation leads us thru the desolated fields, filthy swamps, tall weeds, thick tress and abandoned tannery n ultimately we come face to face with the ugly n harsh realities.Schindler's List's pit scene wher the kids hide in the excreta pit, made me cry. And in this movie, the scene of the girls' bodies hanging on the tree made me very sad n disturbed.The film is beautifully-shot, superbly-acted and has a plot that is disturbing but a reality still existing in 21st century.Ayushman gave a restrained but terrific performance.Director Anubhav Sinha (Mulk) shud be applauded for making Mulk n Article 15. He has dealt with relevant issues which is plaguing India which unfounately no other filmmakers in India is bothered about.The cinematography by Ewan Mulligan enhances the viewing experience, with the rural landscapes feeling appropriately desolated as if the fields n trees r disturbed too.There are some high overhead shots that add to the sense of vastness.Zeeshan Ayyub gave a memorable performance, a scholar turned into a rebel.His lines before the climax is heart wrenching.He says in the film that men martyred at the border r outnumbered by those who die cleaning the sewers n no one mourns for them.Very disturbing that India is the only place where manual scavenging still exists, where poor fellas clean human excreta by their bare hands.This movie is a must for fans of Mississippi Burning n Devgan's Aakrosh which itself is an unofficial remake of Mississippi Burning.",

The story could have satisfied viewers even with limited domain, but instead of narrow approach of pin pointing, it chooses to broaden.Ayushmann is reaching new heights in every other film and other actors also nailed it. And some shots are spine chilling.",

            "content": "Anubhav Sinha is back with this crime drama, starring Ayushmann Khurrana in the lead. June is going superb for Hindi Film Indutsry. Kabir Singh is still running houseful. Now, this has come.Ayushmann is an IPS officer. He has been posted in a small village in UP. However, the next day itself, the police get two bodies of minor girls hanging on the tree. They were raped multiple times. The story gets its pace. And this crime drama continues with the subtext of casteism.Anubhav Sinha has tried to cover as many incidents of Dalits and other backward class people as possible which happened in our country in last few years. The motto is just to aware people on how this things work. From whatsapp messages to arrangement of strikes and rallys, this is how we are dividing us into groups. Also, this is 2019, not just 19! Justice should prevail for everyone without considering his/her caste. And there comes the title, Article 15, which gives each Indian basic rights.Ayushmann has given a splendid performances. He is too good for this role. Isha Talwar gives a needful support to him. Sayami Gupta shines in her effective role. Best of her was crying with Kumud Mishra in this film. Kumud Mishra is terrific. He has played this role like no one can. His slap scene is clap worthy. Manoj Pahwa again delivers wonderful performance. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub has a special appearance. The time he comes in the story, the film picks up very high. Fantabulous performance by him.Movie has no songs in it. Just a satire song at the starting. And a rap song at the end credits.Dialogues are absolutely fantastic. 'Power ki alag hi jaat hoti hai!' Hard hitting one liners will blow your mind. Entire speech by Zeeshan Ayyub in the jeep is perfectly written. Audience were clapping on the last line of that dialogue by him. While my most favorite one has been spoken by Ayushmann to his officer, that 'Jab Aag Lagi Hui Ho Aur Aap Neutral Rahen, To Iska Matlab Hai Ki Aap Unn Logon Ke Side Hain Jo Aag Laga Rahe Hain!'This is going to be a hit in Anubhav Sinha's kitty. While in first half, I was not sure whether this one is more good or that Mulk! But I got clear answer in second half. Film picks up very high. There is a greatest twist too. Public were stunned in that scene. Film is superbly written by Sinha and Gaurav Solanki.There is scene of bodies of rape victims hanging on the tree, and a kid passes by. It gave me goosebumps. Another one is a man coming out of the gutter. One at the interval point, nd one at the last line of a long dialogue by Mohd Zeeshan. Also, it is not a serious film. This year's the most comic scene is in this one. Ayushmann discussing castes with his team.Overall, Article 15 a is very much needful film in this time. It may not be linked with metro cities, but India is a nation of villages and small towns. Kudos to Anubhav Sinha and team for choosing this subject. Police were there in the theater for safety purpose. But there is nothing wrong in the film for any community or caste. This film will run with mouth publicity. So go and watch this entertaining crime drama. And ask yourself a question that Kaun Hain Aap! Bahujan, Harijan.. Ke Jan Gan Man me aate sirf Jan.\n#FarqAayega",

            "content": "Anubhav Sinha's 'Article 15' is designed like a crime thriller. And what works for the film is that it's thought provoking, hard hitting while unflinchingly bringing to light burning social issues.The film is heavy on atmospherics, with the top notch cinematography (Ewan Mulligan) and background score adding to the mood. The feel is grim, gritty and grey often bringing a chill to the bone with palpable tension in the air. The images - some provocative and uncomfortable stand out, like the one where a man goes deep into a drain to unclog it and emerges soaked in the filth or the top shot of a group of policemen conducting a search in a swamp with their torchlights. The dialogues leave an impact. And the director brings out subtle nuances through his characters and setting which add to the essence of the narrative. The film's storyline, interspersed with powerful and poignant moments leaves you with goose-bumps. The narrative definitely keeps you on the edge, but there are times when it feels a tad overstuffed as the layers, political intricacies and a multitude of characters seep in. And at times the pace dips.But certainly, the performances by an ace set of actors is one of the high points of the film. Ayushmann Khurana has you hooked instantly, belting out a riveting performance as the sincere, determined police officer. It's an intense, gripping act as he gets under the skin of his character. Other noteworthy scene stealers include actors Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, in a short but impactful role as Nishad.'Article 15' is not a light watch, but it is definitely relevant, compelling and a film that will spark conversation.",

            "review_title": "LOUDEST AND BRAVEST CINEMATIC SHOUT BREAKS THE SILENCE ON CAST ISSUES",
            "content": "ARTICLE 15 REVIEW :-It's been almost 70 years that India accepted the Constitution and all the articles of it but do we really see Right to Equality lense clear? Especially in rural areas? NO. Article 15 was created by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on one of the Most important and sensitive issue of our traditional society, giving everyone the Right to Equality regardless of what cast, state or religion person it is. Rarely any Filmmaker tried to focus on this subject, don't know why, may be because of fear of controversies or some other threats. Just forget it, we can't say it anymore as Article 15 has just become the Pioneer Film on that subject.The Plot of Article 15 is realistic as we see 2 Lower Cast underage girls are raped & hanged for the sake of 3 rupees and the 3rd girl is missing. An honest IPS officer Ayan (Ayushmann Khurana) gets his 1st posting in Lalgaon, exactly a day after the Girls are missing. He tries to find the rapist and murderers but the conflicts doesn't let him catch them that easily. Later on predictable things like Political pressure, resistance in investigation, suspension and ofcourse conspiracy takes over the scenes. It is very important to have diffrent things in screenplay and quality in execution when it comes to a predictable plot where we already know that Protagonist gonna win at the end, and fortunately that something different and Quality is Found here. Anubhav Sinha had tried gutsy script before, he might have missed that quality with Mulk but he improvised himself as a Storyteller this time. Watch out for the Realistic execution, Ayan's intelligent explaination against CBI officer and the Ending scene when the Truck passes and that Frame, that Voice note is used with Excellent direction skill. Without any doubt Mr. Anubhav Sinha, Article 15 is your Best Work till date.Talking about Ayushmann Khurana, this guy is in different league altogether now. The Kind of films he chose in last couple of years has put him in different league and Article 15 adds another good work in his pocket. Manoj Pahwa and Kumud Mishra have shined equally good in the film. Sayani Gupta and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub were there for little time yet both of them managed to leave an impact. The screenplay has something new to offer and the runtime never make it look boring. Although couple of moments looked unnecessary for this hard-hitting narrative, ot is still okay, those are forgiven for that tight convincing climax. Let's keep minuses aside, because we have majority of plus points such as Strong Script, Brilliant Performance, Engaging Narrative, Excellent Direction and last but not the least, That Socially Important Content.As a whole, Article 15 breaks the silence on Very Sensitive issue in Loudest and Bravest Cinematic Shout. At one moment it looks like Bimal Roy kind of cinema but Bimal Roy was more focused towards connecting Human emotions rather than using Law books. Although Anubhav Sinha made it more regional, more Filmy and used Constitution at his Level Best, the perspective of both of the cinematic minds remains same. Article 15 will go down in Memory lane as One of those Socially Important films which we don't see oftenly whereas it stands as one of the finest made in 2019 so far. If you are that Quality Cinema lover who is always ready to watch Content Driven Film with less or no Entertaining elements then you can't really afford to miss Article 15.RATING- 7/10*",

            "content": "Ayyushman Khuranna (Ayan)One of the burning issues of the country is the caste system.Despite relevant laws and provisions, one can't deny that the discrimination of various communities is there in our Country.The political class takes advantage of these conflicts and it further creates a divide. Very few films in Bollywood have plots that actually revolves around caste, shockingly.ARTICLE 15 is the story of a good cop trying to solve a caste-related crime.Ayan Ranjan (Ayushmann Khurrana) is an IPS officer from Delhi who has been transferred to a village named Lalgaon in Uttar Pradesh as punishment posting.As soon as he joins duty, he comes to know about a case involving three missing girls from the Dalit community in the village.the missing girls - Shalu and Mamta - is found hanging on a tree. The third girl, Pooja, is missing.it ws clear that Shalu and Mamta had been repeatedly gang raped and then hung on the tree. Ayan attempts to solve the case and find Pooja....What happens next forms the rest of the film.Story is very hard-hitting and deserves to be told. It is loosely inspired by events like the Badaun rape case and Una flogging incident.screenplay is engaging and keeps one hooked from start to finish.1 half is good & In the second hour however, the film gets quite complicated...The climax is quite impressive and the film ends on a fantastic note.ARTICLE 15 is a hard-hitting film that raises some important issues related to complex caste system of our Country.'Article 15' is not a light watch, but it is definitely relevant, powerful.",

            "content": "Article 15 as formed by the Indian Constitution of India prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Unfortunately, this is not case on the records in the real India.Article 15 tells the story of IPS officer, Ayan Ranjan (played by Ayushmann Khurrana), who has been posted in a small village, Laal Gaon, Uttar Pradesh. The day he takes up duty, he is welcomed with the murder case of three girls which leads to the \"real\" issues of the caste system which is very much prevalent in the \"real\" India.Last year Anubhav Sinha proved that he is more than just making candyfloss film,Tum Bin, or forgettable Cash with Mulk. This year, he goes one step ahead with Article 15 which is based on true life event of the 2014 Badaun gang rape case where two Dalit girls were gang raped continuously for two days, murdered and hung from a tree. There are no songs in this 2 hours 10 minutes film as Anubhav Sinha takes the audience right into the the truth which is harsh but was never elaborated. There are couple of questions raised by Ayushmann Khurrana to his peers relating to the different levels of caste and to his dismay, he gets the answer that there are different levels of caste and even sub-caste below. The scene is funny yet exposes the harsh truth existing in the few parts of rural India. Two scenes stands out - a lower caste worker coming out of a pit full of waste, his face smeared with sludge and goes back again to complete manual removal of untreated human excreta. The second scene is where a factory owner proudly admits to hitting the three girls who demanded a pay-hike of just Rs 3 and the reason he gives for beating these girls \"Unko Aukat Unki Dikhane ke Liye\"Article 15 details out the struggles and challenges faced by the cops mentally and physically. The crime-drama boast off some strong technical support. I should start with an outstanding editing work. The background score is haunting and yet mesmerizing. The cinematography is brilliant, portraying a real-life crime with aplomb. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the second half.Coming to the performances, it is Ayushmann Khurrana who will make you believe with enduring transformation from uninformed IPS officer into a angry man who stands for the righteous act. Ayushmann Khurrana lives and breathes the character of Ayan Ranjan and is complimented by Kumd Mishra, Manoj Pahwa, Sayani Gupta and the dependable Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub (who shines in a small role).Article 15 is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of what happened on that fateful night and it will definitely make you angry. Go for it ...MIND-BLOWING 4/5",

            "content": "First things first, this is a very important movie. This is a movie about something that we almost everyday read about in news or our Facebook feed but choose to scroll past. It talks about issues that our politicians pick up at slight popularity and turn it into vote machines. Some of us even join the band. Some of us leave thoughts and prayers and move on.In a country that on paper and figures is a fastest developing nation, the citizens certainly don't act like it. Article 15 doesn't pull it's punches when it comes to baring these harsh realities. Problem is, instead of focussing on one, it tries to over reach and takes on several issues but only satisfies us with the two main plot, while other things we have been following are kept open. While I understand that writers don't want to give us a happy ending, or make us feel all is well in the end , these sub plots certainly didn't deserve to be wrapped so quickly to reach the climax. It felt like they shot a long movie but had to let go of important scenes to cut down the run time.Other than that, the writers do a great job setting the characters and the director understands how to tackle this heavy subject. The director and DP work together to shoot every frame with grit and the environment is foggy with low visibility, just as the mindset of people living there.Ayushman does a great job as usual but this time he is not the best part of the movie. Supporting actors Kumud Mishra, Manoj Pahwa and Sayani Gupta give towering performance. Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub is credited as guest appearance but with limited screen time he leaves lasting impact. It's a shame his character and storyline was cut short.Background score is superb. Last but not the least, the casting director has handpicked each character nicely.In the end, this movie deserves to be screened everywhere all around the country. I am enjoying the reviews by trolls who are triggered and claiming this 'work of fiction' a Propaganda.",

This movie reveals how mature Indian censorship has become and how mature the film making has become.\nI always wished to watch such a movie. No overacting no fake stories. truly Based on facts and shows some real tiring home work. the direction, acting and storyline are all falling in place perfectly.

Ayushman Khuranna is an IPS officer who gets his first posting in the village of Lalgaon,UP. Only a couple of days before the date of joining, a gangrape followed by murder takes place where the two vicitms turn out to be of the lower caste. The film majorly highlights the plight of the lower caste people who live in villages like Lalgaon, where they face a prejudice by not only the upper caste but by the state institutions also.Anubhav Sinha has created a masterpiece, the film gives a feeling of a documentary and it feels nothing like a conventional Bollywood film based out of a small village of UP. Strangely, the film has no song nor does it have any dance sequence( which is a good thing). The film has used good humour which is evident from the fact that the viewers can be seen giggling at caste based jokes which goes on to show that the director has pulled the humour part beautifully without hurting the sentiments of the general public. In my opinion, Ayushman deserves a national award for this film since he has played his part beautifully. Thus, the viewers can expect themselves to be glued to their seats for the most part and can also expect a nail biting end.",

It faithfully conveys a huge issue in our country in the best way possible.Anubhav Sinha was a director who I didn't consider great after viewing Ra.One. Upon hearing how good Mulk was, it seemed the director was on his resurgence. After watching Article 15, there is no doubt that he's back in full form. Sinha's direction is nothing but outstanding. He had a clear vision on how this film needed to be created. The screenplay written by Anubhav Sinha and Gaurav Solanki has many powerful dialogues all of which bring a sense of urgency to the relevant topic.Ayushmann Khurrana provides his best performance yet and continues his trend of choosing unconventional scripts. His character represents the many people who are oblivious to what's happening and realising how messed up the system actually is. Kumud Mishra and Manoj Pahwa are also excellent in their roles.The cinematography by Ewan Mulligan really stood out to me. The constant use of darkness and dark colours presented such a disturbing and intense atmosphere that felt very fitting to the tone of the movie. The cinematography in this film is one of the best this year. The editing was surprising terrific. At no point did I feel the film was slowing down. The pacing was constant and well structured which aided the overall theme of the film.Article 15 is one of the best films to come out this year. Not just because of how it perfectly presents all the relevant issues relating to the Caste System but also by how well made it is.There are scenes in the movie which can be very difficult to watch but those scenes show how reality is. The sooner we realise how big of a problem it is, the faster a change can be made. Article 15 is a definite must watch.",

The former will tell this movie as a stupid and pointless as they are given dark shade in the movie while the others will rate the movie accordingly to its subjects like Serious Theme, Social Discrimination, Oppression on Minorities and excessive Cast Discrimination still prevailing in villages and rural areas of the country. Many will tell that this all has stopped in today's 'Modern Time' and is true at a level but as I said 'villages and rural areas' have still people will declined and narrow mentality which doesn't believe to follow rules return in a book ( The Constitution of India) because it doesn't allow them to exploit minors but gives 'right to equality'.The movie focuses on a rape case of a minor (Dalit) who isn't reported just because she is a minor. Those who think that its just a made-up story to stereotype Upper Caste are absolutely wrong. It isn't only one case, there are about thousands of such case which aren't even reported just because the victim is a minor.The movie doesn't stereotype any particular Caste but those who thinks they are superior of everyone else, those who do what they want, those who disregard The Constitution of India which says 'We are Indians FIRST and LAST' and those who doesn't agree to this, check yourself you are one of type I just mentioned.Jai Hind!!!",

Brilliant performances from the ensemble back the writing by Anubhav Sinha (who's directing) and Gaurav Solanki.

That kills the entire plot because it's obvious a criminal will try to cover up.\n2. Max dialogues & scenes are about casteism but none gives any speech about the major uncomfortable minor rape by mid-aged grown up adults.\n3. Ayushman every now & then talks about casteism & indifference but roams the entire village in top class suits!!\n4. Casteism & indifference is spoken about but nothing the undeveloped conditions of the poor after 70 years of independence! It's not the caste but the living standards which make differences but he speaks nothing about it.\n5. The SC ST rebels - don't know what they do. They're not searching for the poor girl nor about the rape cases. They're just against a rally. Imagine! And they are shown heroes!\n6. Unnecessary characters, zero impact, average dialogues & very bad direction.\nPlease don't focus on casteism but development. This movie is misleading on so many levels!!",

Especially the bond between the inspector and his little maid, the film portrayed brotherly feelings of the protagonist through that relationship and even though that's rare in the real world, it sparkled the movie with a topping of sweetness.

Hopefully, however, there will be enough who watch it and who will be moved to start making a difference.If anything this film explains why India, which makes more vaccines each year than the rest of the World combined, had such a shambolic COVID vaccine purchasing, manufacturing, and roll-out - simply because 70% of India simply \"do not matter\", \"do not register\" to so many of the remaining 30%.In the first 10 minutes alone of the film, there are at least 20 strong and subtle points made by the film about current day India, and the film continues in this vein in a relentless fashion whilst at all times presenting a gripping thriller at the same time.Every single moment of this film is powerful - the solving of a mere burst pipe problem outside the Police station is absolutely harrowing in its own right.This film is a masterpiece of the highest order and should have won every single top accolade on every single continent in every country.As a native of France who has extensively visited 4 continents and lived in two (Europe and Africa), and who has watched many Indian films before this one, I can say without hesitation that this film is also relevant to South & Central America, and Africa.Again, a stirring, emotional, at times brutal, but in the end hopeful, masterpiece.I will re-watch it many times.Bravo !",

What we know is our urban, sophisticated and privileged life, and what we don't want to know about is the discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, profession in the rural and semi rural India, because we aren't involved and thus don't care. We close our eyes to the stark reality not too far away from us.- honour killing, child molestation, murders, poverty, atrocities, exploitation, etc., because we aren't partaking in these social evils, but do absolutely nothing about voicing concerns at the very least.Based on a series of shocking but true incidents, Article 15 is about 2 teenage girls being killed and hanged from a tree simply to showcase the strength of the powerful and politically well connected, to put them in their right place and to send out a strong message to the rest. Sadly, the police is complicit. Ayan Ranjan (Ayushman Khurana) is the new age additional commissioner who vows to bring the criminals to justice and doesn't fear trampling on the feet of the powerful politicians and other office bearers. Director Anubhav Sinha keeps the narrative taut and grim, stays focused and doesn't allow the treatment of discrimination to become preachy. Article 15 is a watershed film that shakes you up from your stupor and comfort zone - it questions why we must worship only those who lose their lives defending the borders, but don't bat an eyelid at the deaths of the sewage workers who choke on poisonous gases while cleaning our faeces. It is hard hitting, but doesn't go over the top. Ayushman Khurana is impressive as the upright officer, having underplayed the role to the point of reality. He isn't Bajirao Singham or Sooryavanshi, or for that matter even a hero, he is what you expect a police officer to be. Kumud Mishra, Manoj Pahwa, Sayani Gupta and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub are rock solid and real too. The background score by Mangesh Dhakde and cinematography by Ewan Mulligan underscore the excellence of the film. Article 15 is a thought provoking, introspective and immersive Eye opener that a Indians must watch.",

The only thing which a film should match is the technicality, which is does, rest all is subjective. It is not an action movie. This is the ground reality check, things which still happens and has been happening since days, years, decades, centuries.. Based upon the caste system, the hierarchy of the vernas from top to bottom. The top being the high caste people and bottom being the lower castes.There has been a discrimination, and not just that but Brutal form of injustice in the background, and people are kept away from the truth, but some incidences are so loud that they are heard everywhere, but others are been suppressed and manipulated, and this movie brings that manipulation into light. The real things like Rapes of lower caste women / girls, Atrocities, severe discrimination, Harassments, keeping them deprived of the basic rights and amenities, not letting them in the house because they are lower caste people and naming them as dirty animals, not letting them into temples, not letting them have public water, not taking their cases, Poisoning their wells, mass killing, rejecting their FIRs, reports, requests of any sort, killing the couple if they are different castes, and they rape the girl which is done by their own family men, and kill in the name of upper caste honor, dalit women are still being harassed and raped on daily basis and they are labeled as prostitutes, following that the police too doesn't care to take their cases. And many such things happen which will take days to speak about.This is not an old fact, this happens today, in may places, mostly rural india. So this film just brings light to that reality, an its harsh to some people who are top on the hierarchy list, hard to digest. Not a regular action drama spicy bollywood movie but a twister and shocker. Worth watching indeed.",

            "content": "While watching the film, I had completely forgotten about pointing out the flaws. But by the time the film ended, I realised there was just one flaw and that was regarding............. Costume. That's how good the film is. Right from the beginning, you sense an extremely controversial yet impactful plot based on true incidents. Credits to one fine piece of direction, the justified 2 hour long film was successful in avoiding any indirect offensive attacks towards any particular person, group or race. However, that is debatable as it highly depends on how you want to take it.However, the film is very unlikely to be as good if it wasn't for Ayushman Khurana. Acting in a police role for probably the first time, the young man just nailed it with a magnificent performance supported by crisp dialogue writing. As for support cast, it was highly disappointing to see such a short role of Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub. Yet, I cannot disagree upon the fact that everyone's roles and their screentime were justified for the sake of plot; and that, the \"no star factor\" and no romanticism definitely ended up enriching the film even further. However, that definitely doesn't mean the characters lacked chemistry (especially Ayushman Khurana & Isha Talwar) but at the same time, they weren't over exaggerated as you'd expect usually from Bollywood.Coming to the technical points, the colorgrading of the film was neatly chosen and done. The brownish color and practical cinematography played a huge factor in setting up tone of the film as well as capturing the essence of Uttar Pradesh. Background scoring too was done intelligently and the decision to not keep a single song in the film was undoubtedly a brave one. And for all these, the perfect editing can't be ignored.An impactful and eye-opening plot which takes you to a journey of tolerance, discrimination, acceptance, corruption, hopelessness, faithfulness, obviousness, optimism & all, \"Article 15\" is definitely a must-watch. But at the end I have to agree that this film might not be one from Shah Rukh Khan or one from Mrinal Sen, yet, it's so unique & powerful on its own.",

The story and character development lack depth and despite some scenes that try to show the brutal reality of cast based discrimination with exceptionally blunt honesty, the whole effort falls far below the hypothetical benchmark.To begin with, the story and screenplay themselves are shallow. Elements are introduced abruptly and are mistreated by some ordinary writing and flaccid dialogue. The plot appears to have been underdeveloped but tries to pass off as wholesome through visual props.Moving on, the character development is next to non-existent. The director does try, he cannot be wronged for that. But sadly he fails. The audience is left pondering over the antecedents of each character. Each character, at the end, turns out to be a stereotype, some ironically defined only by their cast. The director thus falls prey to the same disease that he intends to eradicate. Replacing individuals by communities.The actors have not a bad job though. Although one has now become accustomed to seeing some supporting actors reprising similar rolls and with a similar lingo. But the weak screenplay really corrodes the performances. \" Get the f-word out of here!!! \" is the lead character's punch line in a couple of scenes , showing the poor literary skills of the writer.There is no doubt the film could have been produced better but to do that the directorial and writing team would have had to change.",

What was interesting to note is that the actual Article 15 of the Indian Constitution is being ignored by individual local police forces. Whether this is true or not I have no way of finding out since I don't live in India. Still, it seems plausible. Upper class, lower class...a recent article I'd read showed how all the contestants of a Miss India beauty contest were milk white, like they'd been born and bred in Iowa. I guess there is a racial divide in India and I'm glad films like \"Article 15\" are there to expose it.",

The way they found the third girl is like, we had enough of searching, I know where is she.\nIt seems like there is a centre theam or a point in the story but there is none. Is it a detective kind of movie? Is it like I know who did this but we just some how have to prove it kind of film? Or we will end this cast system and bring justice to the girls movie? I don't know?\nThe difference between Ayushman khurana's acting of previous movies and this one is, just the mustach. He is a typical Dilli ke Punjabi baag ka launda, which he played in Vicky diner and all his previous films. And in this one is will. Stop calling him versatile actor.

It is inspired by the true incident of Badaun Gangrape Case which happened in 2014 in Uttar Pradesh. Ayushmann Khurrana in his role of Ayan Ranjan as an IPS Officer is just phenomenal. His presence is just superb. Supporting actors like Kumud Mishra, Manoj Pahwa, Isha Talwar, Sayani Gupta did an excellent job. But, I personally feel Special Appearance of Mohd. Zeeshan Ayyub as Nishad is very impactful.Anubhav Sinha Sir clearly showed that how in today's era also people in Village areas still believe in caste and discriminate on the basis of that. They are not allowed to drink water from glass in front of a Brahaman or enter into temples, and if they do they are beaten up badly. From Direction to Story to Dialogue delivery to location of village is just excellent. Some of the scenes in the movie will give you goosebumps and make you feel bad for them.It is a movie with a very strong message for those who still believe in Caste Discrimination. It is well said in the movie \"FARQ BAHUT KAL LIYA, AB FARQ LAAYENGE\"",

This was hard-hitting and the ominous atmosphere set up in the cinematography, has been very interesting. The acting has been pretty great. Ayushmann was great, of course, but the supporting cast was also really good in their roles. They built up the story in a wonderful way and it made my skin crawl. It is very difficult to stomach these kinds of stories but I also believe these movies must be seen to make any kind of impact on society, so we can come together and reduce the crime rate in our cities.

As soon as he assumes his duty there, raw events hit him hard when he is informed 3 teenage girls from dalit (backward) community are missing. Soon enough two of the girls are found hanging in a tree. Except of the two fathers, everybody including the capable police force are convinced it is a honor killing (when the family murders a girl or a boy when they get attached to another one from a different caste or community).But a relatively brave and outspoken local girl Gaura (Sayani Gupta) and activities of a sub-inspector Jatav (Kumud Mishra) raises his doubts and he is hell bent to investigate the case and to find the 3rd missing girl. Though senior inspector of his police post Bramhdutt Singh (Manoj Pahwa) leaves no stones unturned to convince him \"In logo ke saath aisa hi hota hai, ye log kuch din baad aapne aap wapas aa jate hai (such kind of events always happens with this type of people, and they themselves usually come back after some days)\".Actions and events after that, when Ayaan tries to go deep in the case opens up surprises one by one. Political pressure, squeezing from upper castes of the society, helplessness due to poverty, corruption in police force upto the high government level - everything hits Ayaan hard. When he gets fragile and shaky, he receives timely assistance from Aditi (Isha Talwar) - his admirer, enabler, critic, strength and love interest.The film opens up shocking facts and events time passes in the 2nd half. The tough influence and strength of casteism over indian people makes you wonder why it was there at the first place and till when it will termite the society. The meager state of village people hits you hard. The corruption of the keepers of law-and-order makes you feel helpless. The state of local maosists and naxals compels you to ask who made them, where did they come from?Article 15 is the commandment in Indian Constitution where it states every citizen in this country is equal irrespective of \"anything\".\nArticle 15 is the movie that shows this article in the constitution is just some black words written on a white paper, nothing else.Very powerful and matured performance by Ayushmann. Aptly supported by everybody else in the cast. Exciting time in indian cinema when so called low budget actors are making such brilliant movies.

The treatment can be described as misfired. The real incident was completely different- wish that was shown more honestly.The Movie- \"Article 15\" is testament of selective criticism. I won't go on to call it propaganda, primarily because, the concern raised, if not addressed- in the movie as serious, genuine and very important for the change to come in our society. In that sense, the film was pretty good- but just like most such films, the makers digressed from the main theme- to appease their specific audience base.\nAnubhav Sinha is a known propagandist, for- his movies to leave a mark on matters of rape and suppression must be seen as a very positive move towards good film making. Ayushmann Khurrana has done a great job, yet again, carrying the film despite being amidst such talented cast who must be commendedHaving said everything, let us also accept that vilifying some people fiercely is not the way to go, the nation, the society is trying to change- as we speak- change is much more complicated than see things as either black or white. Not everyone in the advantageous group is an absolute villain- to alienate them all with generic vilification is not healthy.

Yet we know that in the dark underbelly of the Indian hinterland, atrocities on the lower caste is all pervasive and repugnant. It's a truth that affects our sensibilities but spares our souls; we turn our eyes away; newspapers are quick to hide it in page seven.

Ranjan is your typical anglophile; educated abroad, a rich civil servant and a rank outsider in the grime of Lalgaon looking almost inappropriate in his tie, cardigan and jacket. Yet he is unafraid to dive headlong into the filth of social order that subjugates the village; the metaphor of Ayan along with police walking the mucky swamps searching for the missing girl as their torches fail to penetrate the miasma or the noxious scene of a man cleaning the sewer by diving time and again into the putrescence is not lost on the audience.\nAyan does not set out to be a messiah; his delectable exchanges of messages on phone with his wife miles away initially makes him seem recalcitrant. Yet the shocking sight of two minor Dalit (lower caste) girls hanging on a tree changes his attitude and life forever.\nHis crusade to find the third missing girl, unpeels the layered and complex topography of caste abuse and social politics; where rape is covered up as honour killing; where it is perfectly natural to put a lower menial labourer in her place if they so dare to ask for a three rupee increase in wages and where CBI is galvanised into action when Ayan raises uncomfortable questions and threatens the sang-froid of the unhealthy caste mosaic of Lalgaon.\nIt is indeed ironical that the upper caste openly refuses to consume food prepared by a lower caste and otherwise uphold imperial examples of \"untouchability\". Yet the very same exalted species do not allow these principles to interfere with their abject and wanton crimes like rape or flogging the latter.\nArticle 15 will come hard at you; Anubhav Sinha and the cast keep you hooked on a taught leash of foreboding. The images are disturbing but never over the top. Despite, the context and perhaps the temptation, the director eschews grating imagery of gore or violence. There are moments of humour too, deftly thrown in.\nAyushman is wonderfully supported by Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, Siyani Gupta and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub in a short but powerful role as the \"Robinhood of the Dalits\" and Siyani's love interest.\nA solution to caste oppression eludes us despite sixty-nine years of having our own constitution. In a poignant scene between Ayyub and Ayushman, the latter exhorts him to avoid rebellion and work within the precincts of the constitution. He reminds Ayyub of Dr Ambedkar a great champion of the Dalit movement and the principle architect of our constitution. Ayyub replies, 'Yes and the same man also said that if the constitution is not followed, it must be torn up and burnt.'\nArticle 15 is not preachy; the movie simmers and seethes but never boils over with the rebellion of discontent against the oppression. And that's exactly the message; we need to do something quickly before the conflagration becomes a wildfire. It will then incinerate the politicians and the very petty vote bank politics that they were trying to protect.\nA must watch.",

            "content": "Article 15 hits you hard with its unabashed, sucker punching, intense portrayal of Indian society.Score: 8/10Direction: the story telling style seems to be adopted from Bong Joon-ho classic, Memories of Murder, which itself elevates the treat in suspense, cutting through many social causes along the way. There are 2-3 scenes of slightly less than subtle humour, which give you just enough to bring you back to the seat slightly more than the edge you were about to fall off. the ending was a well crafted, symbolic, satirical and lighter.Final Scene: After the stressful work that leads to the finding of the body, when everyone's too hungry they just have the food on the street side without bothering the caste. And when the lead asks the caste of the old lady who cooked, everyone turns around to see her reply but it gets drowned under the honking of the truck shot from an angle, which sarcastically shows \"Mera Bharath Mahaan\" at the back of the truck.Writing, plot: Dialogues are sharp, bold and relevant. Story may be about delivering the same old plot-line, but in a refreshing, interesting, thrilling package: the govt trying to stop the idealists, the border line suspects turning out to be the real evils, and the revolutionaries disguised as the threats to the society.Cinematography and Music: Ewan Mulligan is for Anubhav, what Jeff Croneweth became for David Fincher. though obviously not at the same levels of craft. With the dark visuals, using a lot of light, fog and blue hue to give the undertone of \"night\" and the lack of clarity, suits perfectly to depict the nightmare the lead goes through.I loved how it starts with one of my favorites from Bob Dylan:How many roads must a man walk downBefore you call him a man?The song goes well with the how the film starts: how the lead is not too motivated about getting it resolved but more about the process. But in his subconscious efforts to prove his lady-love and become the \"hero\" (as she speaks about in one of their conversations) and his emotional setback, his motivation builds up to do the right thing, swimming against the tides.I don't know how many times we would have a film, that gets so many things right together, last in my mind is Masaan, if I cut some slack then even Sairat.",

            "content": "Casteism is the deadliest bane of our indian society. And we must eradicate it. This is the very relevant message from the film.\nAs a film it works well to an extent. Could have been more gripping. The movie is not a straight documentary nad nor a thriller. Difficult to meet the balance.\nThe mood is gritty and glommy. Lots of fogs in the cinematography. Either morning fogs or evening. Slightly grey and bluish hard and dusty scenes. One common scene in reality has people gasping, that's of a cleaner going down in the drain of scums through a manhole and reappearing. The dramatic music enhances the eerie feelings.\nSome dialogues are incisive and shakes your beliefs and many things which took it for granted in life.\nThe scenario js based on few real life incidents of recent times which shook the moral fibre of the whole country. But did we take any decisive action after that? That's where we have to shake our incumbency and move forward. Society should be the same for every body.\nToo many layers were introduced very fast and none were properly explored to give you a rounded picture. May be it's not possible logically. But I felt that we werr just given a glimpse only of the real drama of society. The Nishad angle, lowest castes, Bhim sena, mainline politics intertwining with the underworld of underprivileged and untouchables, also the mix of mainline media and booming social media etc.\nMany of us haven't been to the rural settings of UP-Bihar-MP-Odisa-AP-Maharshtra belt and lived a city life. Which has it's own different sets of existential issues. But in that belt, the additional casteist rules just blow you away.\nEven the shadows of a lower caste can't fall upon the higher one, forget about food and touching. And each of the castes have their own hierarchies among themselves.\nThe film explores the impact of these whole conundrum upon a newly appointed IPS officer, with a multinational background and how he tries to trigger a casteless justice against the traditional heavy handed machinery of the socio-political juggernaut of the erstwhile stakeholders, but staying within the justice system. Initially he gets a shock ,but he recovers fast and stays one step ahead with his modern ideas. He has this strong humane approach which helps him reaching out to his subordinates.\nTwo teenagers were found abducted and hung on the trees after his arrival to a north indian rural police station and the third one is still missing.\nHe talks with his human-rights activist girlfriend and swings into action. His pro-higher caste assistant tries to scuttle the probe but ultimately he uses both diplomacy and hard nosed action to defeat the local political undercurrent and bring the underground lower caste leaders as his allies to give justice. He listens to the grievances of he poor and lower caste and they start believing in him.\nThere are nuanced jokes like discussing castes while eating together. They hit home.\nAyushman khurrana does well as the titular character but has less of physicality in his acting, which probably is less suitable for the role. He does embody the role of a western educated slightly nerdy, reader of The discovery of India, perfectly. His girlfriend's character seemed a bit imposed upon, and looks too much of a fancy dressed theoretical facebook warrior type character. Only at the end, when disclosing a deep secret to the teenage helper girl, she provides a required presence. Otherwise her role is used as a Person talking to him/herself, as seen in the yesteryear's Folk-theatre/Jatrapala, as in Vivek/Soul.\nSayani gupta with her large deep eyes which says a lot without talking much ,leaves an impression. She is strong and educated to an extent, but has her priorities right.\nThe bubbly young girl who cooks for the new Upper officer of Police , was charming and natural. Stands for the pure heart.\nZeeshan is always a strong and reliable performer. Suits the role of an educated resistance leader.\nPolice subordinates were done perfectly.\nI was impressed by the actor in the role of the local political leader, Anshu. Reminded of the great Raghuvaran in the film Shiva of 1990. Same nonchalance and ice cool languid physical presence.\nHere is no single villain in the film. It's the criminalization of the society in the name of caste, political gains and taking all these inhuman attitudes as part of the same game of keeping balance, which is shocking. We must get out of these collective apathy.\nAs I said, this is a good movie. Not a great movie. But stirs our essence of the soul and in 2019, we should do something about it.",

You really need to have balls to make films like Mulk and Article 15 one after another in a country like ours.Films excels in each and every department, be it the superlative performances of actors, cinematography, background score, although at one point you feel like there is no progression in the story but that goes away and last 20 minutes are probably best i have seen in a really long time in any movie including \"The End Game\"",

The name suggests a huge legal, bureaucratic and social battle about Article 15 of the Indian Constitution. That is not so. A better title would have been 'Santulan' (meaning Balance), a word used by the deputy cop Brahmadutt Singh in the movie, or 'Asantulan' (meaning Imbalance).There are some weak scenes in the narration. The impact of the narration was somewhat weakened due to that --First, the policemen wade in the swamp to search for the third girl. The camera shows that they actually do wade in the swamp. But, when they emerge from it, their trousers are not mucked up or wet.Second, Ayushmann Khurrana, as their leader and head policeman, asserts that he too will wade in the swamp and help in the search. This surprises and awes his team of juniors. But, the camera does not really show him in the swamp or his pants getting dirty. Only a verbal immersion, obviously.Third, there is a scene when a sanitation worker dives underwater in an overflowing manhole (for a sewer drain). He is totally devoid of protective face mask or clothing - incidentally this a much talked about, lethal and caste-based occupational hazard in India. This worker emerges from the man-hole with very little of the muck that is supposed to be clogging and overflowing the drain. A chance to make the whole sequence subtly more telling was missed.Fourth, in the last scene, the police party is tired and rests in the dirt at the side of a deserted road, in the middle of nowhere. And, there is this old lady selling basic cooked food (dry potato vegetable rolled in rotis), and she apparently has enough for all the policemen. This seems implausible is rural India, on a deserted road, in the middle of nowhere.The opening lead-and-chorus folk song was quite good.There were several scenes in the morning mist, which were beautifully captured.Overall, the story has been narrated well.",

A must watch.Article 15 kinda movies has proved that Indian cinema is not only about masala films they can can take any subject and make it into masterpiece.",

I am no big fan of Bollywood casting directors as every time and all the time they have to portray a cop they choose perfect looking actors which puts me off because someone like Manoj Bajpayee could have played this character better. However, Ayushman has tried his best to do the justice to the character and have excelled in acting from his initial days. All the other actors have done justice to the characters they are portraying and its because of them this movie is able to deliver what it wants to deliver. Isha Talwar the female lead doesn't have much screen timing and feels useless most of the times and is there in the movie just to put a tick on the check box of orthodox Bollywood producers. Sayani Gupta has been the pick of the actors and have performed convincingly. Sayani stellar performances might go unnoticed and unpraised, but she is an amazing actor and always pulls off difficult roles with ease.PlotThe plot is not entirely quintessential of Bollywood movies, but better editing would have put cheery on the cake. The writers at the core wants to highlight the caste system in India and the issues different castes faces, however writers ended up highlighting issues in judiciary and bureaucracy. As a viewer I felt the depth at which caste system is covered in the movie is not enough. The movie is entertaining for average audience who are not looking to take home any social message from the movie. Many threads are not closed and, in the end, I felt like what happened to that doctor- how can she be still alive, how come the entire CBI team was corrupt, etc. The story line is very flat, it starts from one line of thought and end at the same line of though, as compared to similar movies, which would keep the audience on their toes by allowing good guys and bad guys winning almost equal times. In the end, I would say this was still one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in the recent times.",

            "review_title": "Best Bollywood Flim of 2019 !",
            "content": "Article 15 - ReviewThe flim's title refers to the Article 15 of Indian Constitution which clearly states that the State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them.However , we all know even today in India , caste remains a enduring marker of indentity & singular cause of violation . Director Anubhav Misra brings us this disturbing truth of rural India based on true events of the horrific Badaun case from 2014 .The flim starts with newly posted IPS officer Ayan , played by Ayushmann Khurrana , coming to take charge to a small town named Lalgaon , Uttar Pradesh. Ayan represents the charecter of an educated , urban , proud Indian , unaware of real issues of India . Two teenage Dalit girls who were gang-raped and murdered, their bodies hung from a tree, just because they asked for three rupees of more in daily wage . The film places Ayan in charge of the investigation which is considered as honour killing by the police to shut the case as soon as possible . Ayan goes deep in the case which in turn leads to the real truth , righteous anger about caste atrocities, and self reflection on who he really is and what he stands for.The film is restless when it comes to disturb the viewer as the director and cinematographer has done some excellent field job & research . The flim keeps it's pace as the director cuts the unnecessary songs or love interests unlike other bollywood dramas. Filmed in uncomfortable close ups , tension is built through slow building background score, and the search for a third girl who's missing but who might still be alive is all consuming.Ayushmaan has proven himself how good is he in choosing scripts , as his last two films were among the best five of last year. This time yet again Ayushmaan lives up to the height . The director wins half the battle by casting little-known actors with real faces who look and act like people you would meet in an upcountry village. Ayushmann Khurrana underplays his part to great effect, enhancing the intensity of the character. Article 15 also benefits from highly effective performances from a supporting cast that includes proven quantities like Nassar, Kumud Mishra, Sayani Gupta and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub.Article 15 is an important addition to a very small number of Hindi films that have successfully tackled weighty social issues through the means of a more popular idiom and it's not to be missed .",

            "content": "This is a must watch for every Indian out there. The way it brings to light the biggest and most widespread fault line in our country, is unprecedented till date in Indian movie industry. The division of Indian society into thousands of castes, sub-castes, hierarchies and the effect of this system onto the people who come at the lowest rung of it, has been most effectively portrayed with events that are extremely real and also resemble a lot of recent crimes against Dalits.The movie shows how trivialized the crimes against Dalits are because they are routinely treated worse than animals and any crime against them is thus ignored by the larger society. The indifference, prejudice and more often than not, the involvement of police in these crimes has been laid out bare and the phenomenon that a lot of well-to-do Dalits themselves have an apathy for the extremely marginalized Dalits has been shown very effectively. The movie shows how one of the lead police man treats stray dogs better than fellow human beings, how the upper caste influential people in politics try to shut down the case, and how some Brahmins who themselves propagate the caste system are now resorting to fooling Dalits in the name of Hinduism for political gains. Overall, this movie is a social masterpiece and a must-watch for every self-aware Indian out there. It's a wake-up call to see and rectify the practices that we in 21st century India still carry on with us.",

            "content": "This movie has good cinematography. A lot of the shots and angles used in the movie for dramatic effect look pleasing and add to the intensity of the moment. Aside from some decent to good acting performances this is really all the movie has going for it. The story was just hard to follow due to the lack of a sense of continuity from scene to scene. It was hard to keep track of characters who didn't get much of an introduction. It felt disjointed and poorly explained at times. Maybe the source material it was copied from was too confusing for the writers of this movie?Ayushmann gives a decent performance, but there's not exactly much for him to work with as his character is dull and lacking in complexity. He barely showcases any personality aside from when he occasionally snaps and gets angry. His relationship with his wife doesn't get any development either. The supporting characters aren't interesting.The most jarring thing about the movie, strangely enough, is a particular music track which is played on literal repeat throughout the movie. Once you notice it, it completely spoils the experience as it sticks out like a sore thumb. The rest of the BGM feels out of place. Thankfully there weren't any song-and-dance numbers, though.In the end, just another Bollywood movie that felt like a missed opportunity to be a great thriller. There were no thrills at all in this movie. In fact, for much of the movie, there is a suspenseful build up with no pay off at all. And this happens over and over again leaving the viewer deeply frustrated and even annoyed.",

And he is going to be shocked by the surprises that come his way for some viewers it may be unusual and disturbing. i cant promise that this film will be entertaining.

The movie is too gripping & never misses a beat. It shows how Indian secularism works in rural areas. We the people living in urban areas think we have progressed & here we are living in 2019 still living in 1600 A.D. The way such casteism is potrayed hits you hard and never once it goes wayward.

You, Aumlan, are guilty of it.\nMr. Anubhav Sinha - you are guilty of the same crime.\nArticle 15 is such an exceptional film. It is phenomenally made film - especially from the technical perspective, notably the cinematography & the art direction. Sadly, the technical finesse is wasted.\nThe last 45 minutes of the film give it all away. Article 15 is fundamentally, a vehicle for Anubhav Sinha's ideology, and while it is no crime to colour your film with your ideological bias, it is certainly culpable to smear what could have been a brilliant film with your expressions of bias towards a particular ideology. What could have been a fabulous film, turns out to be a downright dishonest, if technically well-made film.\nPros : Acting (esp Ayushman Khurrana, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, Sayani Gupta & Mohd.

Ayushmann had slightly lesser scope than he usually has in most of his movies. But he still delivered quite well for what the role required. The power of the movie is in attempting to bring out all sides of the problem, from different perspectives, which can boost the proper awareness.Weaknesses: Some events were a bit abrupt (especially in the beginning), some parts were little dragged (towards the end), less time was committed to develop some of the important characters and relationships. Last, but most important, there were several junctures to choose between cinematic value versus commercial popularity/success, where the later was chosen!

            "review_title": "Less is more! Or less...",
            "content": "Article 15 - less is more!\nThere were a couple of surprising things about Article 15 that I really appreciated. One it showed the main protagonist (Ayan, played by Ayushmann Khurana) as someone who is not necessarily interested in being a hero but is drawn into a fight because of the outrageousness of the criminal injustice he encounters in small town India. If you know Bollywood movies you know that is unusual - typically the protagonist in such a tale is shown giving lectures about how righteous he is from the get go. Tell, don't show -- is the way it goes and the movie is typically unwatchable. Not here.The second is that the film takes on the subject of caste head on. What a completely stale subject to stake a whole Bollywood production on! And that too with someone like Ayushmann who's been riding a winning streak of hits. Why risk all that? But, for reasons also alluded to in the film, I am glad Anubhav Sinha took this on and made the film. I did not know this going in, but I believe the film is inspired by the 2014 heinous gang rape and murder case in Badaun. If so there is never a mention of it.Article 15 is a dark and chilling tale of the sub-human treatment of those deemed to be \"low caste\" in small town or rural India. Not only are they treated worse than animals, they reside at the very bottom of the economic ladder and justice has no meaning in their lives. A simple request for an increase in wages can have dire consequences; two minor girls brutally raped and murdered for just such a request and are left hanging from a tree as a \"lesson\" to the rest of their tribe. The criminals powerful, upper-caste men expect to go scot free and do. That is until Ayan the police inspector - Anubhav Sinha's hero - shows up. The rest is a tale of justice sought and found.While the movie is well-played with a satisfying end (who doesn't love a good tale of justice delivered?), it missed being a powerful film that stays with you for days. In your face symbolism such as the playing of \"vande mataram...\" when Ayan realizes he is in the fight for good was unnecessary and annoying. Secondly, Ayan's journey while set up perfectly never quite raise the stakes sufficiently. He is shown to be an upper class (and upper caste), urban kid who is blind to the reality and rigors of caste. He is not only ignorant of the intricacies of it, he can hardly believe how rampant and deeply entrenched it is in the village he is in charge of. \"Wild wild west...\" - an allusion that would be lost to practically all of small town India - is how he describes it. This is how most of India lives but this is news to him. It all ends in a \"happy\" end with Ayan carrying the missing third girl through the swamps. This perhaps scored drama points with the audience but left me asking for more. Perhaps also because in the very next scene Ayan is shown standing in his jeans that are clean and dry!A more bitter tale would have made the film more compelling. Such battles are won, if ever, in much more involved fights where the hero rarely emerges unscathed and heroic.But then perhaps it would not have delivered the hit Anubhav Sinha wanted which, is likely necessary to get the word out: Caste is still a thing, you know!",

And yeah l appriciate that dialogue \"political power is another caste standing in our society\" and they are taking lots of benefits from using their power\". Article 15 gives us power to raise your voice against it. And it is the badly needed movie in this time, Must must watch. lt depect the real issue of current time that faced by our society. Ayshman Rocks. The whole movie is Nepotism free & Isha talvar is also good. Kumud Misra again delivered powerfull performance \ud83d\udc95",
