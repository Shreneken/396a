Honestly I really don't know about him much more till watching this movie. After completing the movie I read lot about him. I really shocked he was a rank holder and quit this studies for cinema. And also I can't believe you attempted suicide. You was a fighter.. A true fighter.. and the way you end your story is very disappointing. I miss you Sushanth....",

            "content": "Chhichhore - Indian films have now come of age, they can give a message subtly without being preachy. Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.Don't miss Chhichhore, it's a fantastic mood lifter and easy on the mind, often drawing you into the proceedings.",

Sushanth is wonderful in his role, and the film also touches few social topics and leaves you with a message.\nThe dialogues and college episodes are just mindblowing and it brings you laughs.\nYou laugh so much that you no more care about the world.\nThe director runs the screenplay of the past and the present simultaneously which is really fresh on the film.\nThe sports episodes are also picturised in a clean way instead of adding a cinematic feel into it.\nBottomline- you can watch it a million times and will never be bored.",

We will be invited to reminisce into college days like 3 Idiots with different atmosphere and themes, but with almost the same impact. I know, the transition of flashback scene was not seamless. Sometimes, it seemed out of control. But believe me, it'll be still on the right track till the end. The performances of lead cast was also just okay, not that great. It was the supporting cast who looked stunning in this film. But overall, the chemistry between casts was excellent. Go for this one! You will regret if you missed watching this film at nearby cinema! Unfortunately, this one is limited in my country, Indonesia.",

            "content": "#FinalVerdictA film of impeccable pedigree, a breezy entertainer with its heart in the right place! Director Nitesh Tiwari is truly working at the height of his creative powers. Sterling!You expect the moon from this Fox Star Studios and Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment's production as far as the entertainment goes because it's Nitesh Tiwari's next release after Dangal. Let me make it clear right away. There are films & there are more films and then there's Chhichhore. It can be rightly termed as a slice of life film. Nitesh Tiwari understands the intricacies of human behaviour & strives to deftly integrate authentic characters & bona fide situations on celluloid. Technically too, the product is first-rate.The initial reels are full of light moments & keep the viewer in splits with witty one-liners. More than the story, it is the screenplay (Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta & Nikhil Mehrotra) that should be talked about. You will be high on nostalgia for sure!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dOne more thing! You cannot draw parallels with any other film, past or present, successful or unsuccessful. If masala means entertainment, amusement, hilarity, escapade, emotions and drama, yes, Chhichhore has it all. Only thing, it's treated differently!Every person behind the camera gives his/her best to the film. Amalendu Chaudhary's exquisite cinematography is another aspect that catches your attention. The feel of the film has been cut, compiled & presented with dexterity by editor Charu Shree Roy. Nimble-fingered!Pritam's music perfectly grows on you after you've watched the film. Sameer Uddin's background score uplifts the overall mood. Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics leave an impression. And the best is reserved for the last - Mukesh Chhabra's casting is spot on!Chhichhore boasts of an exuberant on-screen ensemble cast. As a matter of fact, it's an unusual mix of actors & they unequivocally shine collectively. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that's easily relatable. Sushant Singh Rajput is blessed with wonderful screen presence & gets the timing of his character right. Watch out for him in the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya. Shraddha Kapoor emotes with utmost conviction, proving her mettle as an actress of substance. Varun Sharma is superb in his comic timing. His appearance, mannerisms & dialogue delivery are exemplary. Tahir Raj Bhasin portrays the role with plentiful charm & magnetism. Naveen Polishetty is quite a scene-stealer on more occasions than one. Excellent!Prateik Babbar's registers a strong impact despite the small role. Tushar Pandey plays to the gallery & delivers a sparkling performance. Saharsh Kumar is in terrific form & portrays his role with precision. Chhichhore belongs to everyone. Copybook!On the whole, Chhichhore is brimming with solid content with a relevant message. Watch it for the spirit it is made in. Sometimes, we laugh at movies. At times, we laugh in movies. Chhichhore belongs to the latter type. Get ready to relive your college life!",

If you have lived in a hostel or you have spent a lot of great times with your friends, you can find moments to relate yourself. The movie also teaches us about our expectations from life and from those who are around us, especially the kids. It keeps us entertained and engaged throughout the runtime.\nDefinitely one of the best movies of the decade.\nGo watch it..",

This message has been conveyed in an engaging and enjoyable manner.Screenplay: This movie gives the nostalgic feel about college life. Screenplay does engage well in its first half. But got little slow in its second half, it's because the message should be effectively conveyed. However the message is effectively conveyed.Music: Background score by Pritam was good. But, out of 3 songs, 2 songs are good. Background music helped a lot to make us involved with the movie.Acting: It's definitely the best movie in the career of Sushant Singh Rajput and the best movie of Shraddha Kapoor after Aashiqui 2 and ek villain. Their acting is absolutely awesome and make us connect with the movie emotionally. Varun Sharma as usual made us laugh with his one liners. Prateik Babbar though underutilized, done his part well. Other casts have also performed well.Dialogues: The best part of the movie, which makes us emotional was its dialogues. Though old, the dialogues are awesome.Overall, a nostalgic film that can't be any better.*My Rating: 4.5/5*",

            "content": "CHHICHHORE REVIEW :-Who doesn't want to relive college and hostel life memories after settled life? Who doesn't want his kids to know thier funny and crazy stories? Everything which seems unusual to sophisticated society actually gives you immense happiness and that's what Chhichhore does right from the start till the End. It is a film that will entertain you, make you laugh, recall your old memories and at last gives you one small but a long lasting message.Chhichhore is a story of an united college group and of a separated group of same people after some years of College life. Aniruddh (Sushant Singh Rajput) and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor) reunite thier college group when his son is admitted in Hospital who needs to know thier college life to motivate him self. As decided, Sexa (Varun Sharma), Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin), Acid (Navin Polishetty), Mummy (Tushar Pandey) and Bevada (Saharsh Kumar) reunite and the Losers start telling the mad journey of thier hostel life. Their story takes you on a ride of non-stop entertainment where you meet some other characters too, where Raggie (Prateik Babbar) is one of the main character. Acting wise all the Characters are funny, emotional and realistic and everyone out there has done thier part with the sense. But college life characters are more impactful because variations there were more comparable to mid-life characters. In this roller coaster ride there are hardly any loo breaks and that's the biggest strength of Chhichhore. The screenplay is flawlessly written for the simple story but the fashion of storytelling is amazingly crafted. Music being one of the loo breaks, that might give you the Chance to leave your seats for a while but that's all, you don't get any other chance to take a nap. Dialogues are Hilarious, vulgar but have humour and local feel in it. Director Nitesh Tiwari does an excellent job with the script and the actors he had in hands. Handling such a sensitive subject with realistic manners, humorous comedy and balancing 2 generations and 2 situations at the same time keeping the quality intact, all these are done by 1 Man so accurately. Mr. Nitesh Tiwari you're officially a Big Thing In Bollywood now. The goodwill earned by Dangal will be carry forwarded by Chhichhore untill you come up with your next venture.Apart from entertainment, Chhihhore also focuses on an important issue like does we really have an option after failure. We all have plans set after victory but we never prepare for defeat and that might force you to take a big and horrible decision in your life. Whether it is Study, Sports or any competition in life you must have something planned for the defeat too. In a nutshell, Chhichhore is Hilarious Entertainment having emotions and heart at right place. If you wanna relive your college life and compare it with your later one then Chhichhore is a Must Watch for all 3 generations in your Family.RATING- 7/10*",

            "content": "This is the kind of feel-good, message-filled cinema that a vast majority of Indians have grown to love. It's cinema in its most easily digestible form - light-hearted, breezy, predictable, and filled with melodrama. When viewed as the second directorial attempt of Nitesh Tiwari, the man behind India's biggest blockbuster 'Dangal', one can only let out an impromptu sigh at the end of this 145-minute long affair.'Chhichhore', at best, feels like a rehashed '3 Idiots' with a bit of an expanded universe. Unfortunately, it lacks the charm of the latter even when it had much older actors playing the role of college teens. Here too, the lengthy flashback sequences come soaked in nostalgia. What works against the movie is that these fun-filled moments are intercut with the scenario of a young student who is in the hospital in a terrible physical and mental state after having attempted suicide. So, there's a constant switching on and off of emotions.While there is, of course, a novel idea hidden in there somewhere, it gets lost amid everything else that happens. Nitesh has already proven (with 'Dangal') that he can handle sports sequences well and he doesn't let the viewers down in that department, however predictable they turn out to be. It's surprising to me that the supporting cast (comprising of Varun Sharma, Naveen Polishetty, Tahir Raj Bhasin, and Saharsh Kumar Shukla) has done a much better job here than the lead duo (Sushant, who is usually pretty good, and Shraddha Kapoor, who is yet to impress me acting-wise) and it's their nuances that are comparatively more memorable.For what it is, 'Chhichhore' doesn't require its viewers to overwork their brains. In essence, it's the equivalent of eating Maggi noodles. It gives you instant energy, but not much beyond. If you can deal with a certain level of cringe-worthy clich\u00e9s, then 'Chhichhore' could very well up your alley. Looking at the 8+ rating, I realize that our audiences still buy into anything that offers a decent dose of nostalgia, even if it's not the most competently written/made.Verdict: Throwaway watch!",

            "content": "No...just no. This film has to be one of the most pathetic ripoffs of 3 Idiots that nevertheless fails to inherit any of the charm or grandeur of the original.The first sore thumb, among many, was the casting choice for the lead roles. I found the supporting cast adequate, but both Sushant Singh and Shraddha Kapoor were TERRIBLE picks for the lead.Sushant gave a somewhat tolerable performance as a college student but the moment he put on the terrible aged makeup to play his older self, I would brace myself for a lot of lifeless bland acting. I think this man was way out of his league for such a role. He is more fit as a teenage heartthrob with the dance moves and pecks rather than playing any character/role that requires some dramatic depth. But a more terrible offender of bad and even cringe-worthy acting was Shradhha Kapoor. Whenever she attempted to shed tears on screen, I would have to painfully restrain myself from bursting out into laughter. She was just so bad.And now, let's move onto the plot. Ideally, a good plot would have compensated for any of the bad acting to some degree. But sadly, the plot here felt an ever bigger joke than the dubious casting choices. The writer thought it was probably an excellent idea to mash 3 Idiots with Student Of The Year. And this does not pay off at all.Here's the main problem: The film tries to correlate a young boy's frustrations of not getting a good college admission rank with the frustrations of his father and friends when they tried to win a college sports competition to reclaim their hostel's glory on campus. There is an immediate disconnect between these two types of frustrations. The boy is genuinely worried about his future career and education, things we can all agree are paramount to establishing security in life. But his parents in their youth are worrying over a mere sports competition??? How can they be both the same. If I lost the latter, maybe I would be severely heartbroken but I know that would not leave an impact on my life's security. I find it even more ironic that the director of the film is an IIT alumnus and yet he stupendously fails in portraying this frustration today's youth face in trying to establish themselves in an over competitive third world nation.So , starting from the second act, the film completely devolves into Student of The Year territory without any tether to the actual struggles of college and academic life in India.If you really want to watch a film to stoke your nostalgia of college life, either go rewatch 3 idiots or simply go to Youtube and watch the excellent satire TVF Honest Campus Placements.",

            "content": "School and college days are probably the best moment of your life as it is filled with fun, vibrance, memories and adventures with your best friends even if you are penniless. Chichhore brings back those beautiful days and does it with aplomb.Chichhore tells the story of reunion of 7 losers a.k.a friends who meet after 20 years due to an unfortunate circumstance and how they relish the moments spent in their college days.Directed by NiteshTiwari, who co-directed Chillar Party, directed Bhoothnath Return and Aamir Khan starrer Dangal, Chichhore not only meets the expectations from the talented director but surpasses above and beyond it. There are innumerable hilarious moments and comic scenes which will bring down the house and even will remain with you after leaving the theater. Hats off to Nitesh Tiwari for giving us yet another unique taste of entertainment.Chichhore also succeeds in bringing back the charm of friendship whom you will definitely miss after watching the film. It does remind of Dil Chahta Hai, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, 3 Idiots and even Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara of the valuable time spent with our close friends. One important message from the film is that we always prepare ourselves for the success and never for the failure. May be we start looking into that aspect as well.Music by Pritam is passable while lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattarcharya is just about okay. Art direction is decent and so is the cinematography. Editing could have been better as the film takes too many turns to swap in between the past and the present scenes. Background score is good. Writing by Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta and Nikhil Mehrotra is superb while dialogues are brilliant.Performances wise, I loved Varun Sharma as Sexa. This will be his best performance after Fukrey. Sushant Singh Rajput was good and does well in transforming from an old guy into a college student. Shraddha Kapoor gets better with her role.\nTahir Bhasin shows confident as Derek, Navin Polishetty is brilliant as Acid and Tushar Pandey as Mummy is mind-blowing.Overall, Chichhore is a refreshing tale of young, wild and free college days. Go and watch it to bring those beautiful memories back. Awesome 4/5Ketan Gupta",

I was very disappointed when I started watching it because it was nothing like I thought it was. Still it was pretty good. The message the script gives is superb. All the college life scenes were pretty good but the present day scenes were not so good. The cast was okay but there was no breakthrough performance to mention. Nitish Tiwary's style didn't have any freshness as he did this in old school Bollywood style, which is not bad but not very good either. The climax is what I liked the most as it was a bit unpredictable. It is nothing like Dangal and I'm a but disappointed as this Nitesh Tiwary's movie after Dangal. Overall, Chhichore can be defined as a must watch because it can entertain everyone.",

            "content": "I was excited for this film purely because of Nitesh Tiwari. His previous film, Dangal, was one of my favourites of 2016 and I'm so happy to say that this movie was amazing.Chhichhore is the story of seven friends who reunite after a tragic incident and reminisce about their college life.Nitesh Tiwari tugs on our heartstrings as he creates the most heartwarming film of the year. What people will love the most is the constant nostalgia throughout the film. Audiences will laugh and cry as they remember their college life. How wonderful it may have been. The unforgettable friends they made there. All of that will be remembered whilst watching Chhichhore.That's not all. Each character has such a likability to them and their persona. Such characters seem so relatable as we have seen people like Anni, Maya, Sexa, Derek, Mummy, Acid and Bevda in our life. This relatability is what helps us connect more with our protagonists. What makes these characters come to life is the extraordinary performances of the cast and fun dialogue. Varun Sharma being the standout.The phenomenal writing and cinematography add to the experience. Each dialogue given to each character seems well suited and the gorgeous cinematography by Amalendu Chaudhary transports us to a college that takes you back to the past.Tiwari doesn't just cater to the adults but allows youngsters to learn a very special message regarding the pressure of getting good grades and how we shouldn't be disheartened if we fail.The only areas where the film may falter is the unrealistic situations met during the sporting events and the tacky makeup used to show balding. However, none of these flaws really bothered me as I believe the strengths overpower the weak points.Aside from that, this film's great. The idea of revisiting college and friends will put a huge smile on people's faces as well as learning an important lesson on the pressure of good grades which is sure to make people shed a tear or two. Chhichhore is a sweet, beautiful and emotional ride that deserves to be watched. I applaud Nitesh Tiwari's efforts in making this movie because it sure paid off.",

It is not easy to portray so many aspects of life in a 2 hours feature film. Hats off Nitesh Tiwari for pulling this off so so beautifully, and for embedding a very relevant message to every modern parent in this funny tale so seamlessly.The unconventional cast worked like wonder. Varun Sharma, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey, Saharsh Kumar Shukla - everybody is just excellent. Shraddha Kapoor didn't had much impact on the script, but still she is lovable in every scene she appears. And Sushant Singh Rajput! No praise is enough for him. Wonder why this superb actor don't get more chances in more big banners and movies.As a hostel dweller in my education days I could relate each and every act those foolish friends were enjoying.

I went to the big screen, popcorns on one side, drinks on the other, kids cajoled and silenced with their own choicest snacks, I sunk in to my seat.The movie starts slow and suddenly slips in to tragedy as a young boy traumatized at not getting in to IIT, jumps from a building. His parents, completely taken in by this misfortune are in tatters, inconsolable and beyond grief. Sadness and guilt writ on their face, an unlikely start for a comedy, pain and hurt indelibly etched in the movie. And the movie makes its way from the hallway of the hospital, coming back their repeatedly, a grim reminder.It then attempts to tickle the funnybone as the father brings out his diary to narrate his college days. He calls in his friends and they share the story of their college and hostel life and their 'loser' tag. The story veers between their college days and pranks and the doctors submission of their sons condition.Nostalgic college days are just that in the movie, nostalgia. Comic talent is wasted as the scripts lacks punch and cliched characters are ascribed to various artists, with a boy fond of porn, a thin boy, en extremely protected boy, an abusive boy. Again a promising start, but it fails to lift this veneer and dig deeper, to build on it. Multiple characters are introduced, though keeping with the script, staying shallow.\nVarun Sharma, a natural comic is utterly wasted. Shradha kapoor shines, but is just a wall post, bereft of a role. Sushant hogs the limelight, but his acting is abysmal. A tough ask, balancing comic with seriousness, he languishes. His plain expressions and the tired, dreary look he wears robs the movie of its energy. An unlikely and undeserving hero. Comedy is not his forte and the struggle is visible. The external raucous and pomp doesn't bring in the laughs.The movie totters along, with sobriety coming along in the end, weighed in heavily with poignant messaging. It lifts itself in the end, shrugging off cliches and embracing defeat, redefining failure. 'You dont lose in front of someone, but only if accept defeat to yourself'. It redefines loss, not as heart wrenching, but that effort is worthy and it defines a champ.The movie ends strong, with good messaging, but is preceded by a couple of hours of cliched, confusing script, shallow humour and some poor acting.Sorrow meshed with trivial fun, an unappetizing fare!",

Three Idiots was focused on the students who worked hard for what they want and in the end they are succeeded in it. But Chhichhore teaches us what to do when we fail in doing certain things, that too when you know you want that thing and you work very hard in order to achieve it.\nThe best part about this movies was the editing. I loved the way Director and Editor showed the sequence of events that collapsed with their past as well as their present.\nAnother great part about this movie was the the characters. Each character stayed as they were at beginning. Just because things gone awry, they didn't started preaching about what to do but rather helped our main leads to move their story forward.\nSpecial mention to Sexa a.k.a Varun Sharma. Throughout the film he will make you sit on your chair to see what he says or does next. The best part about him and his character was they not just used him as a prop to make the audience laugh which is very common with most of his role.\nSushant and Shraddha were awesome. It was good to see them together, although Shraddha's character could have done more than just being Sushant's love interest.\nAll in all this movie is a must watch for those who like to experience their old college days through movies and also want to learn something out of it",

One that would remind many of what's really important.The movie itself was a mixed bag of some good, funny scenes and other not so great cheesy, cringeworthy moments. Unfortunately, the latter was the prominent aftertaste while walking out of the cinema hall.It's like they took the most cringe parts of 3 Idiots and SOTY and squashed it in one movie, hoping people would love it. It somewhat achieves that due to the college nostalgia most people would relate to.I felt the second tier actors/characters were better than the main actors. They brought a spark to an otherwise predictable, cliched storyline. The make-up for all the old (current timeline) characters was very similar and quite comical when seen together (mainly the same receding hairline). The music/score was quite average and failed to really have an emotional impact.I feel the movie is somewhat being overrated by some watchers. It's the nostalgia and relatable youthful moments that makes it appeal to them, rather than the quality of the movie. Neither great, nor the worst I've seen. Overall, I'd say it's a decent time-pass watch at best. Nothing more, unfortunately.",

Just last week, we had Prabhas starrer 'Saaho' falling short of the 'Baahubali' (2015) expectations people had from it. This week director Nitesh Tiwari attempts a campus rampus after his brilliantly executed 'Dangal' (2016) but Chhichhore ends up being merely an okey dokey fare - a second rate version of '3 Idiots' (2009) meets 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander' (1992).Middle aged Anni (Sushant Singh Rajput) and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor) are separated couple who arrange a re-union of their engineering classmates at the most unlikely place - hospital bed of their only son Raghav who attempts suicide after failing an entrance exam.The ex- Chhichhore's narrate their college days in order to motivate Raghav to fight and survive. The film's core theme serves as a pertinent lesson to todays parents who expect their children to be only toppers and winners but never have an alternate plan in case the youngsters dont make the cut. What then?? Anni realises it the hard way. Teach your children to be competitive and fight bravely. Dont pressure them like cookers. Good thought that!!Surprisingly, the main competition here is not state level or even inter college but an inter hostel sports championship. Huhh!!! Prateik Babbar turns up to play the snobbish baddie - basically Deepak Tijori of 'Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander'. Basketball, cricket, chess, kabbaddi etc etc contests are all crammed in for no clear rhyme or reason.Worse, the Chhichhore winning strategy is as juvenile as their name. One is sledging the opponent, other is honey trap, third is sloganeering..Tsk tsk, such inanity!!On the positive, Shraddha Kapoor is super impressive as Maya. Infact, she steals the show from her co-lead Sushant Singh Rajput who does well as the college kiddo but looks ill at ease playing the mature part. Varun Sharma as Sexa efficiently provides the comic quotient. The rest of supporting cast is competent enough.All in all, Chhichhore is a feel good film with an unmissable message for parents. But one certainly expected more from the 'Dangal' director than just a cover version of a Raju Hirani product.",

Chhichhore begins with young Raghav suffering from a massive anxiety about whether he will crack the all India engineering entrance exam as he has invested 18 hours a day for the past many months preparing for it and wants to match the caliber of his parents.A failure to launch throws him into despair and the occasion brings together six middle aged people into a reunion with the objective of alleviating Raghav from his pain and encouraging him to bring hope back into his fragile life. LOSERS, as these six were known as in their student life, recount their carefree journey initially and the final effort to shrug off the underdog tag, drawing a significant parallel to Raghav's situation.Director Nitesh Tiwari handles the subject with sensitivity and balances the Losers journey through the undergraduate years well. There was ample temptation available to propel this segment of the film into being an over the top and loud essay, but Tiwari never gives in, thus rising above the ordinary. Sushant Singh Rajput delivers an underrated performance and Tahir Raj Bhasin adds gravitas. Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla add to the little masala with their individual contribution, but the star of the Losers union must be Varun Sharma. He is absolutely a laugh riot with his expressions, one liners and an incredible energy, cracking up the theatre on numerous occasions. The weakest link is yet again Shraddha Kapoor, who needs to experiment with diversity of histrionic capabilities and expressions.Don't miss Chhichhore, it's a fantastic mood lifter and easy.",

            "review_title": "Over-rated, over-emotional, mediocre Bollywood flick !",
            "content": "This is my first review for a Bollywood film  and it is because I am outraged by the rating of this time. IMDB serves as a useful site to get decent entertainment, the ratings on IMDB are mostly accurate and close enough most of the times but this movie isn't one of those times. The rating for this movie on IMDB is 8.4 which is not doing justice to it and I am going to analyze why I'd say so..\nFirstly, the plot ! The plot for the movie revolves around the past of the parents of a young boy who are trying to cope with a recent tragedy by narrating the story of the amazing time they had during their college days. The plot itself is weak, filled with mediocre scenes, songs and script. The pace of the movie is pretty monotonous, so is the tone of the movie. It is filled with cliches and the director uses emotional baggage to carry the story throughout the 2 hrs and 30 mins, which brings me to another thing wrong with the movie , its too damn long, I lost interest midway and had to skim through the rest of it to get to the very predictable ending in an anti-climatic way.\nThe acting by most of the actors is over-done at times and character development is pretty weak. I found the humor present to be dull and below par. The songs are pretty average and are mostly forced in the movie to give it the Bollywood feel.\nIn hindsight, I can say the movie is at best a 6 and the score it got on IMDB is just pertinent to the fact that Indian public is easily persuaded by emotional meritocracy. Another thing to mention is the unrealistic notions that are filled within the core of the movie. Not only is it unrealistic but it also shows the lack of creativity in script and story writing. In all aspects the movie is pretty average and is unworthy of such a high score on IMDB. I wish the Indian public raises their standards of judging good cinematic pieces and weed out such average flicks for the sake of raising the standard of bollywood as a whole.\nI have been trying to think about any good aspect of this film and in all honesty I can't seem to put my finger on a single one that's how average the experience of watching this was for me.",

I was looking forward for some novelty in the plot and also some funny moments as it was said to be partly about college and hostel life. It was also the Dangal director's next film and I had enjoyed watching Dangal.Chhichhorre turned out to be a mix of some movies like 3 idiots and Student of the year, it had only 1 or 2 funny scenes, the music was bad, Sushant Singh Rajput (as he has done in some of his previous movies) was trying to imitate Shahrukh Khan when giving expressions and the plot moved at a snail's pace. Other than Sushant Singh and Shraddha Kapoor, there were no back stories about the other characters and what they were doing in life at present. They just drop in and decide to stay with Sushant and family for days. Almost all the situations in the plot seemed contrived, as if every scene was introduced to push the plot further.Some redeeming factors in the movie were the message it was trying to give to youngsters about life and the College General Championship's unexpected ending. Shraddha Kapoor looked pretty and Prateik Babbar was competent. I have seen Sushant Singh Rajput give better performances. Of the friends, I thought the character of 'Acid' was very relatable.Old plot rehashed and uninteresting film. Watch at your risk.",

I hoped(oh why!), that this being from the makers of Dangal would change that, but alas I could not be more wrong. The heroine in this movie(Shraddha Kapoor) arrives on the scene just when engineering fresher and the hero of the movie(Sushant) dreams/hopes for a \"model\" type lady in his college. She preens and pouts with hoards of boys lusting after her just to prove what a catch she is for the protagonist - and that is the meat of her role in the entire movie.\nI studied in a technical college and so did several of my lady friends. More often than not women would be our college toppers giving serious competition to the guys.

He jumps off his residential building after he failed to get a rank. His parents rushes him to hospital and his chances are very low. Now Sushant decides to narrate his own college story to his son and we get some relief from depressing storyline going till now.At the end of first half, we see some entertainment as they show how Sushant's life was in college's worst hostel and how they used to entertain themselves. We hope that we will see something like 3 idiots but the movie takes a complete shift in the second half and centres only on a sports championship which was very necessary to win to remove thier loser tag and at this point movie starts to lose its whole significance. I don't think that a sports championship is more important than studies in a top engineering college in India.Then the all the hostelers of Sushant's hostel, who are securing the last place from last 15 years swears to win this championship and finally performs exceptionally well and comes second and also the loser tag on them is removed.Acting- No one looked good exept Varun Sharma. Sushant Singh Rajput was expressionless both as a college student and as a father who's son is in critical condition. They tries hard to make us laugh but screenplay is very weak.Screenplay- The screenplay is a complete mess, final moments are good but story is dragged much longer than required to make it a 2.5 hour movie. Second half is just boring which only shows that the sports championship is most important thing in the college.Makeup- I am specially mentioning this because the makeup was the worst I have ever seen. It was worse than the movies of 70s. They all were looking very awkward as mature adults, specially Sushant, who's beard was unbearable.Lastly, I would say that the story was realistic in the beginning but became super fiction in the second half. They won a sports championship just by shouting stupid things which made the players of regning champion hostel lose. The second half was unbearable, predictible and very unrealistic.",

            "content": "Chhichhore, very quickly, turned unbearable because of the soulless acting done by the majority of actors. From the moment Sushant Singh Rajput showed up, there were very few moments of enjoyment. The only actors who acted well were Varun Sharma and Tahir Bashin, and to a moderate extent, Prateik Babbar. Sushant failed his act and so did Shraddha Kapoor. Sushant and Shraddha didn't play realistic parents at all. Naveen Polishetty and Tushar Pandey did only overacting, not entertaining even for 5 seconds.\nMakeup head Preetisheel Singh did the worst makeup job that I've ever seen. One major move for showing the cast getting old was to make them bald, or push their hairline back. Absolutely no work was done on their skin to show them old for real.\nIn the story, the H4 people were facing unbeaten champions from H3. How easy was this job? Just yell at H3 players to bring their confidence down?! Is that how it works? How can a carrom player start shivering and lose a shot because a few opponents are yelling?? Only Chhichhore logic can make that happen. H3 champs fell prey to the Losers very easily, but the opposite didn't happen. H3 guys failed to bring H4's confidence down. Obviously, a reigning champion team can easily fall prey to Losers! That is straightforward, right?\nBy the mid of the third quarter, I couldn't watch the non-sense that was going on. It was utter how easily H4 marched towards victory after receiving the badge of LOSERS. It was super unrealistic.\nThis was a great story, but the actors ruined it. Add to that the unrealistic turns and, of course, their older selves.",

Shraddha Kapoor can act and this is probably her one of the finest work after leaving her mark in 'Stree'. Varun Sharma is doing almost the same characters but we must say that he doesn't repeats his act and always do justice with his job, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Naveen Polishetty with other characters were also impressive. Prateik Babbar proved that he has immense talent like his mother and need some good movies to get on right track.Screenplay in the first half was great and engaging, it gets slow in second half but will neither disappoint you nor bores youas there is a message to be delivered and the message is delivered beautifully. Background music is good and supports the scenes perfectly. Songs are good.The best part of the movie is that the director had tried to keep the movie as original as he can and he had succeeded in it. He has shown the collage and hostel life with utmost realism, there are some very few scenes that can look dramatic but we have to give this much freedom to the director after all he is making a commercial movie.Overall one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen in recent times and a must watch to get a good message with a seasoning of comedy.",

            "content": "Annirudh Pathak (Sushant Singh Rajput) lovingly called Anni by his college buddies and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor), a divorced couple, find themselves in a desperate situation when their teenaged son, Raghav attempts suicide. The doctors indicate that he is critical, not just physically but mentally too. Annirudh believes the only way to bring him out of this darkness is to take Raghav down his own memory lane (back to his hostel days from engineering college). A place where he not just fell in love with Maya but also, forged friendships with 'Sexa' (Varun Sharma), 'Acid' (Naveen Polishetty), Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin), 'Bevda' (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) and 'Mummy' (Tushar Pandey).Stress and overwhelming anxiety is a reality for many young students in India. More so, for those who appear for highly competitive engineering and medical entrance exams. And sometimes, ones who do not make it through the criteria find themselves in a whirlpool of doubt and depression. Unable to take the failure in the face of family and peer pressure, they often resort to actions which can cause irreparable damage to themselves and their families.While this bleak reality is at the center of Chhichhore's narrative, its heart and soul is purely reserved for the carefree college and hostel days that shape lifelong bonds and life lessons.As the film's narrative walks us down the hostel corridors, director Nitesh Tiwari creates an authentic world that is evidently filled with nuggets of nostalgia and a breezy, vibrant energy. There are some genuinely very funny moments that click but also be prepared for a generous helping of low-brow, frat boy jokes, all of which may not be palatable. However, there is no doubt that in its flashback mode - packed with romance, comedy, a sporting championship and some hard realities of hostel life - 'Chhichhore' soars. And when it zips back to the present day, where the group has an unlikely reunion, its heartwarming to witness that their friendship has survived the test of time and distance.The arc of the screenplay though is mostly predictable and has a 'Three Idiots' hangover. And with a lengthy runtime of almost two and half hours, the pace lags in the second half. It's the emotional drama, fun quotient and a surprise element in the climax that keeps one invested. Shraddha Kapoor, packs in a solid performance both as the younger and older Maya. Sushant Singh Rajput shines as the young Anni (watch out for the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya!), however as the older Annirudh he seems a little uncomfortable. In fact, as the young lot - the performances are consistent - Varun Sharma steals the show in many of the scenes with his comic timing. Tahir Raj Bhasin is impressive as the intense Derek. Naveen Polishetty, Prateik Babbar, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Singh also enhance the film with their likeable performances. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that's relatable.'Chhichhore' has a relevant message on the inherent attitude towards academic success and failure that will connect with many youngsters and parents of today. It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly more than worth watching.",

The film beautifully captures the highs and lows of college life and rekindles many memories.The story begins with a young boy attempting suicide after failing to clear the college entrance exam, eventually ending up in a critical condition in a hospital. His parents regroup with their college friends after a very long time and go on to narrate their nostalgic journey with the hope of inspiring the boy to live again.The film has a peculiar charm to it and has the right blend of emotions. The film redefines the meaning of the word 'Loser' by teaching you to never give up in life and by showing that any failure is just a stepping stone to success.There are several hilarious scenes paired with an array of rib-tickling dialogues. At the same time there are some heart touching moments, especially the rousing climax which is bound to bring tears in your eyes.The screenplay of the movie is a bit on the slower side and it feels quite lengthy. The film could have done away with the vulgar slangs in some of the dialogues which would have made this film watchable for the younger audience too.Each of the cast members have given their best performance. Sushant Singh Rajput has excelled in his role, while you cannot take your eyes off Shraddha Kapoor, who looks adorable with her cute expressions in a mustard yellow dress, and a hairband on her wavy curls! The music & the background score complements the screenplay very effectively.Overall, this film an inspiring journey of emotions which gives you some really important life lessons and is a must watch!",

I knew the crux of the film and that ideology also made me eager to watch it. I think I watched this at a time when I could appreciate it the most, and that's why I am very glad I waited for it.The story itself was emotional, but the cast, especially the supporting cast were phenomenal in their respective roles. The leading cast was good, but it was the supporting cast that stole the show for me. Some characters, especially, became the heart of the film. So much so that it became impossible to separate them from the rest of the film. One can't help but root for the characters from the H4 hostel at NCT.The acting, as I mentioned, was top notch. Sushant and Shraddha were good, but I especially loved Tahir Raj Bhasin and Naveen Polishetty. They did full justice to their characters and I couldn't take my eyes off of them whenever they came along. Varun Sharma and Tushar Pandey were also incredibly entertaining, and I also loved the character of the young boy in the midst of it all.The direction was good, although I did feel that the movie was a little choppy at times. The flashback scenes were a little jarring, and I wish the transition could be made more seamless. But, the emotions, the nostalgia that this film brings forth to the viewers more than makes up for it.The message that the film wants to bring to the viewer is a great one. Something that we must all remember and put to heart. I loved this one!",

            "content": "As a middle-aged man amidst a personal crisis, calls on his long moved-on college friends, he also invites the memories he didn't even remember he forgot. As they together recollect with the flashbacks to the era of the early 90s when they all were a bunch of simple-looking individuals coming together in an engineering college, where their lives became so entwined within the micro-universe called \"hostel - college\". Therefore, all felt better together except for the tag of \"losers\". Thus, united, our losers begin on a journey with past and present juxtaposed to fight against all odds to absolve themselves off a tag and to gain beyond the downward psychology of failure.To encapsulate the stupidest idiosyncrasies, the utter nonsense of life and fantasy combined that only a privileged few are aware of - is perhaps the simplest way to describe \"Chhichhore\". Like that glorious song by the Rembrandts, \"...even at my worst, I'm best with you\", those imperfections that seem to others are the joy of real-bonding between some people, which could come out to be more profound than love and family - viz. \"friendship\".Director Nitesh Tiwari with writers Nikhil Mehrotra and Piyush Gupta (\"Chillar Party\", \"Dangal\") recreate some impeccable characterizations and precise dialogues (& slangs) for the most relatable of sensible and ludicrous. It's not rare, but certainly occasional, that the trip to a cinema theatre combines sentiments, laughter, romance, sadness and joy.Here the songs by Amitabh Bhattacharya have got it more right than Pritam's music. This film has one thing right till the end - the exceptional casting. Right from the college staffs, to the leads are fitting but esp. are its supporting actors. Varun Sharma (\"Fukrey\") as the mischief addicted guy, Naveen Polishetty (\"24\") the spit-fire foul-tongue, Tushar Pandey (\"Pink\") the geeky-homely guy, Tahir Raj Bhasin (\"Mardaani\") being the senior with smokes and agenda, Saharsh Kumar Shukla (\"Highway\") the 'liquor-training' senior and Prateik Babbar (\"Dhobhi Ghat\") as the cool college antagonist - are the most likable. The lead pair - Sushant Singh Rajput and Shraddha Kapoor - may have fared better this time.This drama is not a \"Student of the Year\" (no pun intended), instead is a happy cross between \"Jo Jeeta Wahi Sikander\" and \"3 Idiots\". Despite creative liberties and a dull climax, this is a fairly honest representation of what a college looks like in India. The latter is reason enough to sit through the odd two-hours and happily reminisce the times once lived or living in the present.",

The movie had a few cringy moments & a good amount of hypocrisy.During the flashback scene it is shown that the main character is trying a cigarette, there is also a scene where all the characters try alcohol. Now during these scenes the actors were obviously smoking & drinking alcohol but NOTICE on the bottom left corner, a warning is stated \"Smoking Kills\", \"Alcohol consumption is bad for health\".\nNow since we know that 'Smoking' & 'Drinking' is bad for health, then why the hell is shown & promoted in such a glorious way.\nAlso in the starting few minutes of the movie, the main actor promises to 'Celebrate' with his son by opening an alcohol bottle & drinking it together.The movie showed alot of things but there were these negative things that were subtly promoted.\nFor promoting Cigarettes, Alcohol & in a very subtle way divorce, I give this movie at most a 6.5 Stars. I would've given it an 8 had these fatal elements not been there.",

As one points out , one enters alone but leaves after being part of a family of such dear friends , ones who will be always there in times of need fostering an Unbreakable bond..\nOne may think that it's just any other college movie like \"jo jeeta wohi sikander\"!! But it's more on lines of \"3 idiots\" not as great and preachy though ! . Where the latter preached that one must choose a profession where one can excel , in here they tell us that passing exams is not the only benchmark . They come and go . But what is more important is how one deals with it , how one prepares for it ! Like \"love\" , one usually doesn't get it back but it's the feeling that must be enjoyed ..\nOne will be remembering the days of ragging and mind you , there is such an innocent feel to it that the seniors only become your best friends.. The days of togetherness , late night teas and masti .. the flirtings and chartings.. there are so many lovely moments in the flick that on leaving and for many days , u will recollect the old days of no-responsibilities , fun frivolous life ! Look for how Sushant gets scared & fidgety on speaking to a girl for the very first time !!\nActing is top notch and the best part is all if these 6 characters have been given enough space and screen time to showcase their acting skills . Sushant as always works hard and there is nothing he can not do ! . The \"bevda\" , the \"stud\" Tahir bhasin , \"mummy\" , \"sexa\" , \"acid\" , these do not appear any caricatures .. but ones we all may have experienced or seen or been with in past ! ..\n\"Sexa\" in particular with the best lines and top notch funny expressions is the one too look upto ..\nTahir bhasin and acid are too good in their respective parts , especially I loved the spontaneity of \"acid\" .\n\"Mummy\" fits the bill perfectly , do look for his swollen \"finger\" towards the end .\nShraddha looks world's apart but I am really not sure about her acting .\nReally creditable to the team of nitish to write such a screenplay where everyone gets space to breathe in ! With full marks to his direction and screenplay , and the casting by Mukesh chhabra , this movie is one to be EXPERIENCED and not just 'binge-watched\" over mobile ! ..",

You will see the same hospital scene where Raju Rastogi was brought back from coma. It happens similar in this movie too but in a different way. It is filled with 18 + jokes. Never a family movie. Its only for young generation. Over dramatic scenes, Sushant Singh narration was like ad break during the film. Why every movie opt this kind of lengthy narration. The old parents didn't look so realistic. What happened to all the characters and how did they get job. Film shows nothing but the fun they had and the competition of GC.

I probably had two giggles the whole time. Felt no real connection to the characters too, therefore I wasn't moved to tears.As a whole, while the movie didn't do too badly, some things just weren't handled with as much gravitas.

            "content": "Featuring Sushant Singh Rajput & Shraddha Kapoor in the lead, Nitesh Tiwari's \"Chhichhore\" is an unique journey down nostalgic-lane, that doesn't necessarily revolves around the leads.With a simple storyline carrying a very serious message for any of the aspiring students and their parents alike, what made the film so significantly different is its unique form storytelling, while keeping its quirky tone intact. Consisting a both extremely peculiar and low-key foreseeable happy ending alike, the two and a half hour film definitely succeeded to satisfy me nevertheless & for that, Nitesh Tiwari undoubtedly deserves appreciation.But without the magnificent performances of many layers from the wonderful and vast cast of Sushant Singh Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Tahir Raj Bhasin & others, would the film have been as good? The doubt's level is high. On the other hand, how they were handled and portrayed was something not in their control but to add to the film's significance and style of storytelling, whatever opportunity they recieved to shine were recieved with both hands. From comedic, to portray the typical college life as you'd expect, to being serious, to showcase parenthood and job-life, at times; it palpably was one tough job for the actors, even with the company of a very simple yet nifty dialogue writing. As characters, their chemistry was heartwarming and relatable for anyone but what stood out the most was the love-story of Anirudh (Sushant Singh Rajput) & Maya (Shraddha Kapoor). But at the same time, I could've appreciated the on-screen relationship even more had the reason behind the development of bitterness between the two been clarified properly. As neatly as everything else were taken care of, I certainly expected lack of Nitesh Tiwari's bad habit of neglecting certain points.Coming to the technical aspects of the film, music department undoubtedly was my favourite one even though it held close to zero significance in the film other than giving it a kickstart. Pritam, as you'd expect, has done one very good job in understanding the tone and making music upon it. The film lacked one single bad song & how they were played, too, was one intelligent decision by Nitesh Tiwari. Accompanied by a good cinematography, which captured the essence of college life and afterwards so practically & great editing alike, the film was always meant to be one handcrafted-like product.Overall, a lighthearted take on a crucial modern day issue, \"Chhichhore\" is truly one genuinely practical fest with slight bit of cinematic drama, handcrafted by Nitesh Tiwari with the utmost care. A film, that has zero chance of \"failing\" to win one's heart and carries a significant message, which needs to be taken very seriously in the era we're standing in.",

Typical stereotypes such as a sex addict in a college friends group, an angry bird, a reasonable stud and a beauty queen try to carry this directionless movie forward with a SOTY style kabaddi at movie's climax. In the background is the story of an attempted suicide, which is the only slightly meaningful angle condemning students suicide efforted under pressure.Tacky and unachievable.

If you want the short and clear version of comparison of these both films, here it is, 3 idiots=backbenchers, chichhore=frontbenchers. Watching this film felt like watching Steve carell in the office series(tries hard to be loved by everyone, funniest guy which never works because he is frontbencherish). I feel like I purchased a 1000wala crackers, lit the fuse, waited 5 minutes for the action, with no sound or light showing up till that 5 minutes, went to check what happened and then noticed that every thread of each cracker got lit completely.

Once Manoj Bajpai said about choosing a commercial role that one ( the director ) should has to have full conviction about whatever he is telling in a film.

The editing , sound design , scene blocking and screenplay is top notch and it hold your gut with a full extent.\nThe bright light of the conviction shattered the bad aspects of the film like poorly written character arcs, whole writing (you could sense the climax and whats gonna happen next with a mile away) some bad acting here and there and the worst prosthetics.\nMy primary aspect of watching a film is to enjoy and the whole criticism of the film actually educates me about what to expect and lower my expectation bars too.

The main characters like SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUTH AND SHRADDHA KAPOOR are perfectly sketched.. this both act like a divorced couple in the film.. I was mainly surprised by the side characters in the film... they deliver top-notch performance and they act as the main source of entertainment... First half looks like 3 IDIOTS. The college scenes are perfectly picturized and these add a lot of humor into the film.. The dialogues in the film are OUTSTANDING.. THE ONLY CHARACTERS IN THE FILM LEAVING THE SUSHANTH AND SHRADDHA... IS CHARACTERS CALLED AS SEXA AND ACID THERE PERFORMANCE WAS EXCELLENT AND IN SOME SCENES THEY DOMINATED THE MAIN HERO... THEY DISERVE AN BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE.... Everyone's performance are sketched good.. The film starts slowly with a college hostel scene which was good.. SUSHANTH has done a great job as usual and SHRADDHA also acted great but her character needs to be sketched even more good.. to turn up the film even more great... THE DIRECTOR had done a great job in telling the story... and in most of the scenes we go back to our college days... and remember those sweet memories for sure...\nFIRST HALF- 3.5/52ND HALF REPORT\nThe main story gets revealed here in the second half.. and overall it looks like mixture of 3 IDIOTS AND STUDENT OF THE YEAR.. But we can find much more humour in the second half compared to STUDENT OF THE YEAR.. BUT WE CAN'T COMPARE 3 IDIOTS WITH CHHICHORE... Theese both are blockbuster films of all time.. The humour even more increases in this area.. especially the pre-climax and the climax are well written and directed...the credit goes to the director for giving such a good experience.. We'll not feel bored at any part of the film.. this credit goes to the actors for their eye soothing acting performance.. The SCREENPLAY is engaging and Direction is also perfect.. The story was carved out well in the second half compared to the first.. The dialogues were also perfect.. the technical aspects were even more perfect.. But it's the output which we have expected from the director of DANGAL..\nFINAL VERDICT- PERSONALLY I LIKED IT A LOT.. AND ENJOYED THE FILM.\n2ND HALF-3.0/5\nOVERALL MOVIE - 8.0/10.0\nDIRECTION - 3.5/5\nSCREENPLAY- 3.0/5\nACTING- 3.5/5\nDIALOGUE- 3/5\nSONGS- 2.5/5",

And what a timing - right when India's dream moon-landing plan crashed making us all so sad.Finally, Bollywood is realizing the importance of editing unlike the yesteryear's movies.It's just a bit log - the sports part was the weak point to some extent and at times, seemed irrelevant and not gripping enough, but tolerable.I would recommend everyone to watch this movie as it may change your perspective on life.

If Super 30 told you a story of winner against adversities, Chichore tells you that life is much beyond winners and losers...It's more about fighters.Two stories run in parallel narrating that ordeals of every generation remains same but what matters is that how you deal. We all pass through same phases of life. The movie beautifully underlines the importance of friends in life, how hostel life is important ...Friends which became our life once and today in settled life we don't even know where they r...We don't know the real name of our best friends...This film goes very deep indeed. The film is nopreachy , full of positivity...So much that even the rivals who were pitted against had even positive things to speak at last.\nThe film scores on every front. Narration and screenplay is apt. Some People were telling that it's combo of 3 idiots and Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar...Which is totally wrong. Few scenes of hostel life may resemble but otherwise totally different aspect of life is dealt.But what I found the biggest strength of the movie is that there is no one person hero, and baring few like SSR Shradhda and Varun Choocha, all r fresh faces or small time actors seen mainly in TV shows or commercials ...And they deliver big shots. Credit must go to the casting director Mukesh Chhabra for this. The best example of this is character of Bevda, Mess Cook Pandu and Derek. They win ur heart and they r long time actors who got small roles in shows like crime petrol or some ads on TV.\nThis is a movie which I would recommend every one to watch. There r couple of vulgar dialogues during hostel scenes which may embarrass you watching with family but overall content and message is so good that those dialogues get limited just for their momentary purpose. Highly recommended.",

I enjoyed the side characters but I must say I was disappointed with Shraddha Kapoor's performance.

The real movie starts when Sushant Singh classmates reunits and share their nostalgic story of college days. Now you can say the movie is awesome. Every character in movie will relate some friend from hostel life. Sexa played by Varun sharma aka chucha from Fukrey, is something next level. All other characters are unique and funny. The dialogues are funny and will be famous among the audience. This movie will give you dose of jo jeeta wohi sikandar and 3 idiots and happy days.

Enough to take you on a nostalgic cycle. But was this recollection for? It was for his 'failed son'? Was it not? Had he really failed? Was his hardwork and effort all in vain?This is where this movie subtly hits and hits fiercely. It shows that effort and hardwork always pays, maybe not always the winner, but a loser either. This may seem common sense to you. But India had a student population of 3.74 crores in higher education in FY2019. And 22 lakhs students applied for JEE for 12,000 seats in IIT's in 2022. See the cruel ratio? Which one of the 22 lakh students have not made effort for getting into JEE? How many parents emptied their savings to get their child the best coaching?The rest after the 12,000 selected, what about them? Are they destined to be 'failures'? Well No, there are countless success stories out of IITs.But the applicants don't know it, they are very much crushed under the pressure.

Among which there are 37.4 million students enrolled in higher education in 2019 and majority go for professions \" doctor or engineer\". After 2003, globalization in India reached it peak and the demand for engineers and doctors skyrocketed and granting many people jobs. Since then these 2 professions have become ideal jobs for middle class students. The highest level of college entrance exams, JEE is goal of all elites, as it grants entry in IIT's. Almost 22 lakh candidates had registered for JEE Main 2021, and Phase 3 was attempted by more than 6 lakh candidates. But the total selections in IIT's is 12000. You can imagine the cruel ratio. Many parents invest everything in students coaching, putting so much pressure that suicides after failure became prevalent around 2011. JEE was given the moniker THE SUICIDAL EXAM.This film addresses this, and Sushant Singh Rajput did a fabulous job as father and ex-IITian trying to decompress his son before exams, a jee aspirant, and dealing with aftermath after the accident. It portrays that effort and hardwork always yield results even if you don't win. Even if you don't go to IIT, there are other engineering colleges producing great professionals. Heck there are thousand of other professions on the same level of an engineer if not better.",

With splendid performance by not just the lead actor/actress but all the supporting roles too, and great getovers of the older version of the actors as well as a great transition between the present story and the past and correlating them with each other, this movie, I think, was just the one I was yearning to see since a long time. If I have to describe it in one word, the word would be \"beautiful\". Sure, it had flaws, but it was a good watch all the same. My only two complaints from the movie would be, one, it was a bit too long, could be trimmed a little (there were times when I felt detached from the story just because it was stretched a little bit too much) and second, it was a bit overdramatic, there were moments I felt didn't need the typical bollywood drama music or focus, or pushed and predictable twists. But overall, this movie is a 4/5. Worth every penny spent!",

It's a relevant film with a rather important message conveyed through an engaging narrative. Directed by Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame, Chhichhore is high on content and humour packaged so well that it stays with you for a very long time.The story is simple - a bunch of engineering students and their journey from being losers to choosers. Sushant Singh Rajput (Annirudh) and Shraddha Kapoor (Maya) play a divorced couple, and they have a reunion of sorts with their college buddies, though in rather unwanted circumstances. Together, they recall and relive their old college memories, the good and bad days spent almost 20 years ago. The screenplay takes a trip down memory lane through college hostels, sports grounds and canteen conversations; switch to present day and you see the same camaraderie in their friendship that was forged in college.Brilliant writing loaded with comic punches, one-liners and genuinely funny jokes makes Chhichhore a winner. Full credit to the writers for ensuring that the humour is not even remotely slapstick. For instance, when Varun Sharma's character compares spotting a girl in an engineering college to Halley's Comet that is visible every 75 years, it isn't demeaning women but proof of clever writing. Keeping the storytelling simple, Nitesh made an intelligent move to weave flashback sequences into the present day, and keep audiences attentive. Though mostly predictable, the build-up towards the climax manages to look intriguing.Among the cast, you see Varun Sharma (Sexa), Tahir Raj Bhasin (Derek), Naveen Polishetty (ACID), Tushar Pandey (Mummy) and Saharsh Shukla (Bevda) aptly fitting in their respective parts and doing full justice to their screen-time. The way each character is introduced in the film with minute detailing and individual traits, it makes you sit up and take notice.\nThere are performances that stand out without screaming from the rooftops. From playing Chucha in Fukrey to Sexa in this film, Varun nails it with an impressive performance, yet again. So comfortable with his body and style of dialogue delivery, he knows when and how to throw his weight around, quite literally. Sushant looks good as a young college student but in his '40s, he is rather unconvincing and a misfit. Shraddha's character, it seems, has been written with least amount of interest. Although her screen presence is felt each time she's in the frame, she hardly gets any dialogues and you ask yourself 'was she even needed in the film'? Even the chemistry between Sushant and Shraddha is unconvincing and their scenes together flirting or comforting each other look rather juvenile. Prateik Babbar, who delivered an intense performance as the popular guy and a baddie in college, could have been given a little more screen time.\nThere is an extensive use of prosthetic makeup to show the characters ageing onscreen. While some are shown going half-bald, others decide to grow their tresses. There's one guy with an American accent too -- he has stayed in New York for 20 years, after all. However, in Shraddha Kapoor's case, the only transition that shows her going from her 20s to 40s is midi-dresses turning into cotton suits and saris. Sadly, so little imagination there!Thankfully, Pritam's music and background score by Sameer Uddin does not sound forced at any point and beautifully blends with the narrative. The song Fikar Not in the end credits is a refreshing change from the high-pitched item songs or over dramatized romantic numbers and is brilliantly choreographed.\nA must-watch with your college friends, Chhichhore is relatable and relevant. Watch it for its uncomplicated screenplay, gripping narrative and some stellar performances that leave you in stitches",

Though the core topics are heavy and serious, the screenplay manages to prevent it from sinking into heaviness with deft pacing, great comedy, and the overall optimism.Watch it, it will move you",

Dangal succeeded because every department of the film did their best. Be it screenplay, music, editing and acting performances everything was bang one. And this film fails on various fronts especially on editing and writting.\nThe first half drags miserably. The film's opening scene hooks you in the flashback world of Sushant but the present timeline stalls the entire movie. The main character of the film 'Sushant' and 'Sharddha' were not established properly. Audience is directly taken into the routine scene between them without even letting audience know who they are, what they are. The empathy we fill for them is Zero. There should have been a sequence between them for 'audience connection' purpose. Secondly, the film's main dramatic action which is the fight for GC (fight to lose the tag of loser) begins late.\nOn editing front, I felt the present timeline wasn't given a proper dramatic treatment. The scenes of Doctor informing Sushan and Shraddha about deteriorating health condition of their child is plain informative and needless. In theater, audience was laughing when that Doctor scene used to come on screen because they knew what Doctor was going to say.\nWhat I liked about the film was its second half and acting performances. The GC championship sequences were original and hilarious. Sushant and Shraddha looked uncomfortable and uneven. The secondary characters like Sexa, Acid or Mummy were far superior in their performances.\nOverall, this film is an average, unoriginal movie experience for me.",

Sushanth is wonderful in his role, and the film also touches few social topics and leaves you with a message. The dialogues and college episodes are just mindblowing and it brings you laughs. You laugh so much that you no more care about the world. The director runs the screenplay of the past and the present simultaneously which is really fresh on the film. The sports episodes are also picturised in a clean way instead of adding a cinematic feel into it. Bottomline- you can watch it a million times and will never be bored.",

It is not only the dialogue which sounds inspiring. There are bunch of good dialogues in Chhichhore. Chhichhore points out towards the academic anxiety. Sometimes we do promise for gifts and it results in performance stress.Somewhere Chhichhore hits the main nerve of suicidal cases and sungs the bond of friendship. It also gives light moments to laugh.Annirudh (Sushant Singh Rajput) is divorced with his wife Maya(Shraddha Kapoor),but both are trying to manage their life for their son Raghav. They get deeply shocked. Then Annirudh\ndecides to treat his son mentally. He narrates the failures and triumphs of his college life. His college life collects his friends Sexa (Varun Sharma),Acid (Naveen Polishetty),Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin),Bevda (Saharsh Kumar),\nMummy (Tushar Pandey) and his wife Maya.Nitesh Tiwari successfully created a 90's nostalgic feel through flash back. Infact 80% film runs in flashback and scenes of present disturbs the flow. Especially,the scenes of hospital have bit stretched. The film starts with the glimpse of 3 Idiots' suicide part then meets to Jo Jeeta Woh Hi Sikander or Student of the year like college among competition and romance. Yes,the resemblance in the story can not be intentionally,but what if audience compare this predictable screenplay.The best think about Chhichhore is its depiction of friendship. In one of\ninstance from film Anni's (Annirudh\n) friends come in hospital to see his son on just one call. They not come,but also stay to normalize his critical condition.If we go with title Chhichhore we will see some vulgar and double meaning jokes. Varun Sharma as Sexa is show topper with fantastic comic timing. Tahir Raj impressed me again after played Shyam in Manto (2018). He played Derek with serious dark face. Sharash kumar as Bevada is too late to play a student. Kota factory fame Kundan Raj works as surprise.Late Sushant is good with his charming face and still plays good cricket in film after Dhoni. Shraddha did better than Saaho. Here she holds a good role as college girl plus mother. However,two thinks are not convincing. First Shraddha's makeup doesn't insert her in a mother role. She is too pretty. Second,the relationship between Sushant and his son seems very cool,but in next scene he commits suicide.Prateek Babbar playing negative from some of his last releases. He clashed alone with Sushant's group of friends and gives competition.On music movie is not promising at all. Even background music don't work for audience to tell where movie will go.Well,Chhichhore is a book full of values,lessons of life and meaning of failure. It high on many accounts. It's a family entertainer too.",

Unable to take the failure in the face of family and peer pressure, they often resort to actions which can cause irreparable damage to themselves and their families.While this bleak reality is at the center of the narrative, its heart and soul is purely reserved for the carefree college and hostel days that shape lifelong bonds and life lessons.'Chhichhore' has a relevant message on the inherent attitude towards academic success and failure that will connect with many youngsters and parents of today. It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly worth watching.",

I know that SSR was a legend, and an actor who found his own path to come upto here, but this movie is just something more than SSR. I really like the role of Sexa-He represents the role of every friend who is a funny, a humble guy, and show himsefl like a backbencher but is more capable than it. This highlights the reality of the top engineering college undergrads who are perceived as nerds but are more than just being studious. I wish I would be living this sort of life full of friends, amusement, fests and taking part in sports championship just more than exploring studies. College life is that life that allows you to express yourself in a more dynamic way as you get immense amount of freedom from your teachers and relatives.Every part of the movie was in true flow. It makes us realise that the younger generation that is progressing today requires high level of counselling, and I think this movie has done a lot of work for the upcoming aspirants.At the last I would say its a MUST WATCH for all the students who wish to aspire for the toughest entrance examinations of our country, be it, UPSC, or NEET, or JEE, or BITSAT, or whatever. Just give your full potential, and just wait for the results, if you don't get good results, just don't give up, because life has a wider scope than the engineering field itself \ud83d\ude09",

But personally i believe it goes well with the film...\nDo watch it.. the acting from the whole cast is praise worthy...

Chhichhore really has that much amount of humerous content which would not let you sit quietly. Sexa, Acid, Mummy, Derek all will steal your hearts something or the other way through acting & dialogue delivery. All you can hear is the giggling sounds and clap over each funny incident that's being portrayed within a college campus. The director, dialogues and script writer eventually were successful in mixing a wide range of emotions periodically within the film. However, it would not let you get bored anytime, while you end up receiving the strong message from the film about life. When I saw the film trailer few weeks back, I really didn't find anything new or interesting to watch the movie in theater. But believe me, this film has a lot of surprise contents and you would hardly bother for anything else. Please do visit the movie theatre for ultimate enjoyment, else you would surely regret this later. It would be best if you plan to watch this movie with your very own bunch of friends.",

Movie is slightly ahead of its time in India and parents & teens can't yet watch it together\n3.

The greatness of any movie are the character actors.\nSholay is a classic not because of Jai-Veeru but because of Angrezo ke jailer, Soorma Bhopali, kid Ali, Dhanno, Kalia and others.There were many instances wherein Chichhore could have slipped; getting into the Ani-Maya track, changing the climax and many others that I avoid speaking off to avoid Spoilers....But the beautiful story telling done by the Team succeeds brilliantly. Hats off to them.As a viewer, suggest you watch the movie after taking care of the prude part \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

Even though the two movies (3idiots and Chhichhore)are so different. One of the best things that I like about this movie is that there are no scenes that I feel to skip. Because I couldn't find anything extra or so-called \"Bollywood masala\" or item dance that makes all movies the same or similar to one another and this is why I think this movie is different than most of the Bollywood movies today. Because this movie doesn't contain anything like that. I want to say thanks to the director of this film Nitesh Tiwari for making this movie with such a great story. One last thing that I would like to say is all the characters of this movie have done an amazing job specially Sushant Singh Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor. Also, how can I forget about the hilarious character Gurmeet roled by Varun Sharma. He is amazing. If someone asks me that \"which Bollywood movie should I watch at this time of quarantine?\". My first recommendation will be \"Chhichhore\", especially for students.",

Raghav Is under intense pressure. He finds out that he failed his exams and, afraid of being called a \"loser\", he jumps off the balcony. Aniruddh then calls his friends- Sexa, Acid, Derek, Mummy, Bewda to show raghav that they were once losers. This is a coming age comedy drama film . This movie is very relatable to all generations of audiences. This film is literally all in its writing and at the same time the performers collectively shine. This movie is all about how college was... And how simple life was. How even little things made us very happy. This film is purely reserved for carefree college and hostel days. It is a bittersweet ,heart warming Dramedy . I know - nostalgia's an exaggeration and all that. But this is the kind of writing/film that genuinely makes you want to relive - in this case, go back to college. Great movie with a great story and message. Funny, Touching and very Relatable.

            "review_title": "Chhichhore Review",
            "content": "Stress and overwhelming anxiety is a reality for many young students in India. More so, for those who appear for highly competitive engineering and medical entrance exams. And sometimes, ones who do not make it through the criteria find themselves in a whirlpool of doubt and depression. Unable to take the failure in the face of family and peer pressure, they often resort to actions which can cause irreparable damage to themselves and their families.\nWhile this bleak reality is at the center of Chhichhore's narrative, its heart and soul is purely reserved for the carefree college and hostel days that shape lifelong bonds and life lessons.Annirudh (Sushant Singh Rajput) lovingly called Anni by his college buddies and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor), a divorced couple, find themselves in a desperate situation when their teenaged son, Raghav attempts suicide. The doctors indicate that he is critical, no just physically but mentally too. Annirudh believes the only way to bring him out of this darkness is to take Raghav down his own memory lane (back to his hostel days from engineering college). A place where he not just fell in love with Maya but also, forged friendships with 'Sexa' (Varun Sharma), 'Acid' (Naveen Polishetty), Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin), 'Bevda' (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) and 'Mummy' (Tushar Pandey).As the film's narrative walks us down the hostel corridors, director Nitesh Tiwari creates an authentic world that is evidently filled with nuggets of nostalgia and a breezy, vibrant energy. There are some genuinely very funny moments that click but also be prepared for a generous helping of low-brow, frat boy jokes, all of which may not be palatable. However, there is no doubt that in its flashback mode - packed with romance, comedy, a sporting championship and some hard realities of hostel life - 'Chhichhore' soars. And when it zips back to the present day, when the group has an unlikely reunion, its heartwarming to witness that their friendship has survived the test of time and distance.The arc of the screenplay though is mostly predictable and has a 'Three Idiots' hangover. And with a lengthy runtime of almost two and half hours, the pace lags in the second half. It's the emotional drama, fun quotient and a surprise element in the climax that keeps one invested. Shraddha Kapoor, packs in a solid performance both as a younger and older Maya. Sushant Singh Rajput shines as the young Anni (watch out for the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya!), however as the older Annirudh he seems a little uncomfortable. In fact, as the young lot - the performances are consistent - Varun Sharma steals the show in many of the scenes with his comic timing. Tahir Raj Bhasin is impressive as the intense Derek. Naveen Polishetty, Prateik Babbar, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Singh also enhance the film with their likeable performances. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that's relatable.THE FINAL VERDICT\u00f7\n'Chhichhore' has a relevant message on the inherent attitude towards academic success and failure that will connect with many youngsters and parents of today. It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly worth watching.",

The film is well within the class of Dil Chahta Hai and 3 idiots minus Aamir khan. The Dangal director Nitesh Tiwari has proved that he is a director of caliber and can deliver a good film even without Mr. Perfectionist at it's helm. The film is a right mixture of fun and emotions with a right and strong message at it's end. The film's narrative oscillates between the past and present but never for a moment the film looses it's grip or deviates from it's narrative. Direction by Nitesh Tiwari is superb. Story by Nitesh Tiwari, Piyush Gupta and Nikhil Mehrotra is gripping. Screenplay is tight. Cinematography is good given the fact that the film does not show any grand visuals or beautiful locations. Dialogues are witty and funny and at times deep to convey the message. Performance by Sushant Singh Rajput is top notch. He is good with every film. He acted very well in his last release Sonchiriya and in this one too he has delivered a soul stirring performance. Shraddha Kapoor is good and much better than what she did in her last week's release Saaho. Varun Sharma is funny. The rest of the guys were top notch. Music by Pritam is okay and most of the songs plays in background. On a whole Chhichhore is an engaging fare and you must not miss it. It gives you a feeling of nostalgia if you have ever lived at a hostel. 4 stars out of 5",

All in all, ye movie dekhne ke baad chaar baatein to clear ho gayin:First, College ke din yaaron fir se wapis nahi aayenge. Wo bhi kya din the! This movie will take you through a journey down your memory lanes when you made your first set of hooligan friends, and you might find yourself giggling with amusement as you relate to the chhichorapan and exuberance that each one of us possessed during our wild, college days!Second, the education component of our Indian education system seems to have disappeared somewhere - as the coaching system and entrance exams mindset continue to ruin it. The pressure felt by our gen's youngsters and teens is immense. Life me chill marna bhool gaye hain sab. Materialism and individualism dominate everything nowadays, and \"learning\" has taken a backseat. Failure is and always will be a vital component of life. It has to be accepted as something inevitable - not something to be frowned upon.Third, acting talent to abhi bhi hai Bollywood me. Tiwari sir ki direction was almost surgical for its preciseness, and that the actors had worked hard to justify their roles was very evident after watching the movie.Fourth, I knew Sushant could act, Polishetty could act, and Varun Sharma could tickle my funny bones anyday! But Shraddha, et tu? She has acted magnificently well! Surprise! Surprise! She has really grown as an actress. Last movie that I saw of hers was Stree! This time she surprised me even more!Enjoy it in the theatres while it is running. Such art-forms deserve true appreciation from the audience, and the message it delivers should be taken home! A must watch for parents and the youth - alike. Cheers!",

Wonderful script, More than perfect casting and performances demanding a spot in the viewer's heart.

Sometimes, it seemed out of control. But believe me, it'll be still on the right track till the end. The performances of lead cast was also just okay, not that great. It was the supporting cast who looked stunning in this film. But overall, the chemistry between casts was excellent. Go for this one!

Starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor Varun Sharma, Tahir Raj Bhasin, Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey, and Saharsh Kumar Shukla in the lead roles with Saanand Verma and Mohammad Samad in supporting roles, the film tells the story of Aniruddha \"Anni\" Pathak, a middle-aged divorcee whose son Raghav tries to commit suicide but survives, though he is in a critical condition for his unwillingness to live out of fear he would be called a \"loser\". Desperate, he goes against the wishes of his former girlfriend turned ex-wife Maya's wishes to recount his own journey as a \"loser\" in a gang of six; as he continues along to convince Raghav, the other five receive news of the tragedy and decide to join their friend in his pain to complete a story they never fail to cherish as a lesson in their life.",

His last movie Dil Bechara is also good and he was really a good actor with kind heart. So come back to the review of Chichhore this movie is totally based on everybody's college life, that means we do all of these things in our college and we have been doing this. The tension before exam or rather in examinatioin hall, these scene was so memorable because it happens with us before every semester, that's why it very touchy and relatable with our generation. And also I want to add the bonding of all friends, those call friend who actually there for us in tough time.The movie we have also seen that a father teaches his son that failure doesn't mean loose, failure is key to success. And this movie carries also a social message for all our generation and those who goes through depression in studying that how can I be the topper in examination, however this movie teaches us that study doesn't mean burden, we can study and get knowledge from anything at any time. If we are passionate about anything we can do at any age because age doesn't matter, matters only your passion to do, competing the tough time, handling stressful situation also a success.Although this movie make a strong point in my life. And I believe that Friend are those who never ever feel we are all alone.",

Which acted by late Shushant Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor & Varun Sharma. It's a perfect mix of storytelling which empathize with life situations, humor &emotion. A masterpiece by director of Dangal. The movie provides some messages that our youth and parents need to understand that failure is not the ending of our life. Today's parents teach their children how to be smart & talented. But they are not teaching them failure is the pillar of the success. If we give our hundred present on whatever we have done. That is our success. Parents don't share their failures they just share their success. They don't teach them how to handle the situation. It just happened for parent's busy life. For that reason, todays suicide rate is increasing on top speed. Youth are the big percentage who try to attempt suicide. We students also have some miss conception about life. If we don't get chances in any well-known organization or institution our whole life will be hell. Which is completely a wrong perception. The movie tries to give today's youth the message not to give up. Try our level best. If the success doesn't come, don't worry about it. Take passion & keep trying. Nothing is happed for attempting suicide. Life is too much beautiful for living. The film also gives a message to the parents that stop pressuring their kids and keep supporting them. Until they give their best. Chances will come frequently. In short, the movie tries to give the lesson failure is not the end. It's just the beginning of our journey. Life has corers of things in which one can be good at. So we have to take passion, try to handle the situation & give our best embrace the results and move on. Because Life has something special for everyone to live.",
