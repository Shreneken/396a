            "content": "What We Do in the Shadows is not only one of the funniest shows on tv right now but it has become one of my favorite comedies of all-time. It reminds me a little of Seinfeld in which every character on the show is as equally as funny as the others. It's hard to pick out the best and everyone has their own favorite. It's based on the film of the same name and is created by the same people, Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement. As funny as the movie was the show might be even better. It's one of the rare shows where every single episode is hilarious! There's nothing more I can really say except to go watch this show, I promise you'll love it!",

Guillarmo is the guy who keeps everything moving along. He is called a familiar. He opens caskets. Rounds up virgins. And hopes someday to be a vampire. The first episode involve a visit from an ancient vampire, a nosferatu look-alike who pops out of a sarcophagus. He is apparently quite a stud but the others can't wait for him to be gone. One hilarious bit takes place in a stationary store where they are buying glitter and crepe paper (creepy paper?). Guillarmo has a rough time getting them to be accepted as normal customers.",

            "content": "This is an absolute beloved show of mine, and I love the mockumentary style, since the wonderful and political incorrect 'Death Valley', which had to disappear for no reason.The humor is very dry. The actors and their characters are why I fell in love with the show. Kayvan Novaks' and Mark Prokschs' performances, now basically the same over the course of four seasons, they never get dull. Between them, my beloved Matt Berry and incredible Nastasia. Demetriou do their thing with ease, while poor but sympathetic Harvey Guillen has the unthankful job of being their mundane servant (with some special abilities though). Kirsten Schaal, who I loved and hated equally in 'The last man on earth' becomes a very nice regular in season 4.Watching this show is like watching something from another age (hence my title), and I embrace every episode, great, good, or mediocre (yes there are some).Also, the title music and the ending songs, along with other music themes in the show, are great. Matt Berry as the great musician he is, has often his hands in it (especially in season four).The stories are often covering surreal facets of our daily life, and by transforming them into the vampiric lifestyle, they show how ridiculous these things are.Note that in my opinion the show has not much to do with the original movie (except vampires living in a shared flat), which I found nice, but not great. The show is much more sophisticated.The four seasons up to now (fall 2022) I would rate as following:\nS01 - Hilarious entrance 9/10\nS02 - A lot of wonderful ideas 8/10\nS03 - Always surprising 8/10\nS04 - Slightly decreasing story quality 7/10.",

            "content": "(Updated after Season 4).Four vampires and their human helper share a house on Staten Island, New York. Turns out vampires have domestic problems too.What We Do In The Shadows, the movie, was released in 2014. Co-written and -directed by Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) and Taika Waititi (Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Eagle vs Shark, Jojo Rabbit) it was brilliant: with wonderfully understated humour, sharp dialogue and clever skits it was quirkily funny and intelligent without becoming silly or even seeming to try too hard.The movie was set and filmed in Wellington, New Zealand and captured the folksy understated humour that is a New Zealand trademark. When I discovered that the series is set in the US, I had my doubts as to how it would measure up to the movie, figuring it had been hijacked by US producers and writers.I needn't have worried.Clement and Waititi are the executive producers and lead writers, so, while the setting has changed, the creative geniuses behind the movie are behind the series too. The series largely captures the same quirky, understated humour of the movie, but with different characters and actors, and the new players don't put a foot wrong.Not entirely the same feel as the movie: the movie felt more candid (as was ostensibly filmed by a documentary crew), giving it a slight edge but there is little to choose between the two.Four seasons in and the show is as good as ever, showing that the writers haven't run out of ideas. There's also a long-term story arc developing, making it even more interesting.",

I didn't read ALL the reviews, I eventually will have to go to bed, but the ones I did, I agree with, absolutely. This show IS brilliant, funny, dark, twisted and all that other devilishly wonderful stuff. The one thing I feel the need to add is a reference to Colin Robinson, played brilliantly by Mark Proksch. Ok, he's not one of the leads, but he's very, very funny in his own right. None of us will EVER know a real vampire (though sure, there are nut jobs who think they ARE real vampires) but we've all met Energy Vampires, THESE FOLKS ARE REAL! And it's great to see Colin interact with the regular vampires and the way they grudgingly accept him as one of their own, in some ways. I just hate the idea that this character and this actor are overlooked because, he's a very funny take on a very real issue. I'm glad he's been getting more screen time this season. Thanks cast, crew, producers for this fantastic show.",

Since the movie by Waititi and Clement, we have been absolute fans of the whole idea of a house of vampires just trying to \"get by\" in the modern world. A hysterical concept excellently produced. All the actors embrace their roles to the hilt, and the comedy material is profound and abundant. The show just gets sillier and sillier... in the best way. Despite the concept - a house in the middle of the suburbs full of vampires who are kind of \"nice guys\" - they somehow make it tangible and even sympathetic. With all the vast number of \"dark & evil\" vampire tales out there, this show perfectly counterbalances the genre with some much needed silliness, presented in a thoroughly enjoyable romp every episode. Highly recommended, and I equally recommend you see the original movie for the greatest context.",

            "content": "Really kinda sad here...Just wrapped up Season 3 of What We Do In The Shadows and now have to wait for Season 4 - but at least it was renewed! This show is INCREDIBLE. Wonderfully written, hilarious, original (except for The Office/Parks & Rec filming style, of course) with a great cast, snappy and quick dialogue and a standout that improved episode by episode: Harvey Guill\u00e9n's Guillermo de la Cruz.He really is the center of this show and impresses me all the time. Of course, he's gorgeous and I love his voice and mannerisms, but beyond that, he's the glue that holds both the show and the scripts together. I do love the entire cast, but this show wouldn't be half of what it is without him.And talk about perfect casting. ALL actors (and some puppets) belong in this movie and universe. I never once failed to believe these could be real-life characters and that's difficult for a show about the Undead.The show, about four long-\"living\" vampires living under one spooky roof with their familiar and being filmed as a documentary for them/mockumentary for us, is enormously funny and deep, as well. All seasons so far were great and Season 3 was by far their best one. There was even a surprising death I did NOT see coming and it 100% made me sad!! Even in a blatant comedy with hardly any dramatic elements. You just really learned to love this character and would have a hard time seeing the group without her/him.The Cliffhanger Season Three Finale also made me sad. I guess they ARE tugging at our hearts while disguised as a sitcom. I CANNOT wait for this to return and I might watch all three seasons back-to-back as I did just now before Season 4. I need to rewatch the movie, as well. I recall liking it a ton, but I LOVE this show. LOVE.***Final Thoughts: Quite frankly, Guillermo's story is tragic and despite him allowing himself to unsuccessfully try for unacquired love, I can truly relate to him. Guillermo spent 10+ years wanting to be a vampire and also possible love interest to one of the Vamps, and I did the same for about 7 years with a roommate. Now...he wasn't a vampire, as far as I know...",

The location is different and there are new characters, but on the whole it lives up to the high standards set by the movie. The casting is spot-on and the acting flawless. The writing is inspired - this could be any family in any street in any town.Indeed, the appearance of some fairly heavyweight stars would suggest that those in the industry recognise the quality of the scripts. It has all the hallmarks of a cult TV show in the making. There is a ready-made audience of vampire fans of course, but these vamps are just so darn human that the comedy should appeal to anybody who recognises how utterly complex and ultimately insignificant people are.",

If the randomness of The Office isn't your cup of tea, I doubt this will be either.

Someone suggests the attic and Lazlo says \"no the stairmaster is up there!\"Stuff like that gets a laugh out of me. It's random and ridiculous and said by a vampire those things are just multiplied. Don't even get me started on the kickball game they have against the werewolves.This is a funny show. But you'll know almost immediately if it's your kind of funny or not. I'd say give it a shot regardless.",

The larger cast, including the core couple Lazlo and Nadja, makes for a lot of scenarios that succeed in going beyond the premises of the film. Somehow after 3-4 seasons they still come up with some of the most inventive concepts which leave the audience pleasantly shocked. Brings together a lot of the character based humor one sees in UK comedies but with the New Zealand quirkiness you see in any of the film's producer's other work. There are also a lot of moments where you realize the characters care about each other, as well as inside jokes that come back over the time, rewarding the audience for paying attention. You will laugh and be amazed.",

It keeps the same comedic style as the movie, but extends the lore and fun across multiple seasons. There isn't much of an overarching plot, but slowly more character backstories comes in, and by the end of the second season I was quite hooked, it seemingly only got better from there.

Genius stroke to portray an energy thief as a devious super white guy draining everyones' energy on purpose and even planning how to do it beforehand. The others in the show help playing him good too, by having the real vampires fear Colin and constantly being cautious around him.Nadia is fun too, with great timing and physical acting. Very talented actress.The problem is that after season 2, the quality of the show drops. I easily laughed several times during nearly every episode in seasons 1 and 2 and expected the same with season 3 onwards, but I find myself hardly laughing anymore.They started subtly adding more and more PC elements from season 3, although that doesn't necessarily explain why it's not funny anymore. That's just a mildly annoying thing that gradually makes the show less magic and genuine, which in turn makes you lose interest over time. However, PC writing might be an indicator of how the focus has shifted.The magic of Colin Robinson gradually decreased too. They started developing his character too much instead of continuing with the winning recipe. A character like that should be kept at a certain distance for the viewer, and the moment he starts acting like a normal, realistic, emotionally needy and vulnerable human-being he loses his magic at the same time. I wish screenwriters would realise this in other shows too.",

You know how sometimes your brain processes before you decide whether or not something is funny? Yeah. You don't have time with this show. The comedic timing is a step above perfection. Excellent directing.The cast is great. I'm very critical of positioning, inflection and facial expressions. 100% on the deliveries, even for Colin, who is very very (double very) effective as the energy vampire. It's a struggle to watch and listen to him at times, but... it's supposed to be that way. And that, too, makes it funny.It's well done, it's cheesy, and corny, all the things that made Monty Python and Fawlty Towers great.

            "content": "After completing 4 seasons this show is the best thig out there. There have been ups and downs, but the quality has been maintained throughout.Season 1 was all about the introduction of the vampires we love along with the human familiar Geill.. (Gizmo). Two of the major season plotlines revolved around Nadja, one being her long-time love affair with Gregor who gets decapitated in all of his former lives and the other being her adoption of the young girl Jenna and transforming her into a vampire. The plot twist as the season progresses is that Guil.. (Gizmo) who wants to become a vampire someday is actually a descendent of a well-known vampire hunter Van Helsing. Despite all this the best thing to ever happen in this show was Colin Robinson.In Season 2 the vampires deal with Zombies, Ghosts, Mailer Daemon, Witches and the Vampiric Council throughout the season while Gizmo is busy killing off other vampires like mosquitoes. What's intriguing is that in one of the episodes they introduced a regular human guy Jackie Daytona which doesn't make sense at all since it's a show about Vampires. Another outstanding episode is the one revolving around Colin Robinson, and his promotion, which tells a little more about an energy vampire.In Season 3 the plotline revolves a little bit more on Nandor and his personal life, Nandor tries to find love with a former lover Gail and tries to rediscover himself by joining a cult when that doesn't work out. Nandor along with Nadja become the co-leaders of the Vampiric Council while Laszlo, who knows of a dark secret, spends a little bit more time with Colin Robinson and go on various adventures including a boys night with Seanieee and a meet-up with a Siren. This season ends with every person trying to discover themselves while Laszlo takes a new responsibility of being a father.Season 4 shows us the development of the child that crawled out of the chest cavity of the dead Colin Robinson throughout the season, from a boy to turning back into the original boring energy vampire Colin Robinson. Nandor continues to find himself a wife which he accomplishes by the help of jinn magic while Nadja opens a vampiric nightclub with some help from the Guide. On the other hand, Laszlo along with Gizmo decide to raise the child that crawled out of the chest cavity of their dead friend Colin Robinson into an interesting being. Once Colin Robinson is back Gizmo realizes that nothing will ever change in the vampire house and decides to leave it and starts taking matters into his own hands.",

I might have to start recommending that they stop watching after the end of season 3 (which even seemed to slow down a bit to me in the middle). Right from the start, Season 4 started out with a jumbled plot and a stretched motivation for the characters that used to seem so natural. The actors were pushing the limits of their characters... But I do not mean a good \"pushing\" here. It felt more like when you've been hanging around friends for too long and some of their charming traits start fraying into annoying traits. The plot itself essentially goes in a big circle - and essentially nothing changes from Episode 1 to Episode 10...

The episodic format means plot-lines can begin and end more quickly than the movie, characters can be developed more and they can be thrown into a wider variety of crazy situations. The movie had great world-building but could only do so much with an 85 minute runtime, and the show furthers that simply from having more time.The show would not work if Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement, who wrote/directed/acted in the movie, were not onboard.

I watched the entire first season in a single day (don't judge me!)\nEvery single character is fantastic and the actors really get into their characters. Nandor is definitely my favorite and Novak plays him perfectly. Colin is the absolute worst and that's exactly what his character should be. It feels like they do a lot of improvising during the show and it works well.\nIMO, the premise of the show sounds like it could get old fast but nope. It manages to stay fresh and funny.\nAs long as season 2 stays great, I'll rate it a 10.",

            "content": "I love this show. Everything about it works. The intro credits look great, the theme song by Mark Mothersbaugh (of Devo fame) is great, the casting is perfect.\nI was very apprehensive about the transfer from movie to small screen, even though it was in the hands of the creative genius double-act who created the movie. So much so, I waited a long time to watch for fear it would tarnish my feelings about the film. I needn't have worried.\nThe story structure is very similar to the film - house of medieval European vampires house-sharing in modern America (transferred from New Zealand) are filmed by a crew of humans in a mockumentary format. There are two major differences: firstly, the TV series has no obvious narrative, unlike the film which was a build-up to the Undead Ball; secondly, the TV series replaces Peter the Nosferatu-esque ancient vampire with the masterstroke creation of an energy vampire. I loved this character. Everyone knows someone like that, who can miraculously suck all the energy and life out of a room of people just by talking at them; that's what makes it so funny.\nI liked the clever way the source material was referenced by making Viago one of the Vampire Council, while simultaneously riffing on the idea that actors starring in vampire movies are actually vampires.\nActually, I think the episodic structure of TV serves this project very well, because it gives the creators more freedom to serve the jokes, and doesn't risk outstaying its welcome; comedy is generally at its best in bite-size chunks (pun intended). Even so, these were remarkaby short episodes, even for TV comedy. It left me wanting more, and I really really hope Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement are planning on producing more.",

            "content": "S01&S02I can't believe I started watching this vampire comedy series so late. It was a supernatural version of the \"The Office\" only in this case featuring the 'home' and lives of a bunch of vampires who are the quirkiest, craziest, and funniest examples of the blood-wraith kind I have ever seen or read about. And there's their familiar, Guillermo.Such hilarity, such deliberate and intentional production design and costume choices to communicate humour, and such wonderful performances all round. \"What We Do In The Shadows\" seasons 1 and 2 were both such a hoot to watch.I admit I got started on the first two seasons only after hearing the season 3 announcement. I had long been wanting to begin this series, and can't for the life of me understand why I took so long.Kayvan Novak's Nandor was hilarity made manifest. Matt Berry's Laszlo Cravensworth was tip-tip comedy at its subtlest. Natasia Demetriou's Nadja was perfection. Harvey Guill\u00e9n's Guillermo de la Cruz was the best thing to happen to this show. The 'comedic balance' of Mark Proksch's Colin Robinson should not be underestimated.All other characters/supporting-cast were just as amazing in this series, which took a bizarre but superb documentary-filmmaking approach that I never would've believed could turn out so well.Various directors and writers came on board to craft different episodes, and each one was comedy gold. It took the best of some early British TV comedy programs, merged them using American TV comedy flair, and layered the lot with Continental themes and lore twisted to fit a funny mould. I loved every minute of every episode in \"What We Do In The Shadows\".The series was shot in Canada, and select places thereabouts. But the story itself was set on Staten Island, New York, and Brooklyn - two major locations. The places were well-chosen, and added to each season's credibility and comedy.Music by Mark Mothersbaugh was spot on.Norma Tanega's \"You're dead\" opening-credits theme song is still running marathons in my head.VFX, special effects, and makeup knocked it out of the ball park.This show is based on the 2014 movie after the same name. Taika Waititi collaborated on that one too.Various A-listers made appearances in select episodes. Tilda Swinton, Kristen Schaal, Haley Joel Osment, Taika Waititi, Benedict Wong, Evan Rachel Wood, Wesley Snipes, Lucy Punch, Dave Bautista, Doug Jones (as Baron Afanas), and the inimitable Mark Hamill all played memorable roles.The team behind this 2019 supernatural comedy series took vampiric stereotypes (and clich\u00e9s) and organized them into a glee-fest worth every belly-laugh that the dialogues (and delivery of the same) inspired. Subtextual, symbolic, existential, truthful, debasing, awkward, inappropriate, macabre, and hilarious to a fault... No matter how late you may feel you are to this masquerade, just join already.\"What We Do In The Shadows\" Season 3 will premiere in September 2021.",

They document two male, one female who are more Traditional Vampires, a 'familiar' and energy-sucking variation on the 'vampire'. Viewers go from understanding 'vampires' to the daily lives of the group dynamics, individuals and subgroupings working inside and outside a mansion.All the bits and pieces you miss in vampire or monster movies you learn in this elaborate sitcom. Without giving story-lines away, you learn 'familiars' work for vampires but aren't necessary or are vampires, know other 'familiars'. 'Familiars' are like a cross between groupie and servant to a particular vampire. 'Guillermo' is the primary 'Familiar'. People come and go, but he isn't strictly a servant who can NOT change into some animal as 'Familiars' do -- like a black cat or, etc. He isn't all he seems.The things like 'Familiar' you hear in movies and just ignore make sense after watching this elaborate sitcom. If you watch say \"Bell, Book and Candle\" (1958,) you learn Kim Novak's (main Witch in the film) Black Cat is a 'familiar'.What you learn about the Energy Vampires (i.e., 'Collins') is utter brilliance.\nWithout giving too much away, people about our lives.. too much information!The 'documentary' educates as much as provide clever story-lines.

Three silly and eccentric vampires flapping about with the wonderfully vulnerable familiar Guillermo and the droll wildcard that is Colin Robinson. Everything else is icing, and the core team are still brilliant together four seasons in, despite some mild Flanderization.The well-trodden semi-documentary sitcom format which the show is built on is shakily defined and inconsistent so I find the stronger episodes to be the ones that toy with their meta-filming narrative. The strengths of the show are the dark comedic writing, the satirical proddings at darklore and the central characters which are often remarkably fun - whenever it centrepieces indulgent cameos or leaps into cartoonish rabbit holes the premise begins to come apart a little - but as the series has gone on they've got far better at doubling-down on their own canon which makes it terrifyingly watchable.",

High praise should go to the show's creators, Jemaine Clement and fellow New Zealander, Taika Waititi, for they have clearly taken great care to move this hilarious adaptation far beyond the limits of conventional television. The premise of the series remains the same as the earlier feature film: Ancient Vampires live together in a contemporary setting, feeding on hapless humans by night and sleeping by day. And like the film, the series is \"documented\" by a film crew who have been guaranteed they will not be harmed by their blood-lusting subjects. Even with the new and talented cast, and celebrity cameo appearances, a improvisational style of comedy is much in residence. Excellent writing allows the actors to adhere to the basic laws of malevolent Vampirism while simultaneously shifting to amusing lapses of poor judgement and cultural misunderstandings. (Try to imagine Vampires partying all night in the clubs, periodically \"refreshing\" themselves with humans, only to later find themselves \"tripping\" on their victims ecstasy-tainted blood). Bats fly, coffins creak, victims bleed, and vampiric gags laced with slapstick abound, yet there is also a genuine emotional, loving component, that will leave you hoping there will be many future seasons for this dark and delightful new series.",

We end up with tears streaming down our cheeks after every episode. What's more - he's Pole and reading subtitles, I'm Brit/Pole hybrid listening to original jokes and the effect is exactly the same for both of us.

The series brings in amazing cameos, absurd/cringe moments and what not. It's a perfect getaway that would keep you hilariously wanting for more.As a fan of horror, I love how they touch upon everything supernatural from zombies, witches to what not in a satirical way. Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement have created an absolute masterpiece which would be a cult classic in the times to come.

Indeed without him we'd be looking at a bunch of spoiled kids who blunder their way through eternity.Characters to love nevertheless. Colin was tedious at first but his tedium became more endearing once I knew why it was his core activity. He develops well and endearingly. Nadja is perfectly formed for the drug-fuelled night-circuit in New York circa 1990 onwards but she's a great companion to Lazlo and their tumultuous (and improbably gymnastic and omnisexual) love affair is what binds them. Nandor is the best Daddy of them all, a binding grumbler, older than his 1200 years (he's already in his 1800's perhaps even 2000's) who holds the house together with his paternal pottering.Colin is a jewel. We've all known a Colin if we've ever worked in an office and he's truly an outstandingly splendid explanation for those Colins who have drained the life out of us by waving a cheery Monday morning greeting and swerved to revector and rendezvous with us in the Tea Room to whiten our hair with tales of his weekend.I'm a fan of Matt Berry (Toast of London, I Regress) and of Kayvan Novak but Natasia Demetriou is sex on legs, she's perfectly cast for this role.Looking forward to more.",

            "review_title": "A regaling vampire comedy",
            "content": "A mockumentary-style sitcom, What We Do in the Shadows revolves around the lives of four vampires Nandor, Laszlo, Nadja and Colin Robinson who reside together. Each has their individual quirks and idiosyncrasies but they all struggle to fit in with ordinary humans and the modern lifestyle, often requiring the aid of Nandor's thankless human familiar Guillermo.A lot of the show's humour resides in the misadventures that ensue due to these powerful immortal beings trying to come to terms with the banalities of human pursuits. The characters are charismatic and light-hearted thanks to both the well-crafted script and the excellent cast performances. There is a ready wit in the dialogue with the interspersed interview snippets \u00e0 la The Office being a wonderful addition. Finally, the fantasy world is realized vividly, praise for which should be directed towards the set and costume designers as well as visual and sound effects artists.Unfortunately, there has been a noticeable drop off in quality as the show has progressed. The jokes have become cruder (lots of sex and farts), there are more underwhelming storylines (like the Vampiric Council leadership saga), pop culture references are increasingly blatant (such as callouts to The Big Bang Theory) and the visuals have regressed. Most importantly, character personalities have changed too rapidly to be realistic - Guillermo transitions from a diffident helper to a manipulative vampire-slayer, Nandor's principal trait is that of gullibility and Laszlo's newfound chumminess with Colin Robinson is at odds with his earlier distaste. Some of the plot choices are also questionable - for example, the culmination of Season 3 which sees the separation of the vampires is rendered moot when the start of Season 4 sees them all instantly reunited. I hope that with the return of Colin Robinson, Season 5 contains more hilarious escapades, clever gags and lighthearted interactions instead of an overabundance of green screen scenes.Despite these personal misgivings, What We Do in the Shadows still makes for an engaging and entertaining watch. To catch some of the more subtle jokes, I would recommend watching the 2014 movie by the same name before commencing the show.",

This excitement was only enhanced when I discovered that the writers and producers of the movie would be the guiding hand for the show. This show has such an unusual sense of humor, such a dry, absurdist take on the premise of the vampire genre, that I was scared that they wouldn't be able to continue the momentum they started with the movie. Fortunately my fears were unfounded.Unlike sparkly, beautiful and completely boring vampires from a certain other series of movies, this show takes the form of a mockumentary that follows a group of ancient vampires dealing with the banality of day to day life in modern times. Orgies, vagina topiary, city councils, hypnotizing raccoons, office vampires that suck energy... this show has it all. One of my favorite quotes: \"But, but, but! You're like a nonstop but machine!",

            "content": "The first two seasons are easy 10s, but they lost me starting season 3. Guillermo wanting to be a vampire while also being a vampire killer should've been the main focus of the show, and they had a pretty great set-up for season 3 with the season 2 finale. But they pretty much threw it all out the window right from 03x01. A vampire bodyguard? What? And then they went ahead and got rid of that whole bit too, so what was the point, really? The season 3 finale had a half-decent set-up for 4, and Colin dying to be reborn was pretty neat, but again, starting season 4, they lost me. Within the first five minutes of 04x01, we see the crew comes back from their travels around the world (another completely redundant plot-line) only for the same directionless crap to go on from episode to episode. Colin is a child performer now? Why is he aging so fast? Shouldn't it be a while before he visibly starts to change at all, considering it takes him 100 years to age to what looks like a 40-y/o human? And Nadja opens a nightclub? But why? Not to mention Nadja's comedy has pretty much been reduced to just yelling stuff at people, unlike the first two seasons, where she was easily the funniest character of the show. And God, I love Kristen Schaal, but why is she a regular? The \"Guide\"? Seriously? The Nandor-Guillermo dynamic is all over the place- Guillermo refers to himself as a familiar in the last episode I watched (\"Freddie\"), so the whole familiar/not a familiar thing is gone too, I guess. The writers aren't even baiting the Guillermo-Nandor thing well, and when they try, it's so unbelievably cringey. Marwa served literally no purpose in the show. And then they essentially killed her off in the last episode, so like ??? What was she even there for?It basically seems like every development is pointless, temporary or simply a bad idea, and takes the show farther away from what it was supposed to be about. And please don't tell me these terrible ideas were written to lead to some bombshell development - it's a cheap tactic and only takes away from the rewatchability of the show. Shadows is turning into a bad sitcom with mostly filler content. I personally have no idea where it is going at this point, but if the past is an indication, they'll probably just chuck out everything from season 4 come season 5 to essentially be back at square one, minus a handful of irrelevant developments.",

The first couple of episodes of this television series almost seemed like a bit of a letdown compared to the original, however there was enough in them to keep watching... And man, was it worth it! Episodes 3, 4 and 5 have really shone, constant laughs, and insane situations that only 3 inept, and slightly out of their depth, vampires (and their acquaintances) could get themselves into... After considering it, it is possible that the reason I was not such a huge fan of the first two episodes may be because I was disappointed that it was about different vampires to the movie, and it had to introduce these vampires, and their relationships and personalities, to the viewer... So... If you haven't watched it, or have only watched the first episode or two, don't dismiss this show... It really is worth a watch!",

Tho the style of comedy from the film and office series are totally different, so perhaps I went in with different expectations of the style of humor.

Kayvan Novak has slipped ably into the role similarly played by Taika Waititi in the movie, but Matt Berry (great Shakespearean voice) and Natasia Demetriou have created two new and hilarious vampires. Watch especially for Nadja's facial expressions. Harvey Guillen is perfect as the sweet but inept familiar Guillermo (\"being a familiar is like being a best friend ... who's also a slave\") and the addition of Mark Proksch as the \"psychic vampire\" is very funny. In the pilot, the great Doug Jones plays the Baron to great effect.Jemaine Clement has created very funny scenes with quick and witty dialogue and characters that make the incredibly ridiculous situation seem plausible, just as the movie did.

This is a mockumentary about a group of vampires who live in one house and try to adapt to the modern world. They played the lead roles along with the excellent Jonny Brugh.In 2014, the short film became a full length film, with the same name and with the same cast of directors/writers/actors.Following its success, the film became a TV series in 2019. Waititi was already busy with bigger projects - he directed THOR: RAGNAROK and JOJO RABBIT (he won an Oscar for the screenplay and was nominated in the best film category). Of the 10 episodes of Season 1, Waititi directed the pilot, episode 7 (\"The Trial\") and the final episode. Clement directed episodes 2-4.In the TV series the cast is different and they don't play the same characters that were in the film but new characters, with the idea of the series continuing that of the film.In episode 7 of Season 1, the three original actors appear as guests in the same roles from the original film, in addition to other well known actors who appear as vampires (whose name is the same as their name in real life) - all of them previously played vampires in other movies/TV series.Another recurring role in Season 1: Doug Jones, who is already used to performing under heavy makeup, especially in the films of Guillermo del Toro.Season 2 begins this week.

I am now rewatching it with my husband. It is absolutely hysterical!!! It is clever in sticking to some traditional vampire tropes while Introducing a modern concept of the \"reality tv\" format. It's a light hearted comedy that continuously causes you to laugh out loud or rewind the scene back a few seconds, to ensure you heard a left field comment correctly. It's only been about 3 weeks since I discovered the show and I've seen each episode twice, some thrice. If you need a pick me up or a comedy to watch with your partner I highly recommend this!

Its their anachronistic antics that's the life blood, so to speak, of much of the comedy found in this series.Of course the question any viewer needs to ask themselves is \"is it funny\"? Of\ncourse humour is a subjective proposition.

But surprisingly, this series is actually improving with each episode of season 1. The writers have realized where the strengths of each character lie, and they are making great use of their observations. The Nandor and Guillermo characters are the key here. Their somewhat innocent nature makes them very likeable, and the series focuses more on their characters as the first season progresses - great choice by the writers as the Lazlo and Nadya characters are not nearly as funny nor endearing. It seems Lazlo and Nadya have to resort to profanity for laughs, while the other characters do not. The Colin Robison character is absurd, but works well in contrast to the other four leads. The episodes \"The Trial\" and \"Ancestry\" were the highlights of the season, and \"The Trial\", with its tremendous cast of cameos, is one of the funniest comedy episodes on TV in the past few years. Hopefully, season 2 will continue a focus on Nandor and Guillermo, and they find a way to either improve the Lazlo and Nadya characters or de-emphasize them further.",

A disappointing downgrade, like an empty cranberry juice bottle with a sticker bearing the handwriting of a 5-year-old saying \"Bl00d (property of Timmy the Butcher. Mortals (mom), keep out!).\"On another hand, I feel like making this show an exemplary \"sacrifice\" to pathetically ramble about the state of entertainment as a whole. If you are a single person living with your pet or two and putting this show on in the background as an emotional crutch to simulate living with \"quirky roommates with sexy European accents\" and giving it a 10 just for the sake of the warm feeling inside it gives you, you do you, boo, but I can't help but feel almost belligerent at how big yet simultaneously lazy our megacorporate overlords are, churning out repackaged brainless (oof, the irony) garbage for eons now. Disney, Sony, and Viacom could practically take over the government right now and it would be a bloodless painless coup, too, as masses in the street eagerly gather to welcome a rain of Baby Yoda plushies and dolls with \"Yeed\" that instant be declared the honorary president of the United States of America (the revolution will be merchandised) but I digress.What is it about good material that in the process of \"adaptation\" often gets butchered, its direction thwarted, and tone subdued whether the original makers were or were not involved in the production as this show proves. Sure, sure, you are smirking right now and want to rub \"The Office\" in my face, that one supposedly successful exception that proves the rule. Typically what happens is that when a show is taken out of its home place, tweaked a bit here and there perhaps to suit the \"tastes\" of the new place with the end result perhaps even bearing the same name or the same theme, chances it will have the same spark as the original thing are astronomical, case in point Red Dwarf versus Red Dwarf USA pilot. The will and the \"skeleton\" of Shadows is here but the spark is burned out.",

Another 5% of screen time filled w/old photos of vampirism/satanism/etc. Special effects/props consist almost entirely of really cheap wire (cropped out) flying that was just laughable bad; some false vampire teeth every so often; lots of black clothing. No bloody food feasting (that is not viewable by a 3 yr old) typically found in this genre.Despite all that it did have some creative parodies, satiric funnies & spoofs on the vampire genre, e.g. the obvious wire flying; the turning into a bat; the vampire teeth; the hissing of course.",

Even when the TV series is good in its own right (such as M*A*S*H), it's still not as good as the movie. This time, I was wrong. The series captures the flavor of the movie and actually improves on the concept.What We Do in the Shadows (WWDitS) is a mockumentary following three vampires who share a modern house in Staten Island, as well as a familiar (a human who longs to become a vampire and therefore serves) and an \"energy vampire\", who instead of feeding off blood bores people so much they lose all their energy. Living for centuries has not made them wise. They are colossally stupid on several levels, which makes them oddly endearing.It's wacky, unpredictable and occasionally very gross. It is certainly not for everyone. But if this kind of macabre humor works for you, you might find WWDitS as adorable as I do.

Meanwhile, the truly hilarious Matt Berry, one of the best comedic actors out there, is relegated to a supporting role and rarely gets the spotlight. During the 3rd season Berry seems absent and indifferent. Mark Proksch is also good as the \"energy vampire\" Colin Robinson. The scenarios have potential, but the execution is usually just sort of blah and lowest common denominator. It all seems like an attempt by British actors to make a dent in the lucrative American market by not being too edgy.",

Maybe it's because I'm a huge Matt Berry fan. I only started watching the show because of him, but soon fell in love with all the other characters. I've seen all of the episodes probably at least 10 times. I even run all the episodes on loop while I'm stuck working from home just so I don't get bored during the day. I didn't find the show laugh out loud like The IT Crowd, but it's highly entertaining. If you loved The Office you're sure to love this show as it's filmed in a similar mockumentary style. I can't find anything negative to say about it. The acting is absolutely on point and the characters grow on you. While I do like Matt Berry I've come to really enjoy Kayvan Novak's portrayal of Nandor The Relentless. Nandor tries very hard to be scary and intimidating but turns out to be the one with the most gentle nature and kind heartedness. Give at least a couple episodes a try. I'm sure you'll want to continue watching. Can't wait until Season 3.",
