We have three supporting Vijays here in this movie Vijay Raaz(father),Vijay Maurya(Uncle),Vijay Varma(Friend) and they are spot on.\nAmruta Subash(mother) expresses her life's melancholy brilliantly.Kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs a punch and last but not the least\nthe game changer Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher). He overpowers Ranveer in many scenes.I won't stop if I start mentioning how apt and brilliant is the screenplay here..\nCinematography by Jay Oza and crisp editing by Nitin Baid are felt on the screen as the movie even being slow in pace doesn't be a boring affair in 2 hrs 35 mins.\nZoya has struck a win win here.Finally, what made it more lively was screen time for real life rappers like Emiway Bantaai,Stony Psycho and Dope Daddy from Dopedealicz , Kaambhaari and also a second of Brodha V.Just felt like saying this that how well the hip hop culture has been able to connect with our generation. Emiway Bantaai's one second presence in first half and the crowd erupted like never seen before. Also , his acts in second half are treat to watch. Not to forget Kaam Bhaari is there too.All in all 9/10 from my side.\nGo for it folks.\nWatch it for a beautiful journey of the guy from streets.",

            "review_title": "The Hate U Give to Youth ...",
            "content": "Gully Boy - A+ (Award Worthy)After listening to massive wave of backlash against Alia Bhatt and Gully Boy from Kangana Ranaut after untimely death of Sushant Singh Rajput (May he rest in peace). I decided to watch Gully Boy out of curiosity and I was amazed how terribly wrong Kangana was to attribute someone's death to a movie or certain people. Gully Boy for a person like me who rarely watch Bollywood movies unless it's on Netflix is such a game changer. A whole movie not only on rap music woven into struggles of a poor guys from slums with the message of empowerment to youth, friendships and dream was astounding.I don't even listen to rap music besides EMINEM, and I was enchanted by Indian rap which I have never heard in my life. I was amazed that they used no profanity laced rap in the movie to make it more appealing to younger crowed either. They showed Muslim background where singing in the family is the forbidden and empowered even Hijab wearing Alia Bhatt to speak her mind and still be the leading lady. To say she won award for 15 mints screen time is utterly ridiculous, you don't have to win an award for how much time you have spend on screen. Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and Judi Dench in Elizabeth won Oscars for merely roles 10-15mints screen time. A movie like Gully Boy, which is one of kind real musical directed by a women is commendable.The hate towards the movie from some part of the very vocal group speaks volume of misogyny in some individuals. who want to take advantage of someone's demise to settle their own old scores against old enemies from YashRaj, Karan Johar, Bhatt Family, Hrithik's family friends Javed Akhtar etc etc. is utterly shameful. A person who never worked with him or helped him while he was being trolled for Drive and rumours now is trying to become his ally. Nepotism exists in every industry even a shopkeeper hands over businesses to his family not stranger and to train them you have to put them through the business. Some get successful, but mostly miserably fail. Legendary actors like Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan were outsiders, there is mix balance of both sides and new crop Ayushman Khurrana, Kangana Ranaut, Taapsee Panu, Rajkumar Rao, Katrina Kaif, Kriti Sanon and Bhumi Padnekar are proof that if you have talent you can make space, it won't be easy but if you want an easy life then don't chase your dreams. Chasing dreams and accomplishing them is going to be hard and I am glad that this movie shows that and put a light on such topic and I hope people understand and focus on positivity and not the negativity.A powerful movie which showed camaraderie among friends without jealousy, determination, family love and struggles living in slums with rap music is unimaginable in Bollywood mainstream cinema with top actors Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt. The movie deserves all accolades as cinema like this needs to be encouraged and appreciated.",

            "content": "Zoya changes gear with Gully Boy. It's the story of Murad (Ranveer Singh), his aspiration, ambition, his family, his love Safeena (Alia Bhatt), his friendships and the path he takes to fulfil his dream. At the forefront, Gully Boy may seem like a movie about the underground rappers but actually, it is much more than that.The movie is mainly about human relations, connections, emotions and dynamics. There is no filmmaker better than Zoya Akhtar who can portray and handle human complexities in such a brilliant way. Gully Boy will surely be counted amongst her best work.Ranveer and Alia's chemistry is too cute to be true. They are like a house on fire...,Vijay Varma special mention - He is too good...as Moeen,, got a good depth to the character.If the writing of the movie and Zoya's direction is of the highest order, Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, debutant Sidhant Chaturvedi and other actors compliment it with fabulous performances.Alia Bhatt, is the scene stealer. Every scene she appears in is a riot. She is endearing, to say the least. This is one of her best performances and her character is a crash course in women empowerment. I am sure everyone's gonna fall in love with her.On the downside though, the pacing takes a dip in the second half.Gully Boy is one of the best movies to come out of Indian cinema in recent times. Watch it for Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt's dazzling performances. And moreover, watch it for the master filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. Hats off to her. This one's a winner.",

Not a college kid coming up. His age lurked in the back/front of my mind in every scene he was in. So I looked him up. Yeah, he's around 34. For me, it spoiled the film.

Alia Bhatt is a fire cracker in the movie. I just wish there is lot more to the story. its a worth a watch.

Alia and Siddhant were the best. Ranveer decent. The finale was a bit let down. Just too much of celebration which didn't emotionally connect with me. I was happy that it was finally over. Compare this movie to Dangal, Secret Superstar, Chak De India, etc. and you will see that it lacks life.",

It's a slightly odd comparison but those two films have to come to mind while watching it. Intercutting rap battles into this tale of rags to riches is actually a concept that worked much more than I would have thought. What I think also helped is the addition of a fiery romance, a cultural family dispute and a terrific ensemble cast. There's a fair amount of humour too, which provides well timed relief to some of the emotional drama. Overall, Gully boy seamlessly blends romance, drama and comedy situations and a well-meaning message that rings true in today's society.",

            "review_title": "\"Change your reality to match your dreams\"",
            "content": "Gully Boy is an extraordinary film about a young Muslim student from the slums of Mumbai, who is a fan of hip-hop music and who keeps secret his dreams to make it big in the rap music scene. It is the kind of film that hooks you right from the first moments and just keeps growing on you as it goes on. The story, the setting, the cinematography, the music, the characters, and the narrative all contribute to the film's unusual feel in equal parts. The Dharavi slums of Mumbai where the film is set are shot beautifully - the congested streets, overcrowded with a diverse population of individuals, much to the point where poverty, and often sad pictures thereof, is presented as almost culturally exotic. It's amazing though that specifically these disheartening, seemingly impossible areas bring forth heartening messages of hope and opportunity where neither dire straits nor harsh realities can take them away.The film's narrative style is fantastic - it IS music. Its youthful, modern feel is there all through and, even those not particularly fond of rap music, are very likely to enjoy the rhythm and the many songs which decorate the proceedings in ways one could not imagine. The lyrics of the songs, as well as the rap sequences as performed by the characters of the film, turn out to be symbolic and poetic and very true of the challenging conditions of the speakers in question. The cinematography is stupendous, the lighting and diverse shots make it quite a visual treat in many ways and, as mentioned above, even despite the setting of not the prettiest locales. Apart from Ranveer Singh as Murad, the film's leading actor who's an aspiring singer, and Safeena, his charming and headstrong girlfriend, every character is given a story, which is part of the entire picture of a society often immersed in its primitive ways, like, for one, his bigamous father or her conservative parents.And the acting, as part of this entire picture, is spot on. Every member of the cast is natural to the hilt. Singh obviously leads the cast with an excellent performance. His portrayal of his character's reserved nature, insecurity, and then his inner self-belief in his ability to make it, is fantastic. In a smaller part, Alia Bhatt is wonderful as the free-spirited Sakeena, and she almost steals the thunder as she is highly relatable, convincing and above all enjoyable in how ambitious, determined and madly in love she is. Without taking anything away from the two leads, the supporting cast is full of stupendous character actors, led by a brilliant Amruta Subhash in a heartbreaking portrayal of Murad's mother. Vijay Raaz, as her abusive and adulterous husband, is superb, and so is Vijay Varma, as the troublemaker Moeen. Siddhant Chaturvedi is a nice find as he fits the role and does exceedingly although he does look over-confident at points, and Kalki is given a thankless role though she's good.Gully Boy is a rare combination of top-notch acting, story, music, and soul. It works as both a musical, a sports film of sorts, and a human drama. In the end, it's just very inspiring. For director Zoya Akhtar, this is clearly the best film of her career, as no film of hers, even the most celebrated and acclaimed (and some, overrated), reached the merit and beauty of this one. This film has clearly a lot invested into, and not just money but hard work in studying and preparing, because it takes us into the world as those who too often are deemed transparent, and it makes them matter. Many years ago, a movement of Indian films known as parallel cinema was producing films which often sought to give voice to the voiceless, namely people from the slums. It's nice seeing that their stories have crossed the boundaries of what was called \"offbeat cinema\" and is now given importance by mainstream filmmakers. That mass audiences find their stories valuable is not surprising, but Indian cinema is maturing, and it's great.",

When the film starts to the end, the director(Zoya Akhtar), makes sure the audience is hooked. Dialogue writer Vijay Maurya, also played by Murad(Ranveer's uncle) wrote some amazing dialogues and a script that not only neatly ties on the gully boy himself, but his love interest, relationships with his family, friends, and his inner demons.\nRanveer has slowly become Indian's Daniel Day Lewis. There is no trace of him in Murad. He is sensitive, daring, intense, and quiet. He breaths fire as he sits in his car, and raps his heart and arms out. He is brooding as he sits and writes after he sees his father's second wife come in his home. He doesn't miss a beat. Alia is growing from strength to strength. After, Udta, Dear Zindagi, Raazi, and now Gully Boy, is the latest in her kitty of great performances. A special mention to Siddarth and Vijay Varma for giving us such lovely characters to root for. Also Vijay Raaz as the abusive father. I hated him and that's a testament to how great Raaz is as an artist.\nThis movie is a must see. Go in and you'll be happy to spend Valentine's Day with Zoya and her team whom have gifted us this extradinary film. Hard Hai Boss!",

            "content": "Viewed at Berlin, 2029. Gully Boy, india, directed by Zoya Akhtar.(46) seems to be pointing Bollywood in a new direction away from the Masala formula loaded with often irrelevant mass dance numbers and focussing on the lives of the wealthy upper classes. \"Gully\" is one Hindi word for-street from which the less common English word \"gulley\" is derived and immediately informs viewers to get ready for something different. Set in the infamous Mumbai slum of Dharavi Gully Boy is in a way a local response to Danny Boyle's 2008 world wide success \"Slumdog Millionaire\", focusing, of all things, on the recent Indian craze for Hop Hop and Rap music and the lives of the slum dwellers.\nMurad, a 22-year-old youngster in an Islamic ghetto family (Ranveer Singh), knows he has a way with words and dreams of making it in the rapper world but only as a composer because he is too shy to take the stage himself. He us encouraged by successful rapper, Sher, (the Lion) to mouth his own words at the mike and is warmly received. Eventually he will enter an aggressive Rapper duel with an enormous cash prize for the winner. Meanwhile his ultra conservative father takes a dim view of Murad's ambitions and demands that he follow up an education to be a white collar worker. Needless to say, in the end Murad will triumph but not before the obstacles of poverty and resignation to lowe classness have been overcome. His feisty girlfriend (Alia Bhatt) provides him with moral support. At 33 Ranveer is maybe a little long in the tooth to play such a youngster but he has charisma to burn and pulls it off with restraint and verve. With this off beat role he has clearly established himself as the leading actor in Bollywood. SRK move over. And you do not need to be a hip hop fan to get on this swift roller coaster of a ride and enjoy it to the hilt. Not in competition Gully Boy was nevertheless a rousing experience, feel-good in its own way, and one of the better films seen at this festival\nZoya Akhtar, stemming from a prominent Indian film family, is not only the only major female director in Bollywood, but one if its very smartest, most effective and most skillful. A leading figure of the new Bollywood until now totally male dominated.",

Majority of the plot is from a Eminem movie back in early 2000, 8 Mile. Gully boy has also copied major plots from a few popular movies of it's own industry. The ratings were high and i booked because it's been a while since i've seen a movie on the big screen. Movie started and this happened......Ranveer Singh This man is gifted. His dedication to the character he plays, be it a King, Street Artist, Businessman etc., he sweeps the audience off the floor. MC Sher, he played beautifully too. Might i say, I think he played a stronger street rapper than Ranveer himself.This movie, although much was predictable is a fine cocktail of many things that lifts your spirit high and you leave the theatre with a bit of adrenaline rush and a smile.Peace out!",

            "review_title": "Little India Directory Review: Gully Boy (6 Stars)",
            "content": "Gully Boy (Street Boy) is full of energy. So full of energy that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for nearly 3 hours as this blend of hip hop music and dramatic performances put me in a state of daze. Unfortunately, when I was finally out of that daze, the humdrum, polished story stared me at the face, making me feign the gloomy air of a rapper that he assumes when he realizes he just got owned by his opponent in a street rap battle.Hard-nosed Ranveer Singh plays the central character of Murad - dreamer, boyfriend of aspiring surgeon and rough-and-tough human being Safeena (Alia Bhatt), Engineering student, and a member of an extended family where the guardian and sole breadwinner (Vijay Raaz) has just recently married for the second time. In that order. Although, if it was for Safeena to decide, she would change that order and maybe even murder a woman or two to get that done. But since the screenplay is written for the masses by Akhtar and co-writer Reema Kagti, with substantial support from dialogue writer of the year Vijay Maurya, Gully Boy flows like a rap song. The poetry is very good and \"hard\" considering the rhythm by an ensemble of musicians including Divine and Raezy (Mumbai-based rappers on whose story the film is based), Raghu Dixit, and Mickey McCleary makes the viewers get out of their seats and dance like Murad does sometime during the slow-paced second half of the film.At first glance, the short slices of scenes made me believe that I was watching the trailer of Gully Boy. And then the screenplay started to bring long shots into the mix and made me laugh my stomach off. As I have noted earlier, writer Maurya vomits knowledge and experience of street language into the screenplay, not only surprising you at the rawness of the sequences that it complements but also amusing you to a level that you fall in love with the characters. Although I am not a fan of Murad or his ambitions, I was blown away by newcomer Siddhant Chaturvedi and his introductory character of MC Sher. It almost felt like I was watching a real-life street rapper spread wisdom about hip hop and the real world among his peers. And whenever he spoke - which is akin to how he raps - it felt like I was experiencing an experience that I had never experienced in Hindi cinema. Sure, films about street urchins - down and out - but dreaming big and humming \"apna time aayega\" (\"our time will come\"), have been presented before, but not with so much energy and finesse. A good look at the scenes involving the slums of Mumbai and their people will enthrall you like only a few films have in the history of Hindi cinema.If the music comes in first in this race (with \"Apna Time Aayega\" sung by Ranveer Singh and Divine taking the pie by at least eight miles from the second track Doori also by Singh), then the cast performance definitely gets the silver medal. Both Singh and Bhatt are phenomenal in what they do, especially enacting the appearance and behaviour of the poor. The latter just hits the roof with her enactment of Safeena, a ferocious true bred and highbrow, independent woman in mad love with the man of her life. Even if the film's energy as a whole gets compared with Singh's and the latter wins, there is much more to relish about the rest of the cast. Performances by everyone, notably including Vijay Raaz, Chaturvedi, Vijay Varma, Kalki Koechlin, and Amruta Subhash are a treat to watch. It won't be surprising if you wonder if these actors were made for the roles that they portray so effectively, uplifting the understanding of the social issues that I mentioned earlier.Yet there is a pungent, uncomfortable element about Gully Boy that prevents you from calling it extraordinary. The story of a guy stricken with poverty trying to make it big in the millennium city is as common as a piece of garbage lying around in the same city. How perseverance and patience gets you ahead is another point that Akhtar brings into the fore, all the more making me question the point of such a film. Of course, the musicians have done a splendid work writing the songs and producing them, but I am not seeing any special reason or a special factor that would differentiate Gully Boy from an ordinary biopic about a person who tries to make it big in life. And that is what restrains me from singing any more praises of Gully Boy and avoiding the peak-end rule. Because those final 10 minutes are manically fantastic. But I will definitely say this: the music will uplift your mood like no other film has in a long, long time. And if that's your cue, then Gully Boy should be in front of your eyes this weekend.Director Zoya Akhtar somehow always manages to make even the most humdrum of stories into ravishing pieces of art. Gully Boy is no different even if you look at it from the perspective of a person who hopes to see social issues being addressed through cinema. For it also marvelously hints at issues such as social status and inequality and wealth and even (Islamic) polygamy to an extent. The excellent camera work by Jay Oza will make you want to watch it for the second time on the big screen despite of this review. And that is the kind of movies that Akhtar makes, only to find them being watched and rewatched by cinephiles years from now.Gully Boy gets everything right and pumps up your mood regardless of what position you are in in your own life, but just thinking about it a few hours after you have seen it will make you realize that it just falls short of becoming something that can be dubbed as extraordinary.

            "content": "Director Zoya Akthar's Gully Boy is an affective underdog story that is well executed and supported by solid performances by the leads as well as a competent supporting cast. It presents the story of Murad, a resident of the slums of Dharavi, Mumbai and his rise to become an acclaimed rap artist despite the odds that are stacked against him that seek to trap him forever in his suffocating circumstances. The narrative arc traces his journey of self discovery and how he harnesses his innate talents and self belief to become a famous rap artist by \"melting down the shackles that bind him with the lava of his lyrics\".I have never been a big fan of the genre of hip hop/ rap music. But, there is an earnest intensity in the album and the hard-hitting lyrics (collaboration by an array of artists) here that captivates the viewer and hooks them to the genre.Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhat prove their mettle as the definitive stars in the making, oozing loads of talent and cement their billing to be counted among the very best of their generation of actors. This film provides a perfect stage for them to collaborate and shine together. Ranveer is like some shimmering liquid metal that could be perfectly cast to fit into any mould. He can effortlessly transform from being an obsessed and cruel medieval Sultan in Padmavat to the underdog from Mumbai slum and make either part feel very real.Here, he is inhabiting the part of Murad, a Dharavi resident dreaming of elevating his life from a rag-tag, down-in-the-dumps reality to match his soaring dreams. And, it definitely doesn't hurt that he can also rap like a pro. Alia Bhatt lights up the screen as the charming Safeena, a pint sized dynamite of a medical student, madly in love with Murad. She shares a warm chemistry with Ranveer, complementing him effectively.Zoya assembles a string of notable names like Vijay Raaz, Kalki Koechlin, Vijay Verma, Sheeba Chaddha as well as debutante Siddhant Chaturvedi (as MC Sher) who turn in impressive cameos along with multiple real life rap artists who add a dash of authentic flavour of the music and the milieu, especially in the fierce rap battles. The crisp cinematography (Jay Oza) and the conversations soaked in the local lingo add to the lived in feel to the proceedings.The writing (Zoya and Reema Kagti) is dexterous for the most part and manages to breath a dash of freshness even into some time tested tropes and cliches. The result is an extra-ordinary movie that is engrossing and satisfying at multiple levels.",

            "content": "Zoya Akhtar films have been all about urban rich lifestyle films such as Luck by chance ZNMD Dil Dhadakne Do but Gully Boy is completely different from her previous outings and she nailed it with the story(along with Reema Kagti) and captured the slums of Mumbai with almost perfection! I've been a huge fan of Divine Naezy songs like Mere Gully Mein Jungli Sher Kaam 25 etc. Zoya didn't disappoint in showcasing the underground rap battles and slums of Mumbai which marvelled me.Story: Murad(Ranveer Singh) is an aspiring rapper who lives in the slums of Mumbai along with his abusive father(Vijay Raaz), mother, grandmother, a brother and a step mother. He's in relationship with his childhood love Safeena(Alia Bhatt) and friends with Moeen(Vijay Verma), Salman and others. His life takes a turn when he encounters with MC Sher(Siddhant Chaturvedi) who turns him into the GULLY BOY.Performances: Ranveer Singh nails it with his performance in this film. I initially found him as an above average actor who's best comes out only from Bhansali and Deepika, but after Simmba he proved me wrong and with this film he shut everyone's mouth, especially with the climax. Alia Bhatt is natural in her approach, her performance can be felt as she lived the character of Safeena, the pain can be seen in her eyes. Vijay Raaz, Vijay Verma, Sheeba Chadha everyone performed well, though I wanted more of Kalki Koechlin who had least screen presence. But the one who steals the show from Ranveer and other actors has to be Siddhant Chaturvedi! BOY HE NAILED THE LOOK AND MANNERISMS OF A RAPPER! His entry was the best, his screen presence was amazing and overshadowing Ranveer is not everyone's cup of tea. Can't say he's the same man from Inside Edge who was shown as a weak guy, he completely transformed himself as the MIGHTY MC SHER! For this role a star was required and hats off to Zoya for making a debutant a star of the film!The plot looses the grip in second half to some extent but nevertheless the climax makes up for everything, when Ranveer raps his heart out and promised APNA TIME AAYEGA, arey Ranveer baba aapka time toh aa gaya!Going 9/10 especially for superlative performances and music",

Subdued persona of Murad has been very well imbibed. When loud and forceful rap songs are being sung, it is clear that Murad is the one singing.Aliah has an easier role to pull off. She plays a bold and open girl who wears her heart on her sleeve. And she has portrayed Safeena just as brilliantly.In the form of rap fights, movie takes stances - good takes, some of them very well worded by Javed Akhthar. Multiple independent perspectives of a few varied topics presented nicely through rap.Very realistic and convincing characterizations of not only the protagonists, but also the households, the slums etc. Reminded me of Vada Chennai.Loved the ending of the movie - unlike the meticulous thread closures. All questions answered still. While \"Luck by Chance\" was a pretty good movie, \"Gully Boy\" definitely feels so much more perfect.\"My dreams will not change to match my reality. My reality will change to match my dreams.\"I can see this movie getting all over the psyche of young aspirants. Dream on - apna time aayega!",

Ranveer was on terrific form, he was passionate, he lit up the audition rap scenes, owed it to the superb Siddhant Chaturvedi on the supporting role as MC Sher! Man killed it big time in Apna Time Aayega showdown, rapped it himself! The movie consist of banger of tracks(credits to bunch of musicians involved) but thought Zoya strike the right chords, keep it authentic for the sake of story and explode it towards the ending!

            "content": "Gully Boy is a journey of journeys full of words, visuals, expressions, lyrics and story lines. You, the viewer, get to focus on elements that appeal to your senses and take out as much or as little as you want out of it. There are innumerable reviews and articles on great performances and catchy rap songs and its all true.\nSo instead of repeating the same, let me focus on some of the masterfully crafted journeys where you accompany the characters and open different dimensions of emotions and people who are just like us. Its long, full of spoilers but no apologies.Very skilfully, we are conveyed how Murad's (Ranveer Singh's) world is dark, almost claustrophobic before he gets to taste some success. Notice the lights, celebrations and reflections around him when he's sitting alone in darkness, on a new year's eve as a hesitant driver in a car.In the same job and two different journeys Murad comes face to face with the life of more affluent youth and it somehow tells him about his own struggle. In first instance, his boss is told off for giving up on education and how he himself with his hopes of being a graduate will still just leave him at the lowest wrung of society.\nIn the other, while his boss is crying in the backseat of the car, his pathos gushes out in the form of rap lyrics about how our social class structure prohibits him from reaching out just a few inches across and offer some solace.There are rides with Murad and other youth just like him stealing cars - at times for money and at other just for joyrides, maybe just taking out their angst of belonging to the have-nots class and being stuck with it - naukar ka beta hamesha naukar rahega, no matter how hard they try.\nAnother brief scene of a bored looking multitude of people in local train drives home the point - this is how you end up if you are born poor - just one in millions and no hope being any better.Then there are the bus journeys with Safeena (Alia Bhatt) which beautifully convey how the only way to hide their relationship is in plain sight, in public transport. In a society as hypocritical and divided as India, that's true for many other couples as well.And then there is the more deserved joyride for Murad with Sky (Kalki Koechlin) in her car. This time he is exposed to what a rich, affluent minority thinks is wrong with the world. And then we realise what the so called educated class doesn't get - multitudes of people like Murad are still struggling with the lack of basics - Roti, Kapda, Makaan and now maybe internet too.At the end of same journey we get to see a more pronounced flaw in Murad that makes him all the more human - he sort of cheats on his girl friend of 9 years. In the director's own words - why wouldn't he ? After all its his chance of crossing over and be with a person from the other side of society which otherwise wouldn't even acknowledge his presence.It's a four and half stars from me.P.S. So far I thought Ranveer was just another overrated wannabe. But he proves himself a worthy actor with this movie. In case you happen to read this, an apology first and then Well done Ranveer!",

Alia Bhatt too has a very strong role considering 'Muraad' played by Ranveer is the main story line, she delivers yet again a praise worthy performance. Kalki too in her short role gives her absolute best and looks gorgeous. All the supporting actors make this movie very engaging as you genuinely feel for their angst and desperation. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the best movie of 2019. Thumbs up to the team of Gully Boy. Great performances, great story, great direction and great music!!!

            "content": "I was wrong like most of the people to compare the Zoya Akhtar's latest flick, Gully Boy, with Eminem's rap-battle Hollywood flick, 8 Mile (2002). In fact, I was disappointed after watching the trailer of Gully Boy and thought - why would a brilliant director like Zoya Akhtar would copy a film from Hollywood ? Is she out of her mind ?Gully Boy is a hard-hitting drama on the world of rappers in slum area of Dharavi. Ranveer Singh is essaying the role of an aspiring rapper and wants to make it big despite all the opposition.I was awe-struck by the Zoya Akhtar's school of film-making when I watched her first film, Luck By Chance. I fell in love with her style after witnessing the cinematic excellence in form of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Though Dil Dhadakne Do was decent, Gully Boy surprised me. Mind you, I was half-asleep when I started watching Gully Boy but my eyes were wide shut open after 15 minutes as I was enjoying each and every moment of first-ever rap battle drama made on Indian silver screen. The moment you start the film, you will be engrossed into the world of Dharavi in Mumbai, considered to be one of the largest slums in Asia. Zoya wonderfully captures the lives of people staying in Dharavi which is simple and yet enriching. Each and every frame beautifully showcases the energy and moments of Dharavi's culture. We are also introduced to the world of Murad and Safeena (brilliantly played by Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt). Since this is a musical drama, the rap music (though alien to the Indian culture) is used in the background along with beat-boxing and goes well with the flow of the film.The second half focus on the beautiful line \"You Only Get One Shot .. Do Not Miss Your Chance To Blow\" from the song \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem from the 8 Mile movie as Murad finally achieves his dream. Hats off to Zoya daring to make a film like Gully Boy even though it stars big names and a big shout to the writers (Zoya herself, Vasundhara Koshy, Reema Kagti and Vijay Maurya) for keeping you engaged till the end (by this time, I was energized and motivated). The songs are wonderfully composed and choreographed, especially with the well-written lyrics. Dialogues are outstanding. Zoya had used the poem from Javed Akhtar (same way she did in ZNMD) and I liked it. On the flip side, the length of the film could have been reduced while the story becomes predictable.Coming to the performances, there is nothing in the world which Ranveer Singh cannot do. The actor who is coming fresh from the success of Padmaavat and Simmba, has moved into a complete different direction with Gully Boy. He does not show the energy this time but emotes superbly through his eyes. He plays the character whom you could easily relate to as many of us have dreams, the spark in our eyes and the fire in our heart to do something which you are born to do. Alia Bhatt is OUTSTANDING. Even though this is a Ranveer Singh's film, the gorgeous actress plays the role of a possessive girlfriend with T. Watch for the scene when she rubs her cheeks before meeting Ranveer Singh in the second half. I liked Siddhant Chaturvedi who plays the mentor to Murad. Vijay Raaz was usual brilliant.Overall, Gully Boy is one of the best cinematic experience to watch and I would highly recommend to watch it. Excellent 4/5",

I was trying to find an error between the line but there wasn't. Movie has taken the suffering of the life, emotion and at the same time make sure that there was a happy moment which people will not fall on boring feelings. Every single rap lyrics were attached with the characters. Movie has taken 4 female characters to show different aspects of an Indian woman. Alia's character was living in typical Muslim family that she has limited social attachment where it made her bit of narrow mided and at the same time she was bit of understanding since she was educated. Otherhand, Sky was the opposite character that lives in different country and culture who understands the practicality and social requirements.

Also he is part of a troubled modest family living in cramped conditions, yet he is constantly lounging around with his gym toned body and floppy seventies hair. He's supposed to be an undergraduate in his final year yet never seen studying. He also seems quite posh and not at all street. The other rappers in comparison are fiery and raging while he is reserved and has no enthusiasm for the challenging macho strut.

Accompanied with a brilliantly done soundtrack that fits so well with the story, it amazes us in every other aspects well. Outstanding performances from every lead actor, well developed characters, and great cinematography made it great altogether! Though in the first portion of the 2nd half slowed down, it catches the rhythm in the end nonetheless. I have a little complaint about the screen time given to Vijay Raj and Sidhant Chaturvedi's characters ; they deserved much more for their characters in my opinion. The emotional touch could have been better with that. Overall a must watch for those people who loves music, especially Rap/Hip-Hop scene in India. And for those people who have passion about anything, this movie will inspire everyone to make their dream true. Everything is possible if you think so.

There are so many things going on near him and he is reacting.\nThis film is a celebration of characters, not just talking about leads. One of the best quality I recon of the film is that Joya told us how to be in the shoes of an artist in most authentic way possible. The influences of creativity, yet fighting with all the hurdles.\nMurad is so grounded and lost in the horrors of being a mediocre person. That there is very little space of doing his thing, but how pain drove him write rap and chase the dream is the main highlight. That is the biggest highlight of the film. Ranveer is phenomenal as Murad. This film is most nuanced telling of being an artist.\nA girl with so many ambition and have little anger issue is our Alia. And this film has the potential to make another spin off of there characters. There are so many characters that needed there own storytelling. That is an achievement.Ya there are parts that I as a viewer questioning that is that really a great film or what? These moments are dragged I think, but due to other brilliance, this can easily be neglected.Music to bahut hard hai hi, I listened every single track except the last one called India 91.

Ranveer's character starts to sing \"APNA TIME AAYEGA\" and a small part of the audience in my theater start to clap on the song beat by beat in the rhythm. And although i was not one of them , but i was surely amazed with the fact that how much this movie and particularly that song has connected with the youth of this country. And i decided to rate it a little higher then i was going to.And on that note i would urge every reader to spent some money and watch this movie in theater with as big audience as possible. Because thats the right way to enjoy this film to its full potential. But even if u watch it at home , convince at-least 2-3 friends of yours to watch it with you. because this movie cant be enjoyed properly watching alone.\nNow i am not some crazy fan of MUMBAI UNDERGROUND RAP SCENE. But i don't hate it either. So my likeness or dis-likeness of the things in this film are not influenced by that.This movie had a very basic story of a Underdog\nchasing his dreams. What made it interesting and different is the Slum Setting, the Rap Scene, the dialogues and most importantly the performances.Zoya Akhtar (the director) and Reema Kagti (who co wrote with Zoya) have a tendency to make movies with deep research and deep understanding about the scenarios of there characters. About Film Industry in LUCK BY CHANCE. About friendship in ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA. And about rich lifestyle and rich peoples' problem in DIL DHADAKNE DO. But this one is the first time where they were making a movie about something which they must have known nothing about before doing research about it. And they did a fabulous job with it. You will never feel that you are getting a view of the lifestyle of slum from outside. You will always feel that you are there with the characters. Thats some strong Direction and Writing.The dialogues were as great as they could have been. All of It fits perfectly with the setting. The one-liners were superb. You are gonna laugh big times , sometimes on really really awkward occasions. Although i would say the jokes were little lesser in quantity and quality if we compare it to ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA & DIL DHADAKNE DO. But thats OK , everything doesn't need to be perfect every-time.The chemistry between Ranveer & Alia was amazing. And the intimates scenes were great. In those particular scenes Alia is even better then Ranveer , or you can say she was in more love with Ranveer as compare to the Vice-Versa. In-fact i would very much argue that Alia gave the top performance in this movie among the three leads.But then again how can i forget Siddhant Chaturvedi. As MC Sher he was such a natural performer. From his dialogues to his dressing to his persona , everything about him was just screaming one thing - \"SWAG\". I think he could have a great career in Bollywood.The songs in the movie never hampers the pace. Doori , Mere Gully Main and Apna Time Aayega had the most entertaining videos.Cinematography deserves a special mention (and Nomination). As the movie looked really sleek and very rich . And thats something really difficult to do if 80% of you movie has a setting of SLUM.Two thing which can be said bad about this movie were FIRST the length and SECOND the fact that Ranveer was playing a character much younger thyen his actual age. i mean from nowhere he looks like a college student. But thats just nitpicking in a really good film.I am happy to see that rapping is finally getting more and more importance in India as an ART.8.2/10ANuP APu KuMaR",

We pine for characters, who dare challenge their circumstances, inside and outside, question the authorities and establishments and make a name for themselves, don't we? Always, yes always, we root for the underdogs. Yes, we want them to win. We want them to make it big. Gully Boy tells the story of an underdog making it big. We have seen everything that has been told before, we can anticipate the moves that are going to be taken by the characters. It is another underdog story that has been told. So, what is so special about this story to keep you hooked a couple of hours?\nIf clich\u00e9s are done right, it offers a wonderful ride. Underdog stories are about journeys, journeys of their daily struggles, journeys that take the character from the shadows to the limelight, journeys that make you a part of their own surroundings and when the depiction of those journeys is to the point it makes the character believable enough to make him/her of blood and bones. Since the movie is about a rapper, the raps weave itself in the storyline. It's the soul of this film. It tells the stories of the have nots, the grassroot people who does not know what the next day is going to bring them, people at crossroads in their life and how circumstances always deter us to stay away from the unexplored making us doubt later if we have missed something great.\nThe actors did a commendable job. The leads, the side characters, blend with the storyline perfectly. The climax feels a bit rushed and highly predictable, but it's the spirit of the film, the raps and our innate nature, which always wants the underdog to win complements for that. And last but not the least, the film has shown the emerging scene of rap in our country. It has succeeded in bringing it to the masses, which otherwise, was limited to certain connoisseurs of the genre only.",

The movie is so inspirational and at the end, we will be in tears not just for Ranveer but every single character in the movie. Gully Boy also show casts Muslim women like Bollywood has never shown before. Music is the heart of the movie and they did an excellent job not just in rap songs but other musics here and there. Cinematography captures streets of Mumbai like never before. The casting was perfect and anyone would give full marks. Every single actor did a very good job. Gully Boy is one of the best hindi movie made in recent times.",

I also found the crowd applauses very artificial and overall I found that the film has a protagonist who is to possess an innate art. However, i found his voice and style lacking. I didn't hate the film. In fact I think it is a difficult film that had its strong moments. It is not a fun film. It is entertaining. But the real-element was missing for me.

            "content": "'Gully Boy' is a movie which will last for the ages, it is going to be a cult classic and its impact will be huge in the long run. I could just rave on and on about it, It is that good. Everyone in the movie is spectacular, it is a fantastic cast. Ranveer Singh is just spectacularly versatile, Alia Bhat is Fiery, Siddhant Chaturvedi is pure-awesome, Vijay Verma is brilliant and Vijay Raaz is magnificent.\nOn the surface, it's a musical drama but it has so many layers that are revealed over the length of the movie. An inspiring underdog story, A refreshingly mature love story which is going to establish a lot of relationship goals, A rousing coming of age story, A mentor-student relationship unlike anything else, True friendships which last for life, Music which is fiercely independent (like a volcano which spits fire) and The central theme which resonates throughout the movie 'Apna Time Aayega'.\nRanveer Singh is hands-down the soul of this movie, His 'Murad' is a protagonist that works relentlessly hard to beat all odds and achieve his dream. His story is inspiring and it made me root for him throughout the movie. I cannot describe just how moving his performance was. I was in pure awe of his versatility and talent throughout and just wanted to bow down to his talent.\n'Murad's' journey aided by the powerful music, his voice, his friends, his family amd his love is so rousing that I was completely charged and was just brimming with a restless energy by the end, The final performance of 'Apna Time Aayega' was the perfect culmination, just perfect.\nZoya Akhtar has created a one of a kind masterpiece with 'Gully Boy'. The movie is one indulgent experience, a perfect harmony of craft, execution and heart. The music, The writing, The direction and The cinematography (Mumbai has never been shown like this anywhere, it was just spectacular) just engulfed me. I loved every second of this movie even though it was on the longer side but I wouldn't want to change anything if I had the power to do so.",

            "content": "I want to applaud the makers here for choosing such brave and fresh content. Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti have done a fantastic job in writing the movie. To make a movie on a budding rapper residing in the bylanes of dharavi slum in mumbai, there was always a chance that the movie may not connect with all. But be rest assured, this movie is gripping and infact makes you fall in love with rapping.\nFirst and foremost, the setting feels extremely real and authentic, Jay Oza's cinematography must be applauded here. The characters are real, these are people we see around us everyday. Hence, the movie connects very easily with all.\nRanveer Singh is on a roll! Padmaavat's Khilji to playing to the gallery in Simmba and then this! He's having the time of his life. He plays Murad with such rawness, vulnerability and earnestness you completely forget who you're watching on screen. Furthermore, add to this his rapping. This is arguably his best performance according to me.\nAlia Bhatt has limited screen time but whenever she is there, she sets the screen on fire. She is hilarious! Vijay Raaz is fantastic as Murad's father. Now coming to the find of the movie, Siddhant Chaturvedi as MC Sher, based on Divine's character. Siddhant owns his character right from the time he appears on screen. In some of his scenes, he almost steals the thunder from Ranveer. That goes on to say a lot. Definitely, an actor to watch out for in future.\nAnother big factor is music. The songs hit it absolutely out of the park. Each and every song is special in it's way and keeps the movie flowing. Zoya Akhtar also uses some of her father, Javed Akhtar's poems in the movie, doorie and ek hi raasta mesmerizingly.\nThe movie doesn't have any downsides as such, but it probably goes on for 10 mins too long. But even that is a bit of nitpicking.\nGo and watch gully boy. A film like this doesn't get made in bollywood everyday.",

            "content": "I have always criticized Akhtar's heavy handed portrayal of simple narratives and her \"over the top\" character play. But Gully Boy is a complete overhaul from whatever she has done until now. This film is way more nuanced and raw. Yet there is that quintessential Akhtar Family's poetic touch in the film. The whole film unravels itself as one giant ballad.Writing is mind-shatteringly good. It is quite rare in Indian cinema to see a film which has right amount of drama, emotions and rawness (along with that Bollywood charm of course). There are very few writers out there who can mix all these properly. Kagti and Akhtar are, as they have proved time and again.Each and every character has been crafted meticulously. If one just picks up a character and follows his (sole) journey throughout the film, it might be a story on its own. Though this level of character design is quite common in Western Cinema, but Bollywood still relies heavily on \"heroism\" of an individual, rather than creating an ensemble. This film though breaks that stereotype.\nThe acting and casting is on point. Kudos to the team. Though I am still not sure, what should I expect Ranveer Singh's character's age to be (I know he is supposed to be 20 something but he doesn't look like that). Otherwise the whole cast has done a great job.The cinematography was nothing unique but was more than enough to not get in the way of the great storytelling. And the music is surely going to be Awards Season favourites.This film is simply revolutionary, just like what Hip Hop is all about.",

The songs added some extra boost to make the Excitement level higher and the Final Product DOES NOT DISAPPOINT AT ALL ! Finally, Zoya Akhtar makes a Film with Logic as well as Entertainment. Gully Boy will go down in memory as Zoya Akhtar's Most Entertaining and Appealing film till date. Gully Boy is a Winner from each and every aspect, hence the Box Office Success and Love from Audience is Gauranteed.\nThe Best thing about Gully Boy is, it never goes illogical, Boring or too much intellectual (which was a problem with some previous films of the same director) yet it manages to pull off the enough conviction. Zoya Akhtar goes to the core of small things of the Characters, for instance the Language, the Swag, The Local Humour, The High-Five, Emotional Connect etc. Gully Boy has it's own zone of storytelling, which is curved towards the Realistic Lifestyle of Characters, thier accent with Local Flavour of Mumbai. Ranveer Singh nails as Muraad, not to speak more but he is probably the Contendar of every Award Show Nominees list. Aliaa Bhatt is Fearless and you'll love her on screen. Every member of Cast lives the Character, with special mention to Siddhant Chaturvedi as Sher. Music is Top Notch and certainly the Biggest USP of the film. The Raps will make you groove on it, especially the Lyrics will hit your hearts. Cinematography speaks through it's angle, the Slums, the Club looks realistic even though most of them are shot with Deam light.\nOverall, Gully Boy is a Treat to watch, especially for Rap and Music Lovers. It doesn't really miss anything as all factors like Acting, Script, Screenplay, Music, Direction hits the bar by enough Margin. Gully Boy miss out Quality in few scenes, nevertheless it is still a Winner like i said before. Nothing is more pleasing when you see, Zoya Akhtar arrives in a Proper Commercial Entertainer Zone without losing her Content.RATING - 7/10*",

Blatant rip off is the right word, though) is quite a mediocre film spun around \"Muslim Ghettoes of Mumbai\".Gully Boy should be watched on TV when there is nothing else to do...or if you have some energy left, just grab a Blu-Ray of 8 MILE and let yourself immerse in the wonder that the original Hollywood movie is!!!!Three stars for Alia's performance...rest is just unbearable :(This sort of movie is for those who just want to spend some time in a Mall and nothing much to do...not enjoyable cinema in any sense.

Ranvir Singh plays the title role of a 22 year old living in a slum of Mumbai with an abusive father and needs to overcome the obstacles to give wing to his dreams, with him suitably cast in the role. Supporting is a short but a beautiful role of Alia Bhatt.

It's a must watch guys!Spolier ahead:-\nI just didn't like the fact that ranveer's character cheated on alia's character !

Dharavi 17 is where he stays and his daily struggles,his exposure to rap, his love life, a mistake in relationship,his guide,his well-wisher,his bonding with parents.. A common man's journey actually. We all have such stories in our life. Zoya has brilliantly captured the gully life here and shows how it moulds oneself with the amount of time you spend with people around you.With every movie this guy gets better.So once again Ranveer does his one of career's best. Alia is the show stealer with dialogues that gets the whistle. We have three supporting Vijays here in this movie Vijay Raaz(father),Vijay Maurya(Uncle),Vijay Varma(Friend) and they are spot on. Amruta Subash(mother) expresses her life's melancholy brilliantly.Kalki as sky gets limited screen time but packs a punch and last but not the least the game changer Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher). He overpowers Ranveer in many scenes.I won't stop if I start mentioning how apt and brilliant is the screenplay here.. Cinematography by Jay Oza and crisp editing by Nitin Baid are felt on the screen as the movie even being slow in pace doesn't be a boring affair in 2 hrs 35 mins. Zoya has struck a win win here.Finally, what made it more lively was screen time for real life rappers like Emiway Bantaai,Stony Psycho and Dope Daddy from Dopedealicz , Kaambhaari and also a second of Brodha V.Just felt like saying this that how well the hip hop culture has been able to connect with our generation. Emiway Bantaai's one second presence in first half and the crowd erupted like never seen before. Also , his acts in second half are treat to watch. Not to forget Kaam Bhaari is there too.All in all 9/10 from my side. Go for it folks. Watch it for a beautiful journey of the guy from streets.",

It also shows finely the fusion of western hippy culture with conservative Muslim society with a paint of Indianess alongside it. An impressive work.Alia bhatt is genuine to her role. The reality of muslim household regarding freedom to women is well shown. Ranbeer performance sometimes falls flat in statement delivery but its negligible. The direction and casts are very impressive. The movie gives the message of following the hearts call due to which I think it's a movie of optimism.It has an international appeal. The movie was selected as Oscar nomination where many criticized it. I don't think its wrong. It deserves as nominee by the standards of its theme and narrations. A modern musical film from Bollywood. Zoya Akhtar proved definitely to be one of the best female directors of India. Kudos to the talents of the Akhtar family. A straight 97/100.",

If you enjoy watching movies based on and / or inspired by the real life struggles of successful people who exist in this world, then you will love this movie and agree with my opinions also.Ranveer Singh gives the best performance of his career so far in this masterpiece movie titled \"Gully Boy\". However, I must admit, Sidhaant Chaturvedi definitely gave him tough competition in the movie in the role of M C Sher - his mentor / rap-collaborator / music partner. Alia Bhatt was good in her role, and so were the supporting cast such as Vijay Raaz, Vijay Varma and so on.Zoya Akhtar proves once again that she is a brilliant movie-director, actually one of the very best. Farhan Akhtar is clearly the best-young producer alive in India - Farhan Bhai, you rock man - always keep producing outstanding movies like this. Once again, I have to bring up Ranveer Singh's name again - this is because Ranveer has put his heart and soul in this career-best performance in and as \"Gully Boy\". Keep doing more realistic roles such as this one, brother. You shined brightly in this movie, and I hope and pray that you continue to do so.",

On either side of the ideological divide, we are people at the end of the day.Movies like Mulk, series like Leila, point a few out as villains exaggerate things about them and demonize them, and further the socio-cultural rift by such polarization...Gully Boy on the other hand, flips the perception upside down, presents it as a more universal underdog story, creates a sense of empathy for the protagonist, in a very subtle manner furthers the idea of inclusion and most people love it.",

We have seen plenty of such movies before, both in Hollywood and Bollywood. But what elevates Gully Boy from the average is the way it has been written and directed. Zoya Akhtar has used a skillful mix of entertainment and messaging. There are hundreds of little things in the film that ring so true and you can easily empathise with. Gully Boy is the nickname of the rapper Murad Ahmed (Ranveer Singh) who emerges from the bowels of Dharavi, the world's biggest slum, to bag the big prize. Along the way he and his girlfriend Safina (Aila Bhat) smash many myths without getting overly preachy. The rap sequences, and there are plenty of them, are the best parts of the film. Energetically shot, they mince no words in pitting the haves against the have-nots. The subliminal messaging is obvious. \"Apna Time Aayega\" (Our Time Will Come) has the potential to become an anthem of the underdog in the election year. Ranveer Singh underplays Gully Boy and brings a terrific touch of hurt and melancholy to the character. Aila Bhat sizzles as Gully Boy's girlfriend and aspiring surgeon. The movie liberally uses the street slang of Mumbai. Zoya Akhtar has packed a punch in Gully Boy. Don't miss it.",

Gully Boy is one of this kind, it enters in your mind first and then it captures your heart and then, you are all cheering Ranveer Singh, rapping on the stage. The movie and the rap seem to be so real that you could feel the energy, thrill, and zeal of it. You find yourself one among the audience and you just want to cheer Ranveer Singh aka Gully Boy to increase his adrenaline, so he can deliver his best rap performance.Zoya Akhtar put the soul to the movie with her flawless and impeccable direction. She carries the movie in such a realistic way that it makes you think that all the character and incidents are real and you are right there and watching them.But the spirit of \"Gully Boy\" lies in its character and their marvelous performance. As, I started with Ranveer Singh, who has undoubtedly delivered his career-best makes you forget the ups and downs of your life with its stubbornness, zeal, energy level and electrify raps. Alia Bhatt as we all know is a wonderful actress has once again proved that she is the leading lady of Bollywood, in such a short span of her career in the film industry, she has stunned us with so many amazing performances. In Gully Boy too, she has once again impressed and entertained us with her impeccable dialogue delivery and facial expression. She is just awesome. After the leading pair, another character who has left his mark in the movie is the debutant \"Siddhant Chaturvedi\" the young atom bomb. He played his character to the utmost point and leaves us praising and cheering form him while watching the movie. He is undoubtedly the next vVcky Kaushal of Bollywood. Great debut by him. Rest all the support cast was good.The last but and least, the thing without that this movie cannot be completed is its raps. The raps are so good, much much better than Honey Singh and Badshah. I wonder how talented people are. The lyrics and the music both are so awesome and electrifying that they take a fiery and zestful you out of you.So. at last I want to say that \"Gully Boy\" is one of the movies which will entertain you, make you think, will groove you with its music and stunned you with the power-packed performances involved.In short, if you want to see something real and different, do not wait, just head towards the cinema hall.",

Dil ko rulaya, asli hip hop se milaya aur apun ko rap ka fan banaya.\"Gully Boy is probably one of the finest films coming from Bollywood. It's loosely based on the lives of rappers Divine and Naezy and is a story of an underdog who dreams big kyuki 'apna time ayega'.Murad played by Ranveer is a boy who lives in the slums of Mumbai and writes poetry. He is in a beautiful love story with a feisty Safeena, an aspiring doctor played by Alia. Then there is the character of MC Sher played by Siddhant, an underground rapper who takes Murad under his wings and mentors him, guiding him in the art of rap battles. Murad lives a hard life plagued by poverty where in his father puts in money into his education so that he can get a white collar job. Then there is the conflict in his family. And you can clearly see he doesn't get along well with his father played by a brilliant Vijay Raaz. The film beautifully narrates Murad's journey into discovering himself and going on and becoming successful despite all the hardships he faces.The film is two and a half hours long but never feels like it. The magic that Zoya weaves on the camera is amazeballs. The central character might be Murad but every side character gets a piece of the pie. This is a rarity in Bollywood. Special mention to Siddhant Chaturvedi as MC Sher, what a character. Such brilliance as he goes toe to toe with Ranveer. He is magnanimous. Ranveer baba is in top form. This is the first film where you see his emotions do the bulk of the work. His expressions brilliantly portrays his hardships, his love, his passion. You can't help but root for his character. Alia surprisingly was used very less. But she literally lit up the screen while she was at it. Ekdum dhop-tich wo sabko. Vijay Verma who plays Moin, Murad's friend who does odd criminal jobs also does a brilliant work. We see different levels of their friendship throughout and the final level tears me up. Rest of the star cast too does a mighty fine job and hold the film together never letting it get boring.The cinematography captures the slum life in Mumbai in a oddly beautiful way. Quite a few shots are close ups right in your face engaging you as an audience. The difference in high rises overlooking the slums thus showing the disparity is brilliant. The other highlight of the film has to be its music. Kudos to all the artists who came together to give us an album of a lifetime. An 18 track movie is unheard of in Bollywood. Every song comes with a meaningful scene attached to it and the lyrics match the scene like puzzle pieces. Zoya as a director is brilliant and this has to be her best work till date. Her research on the hip hop culture seems to be near perfect. She along with Reema Kagti have written an amazing screenplay with some astonishing dialouges by Vijay Maurya. The Mumbai ya tapori lingo is so much fun to hear. It stays with you even after the credit rolls come to an end.The movie is not only an underdog story but has a beautiful love story at heart and an ode to the city of Mumbai. The film can be a great motivator to the audience so as to never give up on your dreams no matter who you are or where are you coming from. I'm thankful to Zoya and the team for giving us such a brilliant movie. This one is definitely a must watch and atleast 3 times in a theatre.",

Special mention to Alia Bhatt and Siddhant Chaturvedi ( your MC Sher).. absolutely nailed their parts and played parallel leads to perfection. . . .The movie is well paced and I literally could have watched the movie for another two hours!Music, songs, rap - everything is terrific, to the point, soul stirring at times and definitely drives you in!!!

His previous characters like simmba, alaudin khilji, ram rajadi all required high sense of strength and Ranveer is exactly what the characters are: so energetic. But in Gully Boy, he is different. He captured the pain inside of being raisee in slums, to parents who both are at each other's throat, with no money, and worst, being told to stop dreaming because of their reality. I applaud the director and producer who dared to take this context of india to the big screen. Poverty, together with unhygienic conditions of living.. but it didn't stop a boy from achieving his dreams.Apart from Ranveer, Alia Bhatt did a great job too. Feisty, intelligent girl with lots of tricks in mind. Chaturvedi was convincing as a rapper. Koechlin is as carefree as always.Great songs. Not your typical hindi beats but they sounded great.

But Alia....what an act !!!! Oh just loved her. An entire essay can be written on her performance in this movie!!! Siddhant's also brilliant !!! Only a very few issues, like impact of Murad's writing on his fellow underground rappers at the beginning seems bit obvious. It can be presented more realistically. Though, later the impact of his writing were deeply felt by everyone for sure. Otherwise the movie contains- brilliant portrayal of every character, top notch direction, Hollywood standard camera work, brilliant & hard-hitting sound-tracks........all-in-all an INSPIRING showcase of Gully reality ....HARD HAI...!!!!",

Beyond the family he has his friends Moeen, Salman and others and his girlfriend Safina played by Aliaa Bhat.\nMurad and Safina have been dating for 9 years behind their parents back and things have been going smoothly for them. Until a girl sends Murad - Valentine type messages and the girl gets thulped by Safina. Safina comes from a well off family and is on track to become a doctor like her father. In priorities her education comes first. She's also very snippy and possessive where Murad is concerned. Yet, both are equally supportive of each other's education and ambition.\nOne day at a college fest a girl singing on stage gets booed off the stage by a couple of boys who comment on how boring she is, not just because of her song but also her looks. The next act in the lineup is MC Sher who takes the mic and starts rapping which is how Murad gets sucked into the underground world of rappers.\nMurad takes his daily experiences and pens them down. Every insult, every fight, every moment of happiness, the struggle everything gets penned to form the rap. After his first stage and battle he only gets better and more comfortable with not just who he is but actually putting his heart out for the world to see.\nMurad's mentor Sher finds an outlet in rap. He gets his anger and frustration out by singing. His father's an alcoholic and his mother has abandoned them. This is why he constantly tells Murad to vent and not bottle it up.\nShot with Dharavi in the backdrop this movie is definitely about the underdog breaking the wave but the reasons why this movie stood for me are because:\nDharavi is just another location that the protagonist comes from yet there is a scene where foreigners are taken around because that's what they want to see. *Eye Roll* (Which I think was a jab at a certain movie made about slums in India.)\nIt isn't like Murad has a secret gift that he suddenly unw(raps) one day. He gradually gets better at it and you see the character grow.\nThe movie is about Murad but all the actors in the movie have done an excellent job and you'll know when you watch.\nThe story is very real. It isn't one of Zoya Akhtar's destination location wala story. It is closer to reality than any of her other movies.\nWatch it if you need motivation. You'll surely get some. All in all to me it was a fun movie. I liked it. Aliaa Bhat was amazing and whether you like rap/hiphop or not you will like this movie if you care for the lyrics.",

Seeing a grandeur movie with lot of costumes and all. Ranveer Singh and Zoya brought me to this title. We have to admit that audiences are vary to some extent. There will be saying this movie is crap, boring, masterpiece, Oscan material and such. To justify a movie, you have to watch and endeavour what is served. Gully Boy served a multilayered story focusing on Murad's dream to rap. I can say this is not Zoya's finest, but also not that bad. I realize it will be hard on elaborating background story why Murad loves rap. What happened in first scene is not helping at all. She made hooks in the movie which force us to see who is Murad--and it happened he live in patriarchy family with polygamy issue--which is not elaborate because it is just focus on catching a dream. Safeena and Murad's story is showing the inequality and class divide. There will be a lot pros and cons about this but there are a lot of movies talking about this. Capturing the generation gap without emphasize to Digital India is a smooth way from Zoya. Oh, don't you forget about child labour which is not very advisable to do so. Sky's presence was somehow problematic, but I keen to believe Zoya tried to send a message, sometimes couple need a space from each other. There are many flaws (in my point of view) but it seems won't matter much.Act:\nRanveer Singh is showing another avatar of him which he never put in larger scale. From Bitto Sharma to Murad Ahmad. He's not piling up similar avatar like SRK, but there are down at the pit as well.\nAlia Bhatt. She has contribute at minimum level but her portraying Safeena is quite bold and smart. Over protective yet has no gut to tell to her parents. Good job, Safeena.\nSiddhant Chaturvedi. This debutant surely know how to work with big star such Ranveer.\nVijay Raaz. Outstanding Father. He is surely another version of Ronit Roy's avatar of Abusive Father/Husband.It is not my favorite genre and scene, so 2 point to deduct.\nRanveer Singh added 4 points.\nAlia Bhatt added 2 points.\nRappers added 2 points.\nStory is just 1 point for me, it is beautiful, but not in my favor.

            "content": "So a lot of people at the release of the Ranveer Singh Starrer Gull Boy straight away began comparing to the Eminem Oscar winning 8 Mile. There is no doubt that there are some similarities but calling it a copy is just not correct. It has been said by the director of the film Zoya Aktar that people did compare it to some other films but when the Mumbai rappers who played a major role in the story development and filming of the film had been interviewed, there was many accounts when they mentioned that after seeing 8 Mile they were inspired and motivated to evolve their skill in this art of rapping. So there has been some inspiration from 8 Mile for example the segment where Ranveer's character is participating in a rapping competition, which has similar vibes to the version of the underground rap scene portrayed in 8 Mile. But then again all this is telling us the story of Divine and Neazy who are very up in the Indian rap scene in and outside of India (outside as I follow them event hough I'm living in Australia). So personally it is not a copy of 8 Mile but they do share similar vibes, but personally Gully Boy was able to play with more from the plot and use of music overall personally making Gill Boy the better film when compared to 8 Mile.The acting from all the supporting cast was so genuine you would feel like you are watching a documentary but the people in the documentry do not know that there are cameras everywhere. What I am trying to say is that the performance from the cast was on point.The acting highlights are definitely the performance of Ranveer Singh as the main protagonist, Aliah Bhatt as she yet again showed use how versitile and just natural she can be on intense and bold characters like the one she played in Gully Boy and Udta Pubjab. Others who stole the show in every scene which they were apart of includes the sensational and believable performance of Vijay Raaz, Vijay Varma who is just so talented and the under appreciated performance of Siddhant Chaturvedi who is very close to the character is Ranveer Singh through out the film. And the last supporting cast which I will mention is definitely the performance of the beautiful Kalki Koechlin, she was just a privlidge to watch on the big screen again after seeing her in Scared Games (before writing this I saw the film again and yes I am aware Scared Games season 2 came out after Gully Boy).Overall a must watch as the whole film was amazing as the universe which it creates it is able to portray real life Mumbai really well. Only problem was the ending as I and many others was wanting more by the finishing moments of the film. I say this as literally when the film ended I looked ay my brother and said \"they're actually gonna finish it like this\". Personally felt like some bigger was gonna happen or like another 5 minutes cincludimg the movie would be placed to end it at a high note but they finished the film in very lack later manner. If it wasn't for the ending this is definitely a perfect film but ending was the only problem.8/10 would definetly recommended.",

Ranveer Singh is phenomenal in the whole movie. Underdog Siddhant Chaturvedi gave a totally unexpected performance. It was tough to tell weather he's a real actor or a rapper. Alia bhatt was gorgeous in all her scene, her performance is a must watch. Vijay raaz is definitely the most underrated actor of the bollywood. Such a great performance by him. kudos!!Now, the main heros of this movie, Zoya akhtar on the director's chair and Jay Oza the cinematographer. jay Oza shown dharavi streets with a great camera work, most of the scenes are unforgettable just because of the lighting effects and the use of camera. Sound editing had to be on the top in a musical drama like Gully boy.\nZoya akhtar has never failed with her work and same happens with the Gully Boy, a must must watch for the everyone who calls them a movie lover, Watch it if you want to see why bollywood has changed and this change is positive.",

            "content": "I'll begin with a disclaimer. Gully boy is not a bad film, neither is it brilliant. It is a decent commercial film. But the only reason I'm writing a review for it is because I found the film worth analyzing because it could have been so much more despite it getting a few things right.\nFirst of all, and this irked me a lot. Murad's mother is angry about the fact that his father has gotten a new wife. Murad feels empathy for his mother. Later in the film, Murad cheats on his current girlfriend Safeena after spending a fun and liberating night out with Sky. And then he begins to lie to Safeena. Now, psychologically speaking, this does not make any sense. If he feels empathy for his own mother, who is the first, he should feel empathetic towards Safeena who is the first in his life and should go back to her immediately. He would not be able to cheat on her and then lie to her. That isn't how human nature works. It's definitely not take advice from a friend, seeing how casual Sky is with MC Sher as well and Sky rejecting his sense of identity by telling him that it doesn't matter where he is from, when it clearly matters to Murad. And even then it takes Safeena almost forcing him to come back to her by manipulating Salman, before he does come back. This is not to say that the relationship between them isn't one of the highlights of the film. That is the one thing the film gets very accurate and real more than the relationships we've seen on screen. Safeena is a beautiful character essayed perfectly by Alia Bhatt with her manipulative smile and a blink that borders on being a threat.\nAnother thing, by going into the idea of Doori inspired by a random event with a girl he drives reduced the impact of the song rather than elevate it. It'd have been elevated if it was inspired by his mother, who he is unable to protect despite loving her. Then I would get more of a sense of who Murad is and where he comes from.\nAlso following up the fight between his mother and father, which was quite intense, with the recording of Mere gully mein is poor structuring. We don't get a sense of what Murad is feeling because he is struggling in his reality at home while he is having fun shooting a music video. This gives a lack of emotional continuity to the character. If the filmmaker intended to show that this is a way out for him from the struggles of life, it does not explain the purpose behind the angst in his lyrics, when music is just a way to get away from problems.\nNow let's get to the angst, the angst in the lyrics is rarely replicated in the narrative. We never see him seeking for 'Azadi'. The system is responsible for Murad's condition, but the system is reduced to making us feel just for Vijay Varma's character. The system itself plays no part in Murad's narrative. So his journey is more a search for identity than one riddled with angst and hence the lyrics seem on a completely different tangent from the narrative of the film. Contrast this with the way lyrics and narrative come together in 'Muqqabaaz' as angst against the system and we realize that Gully boy fails to tie those two things.\nNow this is not to say that there are no good things in the film. Ranveer Singh's performance is quite restrained and manages to affect you in certain scenes especially him looking into the camera in 'Doorie'. Alia Bhatt is quite charismatic. Vijay Varma dominates all the scenes he is in, especially when he flips at Murad. Siddhant Chaturvedi is cool to the bone, even though his character fades in importance as the narrative goes on and stays just as the initial mentor. Sky is disposable from the narrative. Her character's purpose could have been served by MC Sher himself. She could have been reduced to just an affair. The background score rings even after the film is done and it is definitely one of the music albums of the last couple of years. Especially the Dub Sharma tracks 'Azadi', 'Apna Time aayega' and 'Jingostan'. Divine really steps it up in the songs he has sung. Ranveer's rapping could have been more genuine, though without the accent he is trying to place in there.\nThe major problems of the film lie in the structure of the screenplay and the edit. Doorie's edit does not work at all and I was praying while going into the film that maybe the video they have released is just for promotion and this is not how the song has been cut in the film, but it turned out to be exactly that way.\nThe cinematography of Jay Oza is exasperating. At times it is brilliant while at times it just does not fit the event. Especially in 'Apna time aayega' the only thing that elevates the scene is the music. That glitzy gold background om the stage does not help proceedings at all. Though I have to congratulate him on the drone shots of Bombay. I've never seen Bombay shot that way before and those shots really create a visceral effect along with the shot in which Ranveer Singh sits in the car as the party goes on all night.\nSome of Zoya Akhtar's choices are really interesting. Like making Murad a really passive character in the beginning, really detached from life, constantly being dragged into situations by the people around him, until he hears MC Sher rap. That's the first time he takes the initiative to do amything. But then he goes back to his passivity and there lies the problem of the structure. It does not just extend the length of the film, but also creates a wall between us understanding Murad. And one important thing in all of this is that if the protagonist is satisfied with his partner and has found solace there, he has also sorted things with his father, why is he ambitious at all, apart from being able to prove to his father and mama that being an artist can bring him out of his circumstances. That is an emotion that won't work because that is not what the film is setting up. The film is setting up the circumstances that Murad is brought up in. So it isn't about escaping those circumstances through momey and fame but doing something that facilitates other people escape those circumstances as well. Here, Zoya Akhtar chooses to make no statements. Not everybody can become an artist and find a way out of those conditions. That is not a viable solution. So, at the end Murad is just somebody who makes his locality proud. But does nothing to change the circumstances that made him who he is and will do the same to many others after him.\nIt is definitely worth a watch, but fails to live up to the expectations Zoya Akhtar herself had set through her short in 'Lust Stories' and the initial promos of the film.",

            "review_title": "A film that doesn't take the audience for granted",
            "content": "There are three major flaws with the film. And I am not kidding -\n1. The underground rap scene of Mumbai/India is not greatly popular. Beyond niche audience people are unaware of even the two pioneering characters who have inspired the story. This makes the characters less relatable.\n2. The music itself is repetitive and isn't rising. There is no obvious way of understanding why one rap is better than the other. The wordings are hugely meaningful, the beats are basic and even the much hyped rap number, \"Apna time ayega\" is paean to wistful thinking and not to the blood sweat tearful grit of everyday existence.\n3. And the last major problem, the graph or narrative of the film is winner-takes-all sports drama. This is so dumbed down version of any reality that it is problematic that directors are still using this trope. Even after all the success in life, there is the next day, the next project, the next failure, winnings and winners are just momentary. Think of the American Idol 17 winner, after 15 minutes of fame and holding the trophy above your head, American Idol 18 auditions are already on.\nNow these major flaws out of the way, there are six things which work for the film and how!\n1. Cinematography. It is a major win for the film to use the real location, aerial shots and all the lowliness and glory of Mumbai/Dharavi-17. Kudos! However, the major win is the beautiful frames through its entire runtime. The film deserved all awards in this category.\n2. Dialogue. Everything in the film sound improvised except a couple of dialogues by Alia Bhatt and Vijay Raj's cribbing about Ranveer eating a lot of food and wasting money for his education. This is significant. It is almost unbelievably great. Vijay Maurya deserves every possible awards in the category.\n3. Direction. And Art Direction by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani. So when a director gets a script, or in this case co-writes a script, nothing is there to begin with except (in this case) a good story. She has to imagine every single thing to the last detail to make the story come alive in the film. This is an extremely daunting process if there is no benchmark. Zoya Akhtar introduces a sub-genre to Bollywood film and deftly avoid all possible Bollywood genres that the movie could seek to fit in - drama, biography, documentary, experimental, musical, coming-of-the-age. Instead she chooses an yet unexplored for Bollywood sub-genre called \"Hood films\". The sub-genre is defined by discrimination, crime, broken families, drugs, Rap culture. Societal/moral/financial upliftment is not the ultimate goal of the films in this genre. The goal is always to tell the story of the marginalized. And Zoya veers into this unfamiliar territory (both for her and the audience) and stay true.\n4. Editing. Of course, you can't see good editing, you see the final product and have no counterfactual data on how what-is-kept compares to what-is-not-kept. Bad editing is often easily visible. If you come out of theater feeling it could have been 30 minutes shorter, the film is most likely badly edited. The great thing about this film is that it could have been more tightly edited, at least a few scenes could have been shortened, especially some of the scenes where Kalki is in, some of the scenes where Alia is in, some of the scenes where Siddhant is in. I am not talking about cutting the story arcs, just cutting scenes to make the film tighter. But the editor does not do so. Why? You can justify it by saying fleshing out characters, having emotional breathing space and so on. But my guess is the editor wanted the cinematography to shine, why? It was clear to Nitin Baid (editor) that the audience is largely unfamiliar with the music scene and its practitioners, the first touch point with relatability lies with the city and the characters. The editing is slack to accommodate the audiences involvement with the situation rather than the underlying music. I am saying if it is a sports movie about Indian Rugby, and the audience has no clue what the game is, the editor has to create a space so that you can identify with the context where these Rugby players are coming from. Else you need to explain Rugby rules a la Aamir Khan's Dangal.\n5. Casting. I mean what a great casting. You see these same set of actors acting in all Hindi films, right? So why would you, as an audience, believe Ranveer is Murad and not Alauddin Khilji, especially if you loved him so much in that role? This is where the casting crew comes in. They have to visualize that the same actor has played very different roles will fit in as a rapper with street-credence. This is NOT same as casting Shahrukh, Salman, Hrithik and other \"superstars\". Superstars in Hindi films generally reprise the same character in various guises and bring the same charisma/charm to the screen. SRK practically acts the same role in all his films. This is similar to the difference in singing between Vishal Dadlani and Arijit Singh. Vishal in his many songs sings the same range, maintains the same texture and poor Arijit has to revisit his repertoire and bring something different every time. The casting for this film is great. Again, it should win all awards in the category.\n6. Acting. OF COURSE. Right? Acting is undeniably great. But, there is a but. Ranveer Singh, who is really effective, is not the best actor in the film. Far ahead is Alia Bhatt, and Siddhant Chaturvedi. Why? Because many of their reactions to the scenes come as unexpected. There is a scene inside a darkened train compartment, present among four other people, where Alia just repeats being called, \"tod-fod\" (or something like that). And then she stands up to leave with Ranveer. Nothing else happens in that scene. But her expressions come across as puzzling and fresh. This is repeated in at least 2-3 more times in the film, for example Alia crying and pleading to her father to continue her studies. And for Siddhant, he is marvelous. He deserves the best debutante award in all award shows. Finally, how good is Ranveer Singh? There is a small issue with his portrayal. At least a few times he breaks character of being coy, shy, underdog and shows his \"hero\"/\"star\" side. For example, his climbing wall to enter Alia's home is extremely cliched hero-like. Ranveer, at the pick of his game, should have insisted in skipping these things. There are at least 2-3 more that doesn't suit the character arc and extremely convenient/lazy story telling.I have this theory, no good film ever declares in the course of the film, that it is good or its characters are great and to be lauded for being so. Like the first scene of Manikarnika, Rani Laxmi Bai is already a hero, just born as a child and blessed to be as great as Rama, in the next scene she is hunting tiger right in the middle of a jump. Only a rubbish film demands that you, as an audience, accept the character's greatness from the opening scene. This is akin to taking the audience for granted.\"Gully Boy\" would not take you for granted through its 2 hour 30 minutes running time even for once. It passes Bechdel test when Alia talks to her mom about the act of lying. It tests your intelligence when you feel torn about a character that uses children as drugs carriers and can't suitably take one position or the other (also about Ranveer stealing cars). It mesmerizes you with cinematography. It introduces a sub-genre to mainstream Bollywood and stays true to it. And finally, it tells a human story full of different shades of gray and stays true to the struggle of the daily existence.I give this film a 9 out of 10. The 1 mark is deducted is for a few unwarranted herogiri that was introduced in Ranveer's character. Exchange on note-taking in the class, entering Alia's home through toilet window, etc which were lazy.PS: The best scene in the film is where Kalki asks if Ranveer and Siddhant have a contract with some label. Awesome!",

The raps already shown in trailer and video songs are all what the movie offers, no other rap is there. The movie basically focuses on the journey of Muraad (Ranveer) from living in gully to performing in Nas's event after winning the rap competition. Nothing more. The movie could have offered much more but it's another opportunity wasted. Acting by all the actors was appreciable though. The only thing lacking was more punch to the story.",

            "content": "The film which revolves around story of a GULLY BOY who aspires to become a RAP STAR, which was quite an entry for the BOLLYWOOD into the newest genre of hip-hop hitting the Background Score and the Album Hits. Music has undergone changes from Party Songs, EDM, Remixes and Remakes uptil 2019, but Gully Boy has set up the stage for Music Industry in Bollywood.\nDirector of Photography creates magic with precise arial shots over the Mumbai Slums. A lot of stunts in \"Meri Gully Mein\", designed by Bosco-Ceaser were marvelous and jaw dropping. Some of them were so fluent didnt seem real, if it wasent then commends the handling by VFX Team.\nThe movie mostly stands out in its dialogues with all the Tapori Dialogues failing to catch sometimes but keeps you entertained throughout.\nBut with dialogues limited, the film was most about expressions by Ranveer and Alia. The stellar performance by award winners of 2018, winning hearts again this year. The support cast by Kalki, Siddhant, Vijay Raaz, Vijay Verma on pars with the lead of the film.\nThe story seems a lot more predictable, plots unneeded, actions unjustified, and 150 mins long movie.\nThe direction of the movie was great as the movie justified Murad's story with other characters in his circle. The story showed the true feminism with Alia Bhatt's continuation of her studies. The story sewed to show how relationship of Murad stands out with all the people in his cirle of friends, mentor, affair, girlfriend, family with abusive father, etc. The cliffhanger by Zoya Akhtar was the best part in the film yet she discloses the suspense very next second.",

Zoya Akhtar answers the question with a solid No. Gully boy, for me is one of the few Bollywood movies that combine craft with wholesome entertainment. Everything , the acting performances, the dialogues , the cinematography portraying the Mumbai as seen from the eyes of a struggling rapper, the story lines is exceptionally done.The reason Gully boy works is because the emphasis it plays on every character of the movie. Sure, it is the story of Murad played marvellously by Ranveer Singh, but the supporting characters have their own stories which are never sidelined in the movie. The love story between Safeena and Murad ( Alia and Ranveer) is unique and the chemistry is exceptional. There are several nuances in the movie that portray on screen the struggles and pain going in the minds of the actors.The music is exceptional. I just wish we get to watch more movies like this.

            "content": "As an American who watches a lot of amazing Hindi films (thank goodness for subtitles), I find it absolutely appalling how Indians will go through the most ridiculous lengths to bring down a film (such as pretending to be a foreigner online and bash the film delusionally) due to: fanbase hatred (a fan of Actor X despises Actor Y so he will spam imdb, youtube, etc with bad ratings and trash talk Actor Y as if the fan gets paid to do so), political leanings, religion, and other nonsensical reasons.Anyway, this movie is based on the real lives of Mumbai's underground rappers and their rise from their heavily underprivleged background to underground sensations. The film is terrific in ALL aspects. The acting was wonderful (Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt and the supporting cast were OUTSTANDING), music (amazing rapping and lyricism in the rap songs, as well as the soundtrack), the cinematography was A+ and it really felt like I was in the Mumbai slum witnessing the characters' livelihoods. Direction was stellar as Zoya Akhtar proves yet again she is one of the best in the businesses. Emotionally it was VERY impactful and very raw and real throughout. Describing the film as inspiring would be a large understatement. It also has very strong feminist themes and values, and offers strong commentary on the life of Mumbai society's disenfranchised people and groups.The negative reviews you see here are by jobless clowns. Do some netizens in India have nothing better to do? Study? Work? Have a hobby? Jeez. Oh, and it is far better than 8 Mile, which it also has zero similarities with other than the rapping part (sorry, jobless spammers!)This film premiered at the Berline Film Festival, which is the world's largest film festival that showcases over 400 films and has over half a million people in attendance. And Gully Boy received a thunderous response and ovation and widespread love and acclaim. Art Director Cameron Bailey even tweeted that he had never witness such appreciation for a film in 20+ years there. It was by far the most talked about film at the festival. And for good reason! IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. Do yourself a huge favor and watch it, you won't see a film like this for a very long time.",

            "content": "The reason Gully Boy, despite its length, stays with the audience long after the credits have rolled, is that its goes beyond just the passage of grime to glory for the underdog. It's the devoted application of the sublime craft of every contributor to this film. Whether it is the writing of Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti (of the plot based loosely on the lives of street rappers Divine and Naezy) or the clutch of over twelve music directors who have contributed to the tracks and the score or the choreography, they weave their magic brilliantly. The cast too will surprise you with their acting chops- not just an understated Ranveer Singh or the fiesty yet vulnerable Alia, but Vijay Varma as Moeen, newbie Siddhant Chaturvedi as MC Sher, Amruta Subhash, who is only 6 years elder to Ranveer as his mother Razia and the ever dependable Vijay Raaz as his father and all the other cast and crew. They all deserve a standing ovation. What impresses is Gully Boy avoids falling into the trap of using anger and hate of the oppressed of the Dharavi underbelly espousing revenge as a motif for their struggles to rise. Rather, Murad aka Gully Boy, is a meek conformist, yet one who refuses to let the dream die within.\nDirector Zoya Akhtar has outdone herself with her deft essay; her dexterity in handling the soul of the poor with as much \u00e9lan as the ways of the rich in her earlier outings. As the plot builds up to Gully Boy taking stage , Zoya quickly wraps up the open story ends as the credits begins to roll, superbly done so that you feel contented and complete even as the strains of \"Apna Time Ayega\" resonate with you and you too believe that their time indeed has come.",

            "content": "So after all this examples, we could definitely argue that Bollywood movies are becoming, day-by-day, as Hollywood movies, portraying the struggle of Indians, and promoting the life of the slum. One of the most important scenes in the movie is where at the beginning of the movie we see a guide tourist with foreigners marching in the slum, taking pictures around, and giving them the opportunity to go inside one of the houses and check the living condition of the people who lives there. One house is way more than enough to generalize the whole living condition of all the population that lives in the slum. It only needs one scene to understand that each house in the slum is no different from the other.In fact, it is loosely based on the lives of Mumbai-based Muslim rappers. So when audiences, who like myself have a feeling at the end of the film wishing this very interesting/intelligent story is true, there is some pleasure present, which the other movie can never offer. But what \"Gully boy\" does go on to prove, which also could have been done in 2008, is that there are some clear signs of progress in India. In this movie, the audience will see a clearly (money-based)/cheaply-successfully growing community in Mumbai who are not involved in criminal activity, people who do live modern and social lives, and there is a sense of connection of the rest of the world. You see that Indians are now wearing (related to Europe) brands. Social clubs and bars have popped up. In fact, (even though there is the existence of) living in the crowded, dirty neighborhoods, Murad is aware of hip-hop culture and knows rap (words in a song) from classic songs.",

The rapping is pedestrian at best and the cringe nature of the lines within them as well as the rappers delivering them are pathetic enough to make you walk out of the theater midway.I'm glad I haven't watched Dil Dhadakne Do yet, and I have decided to spare myself the torture of another Zoya Akhtar movie for life.

The movie has got the answer to it..The slumdog raps up his dream to become rapstar sensation who declines to surrender to circumstances encompassing his life. #GullyBoy is in inspirational movie and also a path breaker milestone movie of youths.The movie journey begins in #Mumbai #dharavi slum with life of a ordinary non-directional guy to charged up rapper and #HipHop #YouTube star. The #GullyBoy is multifaceted, he roles up as car thief to driver to sales guy before he realises where his future lies. The center character has all neighborhood surroundings which can make or break the person - grown up in slum, abusive father, unhappy mother, 4x4 room, intimidating possessive girlfriend, petty criminal friend but he got his passion, childhood lover, a role model and mentor, project album angel then there is dream to chase. The story builds up from there to end up as star, as normally globally as any movie plot has. The difference is, the way its being told, presented, edited. The art of story telling gives your altogether different experience. Every Character in movie has a unique dream and has their own chase and struggle, which makes it as a extraordinary. I am sure director and editor has chopped of tons of scenes before the current releaseversion.@RanveerOfficial performance as #GullyBoy is very contained unlike his other films where his energy overflows the character. He is very cool & mature. One sentence review for his performance is \"iske jaisa koi hard ich nahin hai\"People who criticizes @RanveerOfficial for overacting, must watch this movie and notice how much he has been calmed down Which woman should take credit #ZoyaAkhtar or #DeepikaPadukone? :)If you feel woman empowerment doesnot get place in bollywood, then believe it that writer & directors blue eyed character in movie is @Alia08. Both #ReemaKagti & #ZoyaAkhtar has made #Saifeena witty, bold, fiesty, intelligent and cute all in one. @Alia08 plays it as naturally as if she is portraying herself. The dream character portraitisation.Debutant @SiddhantChturvD as MJSher gets grand entry where he rips apart with his rap and he is also fabulous as influencer and mentor to #GullyBoy. Somewhere down the storyline, his character may have been shortened, though role weightage is equal to hero and he impresses very well.Each character has depth and Each character makes their character lively be it #Moen by #VijayVerma, #Sky by #Kalki, #VijayRaaz, #borivali guy #KaamBhari and any other characters be it.@ZoyaAkhtarOff has just sealed a power packed movie and presented to the audience to experience the #FunVisphot. She doesn't let any character to slow down and keep them bustling, turning movie a fast paced. when GullyBoy Title caption shows up to the screen, people realises.. ohhh.. the movie has ended.. The audience left with needing more to crave for.#GullyBoy music is first of its kind with full fledged #HipHop album. All Songs are youthful and lovable.#GullyBoy is add up to maturing of Bollywood. Just like content driven and focused approach, this movie focuses on entertainment and stick to core. one more noteworthy point is, The movie has score of songs, but you will realise that not a single one for movie heroine. This is the way each character is deep dived and unnecessary things are cut-off. One more instance is, In one of the post break up scenes, just to make sky understand value of saifeena, gully boy tells, without her, his life will become very lonely between childhood and youth. This is how relationship is valued, you give weightage to past, just not leave them for opportunity of future.#GullyBoy is Youthful movie of this Decade.(Check yourself out which one was yours when you were in 20s)",

Murad is quiet and surpressed by his circumstances and his reality. But his eyes, oh his eyes, reveal the fire inside him raging to explode. Ranveer Singh taps into a quieter part of himself to bring this character to life and take him straight into your heart. Alia Bhatt as Safeena is quirky, fearless, unpredictable and borderline crazy. It's so refreshing to see a love interest in a Hindi movie that is not perfect and pretty all the time and is so real and three dimensional. Hats off to Zoya Akthar and team for creating this firehouse of a character. Sidhant Chaturvedi as MC Sher, the rapper that takes Murad under his wing is awesome and loveable in the most unexpected of ways. MC Sher takes all the compassion, swagger and passion and nestles himself in your heart. Loved this character! Vijay Raaz as Murad's father is amazing. A man shaped by his circumstances and life and a survivalist in the truest of sense. It was amazing seeing the range of emotion as a conservative Indian Father from him, truly well done . The side characters like Murad's Mother, Grandmother, Brother, his versatile group of friends , his aunt, uncle were all splendid and a treat to watch in the film. They all added to the storyline in their own ways. Zoya Akthar's innate ability to make her characters three dimensional and on top of that have them all add something to the storyline AND have the audience rooting for each one is admirable and genius.Set Design:\nThis film is almost entirely shot in Dharavi, Mumbai. All the swerving gullies, cramped homes with each inch being utilized is believable and real and really sets the tone for the whole movie. This film is like a love letter to Dharavi and dang I'm here for it.Dialogue:\nThe dialogue in the film is entirely written in the Mumbai/Hip Hop lingo and I am obsessed with it. However, the best part is the lingo is written in a way that still adds the appropriate flavour to the movie without alienating audiences that have never heard this kind of lingo before. It's very tough balance to maintain in a \"dialect/lingo\" film but it is achieved beautifully and is really the best way to transport audiences into Murad's world. #apnatimeaayega #dhoptungi #bohothardMusic:\nIt would be the biggest unjustice to review this film and not talk about the music. The music in this film is EPIC! Every single track in this film was simply awesome and adds to the storyline so well. The rap in this film is the key to Murad's inner mind and it's an amazing place to be. Even if you aren't a huge rap person, I garuntee you will love and appreciate all the lyrics and music of this film.Cinematography:\nThe cinematography of this film is MINDBLOWING!!!!! The camera angles say so much when the gully's that Murad are running through are shot in a close tight frame making you feel claustraohopic and when the terraces where Murad practices rap with MC Sher are shot with open and wide angles. You realize the camera is talking to you and showing you what Murad is feeling in his environment. OUTSTANDING!!!!!Direction:\nZoya Akthar KILLS IT with this movie!!! Zoya Akthar is a freaking queen and genius mastermind. Zoya Akthar you're a gift to cinema. That's all you need to know, this story was in very able hands and Zoya Akthar delivers beyond expectation.Final Thoughts:\nThis one of the best films I have seen in a very long time and it had easily made its way into my top five favourite films list, which is saying a lot. A beautiful film that everyone needs to see. There's lots to see, appreciate and resonate with. You can see it with your entire family and I am sure everyone will love it.",

Siddhant Chaturvedi was great in his debut, never missed a beat, felt like a seasoned artist.\nLoved the family side story. Poetry used in movie is great.

Ranveer was awesome in his role as a slum boy and so was Alia. Even the side characters we all built up really well. The romance between Ranveer and Alia didn't look forced and they looked really cute. The songs were so awesome, people were talking their feets and singing along with the lyrics of \"apna time aayega\". It really was a goosebumps moment.

Every frame of the movie is a souvenir ride of emotions and a palpable bump.

            "content": "Gully Boy - Movie Review.By- Ray Hill.When they first launched the trailer of this movie, people started criticizing that saying it's a rip off of Eminem's 8 mile. And, after watching the movie, after reading a whole lot of great reviews of this movie, I must say that those people don't make sense. Cause, Gully Boy wasn't like 8 mile or anywhere near 8 mile. Cause you see, 8 mile was a great f'ing movie. And, talking about Gully Boy on the other hand was somewhere between Zoya Akhtar's fantasy and Bollywood melodrama.So, Zoya Akhtar did it again. I mean, her life must have been so f'ing easy to make this type of film again again and again. In the starting credit it says the movie is inspired from these two Indian rapper divine and naezy, I'm still not sure how much she got inspiration from them making this movie. For her, no matter how poor the protagonist is, he or she still got a richer lifestyle than any of us, middle class or lower middle class people. It's not all bad, it's kinda cool to watch, but when you are watching it knowing Zoya Akhtar made this, then it's kinda irritating.Now, let's talk about the movie. The movie itself is better than mainstream Bollywood movies, that's for sure. But, what I can say is they tried. And, it's not Zoya Akhtar's best work for sure. Probably, one of her most clumsy work. The thing is it's a long movie, two and a half hours. And the funny thing is, if you just remove the first half it's still the same movie or maybe a better version of it. Yeah, the first half was super boring and clueless. And, the second half is full of emotional dialogues about success, choosing the right road and lecturing the protagonist's Indian dad about chasing his dream and stuffs. We have seen those million times. But, one thing I can say is this movie is full of hypocrisy.So, I'm not sure why, but like all other movies of Zoya Akhtar, Kalki Koechlin appeared in this movie too. And, she was absolutely, from this ultra rich family and she was studying music in the US and was spray painting stuffs all over Mumbai at night with Gully Boy, the protagonist. Now, I have no idea what that scene was doing there, but the spray paints were used to write stuff like \"nature was here\" in an industrial building front gate and \"brown and beautiful\" over a fairness cream advertisement. So, what I think, she was trying to give us a \"message\" about capitalism and stuffs and it was f'ing weird coming from Zoya Akhtar. And, It was even weirder when you got an Adidas sponsorship and your protagonist is riding a luxury SUV to spray paint over capitalist society. I mean, my hands automatically started clapping just watching that whole mess, and to be honest with like thousands of other scenes that scene totally had no connection with the movie. As, I said before if you remove half of the movie, it'll still be the same movie.Now, I read a lot of good reviews before decided to watch this film and I gotta say it's not a complete disaster but it was some kinda typhoon or so. And to end that, I must say 8 mile was like adidas and Gully Boy was simply abidas.",

The pace of the movie is brisk and dialogues peppy, which covers up for 2 hrs 36 mins of the long reel. Zoya Akhtar (director) & Reema Kagti (writer & screenplay) have done good work. And the actors have done a splendid job too. Difficult to judge who was better amongst Vijay Raaz, Siddhant Chaturvedi, Vijay Sharma, Alia & Ranveer. Of course, the last name being cherry on the cake. Brilliant work dude! If acting is the heart of Gully Boy then music is its soul. I am no lover of Rap neither do I have much knowledge of it but whatever I heard on screen today was terrific. Lovely lyrics, melting music & bombastic beats. Definitely a deadly deal! Often we get confused with musical dramas, whether it's more of M or D.

He definitely did justice to his role and definitely stole the thunder from the main actor Ranveer Singh. Ranveer's character is that of an under dog rapper but fails to portray a personality with Rapping talent. He simply doesn't justify a character of rapper. On the other hand Siddhant is awesome as a rapper and is the real winner here. Alia as usual, nothing great except screaming. Kalki is a good talent wasted in a boring plot like this. Overall this movie is highly overrated in terms of IMDB rating, in my opinion it should not be rated more than 6.",

Alia Bhatt seems misplaced in the film. The character though; Safeena Firdousi, is fresh and unfiltered. The strongest points of the film would be the dialogue and soundtrack, you can instantly attach to it. Overall, a decent one time watch that will leave you thinking about it.",

It is the most intense work from her till date. And she has done it with elan. I see no reason why this movie will not be called a CLASSIC in the coming years.\nIt was not only about direction. The story stands out too. It has the right amount of intensity and quirkiness to keep you seated throughout. The cinematography is brilliant and the way Dharavi has been portrayed is stupendous. You will be hard pressed to find a fault in this whole presentation.\nA movie is half good if the casting is not upto the mark. This movie again hits the bull's eye. Each and every role has been portrayed aptly except the role of Kalki, maybe. Kalki was the only not so strong part of the movie. Ranvir and Alia have proved that the future of Bollywood is in safe hands and we will keep getting movies of this calibre in the coming years. Siddhant is the one who takes the limelight. Such a good debut. You won't be able to tell that seeing him in the movie. Vijay Raj is as good as he has been throughout his career. We want to see more of him and he proves it in every way he could.\nMusic, for me, was not the strongest thing of the movie. Some songs are good but others are not. But they don't spoil the tempo of the movie in any manner.\nOverall, this movie is like ZNMD. You can watch it over and over again, if you are able to connect to it. The mannerisms are different, but you will get used to it after the first 15 minutes. The movie runs for almost 2 hours 40 mins and it is a smooth sail. It slows down a bit in the second half but is still butter smooth. A must watch definitely. Thank you Zoya Akhtar for making it. Siddhant has impressed me heavily and I will wait to see more of such works from him.\nBOHT HARDDDDDDD! !!! !",

            "review_title": "A Film Made Right.",
            "content": "I've just returned from the cinema after watching Gully Boy. Gully Boy is a story about dreams and a man's struggle to realize his dreams. This is not a subject matter that hasn't been dealt with before. But this is a film done right. Inspired from the real life struggles of rappers Nazey and Divine, Gully Boy tells the story of Murad, who later becomes titular Gully Boy. When the film starts Murad is just a college student who likes Rap and Hip Hop music and also likes to write lyrics of his own. He sees MC Sher, played by Sidhant Chaturvedi, performing in his college and it is this moment that begins his journey to the rap, his own rags to riches story. Murad leads many lives. He is a son, of a poor family, who has to put both, his studies and his music career, on the sides as he has to take up jobs to support his family. He is a son to a father who has a very narrow point of view of the world and to a mother who gets treated horribly by her husband. He has to retort to stealing vehicles with his friend Moin in when he is in dire need of money to support his mother.The script is very well written and the direction is equally good. No moment and no lines in the film are wasted. Every moment and every line of spoken dialogue helps carry the film forward. And it is because of this reason that the film never feels like a drag because it has a runtime of 155 minutes and most films with such a long runtime feel slow at parts, but not Gully Boy. The nicely written script has been complimented by the very good cinematography of the film. In a very subtle way it captures the essence of the gully and the rap scene. When the MCs are spitting bars you feel like you're standing in the crowd and when Murad is running through the streets of Mumbai, specifically the gully, you feel like you're just another man standing in the gully. The camera captures the many unstable, dry and sometimes colourful lives of the films many characters.Music is the core, the heart of this film and all the songs are very well placed and very cleverly used. The songs hit you hard and will make you clap and nod along, doesn't matter if you're a fan of Hip Hop music or not. Real rappers with real talent are at work here and they have given us songs that are both very deep and entertaining at the same time. Besides Nazey and Divine we have songs and performances from real underground rappers like Emiway and these people are in their A game in the film.Gully Boy might have Ranveer Singh as it's lead, who is terrific in the film. It might be his career best performance so far. But it's not just about him. Alia Bhatt at this point has become one of those actors who will give their best and leave a lasting impression on the audience every time they are on the screen. She and Ranveer Singh have a natural chemistry which is reflected on the big screen.\nIt's not only these two, every single actor in the film has given an amazing performance. And it's because of their engaging performances one leaves the theatre witnessing not only the story of Murad, but also the story of his father, mother, MC Sher, Moin, his girlfriend and many other gully people.Gully Boy showcases the classic struggle between dreams and reality. It is a good film, not only because of the reasons mentioned above but also because it leaves you with many characters to root for. Mourad's father is not supportive of his son's decision to become a rapper and you cannot hate him for it because of the actors convincing performance and because of the reasons that he gives. Gully Boy does not glorify any aspect of life, it rather presents things in a very matter of fact way. It's on us to decide what to do and what not to do. These are the characters from Mumbai that have been presented to us before too. In fact, it is very much a Mumbai film as well. You cannot take away Mumbai from this film and put any other city and hope to make it work.Gully Boy is sure to inspire many young people and make a lot of people think. Even if you're someone who does not like Rap and Hip Hop Gully Boy will not disappoint you at all because it is film well made and it tells the story that all of us can relate to. Watch it for the many lives it covers and look for many stories that unfold.",

The slum dwellers do not watch movies in theatres and the theatre goers will find the connect missing.Story is highly predictable as one could easily guess from the trailer. While the film has its lows, lows, lows and high the emotional impact seems to be missing. You don't laugh, cry, feel good or bad, just watch it.5 out of the 7 stars I have given are for Ranveer Singh for the sheer hard work and making the character so believable. Alia Bhatt's role has no significance to the story but as usual she does full justice to her character. Just that I pity Murad for eventually having an excessively obsessive wife.",

Supporting Cast\nSo I entered into it with lot of expectations and most of them were met. The narration was fluid and enhanced by natural acting of overall cast. Kudos to Director, Production and Cinematographer for choosing the real locations, it brought lot of authenticity. The best part was overall music (background + OST) and it effective placement.\nSome characters and narrative pieces lacked the depth. The supporting characters should have given some more sequence to build their narration more effectively.\nThe chemistry between the characters was handled creatively.\nRanveer shined throughout in almost every sequence, especially the emotional pieces. Alia proves that she could pull off any character. Siddhant as MC Sher has done a tremendous job, looking forward to his next roles.\nZoya and Reema proved again, how creative storyteller they are. Every one of their projects has excited me.",

Though the movie is a bit cliched in showing the rise of a person from abject misery overcoming his shortcomings and achieving his dream, the movie shows all that in a new light through the country's rap scene which is unique in the way it is portrayed all throughout the movie. The vernacular and the accent of the actors makes it even more amazing, I can't insist on how much I loved the acting. Alia Bhat's dialogues were funny and she did more than enough justice to her role. Though the movie has little bit of a cliched story, it deviates from the typical platitudes and banal, predictable scenes usually shown in Bollywood movies. Throughout the movie I was waiting for someone to dupe someone, the usual drama and it was refreshing to be surprised. Overall, a nice feel good movie.",

Then one of the theme of class-divide is shown but there is indications in the second act that money is important, brings happiness and 10lakhs etc- this is contradictory. Also film tells all working class people suck because they not doing their passion dream job- this is totally wrong and preachyOVERALL: Lengthy, predictable, one time watch entertaining film definitely NOT bhot hard.

The protagonist doesn't become too successful, the lives of many characters have little to no improvement.

His love for writing songs and rapping is not supported by his family. This movie shows us how Muraad(Ranveer Singh) overcomes a lot of obstacles to pursue his dream of becoming a rapper.\nThe movie showcases an acting powerhouse. From Ranveer Singh's silent performance that speaks volumes and Alia bhatt's explosive acting, to Siddhant Chaturvedi(MC Sher), Vijay Raaz(Muraad's dad), Vijay Verma(Muraad's friend) and many more, this movie is sure to impress you with it's acting performances. The scenes with Muraad and his father are emotionally compelling and some of the best in the movie.\nThis movie touches apon many topics such as polygamy, child labour, feminism, etc. but still manages to stay true to the main story.\nThe first half is quite slow, but the second half is a lot more gripping.

If 8 Mile was the story of a white boy breaking into the domain of rap genre, Gully Boy is the story of struggle against poverty and aspiring something totally out of league with the environment, the protagonist lives in.Ranveer rocks the part of the rapper. This actor with every new role is redefining indian cinema. At the start of the movie, you may not even recognize him, loafing around with his pals, without his quirky dressing sense and loud get-ups. His intensity doubles up even when he does not have dialogues to mouth, and the expressions are enough to convey the thoughts. He is at the top of his game.But the one that takes your heart, is Alia Bhatt. Hear her as Safeena speaking to Murad at the bus stop. She is a natural, and so is Siddhant Chaturvedi aka MC Sher. The way he speaks, the dialogues that he has, his body language and the confidence that he has in himself despite being from the same slums makes him an anchor to all around him including Murad - Ranveer aka Gully Boy.The music which to some ages, may not be palatable, does to Rap genre in Indian context, what probably 8 Mile did. Just hear the first one \"Jingo-staan Zindabad\", it is sure to give you goosebumps. Of course Apna time aayega is on its way to be top of the charts.Zoya Akhtar excels in every department, and this is not a movie but a poem that sprang out of the true story of Neazy and Divine.

Meanwhile, Murad realizes his calling to be a rapper. Authentic Hip Hop in India is a recent phenomenon and like anywhere else in the world, is rising from the streets. Art is a distant dream for the colonized poor of India and this story is about Murad's journey from realizing his love for rap and chasing his dream to inadvertently transcending his class. The film showcases street rap from the crevices of Mumbai's by lanes. The poetry is conscious of the city's socio-economic fabric and highlights the challenges faced by the disenfranchised youth in the minority population.",

            "review_title": "Motto: \"Apna Time Ayega\"",
            "content": "It's one of the many rousing moments in Zoya Akhtar's superb new film. Gully Boy is loosely based on the lives of real life rappers Naezy and DIVINE, who rose from slums to stardom. Hip hop, modern day protest music, which came out of the streets of New York, has inspired a flourishing music scene in Mumbai. But the beauty of Gully Boy is that even if you are entirely unfamiliar with this world, like I was, the film will still stir your soul. It chronicles the story of an ordinary boy Murad, from Dharavi, who dreams big and refuses to let adversity squash his spirit. His journey from being the quintessential slumdog to being an ambitious rapper named Gully Boy, is exhilarating and exciting, to say the least. Rap is an unconventional genre of music in India, but even those who don't necessarily associate with this form of music, will be able appreciate the underdog and heartfelt story.\nThe writing, the emotions, the brilliance, every song is simply MIND-BLOWING! there will be no one who has faced tough situations in their life are are struggling to pursue and reach their goals. Every spectacular dialogue, the brilliantly conveyed social message, the cast, the crew and finally the film, just outstanding and simply perfect how the whole movie surround a single plot of struggling towards a committed goal.

The relation with God was also part of the struggle.This movie will strike a mark on your heart. You will not forget the felling of working for your dreams and make your own identity.Less compelling is a subplot involving Kalki Koechlin's character as Sky, an affluent, US-returned musician who takes a keen interest both in Murad's music and him. Aside from a few such plot points that I wasn't entirely convinced about, my only really issue with the film is its length. Perhaps because there's so much going on onscreen, and because the filmmakers take the trouble to tie up each character's story, the film is way too long. It's nearly two and a half hours and that's too long for a film whose basic story arc - the underdog narrative - is actually quite predictable.\nBut those minor niggling's aside, Without overtly drawing attention to it, she makes a strong feminist statement in Alia Bhutt's character, some sharp observations about minorities, and also about the world we live in and the place in it for those with lesser means.If want to see some real life hiccups, some real life struggle by passing all hiccups you should definitely watch this and most importantly you would love this movie if you like raps.",

            "review_title": "Celebrating Subaltern Masculinities",
            "content": "The story of the underdog making good is a reasonably familiar trope for Bollywood. Amitabh Bachchan had made the genre his own when he ruled as the 'angry young man.' Usually such stories also include an element of moral redemption and exploit the familiar theme of cops and robbers all the way from the sibling rivalry where Sashi Kapoor famously says 'mere pass Ma hain' to the more contemporary saga of the 'Sacred Games'. The story of Gully Boy while including many elements of the familiar also provides an alternative exploration of subaltern masculinities.\nDharavi provides a very realistic and human backdrop but unlike in Slumdog Millionaire it reverberates with a joie de vivre. Instead of evoking the pathos of the well-heeled viewer it indicts the wide-eyed incredulous 'gaze' of poverty tourism when the grandmother makes a quick 500 rupees by letting the guide bring in the white camera toting foreign tourists into her home. Guiltily I recalled my own experience entering the hovels of a Masai camp near Ngorongoro, clicking away in wonder.\nRanveer Singh (Murad) in the title role is a Dharavi youth who knows that he has to secure a college degree to get ahead in life. His close friend Moeen is in the more familiar 'tapori' mould. He sells drugs and steals cars, sometimes just for a lark and a joy ride. The third character is MC Sher, a 'rapper' who both inspires and mentors Murad in 'rapping'. Unlike the other two he is not Muslim and instead of Dharavi lives in a one room chawl where he keeps his many sneakers secure in a safe. These three young men are all from the more marginal sections of Mumbai society but they are different and their differences don't seem at all contrived\nThere is a very interesting 'bro-code' in their relationships throughout the two and half hours of the film. Sher is already an icon among college students when Murad asks him to use his lyrics in his rap. Sher refuses to use the more 'powerful' poetry of Murad and instead encourages him to 'rap' and takes him under his tutelage. This support is unwavering even when mentor is knocked out of the 'rap' competition and the mentorship continues till the end. With Moeen the relationship is a little more complex. Murad is shown as a reluctant participant in the joy ride in a stolen car in the opening sequence of the film. He also rebukes Moeen for using children to peddle ganja (cannabis). Moeen will have none of this moral lecture and one senses that their relationship is perhaps doomed to end on moral grounds, but it does not. When Murad walks out of his father's home along with brother and mother, Moeen's garage is his first port of call. Moeen is the only one he knows who can make money by bending the rules. Murad becomes a willing associate to a string of car liftings and using this money sets up his new home. When Moeen is picked up by the police Murad is willing to share the rap with him but Moeen refuses. He says that Murad has a better chance to make 'good' and should stay out.\nGully Boy is a film about young men and rap music. Rap competitions in the form of a face off between rappers is a running theme in the film. The key to winning is to run down your opponent. Murad is hesitant in the beginning and is not at all comfortable in belittling his opponent. He avoids this attacking style which is more popular with other rappers. Instead he uses a more reflective style where social observations around poverty and inequality form the core of his poetry. He too is an angry young man but the film completely avoids physical violence as a means of getting back at society.\nWhile the film is primarily about men there are a couple of strong female characters as well. Alia Bhatt plays the role of Safeena, Murad's love interest. She is from a conservative middle-class Muslim family and is training to be a doctor. Dressed demurely in a hijab she is explosively independent and thinks nothing of hitting another woman with a beer bottle, when she thinks she is 'poaching' her man. Kalki Koechlin is 'Sky', the other young woman who is very unconventional. She is from the high society of Mumbai, and studies in the US. She is keen to produce a track with the rappers. She also a rebel and provides a counterpoint to the existing socio-economic order when she sprays graffiti and defaces posters of anorexic models and fairness creams. Murad's relationships with these two young women are important but somehow seem less significant than that with Moeen and MC Sher.\nThe film offers a fresh perspective to subaltern masculinities which are currently much maligned. The Nirbhaya case from Delhi and the Shakti Mills case of Mumbai have highlighted the intense sexual violence associated with young men from the margins. The current political climate of intolerance is being fuelled through the same demographic who are being encouraged see their enemy in the 'other'. Across the world rapid social and economic changes along with dispossession and economic inequality have created some of the most virulent expressions of male violence and hatred. Male youth see their many masculine entitlements challenged and threatened. The political and economic powers have been able to focus the attention away from more fundamental questions of equity and justice and towards convenient 'enemies' like ethnic and religious minorities and women. Within this context Zoya Akhtar has done a remarkable job in presenting the story of young men from the underbelly of Mumbai in a very human manner without using any hyperbole, violence or sex. The men are clearly dispossessed but they are observant and analytic as well. They bend the rules for fun and for survival but they are not evil or malicious. Within an ambience of competition the film provides a strong message of empathy and solidarity. Gully Boy is a contemporary film celebrating eternal human values, a film worth watching even if you are not into rap.",

            "content": "8-Mile-ish, Gully Boy is the first and only Bollywood movie I've seen that revolves around the desi rap culture. It does a great job in portraying Mumbai's amateur rap scene, and that it does with very impressive rap lyrics whose flow doesn't seem synthetic. One on one rap battles seemed a bit ersatz, but 'Salim Shady', as someone calls Murad in an earlier scene, does deliver a whistle-grabber.Halfway through, I realized the movie incorporated all the elements of a natural, 'everyday' story of a group of happening biographical figures! Vijay Raaz's exceptionally fluent acting; Kalki doing her best at portraying her character of a free soul drawn to music; mellifluous yet manly rap tunes; attention grabbing sub-plots like that of Kalki's gang artistically protesting fair-skin and body-shape taboo by blacking-out posters; the quintessential, forever ongoing bickering of Dharavi - the movie had it all. It even included in a way, the no-Youtube 90s era movie trick of building up the hype by offering hums and tunes all through the movie of its central song that would finally roar at a later point in the movie. Apna Time Aayega, in this particular case.The meat of the movie, though, was a firecracker performance by Alia which can easily earn her many award nominations, a mind-blowingly cool performance by the debutant Siddharth Chaturvedi in his role of the humble but Hard (pun intended) MC Sher, and the remarkable narrative by Zoya and Reema that's down-to-earth and pragmatic, uncustomary to mainstream Bollywood story-telling. Add to this a very modest, uncomplex, sincere, and hunky-dory performance by Ranveer who very much forms the crux of the whole story.Overall, I found the movie to almost fall into the category of \"Must Watch\"es, though I'd say one would find it terrifically captivating only if the person is contextually aware of the history, evolution, and reception of rap culture in general.",

            "content": "Ever since I have watched this movie, I can't get it out of my head. It is everything you want if you adore the craft of filmmaking; intricate, intense, charming and revolutionary. In the simplest of words, it is a masterpiece. The journey of Murad is his, and the viewer's at the same time. The story unfolds beautifully and just gets better. Ranveer and Alia shine, Zoya's direction strikes and the music is perfect. Don't expect to find commercialised senseless 'rap' from the item songs, this is from the heart, as in, ACTUAL rap.Firstly, I salute the team. Every aspect of this film is absolutely stunning. Ranveer Singh proves that he isn't here on the basis of luck, the movie belongs to him. His performance is fascinating and the fact that he did all the raps himself makes it even more special. Alia Bhatt delivers what you expect from her - perfection, she really is the finest actress of this generation. Zoya Akhtar is a master director. No one could have presented such a different film in such a remarkable way. Cinematography, editing - its all gorgeous.The soundtrack has a soul of its own and acts as the one of the biggest strengths of this film. The lyrics, expression, beats and Ranveer Singh's voice mesmerizes everyone who listens to it. Divine did a great job at composing the music. The whole background score and songs are all beautiful.Gully Boy is an inspiring piece of art and is the ultimate ode to the dreamers - to everyone. Take that chance! Bohot hard hai bhai!",

People who claim similarities to 8 mile probably need to go back and watch that movie again, chalk and cheese.\nPerformances of all the main cast are excellent and the movie has captured the pulse of Mumbai and shown the internal struggle of a man from lower middle class society along with the rich- poor divide beautifully.\nFantastic songs which blend into the narrative.\nAs all characters are given time and space the movie is slightly long though at no point out feels slow.\nCertainly a must see movie.",
