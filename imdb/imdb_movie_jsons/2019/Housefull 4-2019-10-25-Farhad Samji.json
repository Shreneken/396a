No script, no acting, only big stars and plenty of crap songs that's what make movies in India.There should be a quality check before a movie is made public. Outside world when they see this kind of movie they might be laughing at us not on the movie. Directors and Producers of this movie should arrested for making this movie. Its pure nonsense and may cause migraine to some people in audience.",

However, the second best of the Housefull franchise after Housefull 2. This one is a gem.\nThe first half seemed okayish, above average, all the secrets were out. The second half, I must tell you, it was unbearable for my stomy. I laughed so hard, so loud, I couldn't imagine ever.\nAkshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh, Bobby Deol, Pooja Hegde and Kriti Sanon, all have done a remarkable job. The best was Johnny Lever, oh my God! I couldn't take a moment of calmness. Mamma Mia again rocked it.\nWe need Housefull 5.\nMy ratings for all the Housefull Series are as below:\nH1 : 7.5\nH2 : 9\nH3 : 6\nH4 : 8.75\nYes, I'm an Akkian, but this is my true review, not a biased one unlike the idiot Taran Adarsh who never underands comedies \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nI couldn't stop laughing when he Rated Prem Ratan dhan Paayo and ABCD 3 as 4/5, Dabbang 3 as 3/5 saying entertainer and one of the best movies of Bollywood Dil Chahta hai as 2/5 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

I knew that all the films were bad but there was something about them which gave me enjoyment whilst watching them. The fourth film, however, is just straight up terrible.Housefull 4 is about three couples who get reincarnated 600 years later as they find out that they're about to marry the wrong person.I'll just get to the point. This movie is just atrocious. Out of all the Housefull films, this one is most certainly the weakest. What sells this movie is its huge scale and ensemble cast but apart from that, everything else is poorly made. I think the jokes in this film is the worst out of the four. Majority of them get constantly recycled and some of them are just childish and disgusting. There were a few moments and jokes which I thought were creative and actually got a laugh from me but there is so much rubbish that overshadows them. It starts to get tedious really quickly. The visual effects were a pain to sit through. It seemed very noticeable where the effects were used and it made me repeatedly facepalm in my seat. There was also an absurd amount of perversion scattered throughout which weren't clever or funny. It goes to show the struggle the writers went through in terms of writing unique and witty humour.The acting was fine. Akshay Kumar was clearly trying to funny and is definitely the best part of this film. Riteish Deshmukh and Bobby Deol were fine. The three actresses didn't have much to work with and just had the purpose of being eye candy. It's so sad to see talented actors like Nawazuddin Siddiqui be completely WASTED and pointless to the film's story.If only the film actually tried to provide us with jokes that were actually funny and unique as well as giving a compelling story with fleshed out characters in the forefront rather than a bundle of cameos, references to past and current actors and illogical sequences that make you shake your head in disappointment.Even if you're a fan of the Housefull series, I reckon this installment won't satisfy your expectations. It's better to skip this one and watch something more worthy of your time.",

            "content": "First there are funny films that leave an impression for a lifetime (e.g. Golmaal of Amol Palekar, Chupke Chupke of Amitabh & Dharmendra, Hera Pheri, Munnabhai MBBS) and then there are those casual weekend watches which makes you laugh your heart out at certain moments during the film but nothing you'll recommend to someone the next day. Housefull 4 qualifies for the latter. One great thing about the movie is that it's NOT a vulgar comedy filled with hindi slangs (which many other directors bank on today to make people laugh). It's old school, clean and meant for a family watch & I really loved it from that stand point. Akshay Kumar is brilliant. Kriti Sanon is good too. Certain one liners are outright hilarious and will make you laugh. Problem is that the support casts (including stalwarts like Johnny Lever) are absolutely horrible. Chunky Pandey & Bobby Deol should stop acting. They are an eye soar. Johnny Lever's acting as a transgender is difficult to watch and in just how many movies more are they going to make Riteish Deshmukh behave in a feminine way. There's no originality left in that any longer. The music is terrible & the story is rubbish. However, the best part of the movie are the last 20 mins. So there's a bit to look forward to. Therefore, if you're not doing much this weekend, you might like to buy the tickets for this one or not. I'll leave that choice to you \ud83d\ude0a",

            "content": "#FinalVerdictHousefull 4 is that rare genre of films which will test your patience with its foolishness, shock you with its lack of logic & launch a vicious assault on your senses. Utter nonsense!Usually, a paragraph is devoted in reviews to detail the plot & screenplay but to say that Housefull 4 has even a semblance of the two is a poor joke. The audience is just going to shake their head in dismay & frustration as the intolerable cruelty unfolds.Fridays are becoming a messy hodgepodge in Bollywood with each transient months, in the matter of getting an epochal release and a Diwali release is an event in itself. But the makers of Housefull 4 have literally shown a middle finger to the audiences. Sure, we relish madcap entertainers, but what director Farhad Samji serves in Housefull 4 transcends all limits. He attempts a crazy, simple entertainer yet again, but peppers it with inane, ridiculous episodes that makes you wonder, is this for real? Sara Bodinar and Sajid Nadiadwala's story drains you at the end, despite the actors putting their best foot forward to make you giggle. The banal jokes & the lame PJs coupled with the muddled screenplay are clearly responsible for the EPIC mess.The soundtrack of Housefull 4 is pleasant, with the composer (Sohail Sen) belting out a couple of hummable tunes. The plush locales of London & the grandiose production design ( Subrata Chakraborty-Amit Ray) gives the film the required scale. And that's it.VFX should've been better. Editing (Rameshwar S Bhagat) is uneven. This singularly unfunny film plumbs the depths of comedic bankruptcy by a director who quite frankly, hasn't delivered anything funny in a long time.Akshay Kumar plays to the gallery but is letdown by the writing. Also, he tries too hard to be funny. Riteish Deshmukh hams to the hilt. Bobby Deol looks out of place completely. The leading ladies - Kriti Sanon, Pooja Hegd and Kriti Kharbanda - are pure eye candies. Chunky Panday is wasted. Ditto for Ranjeet, Johny Lever, Sharad Kelkar, Rana Daggubati and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.On the whole, it'll be difficult for Housefull 4 to sustain once the initial euphoria settles down. It's all bad. All of it, every last instant, every single word. Simply put, Housefull 4 is an unforgivable farce. This is public harassment - a precise sentence I'll use to describe the experience. If you thought comedy could sink no further. Watch just 15 minutes of Housefull 4 and you'd be disavowed of that notion.",

But Even as a standalone Comedy film this has utterly failed. The previous housefull movies at least made us laugh!Except few scenes, the humour wasn't really there. The dialogues are poorly written, instead of making you laugh ; in reality they annoyed me a lot. Except Akshay's Portrayal other performances were just below average! I had high expectations from Ritesh But man did he disappoint!There are only two Things that Liked in this film is one Akshay's performance as I said before and the CGI or Art Direction in general. Asthetically the film had high scales and properly maintaned their standards For the entire runtime. With a Premise that could have been interesting if done properly but has been totally wasted under lacklustre script writing and Bad choices.The Tonality shifts, Between comedy and drama/action it just makes all the things more confusing! Sometimes these blends do work pretty well but it should be handled properly and under a expert supervision! Unlike here where the film itself doesn't know where it's headed, and makes the audience feel the same.They should have focused more on the script and dialogues rather than investing lots of money in VFX department. If the content itself is good enough ; Average CGI would do the Job damn well!After finishing the movie I still don't get why Nawazuddin, one of the finest actors in this generation accepted to do that small ridiculous role! It was Sad to see to be honest.In the end, I must say it's the Worst movie in the Franchise, Although I loved what Akshay has put on the table but His sole presence couldn't save the movie unfortunately.With that poor of a script and direction, it was bound to fail.",

Even Riteish also. So why they did it, are they unemployed? Why bobby here? He and Akshay looks too much old. They don't fit this crap comedy movie. For Akshay only, he is good in acting but bad in choosing. I think he does't ever choose any movie rather every movie offer he gets, he does the role. Most brainless and idotic movies in bollywood mostly made by Akhsay the hero.Akshay forgets and this is the worst part of the movie. What the actors are doing in this movie they know themselves. Song after every 10-15 minutes. Just a brainless full of hollow comedy. AVOID IT ANYHOW if you don't want to torture your existence. Otherwise, YOU'LL REGRET.The director Farhad Samji, I checked his profile in IMDb, he has the creator of most of the crap movies now a days.

But after watching it on television I've started doubting my friends and relative's mental health and choices. By far it's the WORST of the year and easily in top 10 worst of the decade. As much as I enjoyed Housefull and Housefull 2, I disliked Housefull 3 and HATE the 4th part.Plot(Haha LOL): The plot is so confusing that even the crew members themselves had forgotten what the plot was exactly all about except the reincarnation and mocking magadheera baahubali and other films of fantasy category or mocking their ownselves.Performances: Honestly I'm a huge Akshay Kumar fan but unlike many reviewers claiming his performance was laugh riot, I felt only few scenes of Akshay were actually worth mentioning whereas overall he hamed badly. Unlike the previous Housefull movies where all the lead Male actors got equal weight to lift in which Akshay and Ritiesh Deshmukh would emerge as the standouts, here Ritiesh was completely sidelined by giving complete focus to Akshay. Ritiesh was again given a role with defective traits but unlike in previous films the scope here was very less for him yet he carried it with grace. Lesser I say about Bobby Deol the better it be. Unlike in previous installments where Arjun Rampal, John Abraham, Shreyas Talpade and Abhishek Bachchan at least tried to tickle our ribs and give convincing performances but Bobby just seemed stoned face robot and even danced like one(he used to be a good dancer once upon a time). This time again all the girls got no scope to perform and were rather reduced to cameos, in which Kriti Sanon did give a fine performance and Pooja Hegde did look hot while Kharbanda was just as useless as Bobby Deol. Ranjeet had only one major dialogue throughout that is his AEEEE which got more irritating at one point. Rana Daggubati, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Sharad Kelkar were horribly wasted and they made mockery out of themselves throughout. I almost felt like crying while looking at their talent being wasted in this pile of crap. But the one who got most insulted was Johnny Lever. It looked almost like he had some kind of fight with the producers which is why they made him act like this. I agree Johnny's major talent lies in giving weird yet funny expressions and making mockery of himself but there's a limit and here it has been crossed by a mile! Except Rohit Shetty there's no other director who can use talent of Johnny Lever to it's fullest. Chunky Pandey is again Aakhree Pasta and that's the only thing about him.The jokes were all about spoofing themselves or the prehistoric or fantasy films or they were sexist sexually weird, racist, jokes on LGBT community etc. Which is where Bollywood is at it's lowest point. While Housefull had a good story with few decent jokes and gave the women stronger characters as their Male counterparts; Housefull 2 had a weaker story with more jokes and a rather weaker part for the girls; Housefull 3 had neither a good story nor laughable jokes nor good acting from anyone (except the Male leads) and let's not talk about the 4th part the better which actually had NOTHING! Being a huge AK fan giving one star to this is also a crime!",

Guiltilly or not.Even Anees Bazmee made Welcome which was a benchmark in Bollywood.But Sajid Khan And Farhad Samji are intollerable. Housefull 4 is a kind of a film which makes us compare which was the worse part first,second,third or fourth?while watching it because we are thrown in our thoughts at the very start of the film. Neither the film is much funny nor it has a kind of magic which makes us believ disbelief.I watched Entertainment directed by Farhad Samji as a child, this sort of films are crappy mind numbling creations filled with tacky humor and childish gags supported by hamming of deliberate actors. I did'nt enjoy Housefull 4 because i have grown up but i will argue confidently i won't have enjoyed it as a child also because not even a six-year old would be categorized as a age bracket in this sort of movie which is both misleading and illogical. And offensive is the word which already attached with housefull films.They insult women,they insult homos,they insult our minds and now they are insulting the ancient era's.To be fair i have been an Akshay Kumar fan and i am his biggest fan since long time i have enjoyed his slapsticks such as Garam Masala and Bhagam Bhag they were dhamaal multistarrers but housefull 4 is not only offensive but it is unfunny and belongs to Humshakals family of films. But to give credit where it is due,the locations are mindblowing and some scenes with jokes do land expectedly Akshay Kumar is good as Bala but not great as Harry and tries too hard to make us laugh and mostly succeeds but Akshay Welcome and Bhool Bhulaiyaa were still far better films i would prefer on any day rest of the cast is wasted. What is also missing his bromance of Akshay and Riteish which is totally a concern because atlas it was a lifeline in these otherwise mindboggling films with idiotic gags and wholesome torture. But the grand presentation some average music (espesicially good Bala Track) and some hard hamming make it save from boredom by death. Chunkey pandey is also seen last time as Akhree Pasta!

I ended up loving the film and this is by far the most entertaining comedy film I have seen this year.Akshay is gold. He has done such an amazing job with his comic timing and expressions. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job. He is perfect for the role. He does two role with distinct personality differences and did a marvelous job. I liked most of the cast as well especially Chunky Pandey's work.The set is gorgeous. The costumes are amazing. The film shows time period of 1419 and some gorgeous looking palaces. The film looks pretty, cinematography is excellent.Songs are nice. I liked Ek chumma and Shaitan ka saala. Dialogues are amazing. Most of the comedy relies on play on words and I found those hilarious. The most wonderful thing was that the film did not take itself too seriously there were some self-parody that I liked.I liked Housefull, and Housefull 3 but did not expect Housefull 4 to be this good. Very entertaining film. I haven't laughed this much in a while. The film deserves much higher rating than current 3.3.",

            "review_title": "Housefull 4 Review",
            "content": "In 1419, the love stories of three couples are left unfinished owing to a conspiracy. In 2019, reincarnated, they meet again and the romances are rekindled. But this time pairings are mixed up. Can what was done in 1419 be undone in 2019?\nIn its fourth edition the Housefull franchise ensures that it takes its brand of over the top and mindless humour forward. Actually, it's more like the reverse, since it rewinds back six hundred years to the 15th century.\nBut first, it's London of 2019, where Harry (Akshay Kumar) is a hairdresser who alternately has bouts of memory loss and flashes from his past life. Max (Bobby Deol) and Roy (Riteish Deshmukh) are his brothers. Together they hatch a plan to marry Kriti, Neha and Pooja (Kriti Sanon, Kriti Kharbanda and Pooja Hegde respectively), the three daughters of a billionaire, Thakral (Ranjeet), to be able to pay off the loot money of a mafia don Michael that they have misplaced. When the marriage destination is inadvertently fixed as Sitamgarh in India, the couples head there and Harry meets his past life friend Aakhri Pasta (Chunky Pandey) and recalls everything from that time. The three pairs of lovers - Rajkumar Bala Dev Singh (Akshay Kumar) and Princess Madhu (Kriti Sanon), Bangdu Maharaj (Riteish Deshmukh) and Princess Mala (Pooja Hegde), Angrakshak Dharamputra (Bobby Deol, yes the pun is not lost here) and Princess Meena (Kriti Kharbanda) are killed, leaving their love stories unfinished when they get caught up in an evil design to eliminate them. Although, Bala himself is 'shaitaan ka sala' and has laid a trap to marry Mala, so that he can become the king of Sitamgarh.\nThe main hitch now is that, in 2019 the couples are mixed up, and Bala (Akshay Kumar) decides that the pairings must be set right so none of them end up with their sister or brother-in-law from their past life.\nSo with this central plot point in hand, Housefull 4 takes off. Of course, this mission to set things 'right' leads to confusions galore and a deluge of characters, who spring in and out of the narrative and from their last life to present life. There is a sprinkling of mindless comic moments owing to the general silliness all around. And a dollop of low- brow, crass humor. A special low point is when Princess Meena pretends to be  to convince Dharamputra to marry her. Add to that, there are portions that drag and jokes that feel dated.\nThe film's increasingly loud background score (especially in the second half) and the CGI in the period setting leave a lot to be desired. And a running joke on three pigeons named Neil, Nitin and Mukesh that doesn't actually fly.\nOf the actresses, it is Kriti Sanon who has the most lengthy role and she pulls it off well. Kriti Kharbanda and Pooja Hegde are reduced to being props, owing to their limited screen time. Interestingly, all three are uniformly dressed in the same colors, as if it were a deliberate attempt to not be able to tell them apart. Riteish Deshmukh gets the quirks of his characters well and does manage to pull in some laughs. Manoj Pahwa, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Rana Daggubatti and Johnny Lever have their oddball parts to play in the film - though some seem just pointless. And yes, Archana Puran Singh pops up often in a photo.\nBut largely, it is Akshay Kumar who has the most fleshed out role and shoulders most of the film. And he definitely shines in most of them getting the comic timing right.\nNeedless to add, don't go looking for logic in Housefull4 (but still, how did the blood on Rana Daggubatti's blue jacket magically disappear in the last scene?). In the last 30 minutes, Kriti repeatedly asks, \"Yeh sab kya ho raha hain?\" A sentiment that could be echoed by the viewers.\nOverall, Housefull4 ends up as a complete mad caper. Which, if you're a fan of the Housefull brand of comedy, might appeal to you. But if you are not, then proceed with caution.",

The ladies who understoodThe ladies are more active than before as all ...\"have the karate belt \" ..\n..\n.I m ...joking but this is true . All ladies are very capable to beat men ! This happens to more than 5 times in the movie .The story concept is quite impressive even if the story is weird after near the first half in Sitamgarh and gets even more weirder as the story unfolds. Equilibrium is before end whre present and past coexist with all story members effected in this time-mix . A few examples:Aksay is seen to discuss with the birds - something s omen?- later you see his friends do the same . Any other watching them thinks they are mad\nIN the same weird PoV the funny think man (Jony Lever ) identifies himself as a former dancing woman!The today's Pappu identifies himself as a bad Hercules acting as Leonidas in the Marvel's movie 300 after the 3 friends identified him. Morphing CGI and a bit of fantasy helped for that. .Weird and funny together. Faulty by-remixing of Greek history in an Indian movie!!!Madhu + Bala = Madhubala the former names of the older pair. Very interesting word play (starring Akshay + Kriti) . Good also to notice Kriti is Crete in Greek and Madubala was one of the most famous Greek songs of the 60s era,By closing here I dnt liked to the whole result.

There - I summarized all four films for you.But, seriously? The humor is a cross between the censor board and wannabe PewDiePie pop culture experts - the screenplay writing duo Farhad/Samji. Now, agreed, they come out very well in certain films - but, they decide to dump all their rejected jokes and put them here for the sake of it? The four films are filled with a ton of self-reference and euphemism.Now, back to actually talkin' 'bout the film. So - Harry, Roy and Max. Firstly, how do they know Hindi and look like you picked someone from their fourty-floor high-rise from upscale Bandra? But, okay, the characters.Harry looks 43 when he's supposed to be 24, and well - he's a total pure soul, except he wasn't. He is a naive gold digger, most likely a cheap rip-off of Prem (potrayed by Salman Khan) from Andaaz Apna Apna. He has amnesia for some reason (cue the \"e Ghajini\" chants) and he is opposite his past.",

But most of the 1* reviews are of those guys who have a specific agenda and this anyone can verify by visiting their profiles.Coming to Housefull 4 review. My review 5/10. IT PROMISES ENTERTAINMENT AND IT DELIVERS. If Golmaal Again is ok Total Dhamaal is ok then Housefull 4 is definitely OK. A thumbs up for the team from entertainment lovers.It has slapstick moments as well as some hilarious situational comic moments. The blend of period and comedy works well. It is the grandest comedy to come out of Indian Film Industry. It is the first Reincarnation comedy to come out from cinema.Positives:\nBala and Harry, characters that will be remembered for a long time by comedy lovers. Some ROFL moments in Akshay Kumar style. IHIYEYEE whenever this thing happened the audience were guaranteed to laugh.Kriti Sanon who perfectly fits in the drama as well as comedy scenes.VFX and locales. Its a movie to be watched in a theatre.Johnny Lever and Ranjit provide some genuine laughable crazy moments.Background score is nice one.Climax is a laugh riot...right from the Mujhse Shaadi Karogi song played :P to the 4 knives xD.Treat to watch characters in 2 eras.Negatives:\nBadla kawali in 2nd half.Riteish Deshmukh was a bit underutilised.Songs this time aren't as peppy and foot tapping as previous parts.As it has slapstick humor some jokes fall flat and some are like laugh when the audience laughs.Bobby Deol is kind of misfit in this movie as comedy is not his cup of tea although he tries.Comedy movies have been bashed by critics but enjoyed by audience. Be it Dhol, Phir Hera Pheri, Bhagam Bhag, Dhamaal or Bhool Bhulaiyaa all have been given negative reviews. Housefull 4 is not in this league but it's decent in parts.",

But me & my mom like it.The thing i hate the most the casting of Bobby & Two Kritis.I also hate the screening time of Chunky sir as Aakhri Pasta,its just for some few times. Not like housefull 2.So, you guys can watch this if you guys want to clarified your curiosity. Nothing else!It have just average comedy.You can watch this with family. There's no doubt that it's a family movie..",

People judging sexual preferences of other person, actress calling herself \"mein abla hu tabla nahi\" are one of the many disgusting lines given to the leads here.I was shocked to see that Akshay agreed to do such a movie which completely tarnishes his image as a person who is trying to give a social message by doing movies like \"Padman\", \"Toilet\" .The only rating given by me is for the comic timing of Akshay apart from that this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. Sorry to see such a movie even being in theaters for so long forget about earning crores.Seriously, it's hard to understand that people thought it as a comedy as it shows the standard that the movies has degraded to these days",

The story very much reflects around him and keeps him in front of the audience for most part of the movie. Rest of the five actors/actresses have got their part of the roles almost equally divided. The actresses not only add glamour and beauty but also a lot of comedy and emotions. Other characters like hotel manager (played by Johnny Lever), Akhri Pasta (played by Chunky Pandey), Maharaj((played by Ranjit),etc. are equally supportive and entertaining. The villain of the movie, (Suryabhan/Michael) also does play an important part in the movie. The movie brings a rare/different type of story for the audience and is a must watch.",

Akshay kumar define himself to next level, and Bobby Deol is always a splendid actor, he must act more in future movies, Ritesh has performed equally important.

Bobby deol did good comeback makes me remember of his movie chor machaye shor.Story: Akshay Kumar forgets when something rings hard near him but goes back his past as raja bala. Ritiesh and booby are his brothers in 2019 who were nartaki and angrakshsk in their previous birth respectively. They were supposed to marry the three lead actress but due to something (see the movie) cudnt marry and now Akshay reminds rest 5 of them about their rebirth to get married.Didn't reveal whole story here.
