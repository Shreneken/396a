            "content": "\"Rashomon\" was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit (becoming, at the time, the highest-grossing foreign film in America) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn't a movie where you say, \"Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it's done in all the movies.\" Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, \"Basic,\" which copies a good portion of \"Rashomon's\" concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.The film begins under a structure which reads \"Rashomon\" on its exterior, in a small Japanese village. It's raining outside and a woodcutter (Takashi Shumura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner (Kichijiro Ueda), and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know -- of a brutal murder a few days prior.Kurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event -- the slaying of an innocent man (the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer, the wife of the victim, and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man.\"Rashomon\" is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash, but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point (he uses a good deal of it in \"Ikiru\") but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story, not provide an easy solution to all the problems.Is there resolution in the finale of \"Rashomon\"? To a degree. But, like \"Ikiru,\" it also leaves an open answer to its audience -- this film questions us, and our humanity, and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good, and in my opinion the message of \"Rashomon\" is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting.",

            "content": "To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the \"Best Foreign Film\" category was created for the Oscars is one thing, but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema, regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community, but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense, sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders, not because they are worthy enough, but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences, thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rash\u00f4mon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rash\u00f4mon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film (pointing his camera at the sun, filming deep within the jungle, and the mockery of truth), that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being \"borrowed\". His bold storytelling, creative camera work, and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong, the direction was flawless, and the story was compelling, there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rash\u00f4mon. This is the story of murder, betrayal, and rape and in any typical \"courthouse\" film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered, but not in Rash\u00f4mon. Kurosawa gives us the \"black sheep\" of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film, I thought I was going to get a clear-cut story with honesty and troubled souls, but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end, but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story, that there possibly is no way of knowing the true \"truth\". Four different souls, seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the \"truth\" may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth, and like Kaiser Soze, the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that \"it didn't exist\". Deep within Rash\u00f4mon the truth is hidden, and it may never emerge, but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film, after several viewings, and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes, Rash\u00f4mon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction, there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin, the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently (even in his own) and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane, passionate, loyal, and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or over-the-top, I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusing/suspicious of them all, Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed, the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall, I thought that this was a near perfect film. Kurosawa is intense, original, and adeptly secure about his stories. I have seen the same passion in Ran, and it cannot be denied. My only concern with this film is that if you are going to watch this movie, make sure that you can devote your entire mind to it. I found myself watching it three times because I could not stay focused (outside factors) enough to see those darkly hidden themes. I especially enjoyed the unearthed darkness of humanity, which is hinted on at the end. The fact that after hearing these stories of murder and rape, it doesn't stop one from continuing along a similar path. It is a powerful tale that should be enjoyed by all! Grade: **** out of *****",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa was one of those directors, the first from the Eastern hemisphere, to develop the form and structure of cinema in ways it hadn't been. The story he used for Rashomon is now, like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, and Yojimbo, a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense, Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane, Battleship Potemkin, Rear Window, or Open City. Tee basic premise- Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon, is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman, the bandit, the as well as the four in discussion, is that their emotions reveal their humanity, even if their details reveal nothing, or everything. It's difficult to say whether character goes over story here, or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa's psychology with these people. The opening shot of the house is a perfect representation of the mature of the picture, something that has fallen apart over time due to disasters that go beyond control of individuals. The man who heard the testimonies of the trial says \"I don't understand\". This has been a discussed line, since essentially he's saying the point right up front. All the information won't ease his puzzlement. The three who discuss the details of the crimes and confessions are crucial- they speak for us, what our opinions might be, and we listen to each version of the story, the characters, the fears, the pride, the shame, and the search for judgment and/or truth in the situation.Along with being director and co-adapter, Kurosawa's mastery is revealed heavily in his use of editing- there are short, fleeting moments that hint, or rather pronounce, emotions and thoughts. For instance, when we first see Tajomaru, the bandit, played by action-legend Toshiro Mifune, he is looking up at the sky, bound in straps to keep him from moving, and for a second, or less than a second, there's a shot of what he sees in the sky, then back to his face which reveals an expression that borders on skeptical, and a bit crazed, or more. Mifune's part is of a barbarian, but all the more believable as a human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires- he sees the woman in the woods, and knows he wants her, and while he reflects that he didn't have to have killed the man, he did as a last resort as a man with an urge. This is intensified by a sadistic flee with his actions. What's intriguing about that first description/recollection of the battle between him and the other man, is that it seems like it could be the truth, and to one viewer it could, and to another it seems like it could all be apart of his hyperactive and trapped imagination. And in the attack of the bandit on the woman, at first to him, it's like a game, then in later descriptions, he feels a little more un-easy, then later, it's of neither pleasure or discomfort, it just is. This kind of technique later happens with the woman who was victim (who has conviction, though is herself an archetype of Lifetime women), the presence who saw it \"all\", and with the man who in the beginning didn't understand. In each telling the expressions, the cut-aways, the lighting and movement by Kazuo Miyagawa, it's equally startling, exhilarating. That the film gives off such a hypnotic aura isn't surprising, or perhaps it is for those in the grips of the emotion of it all- the dead man's story is like the hook ripping into a twelve foot bass. The final accouter of the tale proves the most accurate to the common observer, yet Kurosawa knows that's not the point- if he made it as such to be bold AND had a definite concrete point, the ending would be as poignant when revealed is the truth, or what one could believe as the closest thing to it is. We know why that last person didn't want to get involved with the courts with what he knows: his story is no more a revelation, of any comfort or consolation to the listeners, than the others. I highly recommend this to anyone, and to those who have distaste to foreign films should view it once anyway- it's certainly not a long movie, and it won't loose its grip on anyone willing to give itself to the tale(s). For me, it's another to add to my top 50 of all time.",

            "content": "\"Rashomon\" tells a very simple tale in a very complicated manner, presenting four 'versions' of the truth, each from a party either witness to or involved in the incident depicted. It is not the film's intent to have you piece together a puzzle since that would be impossible based on how drastically the four tales differ. We know that lies don't enter the equation since the participating persons all claim to be guilty. \"Rashomon\" is not about choosing a version of the incident you believe is true; it is about human perspective and how it shapes what we see. Even if we truly believe what we have seen is true, is it really?The film opens when a priest and woodcutter are encountered by a man who engages in a conversation about crime with them and subsequently learns that a samurai has been killed in the woods and his wife raped by a bandit. These two details are the basic, practically undisputed facts which make up the foundation of the four versions of the story we hear: the bandit's, the woman's, her husband's (through a medium), and the woodcutter's (the only presumably objective account, which still does not make sense in relation to the others). In many ways the best thing about \"Rashomon\" is that it never reveals what actually happens (or if any of the four accounts is in fact true), and although we are not meant to solve the mystery (the idea here is that there is no objective truth since humans are too selfish and dishonest to view anything without bias) the story structure is still brilliant and adds a lot of ambiance to the film. The narrative flow is strong and the method seems fresh and inventive today despite countless imitations (including one inexplicably popular one- \"The Usual Suspects\").\"Rashomon\" is very much a visual film. It would be reduced to unimportant and insignificant fare without the cinematography, which captures the mood and feel of the jungle perfectly, as does the score. The film achieves an epic feel very rare for films filmed in fullscreen, especially during the battle between the bandit and the samurai during the last telling of the story. Kurosawa was also wise enough to choose a location for the film that would accurately capture the eerie, slightly disturbing mood of the story. Just picture the events taking place anywhere other than a jungle.\"Rashomon\" is not without its (minor) flaws, however. While theatrical acting (Kurosawa was fascinated with silent film) worked perfectly with films like \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Throne of Blood\", it does nothing but take away from the realism of this oft claustrophobic human drama. Yes, Mifune (Tajomaru, the bandit) does provide an interesting spin on his character for each telling, and Takashi Shumura (the woodcutter) seems as honest and real as any character could possibly be, but nearly all of that effect is lost every time Machiko Kyo appears on screen. It is hard to take her seriously and during moments when I should have been close to tears I was much closer to laughter. I'm not sure how much blame I would place on her as Kurosawa probably asked her to act exactly as she does. While discussing actors I have to (unconventionally) note Fumiko Honma as the medium, who brings a wonderfully eerie air to the film during its greatest scenes.I don't think \"Rashomon\" is Kurosawa's best or most important film, but it is still a masterful piece of cinema which is absolutely essential for any film lover. It's extraordinary how much Kurosawa accomplished at such an early stage in his career and without the benefit of the lavish budgets he was allotted for later projects. The film's main question is also still relevant and confusing today: is what we think we see really the truth, and to what extent does subjectivity affect perception?4.5/5.",

            "content": "'People forget the unpleasant things.  They only remember what they want to remember.'In Rashomon the editing tells \u00bd of the story.  It may feel experimental or unconventional, but Kurosawa perfects the concept second by second, directing and editing.  This film didn't need a big budget to come perfectly to the point.  It's a simple tale, but not a superficial tale.  Different points of view and selective memories ('It's true! I saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. 'We humans are weak creatures. That's why we lie, even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking.  Selfish excuses vs trust in other people.Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.  That is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal, or try to copy when they fail.  Admitted 'Memento' (2000, Nolan) is a truly great one.  Still not THAT universal.  'Pulp Fiction' (1994) didn't come close,  'La Commare Secca' (1962) also didn't.  'Ghost dog: the way of the samurai' (1999) touched another border of the concept, or does it?The use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence, not only in Rashomon, but also in Kurosawa's forthcoming films, and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.The cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on.  The shadows of leaves and branches, captured by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, make you really feel 'in the woods', while the actors (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune, Takashi Shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers).  It may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film.  After weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it's only 85 min), and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that Kurosawa made. 10/10",

            "content": "\"Well, men are only men. That's why they lie. They can't tell the truth, even to themselves.\"Rashomon was the first film from critically acclaimed Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, that I got to see. I was expecting some great things from this film considering it ranks among the best films in history. The black and white cinematography was breathtaking and there were some great long shots, but the story fell flat and the performances here were a bit theatrical for my taste. The film is only 85 minutes long, but it seemed to drag forever. The film was made in 1950 so I can imagine there were several inventive elements incorporated here, but they really don't stand out today because we've seen those tricks so many times now. For example, it is claimed that this was the first time that a camera was pointed directly at the sun, but of course that doesn't have an effect on the viewer today. However, I've seen many other classic films which I thought still managed to seduce me and have timed really well, but it wasn't the case with Rashomon. The film focuses on different realities and perceptions about humanity, but in doing so it really never manages to find a deep meaning. It focuses on the lies we tell, our selfish desires, and our pursuit or need to believe in the goodness of humanity (reflected through the Priest in this film), but ultimately it plays down to discovering that sometimes reality is just a matter of perception and differing point of views. \"Rashomon is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meaning,\" is what Kurosawa would say about this film when approached about its meaning. What I can say about Rashomon is that the cinematography is great and the lighting effects were also astonishing for its time. The film takes place during a heavy rain storm (classic trade mark from Kurosawa) as a priest (Minoru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) are taking refuge from the rain and talking about a terrible crime that has been committed. A peasant (Kichijiro Ueda) who is unfamiliar with what they are talking about joins the conversation and the two men recount the events of what they consider the most horrific crime they have experienced. The woodcutter happened to discover the body of a samurai three days ago as he walked across the woods and was summoned to testify at a trial for the samurai's murder. The priest also has to testify since he had run into the samurai (Machiko Kyo) and his wife (Masayuki Mori) as they were passing through the town before the murder took place. The woodcutter and the priest then recount what they heard from the three direct witnesses of the murder: the suspected bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who apparently raped the wife and killed the samurai, the wife, and the samurai himself who testifies through a medium. They all give different accounts of what took place, and each account is as unreasonable as the next. The story is told in the form of flashbacks through the perception of each witness.The main issue I had with the film is that the horrendous crime never felt like it was that terrible or memorable to begin with. It was just a common crime, a terrible one, but nothing to have an existential or philosophical debate about. Besides the main concern they had wasn't because a murder was committed but rather that everyone seemed to be lying about what happened. They couldn't find a reasonable explanation for an unreasonable act. The flashbacks were sort of interesting despite me not liking the performances, and I really liked the fighting choreography staged near the end between the bandit and the samurai. It was nothing you would expect from a Japanese samurai film. That was probably my favorite scene in this film and it had some funny moments as well. I can see the influence the director has had in modern films like Vantage Point or The Usual Suspects, but despite that I had a difficult time carrying about this movie. Well I guess I'm on the minority here, but Kurosawa would have to accept my opinion and the perception I had of this film because that is what this film is really about: differing perceptions of what we believe to be real.",

            "content": "It's hard to tell just how striking \"Rash\u00f4mon\" might have seemed to those who watched it in 1950, rather than seeing it after so many subsequent movies and other works have made use of its techniques and ideas. But it's clear that it is a technical and creative success. The story itself is not particularly satisfying, which was most likely by design, and the movie is carried by its structure and by the concept of the markedly different perspectives on the same series of events. The cast also deserve their share of credit for how well it works, and the photography is excellent, as it is in almost all of Kurosawa's films.Kurosawa's expertise makes the interwoven sequences of past and present - essentially telling two different stories - not only work flawlessly, but fit together thematically. It's even more commendable when compared to some of the subsequent films that have tried to use similar ideas, only to come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative. Kurosawa was also working with much less in terms of possible precedents.In one sense, the choice of specific story material could seem a little odd.The downbeat, rather sordid scenario makes the movie somewhat less enjoyable than several of Kurosawa's other pictures (which is, admittedly, a pretty high standard), and as a result \"Rash\u00f4mon\" is more a film to respect and admire than one to enjoy and take pleasure from. Still, it does have significantly more substance to it than do most of the more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative in their portrayals of humanity. Such stories are more trendy at present, and they often receive undue praise simply for so being.At the same time, the lack of sympathetic characters and the paucity of hopeful developments bring out all the more its success in developing its ideas about narrative and about reality, ideas that are more fundamental and, in their way, perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events.",

The film is both aesthetically beautiful, using amazing camera techniques, extensive periods of silence and a very limited cast to deliver the action, and the story is typically Japanese...ostensibly amazingly simple, but complex to the point of sending you cross-eyed!The basic tale is this: a woman and her husband, a Samurai, are travelling through a forest when they meet a bandit. The bandit has sex with the woman and the Samurai ends up dead. That's it. This tale is related to us through the woodcutter and a monk who saw the protagonists give their evidence to the police (the dead Samurai through a medium), but unfortunately the three tales conflict with one another. Each confessor says that they killed the Samurai, and then we hear from the woodcutter who in fact witnessed the event, who gives us a version of events that borrows from each individual account, and is still less credible!The conclusion presented by Kurosawa seems to be firstly that individuals see things from different perspectives, but secondly, and most importantly, that there is no objective truth. There is no answer as to what took place in the forest, and Kurosawa offers us no way of knowing what went on. Each story is as credible as the other, and so no conclusion about guilt can be reached. We even have to think at the end that as the whole thing is reported to us by the woodcutter and priest, was there any truth in anything we heard at all?This film leads to an especially tricky conclusion for a movie-goer! Your eyes are supposed to show you objective truth, but they don't. The camera is supposed not to lie, but it does. I feel that the simple message is that subjectivity lies at the heart of life, and this subjectivity needs to be recognised before any attempt is made to understand events.",

Instead of a sprawling, multi-faceted historical epic, this uniquely original and inspiring film is a different beast entirely; a cinematic experiment if you will, or an exploration of the human psyche. It covers a seemingly straightforward event from different perspectives, throwing into question the nature of truth, while also exploring themes of the unreliable narrator and perception. It's also a highly entertaining film at that.The small cast work wonderfully with the given material, particularly Toshiro Mifune, who's handed the scene-stealing role of the bandit who starts off the story. However, Machiko Kyo gets the meatiest role as the put-upon wife, and she's required to do the brunt of the emoting. Kudos also to Masayuki Mori, excelling as the typical stony-faced samurai character, and Kurosawa regular Takashi Shimura who's present in the framing sequences which help to set up the film's atmosphere.Kurosawa's camera-work is first rate and he brings his forest backdrop to life, utilising all manner of shots to tell his story. He was famously the first director ever to shoot into the sun, but I particularly liked the stand-off in the second version of the tale between the three characters, which utilises point-of-view shots that Sergio Leone later used most famously for the duel in THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. In the end, though, it's the originality of the film \u2013 and the clever exploration of a topic that in itself is quite difficult to use in the medium \u2013 that makes RASHOMON a classic and well worth anybody's time.",

            "content": "As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. Rashomon pioneered Kurosawa's dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai's wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai's spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai's version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn't want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. The concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10",

The basic story of the crime is that a bandit (Mifune) comes across a husband and wife traveling through the forest. The bandit, Tajomaru, seduces/assaults the Masako (Kyo) after tying up her husband Takehiro (Mori), and soon after, Takehiro is dead. What happens between the times Tajomaru encounters the couple and the discovery of Takehiro's body is what is left to be discovered. Masako, Tajomaru and even Takehiro (with the assistance of a medium) each tell their account of the story, each taking blame for Takehiro's death. The fourth telling is from a passer-by, and the audience is left to decide which is the true account.I absolutely loved this film. I had heard that Yimou Zhang's \"Hero\" had, if not as an homage, employed the same technique of storytelling and perspective, but seeing this great film was a real treat. The story is original and rich, and Kurosawa always is able to pull great performances from his actors. I found \"Rashomon\" to be extremely compelling from start to finish, and even managed to be really creeped out at one point. (The psychic medium is pure, unadulterated nightmare fuel) From the very little that I know of Japanese cinema of the 1950's & 1960's, I realize that Kurosawa was not the only director, but he certainly was the trailblazer and set the bar for the genre for decades to come. His peers were putting out material, it was just fairly primitive. (It is easy to forget that not every country's film industry was as opulent as America's) To see this kind of film, a film that is actually incredibly simple, but so ingeniously conceived of and executed makes me remember why I have been and always will be both a student of and lover of film. 8/10 --Shelly",

His style was always so breathtakingly simple that you can't help but get sucked into the rainy and sunny bestial world depicted in here, with a beautiful use of the black and white nitrate film stock contrasting against a sordid storyline. I've probably seen it 10 times now over the decades and it seems to get better every time I settle down to it - it's been a continual treat.A horror story from a few days previous is recounted on a ferociously wet day: beautiful woman is (apparently) raped by animalistic bandit in front of her husband who is then (apparently) murdered. But who really did what to who and why? It's told from four viewpoints: the bandit's, the honourable woman's, the heroic dead husband's via a rather startling medium and lastly a breathless version from a timid eye-witness. The event becomes a crime scene with the beauty of forest surrounding us and splintered sunlight beaming down on us through the trees bearing mute witness to the savage few moments. It's a salutary lesson in Human Beings vs Objectivity; the psychologies of the main protagonists are laid bare, as well as the story-tellers, even to Kurosawa and the viewers themselves. Who's telling the truth/ was it a mixture of all versions/ was there another truth untold? Only you can decide!I urge all innocent bystanders who have a problem with b&w non-HD 4:3 subtitled Japanese films from 1950 to try to get over it! Because it's a riveting journey, expertly handled by probably the best film director who's ever lived, all subjective of course.",

Kurosawa is one of three men who invented film, and this is his most influential one. Much is made of the construction of the story, which you can read elsewhere. I'd like to focus here on what I think is the rarest of Kurosawa'a abilities: the way he changes the eye of the camera -- and the composition of the world it creates for us -- for each of the narratives.Some are impressionistic; some flat and full of contrast; some deep. Some are composed around people, some around the environment with people in it, some around fleeting motion. Sometimes the words are the organizing principle, sometimes images.I know other directors who can do this once within a film: to twist the consciousness of the viewing eye to match the perspective of the narration, even some capable of a dual view within and without. But I know of no one else capable of doing so multiply within the same film and with such obvious link to the story.The DVD is astonishingly clear. It has an introduction by Altman which says nothing interesting; but watch his hands. The DVD has a commentary which is horrid -- just the sort of talky vapidity about apparent insight the film criticizes!",

            "content": "This film has a lot in common with movies that turn out to be a dream in which the main character wakes up to realize that what just happened never occurred. I find those kinds of pictures less than satisfying because they seem to cop out of a final resolution to the story. \"Rashomon\" takes a somewhat similar approach, but instead of setting up a dream narrative, Kurosawa has his characters relate the circumstances of a murder from the perspective of four different observers. I can't say that that isn't a valid approach, but the problem I have is that the characters relating their stories don't seem to have credibility on their side. If I had to make a personal judgment, I'd say the woodcutter's appraisal of events seemed most valid because he didn't have a personal stake in the outcome of a murder investigation.Looking individually at each of the players - the bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) relates a tale that builds up his own self esteem - he valiantly fights the husband (Masayuki Mori), crossing swords with him twenty three times. The wife (Machiko Kyo) relating her version of events seems to be seeking atonement for her shame in being victimized by Tajomaru. The husband, telling his story through a medium after his death, seems willing to spare his wife the agony of betrayal and for suffering the shame of her rape. Finally, the woodcutter, who has nothing to gain by telling what he saw, except for the possible humiliation for not intervening because he was cowardly, was probably the closest to the truth about what happened. But we'll never know because the truth, which lies in the eye of the beholder, can potentially shift and change with each viewing of the film.It will probably take some more viewings of the movie for me to gain a greater appreciation of it. As with \"Seven Samurai\", I find Kurosawa's pacing to be drawn out more than necessary; note the long time it took for the woodcutter to make his way to the scene of the crime in his version of the story. I'm also put off by the histrionics of a character like Tojomaru, who's over the top and manic delivery make him seem out of control. Granted, these are matters of preference with me, so I look at them somewhat like the players in the film who have their own biases in telling their story.",

Although I prefer \"Ran\" and \"The Seven Samurai\" for reasons of personal taste, I don't think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that \"Rashomon\" was his best film. Made in 1950, it is so unusual and so far ahead of it's time that it takes your breath away.The story itself deserves a mention: A husband & wife travelling through woods are attacked by a thief, who ties up the husband and rapes the wife. This is as much of the story as we can be sure of. The husband ends up dead of a stab wound. How did he die? Who was responsible? Each of the three give their accounts before a court (the dead husband through a medium!), and each account is entirely different. A woodcutter who witnessed the events gives a fourth, entirely different, account.Each flashback is an absolute gem in itself, and lives long in the mind. Toshiro Mifune as the thief exudes more raw masculinity and charisma that I think I have ever seen in ANY movie, and creates a totally believeable character. Machiko Kyo as the wife is superb in what are essentially four different roles, her own version being the highlight. The husband's character is the least well developed, but since he spends a lot of the time either tied up or dead, that's not really surprising.Because the viewer knows that each flashback is highly personal to the teller, a vast amount of brainpower and concentration are required if you are going to try to work out what actually DID happen. Alternatively, watch the film twice back-to-back, once for the visuals and acting, and once for the detective work and philosophical implications.My favourite shot in the movie is one which starts with the husband and wife kneeling, facing each other, a view of the wife over the shoulder of the husband; the camera then moves round to the side and simultaneously zooms in on the wife's profile; then pulls back behind the wife, ending with a view of the husband's face over the shoulder of the wife - a mirror image of the initial shot in the sequence. Absolutely awesome! And dating from 1950! Unbelievable!I normally try to keep my reviews a LOT shorter than this, but I make no apologies in this case. Indeed, there are lots of other points I would like to make (I haven't even mentioned the central importance of the dagger, or the relevance of the Rashomon gate itself). I could go on and on and on... however, a better use of your time would be to seek out and watch this film...NOW!",

No Kurasawa film is the same without great scenery and cinematography, and Rashomon is no disappointment in that regard. The camera is always moving but never feels like too much due to how subtly composed they (and the editing) are, and the scenery especially the beautifully lit jungle is just as striking, not as epic as Seven Samurai but still making its mark. The music, though I may prefer Ran's score when it comes to scores for Kurasawa's films, is always fitting with the mood and atmosphere of the film, and with its exploration of the relativity of truth the four accounts of the woodland encounter between a bandit and a wealthy couple is written in a compelling and completely credible manner. Kurasawa's direction as ever is superb, as are the performances of Machiko Kyo and Toshiru Mifune. Overall, a truly remarkable film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Imagine playing that game with your friends but with trick cards, loaded dice, and everyone's allowed, if not obligated, to cheat. Got it? Solve the mystery!Eventually the result would likely be all of you sitting around, sullen, confused & frustrated with each of you taking turns muttering, \"I just don't understand!\" And that is exactly how the opening scene of \"Rashomon\" begins.Two depressed looking men are sitting in the ruins of an old building beneath a sign that reads \"Rashomon\". They are waiting for a torrential storm to pass. A third man joins them also seeking shelter and asks them why the long faces. That's your cue to strap on your seatbelt because after that, all bets are off in the ways of truth, perception and storytelling. The two men tell the tale, as they had heard through witnesses' testimonies it in court, regarding a dead man, his wife, and the bandit accused of the murder. The twist is that each testimony drastically contradicts each of the others. And as the story is visually played out for us in each version, we suddenly realize how subjective \"truth\" is.The effect is poetic and powerful. As Robert Altman (director of MASH, Shortcuts, Gosford Park) commented:\"When one sees a film, you see the characters on screen; it's not like reading where you imagine certain things. You see very specific things. You see a tree, you see a sword. So you take that as truth. But in this film, you take it as truth, and then you find out that it is not necessarily true. And you see various versions of the episode that has taken place, and you're never told which is true and which isn't true ... So it becomes a poem, and it cracks this visual thing that we have in our minds that if we see it, it must be a fact.\"Augmented by Kurosawa's brilliant directing, Miyagawa's excellent camera work, and the symbolic majesty of the forest of Nara which constantly presents a very Monet-like, impressionistic veil of leaves and shadows throughout the film, \"Rashomon\" is so much more than a whodunnit. It's the greatest of them all, leading us the viewers deeper and deeper into the psychological and metaphysical thicket, until ultimately we may end up feeling like one of the characters in the movie who laments: \"I don't even know my own soul.\"",

            "content": "These are the opening words of Rash\u00f4mon, and in a way that's also a summary of the entire film. It is the story of four testimonies of the same event that couldn't differ more. It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner, as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial, and what they heard there made them puzzled, and after they told everything, the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. What happened? Takehiro, a samurai has been murdered and Masako, his wife has been raped, the suspect is Taj\u00f4maru. And indeed, in court he confesses to have raped the woman and to have killed the samurai in duel. Masako however tells quite a different story: After Taj\u00f4maru took advantage of her, he left and despair and pity made her kill her husband, but to commit suicide, just as she originally planned, she's to weak. Then the murdered samurai speaks, through the voice of a medium. In his story, he committed suicide because of disgust at his wife, who asked Tajomaru to kill him in order to accompany the robber. At the end, we hear even another story from the woodcutter, who was, as he reveals, an eyewitnesses. In his version, Taj\u00f4maru killed the samurai in a duel (or rather: in a brawl) that was demanded by his wife. Now what did really happen? Why did at least three of these four people lie? The reason cannot be (as the commoner says at one point) that everyone told what was useful for him, since, except for the woodcutter, everyone told a story in which he was the killer. So do they all think their story is true? Do they all feel guilty for a reason or another? These questions will cause endless discussions once you watch this film. And the end, Kurosawa raises another question: If man keeps lying (to others as well as to himself), does that mean he is evil? This question is underlined by the crying baby the three men find in the Rash\u00f4mon gate. Kurosawa's answer to this question is clearly a no: the woodcutter takes the baby to raise him and the priest realizes that he is a good man, even although he's a lier and a thief. But if Kurosawa had only raised these questions, Rash\u00f4mon wouldn't have become such a classic as it is considered today. He is telling his story with breathtaking images, as when he's holding his camera directly into the sun, when he uses the wood, light and shadow to create a dense atmosphere, or when he shows the trial scenes, where he makes the witnesses talk to the viewers to make them feel like the judges. The fight scenes are all terrifically shot, and the scene before Masako kills Takehiro can move you to tears. Rash\u00f4mon also has some good acting, especially the breathtaking Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in one of film history's most unforgettable performances as the wild robber Taj\u00f4maru, always jumping around and seemingly untamable and unafraid. All this makes Rash\u00f4mon a mind-boggling experience, that had me talk all night through with friends of mine, and still stirs me whenever i watch it.",

In 1950, Kurosawa weaves this tale of human vanity and duplicity with the young Toshiro Mifune, as the bandit, Machiko Kyo as the lady and Masayuki Mori as the samurai. The tale unfolds through the flashbacks in the narration of the great Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter, supported by character actors Minoru Chiaki as the monk and Kichijiro Ueda as the bum. Basically, with a cast of six and the stark settings of a woods and a dilapidated castle gate in pouring rain, Kurosawa the magician gives us four views of human vanity, excessive pride and cultural conflict. The foibles of human needs are exposed but redeemed in the final scene where the basic act of kindness brings closure to the bizarre display of greed, lust and mendacity that has gone before. For a Kurosawa film, this one is short, to the point with an economy of emoting-- for which Mifune was never accused of under doing and the viewer is left somewhat exhausted by all the twists and turns, confused by the mix of contradictions and seeming paradox, but satisfied with a feeling of hope.",

At some point after this interaction, the samurai is dead and his body is found by a woodcutter passing through. Of this much we can be sure. The bandit is arrested for the murder but, at the trial, he, the wife and the spirit of the dead man (via a medium) tell different version of events.Rash\u00f4mon is the subject of my favourite Simpsons' joke and is also one of those films that it is polite to mention in conversation when discussing anything that uses different points of view on events as the basis for its narrative \u0096 whether it be Hero, Boomtown, Vantage Point or whatever. So, with these things in mind I thought I should probably at least watch it for myself. Having watched a few longer films from Kurosawa, I was surprised to find this so short and brisk but I suppose this comes from the fact that there is not a lot of material within the film. As others have said, the scenario is the same with each telling and effectively the film is \"nothing more\" than several different ways of events playing out to the same outcome. Then it is over and you never really know the truth. I can understand why those unwilling to get into the film, just dismiss it. It is \"dull\" I suppose by some standards and the ending is open in regards the events that had gone before and also seems to come from nowhere (not unlike the baby, which is a rather lazy device in my opinion).These are flaws within the film perhaps and I do recognise that the film is not perfect \u0096 in particular with the conclusion to the film \u0096 Kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free from criticism. What the film does do very well is to tell the versions of events in a way that is true to the character and in a way that tells us a lot about the characters. Some have had the lack of shame to come on this site complaining that it is the same story again and again but they are missing the point badly. Each twist on the truth is done for personal reasons, whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments. It is a tad disappointing that the differences are so extreme though and I would have liked to see events a lot tighter but with just as telling, but more subtle differences. It still works though and it does provide some material for thought about the nature of truth and how hard it is to get to one version of any event that can be agreed on.The cast do well to vary their characters between the telling to reflect how they are presented in the version that suits the teller of the tale. The three main actors of Mifune, Ky\u00f4 and Mori work well together \u0096 with Mifune and Ky\u00f4 in particular delivering the most as their material allows. The framing scenes with the woodcutter etc are also good and I think the only weaknesses with their performances come from how they have to present this story as the worst thing ever, which is not an impression I ever shared. For the court scenes we are added Honman as a medium; she throws herself into the performance and it is only a shame that I struggle to buy her character as a narrative device in the first place. The direction is low-key but still impressive \u0096 mainly due to shooting in heavy rain, and in the woods \u0096 neither appear affected by the challenges as the lighting and shot framing is always excellent.Rash\u00f4mon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what a classic it is and will expect to be blown away second by second. Which of course doesn't happen and the film is not as subtle or as clever as one would hope. However it is still a well constructed, interesting and thought-provoking piece that is punchy and engaging with strong performances and direction. Don't expect something that it is not and come to it with an open mind and you will find a film that justifies the majority of its reputation.",

It doesn't need multiple viewings in order to be appreciated, though... it's impact is pretty immediate. It's just that some of the things that seem more odd about it are much more lasting than one would think.The story is about four people who are involved in a rape, a murder, and a theft in the woods, and how each tells the story of the events with a different stress in order to make themselves look better. What is clear is this: a woman was taken in front of her husband by a bandit. The husband was killed. His sword was taken by the bandit and the woman's dagger somehow disappeared. With those elements, a cynical outside observer hears the stories of each character and eventually comes to the conclusion he has from the beginning: that people are selfish and self-interested, and that good no longer exists in the world.The woman's, bandit's, and witness's stories are more easily accepted, but what do we do with the presence of the dead husband's ghost and his story, especially when the priest points out that \"dead men don't lie\"? Akira Kurosawa often puts metaphysical beings into the story with the same matter-of-fact quality as he does any other character, and to a cynical observer's eye, this could be considered a distraction. However, just the ghost helps illustrate just how far Japanese society has degraded away from classic values. Just as the listener of the tales tears apart Rashomon temple as the movie progresses for the selfish need of firewood, the ghost no longer is held to the same amount of abstractly definite authority. The presence of the priest and his clenched grip around his faith in humanity helps create a dialog about how removed people have become from abstract concepts of good and evil. The ghost, the priest, and the temple are all a very important part of the story, the same way the outsider's anecdote, \"They say the demon who resided here fled rather than be met with the evil of human beings\" has dire importance to the interplay of relationships in this film.Kurosawa's skill is not just in dialog and relationships, his visual acuity helps accentuate these themes as well. When the story begins, the woods is magical, even colorful (despite the black and white photography). It is a woods of fairy tale, with magical breezes and quiet streams. As the movie progresses, the woods lose more and more of their mystical quality and become dirty and dry. By the time the battle between the husband and the bandit is played out in its final representation, it is no longer a valiant battle of skill against two well-versed opponents, its a stressful, scary affair that has the two kicking up more dust than swinging their swords. The dust itself shows the degradation of the story away from the abstract qualities of truth and justice to a much more dirty, ugly reality as promoted by the outsider.I don't think Akira Kurosawa necessarily holds the theme of this movie as utter truth, especially considering the hopeful ending, but it does seem as if this movie came during a very cynical time during Kurosawa's life. Many discuss it as a post-war film, which isn't a bad guess. But even without it's affinity to the post-war world of Japan at the time, it somehow has a profound effect on viewers even today.--PolarisDiB",

Each accounting, by various characters (earthy or refined, depending) of the same crime is what gets you thinking, but it also gives each segment a flavor of its own. The concept of stories not matching, despite their common facts, is one of the truths of truth's impossibility. This is the core and the fame of this somewhat forced movie.Rashomon demands, and rewards, thinking. Each of the four main accounts are reflections of the needs of the teller. While there are some traditionally Japanese issues (of honor, both from a male and female perspective), non-Japanese audiences can get it, too. There are mannerisms that are not only Japanese (and therefore foreign to others) but are old-fashioned even for contemporary audiences, kind of like watching Robin Hood, where it takes a little getting used to the style. The sword fights, in particular, seem oddly incompetent in fighting terms. But not at all in cinema terms--they are films with amazing beauty.Kurosawa always found camera operators with real vigor and visual finesse (both!) playing with shadows and light, and moving with a three dimensional logic to the figures in the space. You can, in a movie, like this, almost turn off the subtitles and just watch, and if you lose the details, you get the overall power of it all. It is traditionally \"beautiful\" with all the shadows and light, and is also compositionally strong, even as it moves through space. Exceptionally so.If you haven't seen this, you might be put off by its lack of a regular old story. I know I am, every time I see it. I never quite get absorbed, because by the second telling I know that I am witnessing a \"version\" of what happened, relative to the first. It's incredibly fascinating, but not always engaging in the usual way. Clearly a masterpiece in every sense, and a breakthrough for Kurosawa.",

            "content": "Notable for bringing the Japanese film industry on the global stage, Rash\u00f4mon is a well- conceptualized & beautifully realized study of human nature that explores our perception of reality with its unconventional narrative structure and is also responsible for introducing numerous storytelling techniques that have inspired & influenced countless films over the years.Rash\u00f4mon begins with two men seeking refuge from rain in a former gatehouse and still trying to make sense of the event they witnessed earlier that day. When another guy arrives, they recount the whole story to him, following which the incident concerning a heinous crime is revisited many times and is told from the perspective of all the eye-witnesses, each contradicting the other.Co-written & directed by Akira Kurosawa, Rash\u00f4mon is crafted with a clever eye and is masterly layered to keep the viewers invested. However, it's not about who is telling the truth & who isn't because the incident is merely a plot device that's meant to reflect a faith-shattering side of the human condition, and reveals how we are capable of molding any particular event to fit our own self-serving interests.There are also a number of symbolic & allegorical imagery applied throughout the film, which adds further depth & meaning to the whole premise. Set pieces are kept to a minimum. Cinematography adds a new chapter to the filmmaking manual with its inventive use of lighting, close-ups, camera angles & hand-held photography. Editing allows the plot to unfurl at its own pace but it could've still applied a few trims here n there.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Takashi Shimura, Toshik\u00f4 Mifune, Machiko Ky\u00f5 & Masayuki Mori and all play their part responsibly. Shimura contributes with a very subdued input as the guy recounting the whole story to another person while harboring a secret of his own. Mifune plays a bandit with kinetic flair while Mori & Ky\u014d are in as the samurai & wife respectively and both do a brilliant job in their given roles, especially the latter.On an overall scale, Rash\u00f4mon is a fascinating examination of human nature, the subjective nature of truth, and the shift in reality when any particular event is approached from a different paradigm. A work of innovative filmmaking that's given an ageless appeal by its universal themes, Rash\u00f4mon only reveals more on subsequent viewings and what is says about the human character is just as relevant today as it was back then. Its slow pace is bothersome at times but the more you allow it to simmer in your head, the more you will understand & appreciate its enduring legacy. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "From this material most filmmakers might have made a murder mystery or a courtroom drama, which is what it can fundamentally be considered to be. But Akira Kurosawa, rather, directed this universal tale made all the way across the world, set a thousand years ago, made 60 years ago, which has actually given root to philosophical movements and fields, transfiguring the account of a foul rape and murder into a contemplation on certainty and human nature. The film is about the real animal showing through the most coercive social doctrines.Beginning with a very powerful opening master shot of the Rashomon gate, two mingling time filaments construct the contemplation: Under the Rashomon gate, time lingers ponderously, breathless, exhausted, gathering dust. In the forest time is imbued with heat and disquiet, with life and respect in peril of being erased. As is widely known about the film, the stories of the rape and murder are jointly conflicting. The plot unfolds in flashback as the bandit Toshir\u014d Mifune, the murdered samurai Masayuki Mori, his wife Machiko Ky\u014d, and the nameless woodcutter Takashi Shimura recount the events of the inscrutable afternoon. But it is also a flashback within a flashback. Kurosawa first transgresses across the lapse between these two strands with a glaring two minutes of unadorned cinema which aggregates both: the woodcutter's walk into the forest, a succession of shots of constant sundry motion while the story bides its time in remission. So this scene, like those at the Rashomon gate, is chronological inertia, although its vibrancy and dormant violence, generated by its motion's rise and fall in pulse, introduces us to matters in the wood clearing. For the woodcutter's advance into the marrow of the forest, with its essentially anesthetic drift of movement per sudden cuts and camera maneuver, becomes our advance into the marrow of the film. When he stops, we are there and the forest has emerged as the focal mise en scene of the drama. However the camera proceeds to move very sparingly.The three men in the rain at the gate, comprised of Shimura's woodcutter, a traveling priest claims that he saw the samurai and the woman the same day the murder happened, and an earthy commoner, are like a Greek chorus remarking upon the turmoil in that open space. Their annotations, which throughout the film are chiefly of doubt and amazement, as the three parties in the crime each tell an extensively differing story of the death. Surprisingly, each maintains responsibility for the killing. Each telling retains the teller's honorable sense of self. Then the woodcutter gives a fourth take.Disposed to all this, some viewers consider Rashomon to be a conundrum for unriddling, upholding that there must be one correct account of the killing which we can unravel if we interpret the niceties discerningly enough. For others, Rashomon is the prototypical cinematic delineation of the philosophy that conceptions of truth and moral values are not absolute but relative, that truth is impenetrable. Indeed, we're given clues to believe each of the characters' versions of the story. There is no truth, just biased conception of events. Human beings don't tend to be capable of being candid with themselves regarding themselves. The average human cannot talk about him or herself without ornament to protect their ego. This script depicts such people, the temperament who cannot persevere without distortion to make them feel they're better people than they actually are to any objective opinion of their own. How many hypocrites do you really know? You already know you're one yourself. So am I. As animals, we're impetuous. We all have different externalizations of such behavior. What we must do to realize our significance is gain control over this characteristic.Fumio Hayasaka's slow, skin-and-bone score for Rashomon is infectious even as it's ever so subtle. This theme music is used as an exposition, associated with the presence of particular characters, and distinguishes between the inflection of tone from scene to scene. And each scene is in a class of its own. The swordfight in the bandit's recollection and the later version of the same swordfight are simply antithetical creatures. Mifune's version is a telling of rage, empowerment and humiliating the other guy. Swords clash, there are occasionally bare- knuckled struggles to reclaim a weapon, and Mifune laughing like a maniac. Later, we see even still not truly a swordfight but a fight that begins with swords in the hands of their frightened owners, who may for all we know have never before found themselves in such a fight, which devolves into a tightly aggressive mortal scuffle. Both are two of my favorite swordfights on film, no special effects are even needed! As for the scene where the husband's spectre tells the story, what other way in 11th century Japan would a court have believed they could gather all possible testimony when every survivor's account is drastically different?Kurosawa had to extemporize with sparse assets to bring it to the screen, but if anything, clenching the money clip perhaps resulted in a better film. Minimalism is indispensable to a story that depends on fine points and particulars, and the deficiency of excesses defines the discretion Kurosawa used and the rigor with which he had to work. In one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship. Kurosawa also peculiarly uses sunlight to actually symbolize evil and sin.Beside his remarkable instinct for what audiences wanted, there is a continuous trial-and-error strand throughout Kurosawa's work. The sense of freedom this film brought to young filmmakers was less a reaction to a mysterious thematic motif than to Kurosawa's scorn of the entrenched protocol of narrative cinema. He disregards the 180-degree rule, in so doing inverting relationships that have any extension in space, connects long shots and close-ups and shots of contradictory movements.",

It's as if WE are the interrogators. By hearing these different stories, we have to reconsider how sure we can be about what we think we know. Not to mention Kurosawa's use of the forest to create a mysterious setting.This is beyond an incredible movie. As with \"Seven Samurai\" a few years later, Kurosawa knows how to do everything perfectly: direction, cinematography, the works. Of course, probably the most important point is what the one character says noting that we make up stories to help us cope with life. All too true. A masterpiece.",

            "content": "In 9th-century Japan, a couple of men are sheltering from the pouring rain in a ruined temple called Rashomon. A woodcutter tells the story of a samurai's dead body he found in the woods three days earlier. The murderer was evidently a notorious bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who is captured and brought to trial.Mifune admits to an unseen court that he tied up the samurai and then raped the guy's wife in front of him. The problem is that the wife responded enthusiastically. When Mifune tries to leave, she begs him to kill her husband and get rid of the witness to her dishonor. Mifune releases the samurai, there is a sword fight, the samurai is killed, and when Mifune looks around, the wife is gone.The wife's testimony contradicts Mifune's. After the rape, Mifune leaves and the wife weeps abundantly as she crawls to her husband and begs his forgiveness. His response is only a cold, silent stare, filled with loathing. She implore him to kill her, then, and scuttles towards him with her dagger in hand. Then she faints. When she wakes up, her husband is dead, with her dagger in his chest.The samurai husband testifies through a spooky medium that both stories are false. When he was finally free, both the bandit and his own wife had disappeared, and he killed himself with the dagger.The woodcutter who is recounting the testimony says all the stories are baloney because he, the woodcutter, was a silent witness. He didn't testify at the trial because he didn't want to get involved. HIS story sounds like the real one because, uninvolved as he was, he has nothing to gain from lying about the events.But, no. One of the other men brings up a discrepancy that casts doubt on the woodcutter's story too.We're not used to these kinds of stories. We don't know how to DO them the way Kurosawa did on a tiny budget. (It was remade with Paul Newman as \"Outrage\" and was a boring failure.) If it were made today, it would be filled with Uzis and exploding fireballs but in the original the only thing overdone is the acting, which is highly stylized.You can overanalyze a thing. In this case we can take a nose dive into phenomenology and all that, but what such an analysis would remind me of is the early 1960s, before intuition began to guide our experience of the world, when some people still sat around on the floor with candles in the chianti bottles and asked each other what Truth was.The fact is this movie can be boiled down to even simpler propositions. Here's one. \"Everybody's memory is flawed.\" Here's another: \"It's flawed in ways that exculpate us.\" I'm not arguing that Kurosawa didn't have more in mind that that, but just that the movie can be appreciated by people who didn't major in philosophy. We all have different views of reality. That's a relatively simple fact that everyone will agree on.And we don't have to look far for instances. \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\" \"We know how many there are and where they are.\" \"I use a wide stance.\" Well, this may not be everybody's cup of green tea. The rape isn't very explicit. There is no nudity. Nobody's guts gush out of his abdomen. The ghost acts like a decerebrate feline preparation. Not a curse word in the dialog. It's in black and white. No elaborate sets. And it uses subtitles. (I can hear the cry now -- \"Hey, this thing's in Chinese!\") It may not stimulate anyone's gonads but it may tickle his higher reasoning centers.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is unquestionably the most recognised film-making talent ever to emerge from Japan, his string of reputed masterpieces including 'The Seven Samurai (1954),' 'Yojimbo (1961)' and 'Ran (1985),' each of which I have yet to enjoy, my experience with Asian cinema worryingly limited. After recently enjoying my first Kurosawa picture, the powerful but slightly-overlong 'Nora inu / Stray Dog (1949),' I was keen to watch another, though I couldn't yet find the time to commit myself to one of the director's three-hour-long epics. 'Rash\u00f4mon (1950)' proved the perfect alternative. Kurosawa's film, the first to bring him into the international limelight, uses a simple story \u0096 of a husband's death in the woods \u0096 to reveal a simple but worryingly-accurate truth of human existence: that the truth itself is unknowable. The unique narrative structure of the film, of replaying the same event four times from differing perspectives, had the potential to become nothing more than a curious gimmick, yet Kurosawa makes it all work wonderfully, aided by the exquisite cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa and electric performances from all involved, most particularly Kurosawa-regular Toshir\u00f4 Mifune.The film opens in a bleak, bitter rainstorm \u0096 one of those mighty skyward torrents that makes us drought-stricken Australians green with envy \u0096 where three men are sheltering in the ruins of a gatehouse. Three days previously, the oldest of the three, Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), discovered the body of a man in the woods, and has recently returned from a police inquiry. The coarse, unkempt Commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) demands to hear the remainder of the Woodcutter's story, and so he recounts three \"versions\" of the shocking rape/murder, told from the perspective of the Bandit (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), the husband (Masayuki Mori) and the wife (Machiko Ky\u00f4), each story differing substantially from the other two. The existence of subjectivity, it seems, has permanently obscured any chances of ever knowing the absolute \"truth\" of the incident, with each perspective \u0096 perhaps deliberately, perhaps subconsciously \u0096 distorting the truth to conform to their own interests. It is revealed that even the seemingly-passive observer, Woodcutter, has his own reasons for adjusting the facts, this final revelation almost permanently denting the honest Priest's (Minoru Chiaki) belief in the goodness of Mankind.After portraying a modest, tentative rookie detective in Kurosawa's 'Stray Dog,' Toshir\u00f4 Mifune is an absolute revelation as the notorious Taj\u00f4maru. Regardless of the specific version of events, Mifune unequivocally dominates the screen, his maniacal energy and frenzied cackle certain to imprint on your mind. The basis for the film was derived from two stories by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, with \"Rashomon\" providing the setting, and \"In a Grove\" supplying the characters and plot. The flashback components of the story unfold under the dappled light of the trees, and, on several occasion,s Miyagawa films the Sun directly through the leaves of the forest canopy, perhaps representative of the \"light of truth\" that is being obscured by the inherent dishonesty in Man {personified in the selfish Commoner}. Of course, Kurosawa couldn't bring himself to end the film in such a pessimistic fashion, and the Woodcutter redeems his previous deception by offering to care for an abandoned newborn baby discovered in the gatehouse. As the rainstorm ceases, and the glorious sunlight once again begins to beam down upon the lands, the Priest finally regains his faith in the goodness to be found in a man's heart.",

The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of \"twist endings\"(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being challenged, and is willing to give the medium of film the chance to prove itself as possessing the potential to be a form of art. 10/10",

            "content": "Examining Rash\u00f4mon is a lengthy process, mainly due to the substantial amount of material on offer and the thought-provoking questions which should be probed subsequent to viewing. Not only does the film ask some of life's most profound questions, but it also begins to confront various evocative ideas. Essentially, Akira Kurosawa's unmatched classic is about gaining an understanding; the film's first conversation introduces characters who \"don't understand\" and are looking for answers, this is opening the primary theme.Personally, Rash\u00f4mon has forever been favourite of Kurosawa's directional works. It also happens to be the film which introduced me to the work of an auteur; a man whose vision echoes that of a revolutionary cinematic historian. From the likes of Shichinin no samurai, to Ran, Kurosawa is *the* director of Japanese cinema. During his lifetime he managed to confirm himself as one of the world's leading film-makers. He was director who created cinema which was impossible to match, and his influence still resounds within even the most mainstream works of today. For example, the non-linear narrative structure of Rash\u00f4mon has been respectfully woven in numerous films since. Rash\u00f4mon was the work which propelled the career of Kurosawa; even though it was not widely regarded in its own country at the time, it was hailed by the critics of the Western world.Rash\u00f4mon is the compressed tale of an innocent woman's rape and her husband's murder, performed by a ruthless bandit (acted out by Kurosawa's long-time working partner Toshir\u00f4 Mifune). Even though the bandit is caught and consequently put on trial, the seemingly simple crime soon becomes questionably more complicated as it is recounted from four individually detached \"eye-witness\" perspectives. Posing many philosophical questions for the viewer, the picture asks which story is the one to believe (if any), through -what was at the time and still remains- a highly stylised storytelling technique. Establishing a verdict on the heinous crime centred upon in Rash\u00f4mon is as much an ordeal as the crime itself because it proves to be an incident which provokes moral questioning and fierce debate.The film-making techniques used in Rashomon gave birth to a distinct style that Kurosawa was prepared to develop further in his later works, which can be seen in films such as Yojimbo and Shichinin no samurai. Level-headed pragmatism plagued Kurosawa's features throughout his earlier years; this was something that came as an advantage for his films, being that the characters (even the villains) portrayed in his films were genuine people you could feel compassion and remorse for. Also, Kurosawa began to define genres throughout the 1950s and 1960s, while also bringing to light some now-popular (often overused) methods of camera movement, e.g. dutch angles, revolving shots and amplified close-ups.For those who question the film's offbeat narrative structure, they should ask themselves whether or not the cut-throat editing is there as a means of symbolising the colliding viewpoints. I consider this to be a daring means of combining humanitarian lies and honesty, and also a means of creating a disorientating, volatile impression. With Rash\u00f4mon, Kurosawa's admiration for silent cinema came into evident practice; this can be seen through the minimalist set-pieces, which are a contrast to the complex storytelling procedure that his work embodies. The ambiguity of Rash\u00f4mon is detailed through subtly metaphorical cinematography and lighting techniques. I have always seen the setting of the woods as a display of the work's central atmosphere (intrigue) and the shadows periodically depicting a loss of empathy and symbolising the isolated danger of the surroundings.The majority of films fail to emphasise with the viewer, this can blamed on the morals being \"mixed\" and ultimately enabling the viewer to become unsure of a film's statement. However, with Rash\u00f4mon the morals are clear and refined, without being preachy or simplistic. Summing up the greed, confusion, deprivation and indulgence of the world is a tricky business, but somehow Kurosawa has the ability to perform such a task with exceeding talent. Rash\u00f4mon warrants a right to be hailed as a definitive classic. Unlike its story, I doubt that viewers of Rash\u00f4mon hold clashing opinions, being that it is far too flawless to be argued over.",

The same year, with a simpler and more minimalist setting, a Japanese film-maker named Akira Kurosawa made \"Rashomon\", an oddity whose \"R\" like for \"Revolution\" shook up all the cinematic conventions. Three different persons with different tastes provided their reviews, the youngster, the intellectual and the technician, proving once and for all that \"Rashomon\"'s greatness essentially relies on its fascinatingly paradoxical nature.*** Old but Timeless, Foreign but Universal *** A Review by \"The Youngster\" \"No offense, but there's something weird with Japanese language, it was really hard for me to take it without laughing sometimes, I mean the over-the-top acting, the solemn poses, and all that theatrical stuff. But I must admit that the beginning was very intriguing, a priest and a woodcutter sitting in a temple in a downpour, apparently disturbed by what they've witnessed. Then comes a man who, just like us, is curious and wants to know what the story is about. I didn't expect the movie to surprise me, especially since it features a simple case of murder, a samurai killed, a bandit arrested and a wife dishonored, all the three protagonists have lost. According to the bandit, the wife submitted to him, and then he bravely fought the husband, the samurai. I finally got what the film was about, when the wife told her version: the bandit raped her then she fainted and woke up with her husband dead. I was bluffed, because it reminded me of all the movies I love, with a story told from different perspectives, \"The Usual Suspects\" or non linear narrative like \"Reservoir Dogs\". But the icing on the cake, what really caught me off guard was the dead husband telling his version from a medium. That was so cool. If only for the moment when we understand what the film is about, I always recommend this film to my friends. It looks old and sounds foreign but on the content, it's more universal and modern than any film made today.\"*** The Iconic Iconoclast*** A Review by \"The Intellectual\"\"Akira Kurosawa conquered cinema with \"Rashomon\", his first masterpiece that threw away all the conventions, offering a plot within a plot, even better: three subplots within the central one. Kurosawa elevated the field of storytelling to a dimension never explored before: telling a story from four different perspectives, each one distorting the truth not necessarily in favor of the teller, since each one admits to be the killer. If I might use a culinary metaphor, watching \"Rashomon\" is like eating artichokes: when you're finished, there's more on the plate than when you started, \"Rashomon\" leaves you with interrogations whose answer rely less on your personal understanding than your own approach to the truth that you'll inevitably end up questioning, the truth and how it might be undermined by a legitimate, but no less dangerous, subjectivity. Intelligence comes from the Latin verb: intellego, which means 'to understand', it's a derivation from 'inter lego', literally 'to read between', and clearly \"Rashomon\" is an intelligent masterpiece inviting us to read between these different stories. \"Rashomon\" is a pamphlet against people's vanity, with still, a light of hope at the end. Indeed, never taking the ingenious plot structure for granted, the film also features its impact on the listeners, those who don't care and act with the same egoism as the wife, the samurai and the bandit, and the woodcutter who 'read between the lines', and gives the priest his faith in humanity back.\" *** Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye*** A Review by \"The Technician\" \"\"Rashomon\" is the most insightful cinematic essay about humanity's natural tendency to distort the truth to satisfy an inner egoism but the talent of Kurosawa is to convey this idea less with words than action. \"Rashomon\" could have been indeed a silent film, its real strength come from the photography and the editing. The film doesn't consider unity of time, space and plot, and provide three settings. The court's white and neutral background allow the characters address through the judges, the audience, in a way, it represents the white screen, a sort of fourth wall Kurosawa subtly breaks allowing each one to tell one version of the truth, a formidably choreographed sword-fight, a poor heart-broken creature or the theatrical posture of a man who disown his wife. When the truth is revealed by the woodcutter, even the acting becomes more authentic, the two men look at each other not with defy, but fear, their panting increases, and their fight is a pathetic display of self-defense moves where the winner will be the luckier. The two main settings work by a simple contrast, a pouring rain making the water look like ink and a blinding sunshine. The first shot of the woodcutter walking in the forest is shown by a long traveling shot toward the sun, the camera being the only steady eye that can look at the sun. Ironically, in \"Rashomon\" , the sun is covered by the trees and allow the three characters to disguise their facts. And it's only fitting that the only place where their life is at stakes, is precisely the clearing where both the sun and death strike their faces\" So, the youngster criticized the over-the top acting but this was Kurosawa showing the distortion of truth by pure dramatization, mocking through the pathetic sword-fight cinema's conventions like the wife mocks the two men for their cowardice, as the intellectual said, it's an iconoclast masterpiece, and although the technician praised the editing, the use of lights, he was right that the film could have been silent, but it's during silent moments that the acting was the most perfect thing in \"Rashomon\" transcended by the body language Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajumaro.",

Unlike a traditional whodunit, events get murkier and more tangled with Kurosawa cranking up the intrigue and uncertainty as contrasting viewpoints clash. The stunning look of the movie - from the torrents of rain in the opening shots to the dappled sunlight in the forest - plays its part in making every little thing difficult to discern, backed up by forceful performances, especially from Toshiro Mifune.The genius of \"Rashomon\" is that all of the flashbacks are both true and false. True, in that they present an accurate portrait of what each witness thinks happened. False, because as Kurosawa observes in his autobiography, \"Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing.\"The wonder of \"Rashomon\" is that while the shadow-play of truth and memory is going on, we are absorbed by what we trust is an unfolding story. The film's engine is our faith that we'll get to the bottom of things--even though the woodcutter tells us at the outset he doesn't understand, and if an eyewitness who has heard the testimony of the other three participants doesn't understand, why should we expect to?Kurosawa's screenplay is only the ground which the film travels, however. The real gift of \"Rashomon\" is in its emotions and visuals. The first time I saw the film, I knew hardly a thing about Japanese cinema, and what struck me was the elevated emotional level of the actors. The message of \"Rashomon\" is that we should suspect even what we think we have seen. This insight is central to Kurosawa's philosophy.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa, arguably the greatest Japanese director of all time, introduced himself to Western audiences in a big way with this brilliant, yet tantalizing story about a horrible murder that occurred in the woods and accounted by a woodcutter, a bandit, a woman, and a dead samurai. Unfortunately, there is no real way to know what really happened since all the stories are different and impossible to piece together. Therein, lies the meaning of Kurosawa's philosophy of this film. In life, there are many instances when to know the real, rock-solid truth is simply impossible.In this story, as Kurosawa reveals in the multiple flashbacks of each character's depiction of the event, we are led to believe that they are telling the truth since we can obviously see what is happening. However, Kurosawa is challenging the concept of seeing an event occur that makes it true. In the society we live in, seeing is believing. Kurosawa attempts to destroy that idea and paints a dismal picture of people doing bad things for all the wrong reasons, namely their own personal gain. For all these characters, to lie was to get ahead in some way or another. Thus, it is hard to believe anyone and their version of it. As the priest does, we feel a great amount of animosity towards humans since it seems all they are in for is to survive on their own and not care about anyone else. As we try to unveil this mystery and discover the truth, Kurosawa keeps our interest with some very nifty camera work that is world-famous today (camera pointing at sun, long shots in forest, etc.) If you have heard of anything about Kurosawa, this is a great place to start studying him and his style. He is undoubtedly one of the finest directors of all time and the mind-bending Rashomon is one of the best examples of film-making in the last century.",

It is a dark and cynical outlook on mankind and it's morality and integrity. It is the story of the murder of a man and the rape of his wife, told from four different perspectives. Each perspective contradicts the others and it is left to the audience's interpretation as to who told the truth. Rash\u00f4mon was the first film to utilize the telling of the same story from different perspectives and that technique has now become a staple in creative filmmaking. It is used in many different films such as Vantage Point (2008), The Usual Suspects (1995), and even the animated film Hoodwinked! (2005). It is for this reason that you absolutely cannot say that Rash\u00f4mon is not an influential film.Akira Kurosawa is highly acclaimed to be one of the greatest directors who ever lived, and his skills in cinematography and art direction never fail to amaze. Rash\u00f4mon is no exception. It is beautifully shot in its three settings the entire movie takes place in. It is this intelligent and immaculate direction which captivates and awes you, as you try and decipher the mystery taking place. The story is not complex on the surface but it is the intriguing themes and motifs that Kurosawa explores that make Rash\u00f4mon an experience that makes you think. Nothing in the film is set straight and it is all up to viewer interpretation.Rash\u00f4mon is an excelling work of art, yet a few things must be taken into account to truly understand where the film comes from. It was made in 1950's Japan, a very different time with a very different culture. The filming and acting techniques are noticeably different than modern filmmaking is used to. At times the acting seems very overdone and melodramatic, but you have to take into account the time period. Also the portrayal of women in this film could be looked upon sorely, but this is likely a cultural thing which can't be understood without the proper research. These \"issues\" are hardly minor gripes and can't really be considered legitimate thing to complain about.Rash\u00f4mon is influential filmmaking at it's best. What Kurosawa explores in this film are things that will stand the test of time and make Rash\u00f4mon a classic film by a legendary director.",

What actually happened, and what's fictitious? And Kurosawa uses many techniques to unveil the plot; the dreamy score, the bandit-character (Toshiro Mifune) is a raucous, beastly troublemaker with farcical acrobatics, long sequences with no sound shows Kurosawa's love for the silent era, the non-linear narrative and the uplifting climax.

(To this end, \"Rashomon\" might just be the most realistic character study ever made.) Based on the short stories \"In a Grove\" and \"Rashomon\" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Kurosawa's picture is set in the aftermath of a heinous and brutal crime: a samurai has been murdered, and his wife raped. Three people, including the alleged murderer and the dead samurai (through a medium), give varying, conflicting accounts of the crime, thus leaving it up to us, the viewers, to decipher these characters and their motives for deceiving. I am currently majoring in criminal justice in college and if I were to ever become a professor, I would certainly make \"Rashomon\" required viewing, and Akutagawa's book a required text. Never has conflict been so daringly portrayed on film, especially when viewed as the aftermath of a violent crime. Even after listening to the testimonies, you sort of become disillusioned that you're unsure of what really happened, and maybe that's Kurosawa and Akutagawa's point. What is certain, what is the truth, is that \"Rashomon\" is a classic of cinema, made by one of the greats to ever pick up a camera and shoot into a grove.10/10",

Maybe Kurosawa was making a point about the justice system where people can see the same incident and come to different conclusion as well as indirectly wanting to show themselves in a better light.The film is thought provoking and for Kurosawa a relatively short one but it has aged, with the acting looking a tad overcooked.

It is about the four people, who give four different versions of the testimonies at the court, on the recently occurred crime.The story is set in ancient Japan, where three passers-by seek shelter from intense rain in the ruined temple called Roshomon. Two of the witnesses, a dumbfounded woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki), are narrating the crime trial to the commoner. More than the crime, they are astonished to witness the testimonies of three people, connected with the crime, which shatters their faith in humanity.A man (Masayuki Mori) has been murdered, and his wife (Machiko Kyo) was allegedly raped, while they were traveling in the woods. A notorious bandit (Toshiro Mifune) has been arrested, regarding this despicable act. As the trial starts, the fabricated lies resurface over truth. According to the bandit, he and the man waged a war after the rape, resulting in the man's death.But the woman's version is that she was rejected by her husband, after being raped. So, with uncontrollable grief, she killed him. However, the dead man testifies, through the medium, that the bandit insisted to marry the woman after the rape, but the woman demanded the bandit should kill her husband first. The angry bandit left the place and the guilty-conscious man committed suicide. According to the woodcutter, the woman had manipulated the two men, who were finally pushed to gruesome fight that lead to the man's death.All these testimonies are believably told to the viewers, making them the judges of this baffling trial\u0085 At Oscars, the board of governors voted 'Roshomon' as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the US in 1951. This was an enormously challenging task for the artistes\u0097 who had to enact in 3 different ways for the same story\u0096 and they excel. Toshiro Mifune attained worldwide fame for enacting the clumsy bandit's role with insurmountable passion.'Roshomon' is not about analyzing the chronological facts or its relevance. It focuses on, how perspective distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable. Eventually, this movie has been touted as the classic case study for the film students, connoisseurs and movie critics, all over the world.This simple-looking tale, with its complex web of deceptive elements, remains as the finest cinematic riddle unsolved!",

            "content": "Firstly, you need to appreciate the fact that everyone in Rash\u00f4mon lied. This includes the Buddhist priest because he mentioned that everyone is good in nature. Even though he is aware of stories of rape and murder, he chooses to live in self-denial; to have faith in the goodness of humanity. Therefore, if you are still debating on who is absolutely right or wrong, then you are probably missing Kurosawa's intention. We need to analyze who is more wrong than the rest. Similarly, philosophy students will go off-topic if they choose to debate on whether Euthyphro was absolutely right or wrong to prosecute his father for accidentally murdering a murderer.The deceased samurai claims that someone removed the dagger from his chest and the woodcutter admits to the theft in the ending. So, let us start from here. Two claims from two accounts support that the murder weapon was a dagger. This eliminates the possibility that the murder weapon was a sword. Therefore, the bandit lied about killing the samurai with a sword. It is plausible that his ego as a famous bandit made him conjure this lie. In fact, it is possible that he ran off like a typical bandit after the rape without engaging a meaningless fight with the angry samurai.Did the deceased samurai lie? Yes. Remember what I said earlier, everyone lied in this film. The discussion should be centered on who lied the most. It is plausible that he did not commit suicide even though the murder weapon has been verified to be a dagger in the above paragraph. It is possible that the deceased samurai lied about his suicide to protect any remaining samurai dignity because the bandit raped his wife. So who killed him then? It is possible that his wife actually tripped and killed him accidentally with the dagger. To reveal the truth that he was killed in a freak accident is probably one of the last things in a respectable samurai's mind.Finally, the woodcutter, probably the biggest liar of all the characters' lies combined. He lied from the beginning, filed a false police report, made false statements in front of the judge, stole the valuable dagger and angrily accused the deceased samurai of lying about the murder weapon, which was later exposed by the commoner. He even reprimanded the commoner for stealing the clothes from an abandoned baby, which shows how hypocritical he is. All these accumulated lies make his claim of having a family of six children extremely unreliable. In the ending, the woodcutter was wearing a mild smile while walking towards the camera with the baby in his arms. The unusual eerie music played in the ending was also very suggestive. In my opinion, he is probably going to sell the baby to the black market for more money, considering the fact that he stole the murder weapon out of greed.Rash\u00f4mon's ending was left open-ended by Kurosawa and I urge the audience not to watch on a superficial level. The ending is not as simple as it seems. This is Kurosawa we are talking about, not any random 'grade C' director. It is definitely not a hundred percent happy conclusion. Another open-ended film directed by Kurosawa is 'Rhapsody in August' (1991), which I studied for my film module.Mao points: 10/10",

Thankfully, there is no pandering to try and imitate such a film, there are no musical numbers, not much action of any kind, and characters that aren't the nicest of people.The story starts in the rain, as a group of people huddle around under an abandoned building to avoid it. From there, the common man is told by a woodcutter about a rape and murder in the woods, as well as a depressed monk who is losing his faith in the human species. From there, we are told multiple differing stories from multiple perspectives about what happened, and all of them vehemently contradict each-other. All of them cast a mystery that gives the viewer nothing to go on but their words.What makes it work is that all of the stories, though self-pitying, all feel like they could have happened. There is no favouritism between the three parties, and all are giving 100% believable performance when they retell their stories, including minor pieces of exposition which lend credence to their tales yet further.We are consistently cutting back to the commoner who's actually pretty funny and worldly, who offers a simple, unpretentious counter to the more philosophical world-view that Kurosawa is trying to explore. His crudeness is even somewhat likable. His attempts to try and rationalise the stories are magnificent in their roughness. There is further character development between the monk and woodcutter, both of whom have character arcs in their own right. Both stories, that of the 3 under the building, and the rape and murder, are excellent in their own right, but once combined, we can even then see parallels between them, and that shifts the film into masterpiece territory, without being a completely inaccessible puddle of pretentious cinema. This is a film a 12 year old who likes Transformers can watch as well as some 50 year old Swedish artisan.One really gets a sense of the desperation eating at men's souls, including in all the murder scenes, and the sniping between the nihilist commoner and the (clinging) spiritual monk. There is a sense of underlying nastiness at the heart of everyone, but likewise a sense of potential redemption, though it most certainly doesn't completely conquer all that is wrong. Rashomon leaves us with an honest portrayal of the human species that doesn't leave us completely hopeless, nor wilfully ignorant.It leaves us with hope, and hope can only exist in fear.",

Each story is different and shows a different take on what really happened. In the end the movie leaves us guessing which story is the truth and it doesn't pick sides. Each story told from a character's perspective, is told by the characters to mainly make themselves look as honorable and good as possible. Therefor every story feels just as credible and not credible as the other. There is no truth, at least not an objective one in this movie. And there lies the complexity of the movie. This movie works as a reflecting one and shows us how men lie and deceit for their own good. It shows us the selflessness, we eventually all poses.

It forces us to picture ourselves in the characters their minds. It makes \"Rash\u00f4mon\" one of the most thought provoking and engaging movies out of history. You can always leave it up to Kurosawa to make a simple story multiple layered and thought provoking. This movie shows storytelling at its very best!The movie is made with lots of style.

The Constant laughing by the bandit and the commoner was both confusing and unnecessary and i found the lack of a conclusion frustrating but what i will say is that Just like \" Seven Samurai \" it is beautifully shot.Incidentally when Rashomon was being made , the cast approached Kurosawa en masse with the script and asked him, \"What does it mean?\" The answer Kurosawa gave at that time and also in his biography is that \"Rashomon\" is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meanings.Make of that what you will but at least i wasn't the only one confused! 6 out of 10",

            "content": "In 12th century Japan, a heinous crime and its aftermath are recalled from differing points of view . As a samurai and his wife are attacked by the notorious bandit Tajomaru, and the samurai ends up dead . An episode , rape and killing in a forest grove is reported by four witnesses : a priest , a woodcutter , a commoner , a famous bandit named Taj\u00f4maru , even the dead man, speaking through a medium was lying , each from their own point of sight , but the testimonies of the three direct participants were mutually contradictory and claiming responsibility for the death . Every time the story is retold , each person has a different opinion . This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being his international breakthrough one . Rashomon , the picture blends drama , suspense , emotion and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . The movie is a reflection of life, and life does not always have clear meanings . Its striking visual effects and evocative atmosphere made Kurosawa a name outside Japan . The flick is tense and mysterious from the beginning till ending and is neither boring , nor dull but enjoyable . This movie is known for its use of symbolic weather , throughout most of it, there's heavy rain, which fades away by the optimistic ending, when the weather becomes sunny . The screenplay of the film has a twisted plot and the final gets an extraordinary surprise . This picture had great impact and influence on American cinema , in fact it was remade as \u00a8Outrage\u00a8 (1964) by Martin Ritt with Paul Newman , Claire Bloom and \u00a8Basic\u00a8 by John MacTiernan with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson . Evocative cinematography plenty of lights and shadows by Miyagawa . A very early use of the \"hand held\" camera technique , following characters closely through the Woods . This film is often given credit for the first time a camera was pointed directly at the sun , even during high noon the parts of the forest that the crew needed to shoot in were still too dark. Rather than use a regular foil reflector, which did not bounce enough light, Akira Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa opted to use a full-length mirror \"borrowed\" from Daiei's costume department. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa with both philosophical and psychological overtones . After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the \"Best Foreign Film\" category. When the film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , these are fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures . Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy .",

            "review_title": "What is truth?",
            "content": "Rainy day? Need something to ponder upon? Then take a seat at one of the stairs of the Rashomon gate and listen to a particularly strange murder mystery. But be aware upfront that this is not about the culprit, as you'll hear several confessions, but all won't match. Who's lying? Why? Is it all intentional? Or due to different perceptions? Are people cheating on themselves as well? For their own good, for the sake of accepting reality, or because they are adhering to a principle they consider superior? What is real? What is true? Is it possible at all to understand? Thus are the questions posed under the Rashomon. But that we cannot grasp it is exactly the point.Kurosawa's version of Akutagawa's tale \"In a Bomboo Grove\" doesn't shun from irritating the audience by presenting various accounts of the same story without providing a satisfying resolution. With the abandoning of the conventional, objective narrative form he opened the door to distortions of reality shown on screen, broadening the horizons of what a camera can convey, adding another level of sophistication to the medium. Dismissed by the studio he was working for as incomprehensible, Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" however hit the western film world like a bomb. With the prizes it won it would become the gateway that opened Japanese cinema to the rest of the world and establish Kurosawa as a director to reckon with. Yet it is not only the fresh idea that makes \"Rashomon\" different - music and sound undoubtedly are highly effective, but the exceptionally strong point of the film is that it offers flawless cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa, who would later also shoot Mizogushi's appraised pearls \"Sansho the Bailiff\" and \"Ugetsu\". And of course \"Rashomon\" already has Kurosawa's future key player Toshiro Mifune as the bandit, who borrows with his extreme expressions from the silent era, and this intensity of acting makes a film about reality in question even more stirring. Good cinema should ask questions, and rarely it is done as masterful as here.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant",
            "content": "A landmark film with endless interpretations and analyses, so I'll try my best not to prattle on. There is a good dose of cynicism in Rashomon, with human nature shown to be selfish and for people to lie, or perhaps more delicately, to distort the truth through the lens of their own perception. A couple of serious crimes have been committed in the forest, and what's happened is told from four different perspectives. Common to all is that a samurai and his wife were travelling through the woods, and then set upon by a bandit (the incomparable Toshiro Mifune). He ties up the samurai and rapes his wife in front of him, and afterwards the samurai is found dead. It's a grim, awful crime, and worse yet, because of the culture and the period, the rape is viewed with elements of dishonor and shame in the woman. Beyond that, the truth is elusive, and once we see that the flashbacks vary in their accounting, we realize it may be difficult to arrive at what actually happened.In the bandit's account, he puts himself in the best possible light. The woman fights courageously with a dagger before succumbing to him, but then grasps him in her arms when he assaults her, indicating consent in the end. She then tells the bandit that because of the shame, either he or her husband must die, urging them to fight to the death, which they do valorously. The lens here is clearly the bandit's masculinity, perhaps what is most important to him.In the woman's account, after she's raped and the bandit leaves, all she can see are her husband's eyes, boring in to her own. She feels guilty, horribly guilty, and faints near him with the dagger in her hand. When she comes to, her husband is dead, and she attempts suicide multiple times but fails. In her case, the lens is one emphasizing her feeling of shame, as painful as that is for us to see.In the samurai's account, cleverly told through a medium, after the rape, his wife is about to leave with the bandit, when she asks him to kill her husband. The bandit is shocked by the request, and asks the samurai if he wants to kill the woman, or let her go. Because of that honorable action, he's willing to pardon the bandit. The woman flees, and after the bandit releases the samurai, the samurai commits suicide. In this case, the lens emphasizes an honor code, and puts more control of what must have been a helpless and humiliating situation back in the hands of the samurai.This is where the 1922 short story 'In a Grove' from Ryunosuke Akutagawa ends, and I find it fascinating that Kurosawa added the woodcutter's account (beyond him simply finding the body). In this version, after the rape, the bandit begs the woman to marry him, but she refuses and releases the samurai. Instead of an epic battle for her hand, the two are both cowardly, only fighting when she spurs them on, and then with more fear than skill. It's very tempting to think that this must represent the closest thing to truth, as it's told from an outside observer's perspective, contains elements of the other's stories, and shows no one in a flattering light. However even it has discrepancies, casting doubt over it, and thus, the truth is ever elusive.If you think about it, each of the first three stories has an underlying misogyny. In the first, the woman says no, but given enough force, eventually says yes. In the second, she essentially feels guilty for having been raped. In the third, while the samurai and even the bandit display honor, her shame is so great that she requests her husband be murdered. Perhaps there is some redemption in the woodcutter's story when she criticizes her husband for not protecting her in the first place.The other aspects that Kurosawa added relative to the original story was the setting at 'Rashomon', which was the largest gate in Kyoto, the discussion at the gate throughout the narrative, and the ending sequence with the baby. Akutagawa had also written a short story called 'Rashomon', which is published today along with 'In a Grove' and others in a slim volume, and Kurosawa took this setting and the title from the other story. The gate had fallen into disrepair and was a hide-out for thieves as well as a place to abandon bodies, and as the rain pours down, we feel the wretchedness of the human condition. In providing the ending sequence though, Kurosawa seems to give us an answer to the central question posed by the film: how can anything be accomplished when eyewitnesses can't even agree on the simple truth of past events, and people are so selfish, driven by their own egos? It's through mercy and kindness, acts which transcend misunderstanding.",

Proved by KurosawaTill date, I resisted to touch Kurosawa for I though, I was meek to comprehend his greatness and perhaps even understand it. After watching Rashomon, I must say I am in a complex of a certain dilemma acquired by watching this film. A simple tale can be made complex by adding different versions of narratives to the same story, they are contradictory and inconclusive, yet they add the dimension of thought provoking and making the viewer think actually what could have happened in the story. Perhaps, nothing of what was said and may be all too, but the most important thing it ignites a debate within a mind. Thus, there lies the success of the film and hence it derives all the attention of the viewer. This, is how a film becomes great.Even so many years later, if this film has the charm to attract and enthrall audiences. I attribute that mostly to the narration by Kurosawa above everything else. Yes, the cinematography is brilliant, the editing is precise and makes the film breezy. The production values are good considering this is made in 1950's Japan. But above all, the treatment and the screenplay take the film to greater heights.It's the story of a woman cheating her husband and making love with another man who is a bandit. But the husband, the woman, the bandit present three versions of the story and that makes it complex. Even the witnesses give different versions of happenings and it gets intriguing further.The nature acts as a metaphor, the overcast skies, the rains and the sunshine at the end add another aspect to the narrative, which I got to know by the end. Thankfully, I observed it to grasp it.I will further examine, observe and seek learnings from Akira Kurosawa's films. For this film, a 5/5. It's a masterpiece from one of the finest directors ever.",

Even if Kurosawa had never made another movie he would be remembered forever for making this. Everything about it is perfect, but I particularly admire the actors involved. Toshiro Mifune who plays the bandit is one of the most charismatic actors to ever step in front of a camera, but the rest of the cast are also excellent. I don't think there's a false note in any of their performances. The plot concerns four differing accounts of a rape and a murder, and will leave you fascinated and puzzled. Too many unworthy movies get labelled \"masterpieces\" in my opinion, but 'Rashomon' really deserves the title.

Solid performances from a cast that (of course) includes Toshiro Mifune. This was the third Kurosawa-Mifune collaboration - they would go on to work together in a total of 16 films.Not brilliant though. The whole three different perspectives thing is a bit confusing as rather than everyone trying to blame someone else we have people implicating themselves. This reduces the intrigue to an extent.The ending is also quite clumsy.

Based on ancient Japan where Samurai's dwelled and women had no rights, Rashomon is actually a series of flashbacks. The movie starts with a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner discussing about something unusual that happened in the court that day. The Woodcutter was summoned to the court as a witness to the dead body of a Samurai. As, the movie progresses, it is clear that an infamous bandit killed the Samurai because of the lust of his beautiful wife. This particular crime though is recalled from four different point's of view. The bandit, the Samurai's wife, the dead Samurai himself (With the help of black magic, entering the body of another human) and the woodcutter who was an eyewitness to the entire murder scene. All four of them present completely different perspectives of the same murder and it is left to the audience to decide whose version may be true. But this movie does not stop at being a murder and crime mystery. It also takes a closer look at the human psychology and behavior in different situations and conditions.The plot itself is very unique and engaging . Kurosawa has made this already interesting plot into an exceptional movie with his accurate and detailed direction. The Cinematography is also of the highest order which enhances the feel of the movie. Special credit goes to all the actors who had to shoot the same scenario four times but with different mindsets, expressions and dialogues. Among the actors, a special mention should go to Toshiro Mifune (Kurosawa'a favorite actor) who ruled the screen with his animalistic rage and passion. A very enriching movie experience which left me wanting for more of the great director. In my all-time favorite movie's list straightaway .Rating : 9/10",

It's about how much people are the main characters in their own little stories and the lies people will tell themselves in order to make sure they're the heroes. I recognized in this movie the world of social media, which has made it easier and easier to retreat into a bubble of one's choosing where one completely controls the narrative, and where one can cherry pick whatever they want, fact or fiction, to support the version of reality they want to believe in. I also totally dug this movie's pessimistic attitude about mankind, one which I acutely share right now, when it seems like humanity is basically unredeemable.But then there is that ending, one that might seem abrupt in context of the movie, but which also rang true to me. The day before I re-watched this, I was driving down Lake Shore Drive in Chicago when there was a slow down in the far left lane. As I passed on the right, I saw that a motorcyclist had slowed down to escort a goose and her goslings down the street until there was a good spot to get them off the Drive. This tiny little bit of kindness and humanity hit me hard in the moment, and it actually made me feel like maybe humans aren't a total lost cause after all. So since I had just had that experience, the ending of \"Rashomon\" felt totally authentic to me, and almost like it was speaking directly to me.Toshiro Mifune I think overdoes his performance a bit, but Machiko Kyo blows the roof off the joint.\"Rashomon\" received an Honorary Foreign Language Film Oscar at the 1951 Academy Awards, before a competitive category existed. Unbelievably enough, Japan wouldn't win a competitive foreign language Oscar until 2008.Grade: A.",

Having a marathon viewing of his works for the first time, I got set to see a new perspective.View on the film:Ending Scandal (1950-also reviewed) with a courtroom set-piece, editor/co-writer/(with debut scriptwriter/future regular collaborator Shinobu Hashimoto) directing auteur Akira Kurosawa is joined by River of the Night (1956-also reviewed) cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa in placing the audience in the position of judge, who with each of Kurosawa's distinctive screen-wipes are presented with differing versions of reality,all linked by the characters talking directly to the camera/the unseen/silent judge,to make the case to the viewers that their version of reality is the truest one.Unleashing a grand storm in the opening for the first time since The Quiet Duel (1949-also reviewed),Kurosawa gets in his element, by closely working with Miyagawa to build an immerse atmosphere from the elements, with strobes of natural light, ( done by being reflected off of mirrors,to make it more visible on film) which elegantly captures the spotty thin line between measured reason and impulsive darkness, which Kurosawa ends, by having the woodcutter display the power of personal responsibility, (a major theme in Kurosawa's work) break the sun from out of the darkness.Displaying since the decades-spanning No Regrets for Our Youth (1946-also reviewed)a fantastic skillfulness in threading time-shifting periods, Kurosawa & Hashimoto ignite their collaborations with a spellbinding start.Detailed on Donald Richie's terrific commentary the Kurosawa said that one of the reasons he made the title was because \" The source of the movie is about relative truth, but I wanted to make a film about relative reality.\" , the writers superbly lay out in the court the relating view of reality presented by each recollection made,where the drastic differences that rise to the suffice,widen the scope of each perspective.",

There's mesmerizing, unyielding artistry to every single aspect of the film's craft. Kurosawa's eye for shot composition is incredible, making nigh every frame a work of art in and of itself. Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography is rich and crisp, allowing viewers to soak in every considerable detail. Between those two elements alone even the opening credits, laid over shots of torrential rain in a village, are so beautiful one could almost cry. Fumio Hayasaka's dramatic, compelling score is reason enough to warrant a view as it lends much tension to the course of events. Every performance is a tremendous display of acting skill that counts among the best to be found anywhere. Takashi Shimura, Minoru Chiaki, Kichijiro Ueda, Toshishiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Noriko Honma all exhibit terrific, boundless nuance, range, personality, poise, and physicality that help to elevate 'Rashomon' to only the greatest of heights. The simple set design, and the natural filming location, are both superb visual feasts, and the costume design is terrific.And where can one even begin to succinctly speak of the narrative content? 'Rashomon' is wonderfully sharp and complex as an examination of perspective, the subjectivity of facts and truth, and how the human experience shapes these. Each figure's recollection of the central event is molded by their own needs, desires, and conceits - how they wish to be perceived thereafter, the omissions and half-truths they need to keep to themselves, their own self-images. The fundamental reality of the aftermath is definite, but the way in which the crimes transpired is wholly in doubt depending on who relates it. The result of the resounding uncertainty forces us to reflect on our own experiences, the direction in which we steer conversation, and how we approach occurrences in our daily lives. 'Rashomon' further instills a compulsion to analyze the experiences and perspectives of others - whether that means we find an intent to do good, an intent to harm, or a selfish intent of self-preservation. With limited settings, and in revisiting only a select span of time, we are shown how very complicated the characters are - and how their complications mirror our own.In the space of just under 90 minutes casts a bleak, almost nihilistic pall over humanity, only to offer a glimmer of hope, all while telling a deeply absorbing specific story. And through it all, there's not one facet of the production that isn't absolutely stellar. I don't know how much more I could say without betraying plot points: this is a movie whose reputation - nay, legend - far precedes it, and every ounce of praise is fully deserved. Kurosawa is one of the conclusive, vital geniuses of cinema as a medium, and 'Rashomon' is further proof. Whoever you are, wherever you're able to watch it, this is a film you need to see.",

If the word \"overrated\" was assigned a picture reference in a dictionary, a portrait of \"AK\" would probably be the best choice. If the word \"lemming\" was assigned a synonym in a thesaurus, the term \"AK follower\" would fit the bill nicely. It's no understatement to say that the sheer level of brainless veneration that's repeatedly thrown at this guy hasn't been seen since the advent of organized religion \u2013 especially when one considers the fact that most of his movies suck, yet are somehow able to earn IMDb average ratings over 8.0. These people need to stop beating around the bush and simply construct cathedrals in his honor for daily worship.Well, I knew this day would come. I'm running out of Japanese movies to watch on Netflix, so I have decided to watch more Akira Kurosawa films - despite the fact that much of what I have already seen has been torture to sit through. However, I do typically enjoy films more after a second viewing, so I decided to give \"Rashomon\" a second chance. Ironically, I'm going to end up downgrading my original rating from a 4/10 to a 3/10. All it did was remind me of why I don't like this director. I truly dread this little project I've started on.Kurosawa directs yet another dud that tells multiple perspectives of a murder. As is the case with many of this director's films, the acting is wretched. Toshiro Mifune (a good actor) gives what is likely the worst performance of his career as he cackles and stumbles around like Jar Jar Binks. Meanwhile, Takashi Shimura (a terrible actor) basically just stares off into space with those bug eyes of his, mugging for the camera with that smug frown that Kurosawa loves so much (go watch \"Ikiru\" if you want 2+ hours of Shimura's sad puppy dog glances). As if that weren't bad enough, the lead actress contributes some horribly acted moments during the second half. But the acting isn't the only problem here. The scoring is non-stop and way off base. The mystery simply isn't that interesting or well-written. Some scenes drag on for far too long despite the film being only 88 minutes long. The sword duels are annoying to watch, with characters acting like looney tunes or incompetent doofuses (e.g., stumbling around, dropping swords, missing easy opportunities to kill, acting like children, etc.). Yep, poorly directed crap like this is what I expect from good ole A.K.",

They all compete with each other in trying to outdo each other, and even the bride, after having been raped and sobbing and crying for hours destitute on the ground suddenly bursts out laughing, when she realizes she is actually superior to both her husband and rapist when she makes them fight each other to death. There is also a lot of stumbling around, Toshiro Mifune himself falling off his horse, and when in the divers fighting scenes they keep falling and stumbling, they falteringly try to rise again only to stumble and fall again - this is indeed a study of human weakness. Only the monk has any detachment, he knows humanity already, and to him this horrible atrocity is nothing new, and all he can do is to continue being in shock because of humanity. The film is slow, it is overworked, there are too many and too long moments of inaction and hesitation, but it is 70 years old, and for its time it certainly was epoch-making in its sharp psychology in charting the fundamental weakness of man. No one is right, everyone is wrong, while they all believe they are right. The film is above all worth watching for its very careful cinematography, there are important details in every scene, the photo is wonderful, and of course you must wonder what happened to the lady afterwards. No one knows. All the men seem to immediately forget all about her.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS*** Finding shelter in a driving rainstorm at the deserted Dragon's Gate, Rashomon, monastery three strangers a woodcutter priest and peasant find out that they each were involved in a trail that left them in a state of disbelief. The trial was that of the notorious Japanese bandit Tajomaru who was tried in the murder of local nobleman Takehiro and the rape of his wife Masago. As each one of the three strangers recount the story it seems that they contradict themselves in them being totally at odds with what each other says about it. Tajomaru was nothing but a low down rat who after seeing the gorgeous Masago riding on a horse through the forest decided to make her his woman but he had to get past her Samurai husband Takehiro to do it. This lead Tajomaru to ambush the pair and tie the husband as he raped his pretty wife Masago. That was Tajomaru description of what happened, which didn't help him at his trial, but the other witnesses to the crime including the dead Takehiro,through a Medium, had far different visions of it!In fact it's the rape victim herself Mrs. Masago who seemed to be far more guilty then Tajomaru in what happened to both her and her husband Takehiro! It seems like the true version of the event is told by the eye witness woodcutter who kept his mouth shut during the trial because he didn't want to get involved. The woodcutter brings out out in this fascinating conversation that in fact it was Masago who wanted to leave her tied up husband and take off with the man who raped her Tajomaru! That's because in her mind Tajomaru was the better, in bed?, of the two! With Takehiro now feeling less then a man in not openly preventing his wife from being raped but being reject by her as her husband and lover the only thing left for him was to do himself in with his wife's dagger that he bought her as a wedding present! This the woodcutter's version is more or less a lot like what the dead husband recounted through a medium about what really happened! Or really did it!The audience is skillfully left confused in what exactly happened between the three Tajomaru Takehiro & Masago in that they seem to be hiding something in order not to implicate themselves, if a murder did in fact occur, in what really happened. It was a pleasure for the rain to finally let up so the three, the woodcutter priest & peasant, can go their own way and do their best to forget what they just went through as well as talked about. Classic Japanses movie about not trusting anyone in what they heard or saw even if your the one who heard or saw it! P.S Even though it's nowhere as well known or critically acclaimed as \"Rashomon\" the British film \"Five Angles to Murder\" or it's other title \"The Lady in Question\" that was released almost at the same time as \"Rashomon\" has the same plot but is far more entertaining as well as less confusing.",

            "content": "Although there are many ways to define the non-linear narrative, I would like to argue that Rashomon is not a non-linear piece in the traditional sense, but rather contains only elements of non-linearity than as a whole. It includes, for the most part, digetic non-conventional elements in a linear type structure (one that is fluid in terms of its story) as opposed to the traditional non-conventional structure containing mostly non-digetic material. That is to say, when the characters and viewer do not have a frame of reference as to where they really are, (i.e. location, dialogue, and story) but are rather given vague suggestions, the traditional non-linear structure is more present than not. However, Rashomon does not leave the viewer confused or without a frame of reference. This is clearly illustrated around the stories main theme: In a world of deceit, can anyone be trusted? From the beginning, the viewer holds expectations that the film is going to reveal a story within a story within a story\u0097all told from four different perspectives. As it turns out, this structure remains consistent throughout the piece. Already then, this film does not follow the true non-linear format. Following the true format would create more chaos and less order. This aspect of the film's orderliness brings up its digetic qualities. Not only do the characters in the story know that they are telling stories within stories, but the viewer also understands this aspect. Thus, time and space are not irrationally violated. It's true that the film contains non-linear elements that are demonstrated through its use of flashbacks, but the flashbacks themselves are set in a linear structure. The viewer always has a frame of reference as to where they are. The director presents this idea in the following way: Dissolves are used each time a character begins telling their story/flashback, thus allowing the viewer to enter that world without confusion. Knowing this sets up the viewer to contemplate the stories theme.The four different perspectives that are shared regarding what happened between the woman, her husband and the bandit, leave the viewer, as well as the characters in the story, unable to distinguish the truth from the lies. In one story, the woman indulges the bandit and asks him to kill her husband so she can marry him; in another, the woman is appalled by the bandit's actions and rushes to the aid of her husband but is rejected. When the priest tells his side of the story, he tells it through the perspective of the dead husband, who in turn lives vicariously through a witch doctor of some sort. This particular story stood out above the rest as the best example of non-linearity. When the witch doctor tells the police that the husband was stabbed to death, she herself acts out the stabbing sensation to heighten the effect of the actual death. This element added a type of metaphorical abstraction to the film more so than a realistic quality. Still, the viewer cannot objectively come to a solid conclusion on whose story is true and whose is false.However, the viewer is given strong incentive to assume that the man who carries the baby away at the end was the truth-teller. Why? Because the other two men have created suspicion in the viewer to think otherwise (i.e. the first man stealing the arm bracelet from the baby, the second man lying about the dagger in the story so he could sell it for money). Both implicit ideas strongly reveal the film's theme in terms of the corrupt nature of men and their tendencies to lie to gain the upper hand.",

            "content": "I oftentimes wonder, upon seeing classic films like this, what the atmosphere would have been like in a 1950s movie theatre that had just shown the film. I would imagine that viewers would have experienced the same feelings that I experienced after watching ground-breaking visual spectacles such as THE MATRIX and mind-warping thrillers such as MEMENTO.This film was lauded at that time (1950) for its stunning visual appeal and epic footage. Watching it in today's high-tech world it is a bit difficult to imagine this as cutting-edge, but one thing remains outstandingly clear: this is yet another one of Akira Kurosawa's brilliant stories.The story itself is relatively simple by today's standards, yet there is a pervasive air of complexity that surrounds the film long after its 88 minute run-time. The simple story is told and re-told from four different perspectives, as can be read in any generic plot summary. The problem (and fascination) here is that no two stories are the same, and they all conflict with each other. What's even more perplexing is that the fourth story is told form a neutral point of view and it should therefore be easier for the viewer to believe this recreation, but having seen the initial three scenarios (each of which are equally credible), it is hard to buy into even this final telling.But forget the story, because this film is so much more than just that. This is a film that focuses on truths, untruths, and perspective, all told in a beautifully poetic way. To the viewer, the camera should not lie. The camera is the viewer's perspective into the on-screen world. As such, the camera serves as the viewer's viewpoint and should therefore be totally and objectively honest. It is by such means that people watch movies. However, in this relatively short motion picture, the camera 'lies' to the viewer on at least three occasions, and in the end the viewer is left questioning subjective truth versus objective truth. Many of the core principles are the same as in MEMENTO...that there is no such thing as an objective truth or objective memory. All events are dependent on the observer, and are hence subjective. Indeed, this is a film that has, and will continue to, spark many intellectual conversations/arguments.As with the meticulous Kurosawa, the storytelling and screenplay is marvellous. It is hard to judge the musical aspect of the film simply because it is difficult to compare it to today's standards. All I can say here is that the music appears to 'fit' the movie well. The acting is top notch, and special mention should be paid to Kurosawa's mainstay Toshiro Mifune, as well as Minuro Chiaki, who plays the role of the melancholy priest exceptionally well. My vote for the best actor, however, has to go to Machiko Kyo, who competently takes on a different personality in each version of the story.While some people find it hard to watch classic movies such as this, I recommend that you see this at least once. It may just be one of the more rewarding 88-minute cinematic experiences you will ever have.3.5 stars, 8/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 115. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "This film is the glorious work of a genius. A blend of unique, exciting and sophisticated storytelling, and visual mastery. Rashomon is essentially a crime mystery set in Japan. The crime is recalled very differently from different people's perspectives, so the audience is never entirely sure what the truth actually is. You build up an idea of the characters, but since they're presented differently each time, you can never have a set idea of who they truly are. The way the plot structured is very stimulating. Often plots that work this way come together at the end like a jigsaw puzzle, but not so with Rashomon. You're left with four very different jigsaw puzzles and no real answers. Visually it's truly excellent. The men recounting the story in a temple in the pouring rain is a glorious visual. I found the whole world that has been created very convincing and completely absorbing. Kurosawa builds tension through knowing exactly when to cut and when to linger, and the music creeps right under your skin. My only minor criticism of the film would be that, by choosing not to show the court, Tajomaru talks in a strange expositional way where he'll repeat the unheard question before giving his answer. This just wasn't my favorite thing as it was a stylistic choice that brought me out of the film if only for a moment. Other than that this film is pretty much perfectly balanced with truly stunning performances. The acting is so visceral, and it has to be to capture the many nuances of these characters. Mifune as Tajomaru is particularly absorbing with his constant animalistic stance and his frequent itching. It's hard to take your eyes off him.I thought this film perfectly captured much of the human essence. Of how people think of themselves, and how they think about others. It will keep you mesmerised throughout and thinking long after it has finished. Masterful storytelling from one of the masters of cinema.",

            "content": "\"It's human to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves\". Honesty. Deceit. Contradiction. A crucial part of human preservation is the requirement to lie. Intentional or accidental, it's within our ancestral blood. The unprejudiced can succumb to the immoral values of deceit, either through meticulous storytelling or scattershot deception. Even the truth can be distorted by one's self-absorbed ego. The mutually contradictory stories of a bandit, Samurai and his wife, during a police questioning of an ambush, rape and murder, provides Kurosawa with the leverage to thematically explore the depths of human duplicity. A narrative conveyed through the perspective of four individuals, each telling a variation of the same event and asserting it as the truth. Yet who is moral? Who is verifiable?The answer lies within the embellishments of mankind. The egotistical residue enveloping the desires for personal gain. The bandit, openly admitting to the events in question, proud of his barbaric conquest. The wife, subjecting herself to sorrow and helplessness, innocently scarred from the visceral crime. The Samurai, communicating through a spiritual medium, self-gratifying his noble demise. And the distant woodcutter, examining the various preceding stories, acting as the fragile bystander solidifying his story as the whole truth. But when characters reside in a downbeat world where \"you just can't live unless you're what you call selfish\", is anyone's depiction correct? Is lying for personal gain and visibly stealing an abandoned baby's clothing the same selfish endeavour? Variational stories so similar yet so different in tone. It all comes down to the genius that is Kurosawa.Depicting egoism through embellishment, not just through the verbal tales of the living, but also beyond the grave. Signifying the requirement for flattering falsehood, even when life has been fully exerted. It is the impossibility of human nature that provokes us into fabricating the most obvious details. Never has such an influential film, shrouded in its own classicism, infiltrated my soul through its thematic examination of human psychology as much as this did. Every word. Every detail. Every deadpan look into the camera. Every tracking shot that showcases the glistening sun of truth through the obscurities of darkened natural foliage. It's perfect.The imperfect gender politics of feudal Japan (\"women are naturally weak\") delicately inverted to portray the weakness of humanity, regardless of gender. Utilising the subjectivity of the woodcutter's perspective, and regarding it as the most truthful conclusive narrative, mankind is objectively weak. And it's only through our own digressions that we manufacture the strength of the soul. Kurosawa's symbolic attentiveness never deviated from this examination. His rampart artistry poetically manifesting the beauty of mystery. Invoking the investigative mind of human psychology. And once that overcast storm dissipates, revealing the warm beating rays of honesty, the overwhelming sensation of enlightenment will seep through.A synergistic vitality equalling that of Mifune's energetic quadruple performance. Each tale altering the personality of his bandit blood. Hysterically laughing at the face of adversity, to unbearably breathing from profuse fear and sin. The nuances are not exhumed just from the enigmatic cast. Kurosawa himself orchestrated a tantalising, influential and innovative mystery that combats the perception of regressive culture. It's never retrograde nor unprogressive. It is however, and I can utter this with adorned confidence, perfect.Short, sharp and sensational. Relatable on a thematic and personal level that transcends the discourse of time. Apt now as it was back then, only proving that humanity is cemented in deceit and acts of selfishness. As with any Kurosawa feature, the mind must be prepared for allegorical beauty. Rashomon is no different. Rashomon is painted with silky smooth brushes, illustrating an unconventional technique of storytelling through visceral imagery. Rashomon quite simply acquires the perfect rating. An undisputed classic that justifiably conceived, what is now commonly known as, \"The Rashomon Effect\".",

            "content": "Four different accounts of the same story. Who to believe? No one? Everyone? The audience becomes the interrogator in Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon,\" a film that explores the true nature of man through his subjectivity. So simple is this concept, yet few could match Kurosawa's delivery and craft it into a masterwork like he's done.In the pouring rain, a priest and woodcutter use the remainder of a damaged gatehouse to take shelter as they reflect on a rape and murder they had just testified regarding that happened merely three days before. Another man finds their shelter and asks to hear the story so long as the rain affords them the time. The priest had seen the murdered Samurai and his wife at one point and the woodcutter found the body. At the interrogation, they heard three testimonies from those involved: a bandit named Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) who confesses to the rape and killing, the rape victim (Machiko Kyo) and the murder victim (Masayuki Mori) as heard through a medium. Although all agree that the Samurai was bound as his wife was raped and that he indeed was killed, all three of their stories differ as to how it all happened.As each testimony builds on the next, we adjust what we feel is the truth accordingly, which ultimately leaves us with a story in which truth cannot be deciphered from lies. It becomes apparently rather quickly that the meat of the story lies elsewhere and that no right answer solves the riddle.What Kurosawa does with the story, other than put the audience in the seat of having to sort out the \"facts,\" comes out in the tone. Although the events themselves have a black-and- white nature, he thickens their haziness with an almost fairy tale-like tone. The performances of the actors, namely Mifune and Kyo, echo more traditional Japanese theatre storytelling with exaggerations and heavy (and sometimes irritating) emotions. Mifune's cackling and Kyo's wailing have a profound impact on our perception of the events despite the fact that every character's story lacks in veracity.The key to the whole thing comes later from the woodcutter, who reveals he too has a testimony he was afraid to share. Suddenly he provides a clarity (although not necessarily a truth) to the events and Eastern themes such as the protecting of one's honor seem to factor prominently in what seems likely to be made up or closer to the truth.As the priest and woodcutter wrestle with their faith in mankind in rather blunt terms, so do we attempt to insert our own views on human nature. What sets \"Rashomon\" apart in this eternal dialogue of man's inherent goor or evil is the component of selfishness and looking out for one's interests. It would be unfair to say that the difference in each testimony was caused by calculated lies on behalf of the person giving it. Instead, self-interest can subconsciously warp our perspective and the way we interpret what we see and experience.Kurosawa infuses this tale with an intensity few could match, striking visuals that make you feel as if you're not seeing the same story three different times with slight variations, but three completely different takes.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "There are only a handful of films that so permeate the film culture that they are loaded with so much expectation, having influenced so much, that it's impossible to see the film for the film itself. Kurosawa has made quite a few of these films, of which \"Rash\u00f4mon\" (1950) is, for me, the hardest to approach for the very reason that it seems to penetrate everything.The narrative is, of course, legendary not only how it is executed but how it has influenced art ever since. The untrusted narrator was hardly a new invention, even in film, since didn't noir explore its possibilities in depth? But it is never the novelty of the idea rather than its execution and application that counts in the end. And not that I think it's even remotely interesting and important who did what first here - the reason I mention noir is its vicinity to \"Rash\u00f4mon\", which can be aptly described as jidaigeki noir. This is what Kurosawa did so well, taking a genre and then reshaping it, often revolutionizing it in the process.Perhaps there's a need to moralize towards the end that doesn't seem to come so naturally, since to some extent the drive of the disoriented narratives works toward a rather more pessimistic solution, yet on the other hand it's wise to have a counterpoint that actually gives some sense of closure. And if one yearns for pessimism, Kurosawa gives that amply in his last epic.",

            "content": "I saw Rashomon for the first time last Sunday, on Father's day; it was a good day to watch this film. The movie centers on the interpretation of a murder laced with a rape, so most of it is a dialog among three men: a woodcutter who is a witness to the crime, a monk, and a vagabond. The dialog occurs in the remains of a temple while a heavy rain falls outside. The theme of the dialog revolves around a samurai, his wife and a bandit. The bandit sees the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest, catches a glimpse of the woman's face when the breeze opens her veil, and discovers that an impetuous desire to have that woman has taken possession of his will. He catches up with the couple and through trickery ties the samurai to a tree. He then rapes the wife. So far the story is unique. The samurai dies. The woodcutter encounters his remains and reports the crime to the police. The bandit is captured and tells the jury a story of the crime. The wife tells a different story. A medium is brought up and through the medium the samurai tells a different story. And finally the woodcutter tells yet another story. There is some amazing dialog between the samurai and his wife about honor, love, and dignity. Betrayal surfaces when it is convenient to betray. While the woodcutter narrates the events to his friends, the vagabond lights a bonfire with pieces of wood he tears from the ruinous construction. The woodcutter is interrupted occasionally by his friends. The camera work in the temple is unremarkable, with plenty of close-ups of the aging and rough men. Same goes for the scenes at the courtroom. One strange point here is that we never see any magistrate. We learn about the questions because the witness repeats them. It is like the movie about the Prophet, where the camera never shows the Prophet himself. The forest scenes are much better. Since the crime is narrated four times, there is plenty of action in the forest as the samurai and the bandit fight each other. After the woodcutter finishes narrating the four different versions of the crime, including his, they hear a baby crying in a room of the temple. They find a little child wrapped in a kimono. The vagabond grabs the kimono. Despite the woodcutter's protest that the kimono had an amulet most likely left by the parents to protect the baby, the vagabond makes a bundle with the kimono and leaves the temple, as the rain ceases, disappearing down the same path where he first appeared. The monk cuddles the baby but the woodcutter asks to have the baby. The monk refuses, with indignation in his eyes. Then the woodcutter explains that he already has six children and that one more would not be much trouble. The monk hears him, and with a smile on his faces hands over the baby. The movie ends. Until then, there has not been a single instance of brotherhood in the entire movie. Until then the emotions have been on the sordid side of the human scenario: lust, envy, betrayal, deceit, murder, rape, fights, and lies. Some critics have commented that the ending is a license with sentimentality that Kurosawa allowed himself. To me, the ending is the movie. In the film, we are taken on a long trip throughout the wasteland of human feelings. Human greed and mistrust distort the truth and create confusion. From the affairs of adults emanates a toxic mist of confusion. People mistrust one another. Is there any hope? At the end, Kurosawa shows us the hope, the reason that makes one man trust another man: a future life. The human adventure is an adventure of hope. The same message is found in Sondheim and Lapine's musical Into the Woods. A marvelous musical mixing half a dozen fables that end up very happily like fables use to end. The difference is that at this stage the musical is only half way through. The other half reverses the fortunes of all players when the giant comes to town seeking revenge. Here once more all the nasty feelings seep out of the human soul. At the end, it is a little child who brings the survivors together. They decide to unite to care for the baby.

A nefarious bandit, Taj\u00f4maru (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), is accused of murdering a travelling samurai in front of his wife. We hear four different versions of the events that took place. One from each of the three and one from a bystander. Each tale differs from one another and in the end it's left for the viewer to decide who to believe.Rashomon is a clever tale and full of depths, but it also shows that Kurosawa was still travelling towards his prime. The acting is a bit overplayed in certain scenes. Mifune especially overacts constantly, which in some ways fits the character, but is still a bit jarring. The score is also surprisingly distracting. That being said, the camera-work is beautiful, the storytelling works very well and even the framing story about people hiding from the rain and talking about the trial is not as bad as it could be.And it's simply a fascinating story on thematic level. It's made clear very early that all the witnesses lie to make themselves look better. They all try to shift the blame, to make their own accord seem dignified or born out of necessity. Even the final story by the bystander has undercurrents that make it seem not as objective as it should. So who to believe?In the end the film provides no answers. Rather it asks us to wonder how common this sort of behaviour is in everyday life. Do we shape our subjective realities by telling stories? And if we do so, do we also allow the stories of others to have an affect on what we believe to be true, to be reality?It's up to you to decide. But first you have to ask the question in the first place.",

            "content": "\"Rashomon\" was one of Akira Kurosawa's masterpieces, as the film features an ingenious narrative structure, excellent acting and a musing exploration into the fine line that separates perception from reality. The story of a barbaric crime and its aftermath is recounted from 4 contradictory viewpoints and we are given the gruesome details of each one. \"Rashomon\" is a beautiful piece of art for so many reasons. In a way, it plays out almost like more of a parable than a film. When asked about \"Rashomon\", Kurosawa once said, \"One of the technique of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\" The plot itself is fairly straightforward and we are not left in a major state of ambiguity by film's end. However, this is a film that, like its enigmatic characters, seeks an ulterior motive. Aside from merely providing us with guidance on how to properly conduct ourselves, it frequently uses metaphorical language which helps to elucidate the more complex ideas. \"Rashomon\" is didactic in its search, not discovery, of moral and spiritual answers.And that word \"search\" is very important to the ultimate meaning of \"Rashomon\". This film does not seek to provide some revelation of truth to negate the varying perceptions, but rather to delve deeper into the human psyche by calling attention to the disparity between how we as humans think and rationalize. It is near impossible to adequately praise Kurosawa for what he created with \"Rashomon\". The astonishing cinematography and use of \"dappled\" light perfectly captures the eerie, shadowy feel of the atmosphere. All of the actors (Mifune, Mori) bring a gripping realism to their characters. The dialogue is intelligent and introspective, particularly with its constant reflection of existential questions. What truly set this film apart is that, to a certain degree, every line uttered seems to reveal some level of humanity. There is no superfluous detail I can recall that needn't be said nor presented throughout.One aspect of the film I found particularly interesting is how Rashomon chose to supplant the presence of a judge (to whom each person is recounting their story to) for silence, with each individual stating, then proceeding to answer, the question supposedly being asked to them. This technique demands that we be the one to deliberate over their conflicting stories. It is up to us decide for ourselves \"What do we believe?\" or, for some, \"What do we WANT to believe?\" It seems that Kurosawa is trying to convey the idea that, in the end, there is no one right answer - truth is, in itself, a matter of subjectivity. With \"Rashomon\", Kurosawa offers us a powerful and masterful piece of film-making that really makes you question the human condition.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is not just regarded as one of the best directors Japan has ever produced, he is widely seen as one of the best ever to live, making films like Seven Samurai, Yojimbo and Throne of Blood. One of his most highly regarded is Rashomon, an ambitious film with its storytelling and narrative methods and a highly influential film, even to this day.In Feudal Japan a Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) tells the story of a trial of bandit, Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) is accused of murdering a samurai (Masayuki Mori) and each story about the same events contradicts the previous witness.Rashomon is a case of Chinese Whisper as a story keeps evolving and changing as a new layer of the story is revealed to the audience. Each narrator is unreliable as they tell a story in their own self-interest and one of the big themes is that humanity is selfish. Rashomon was a film released in 1950 where Japan was still recovering from World War II, seen the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a new war was brewing in the Korean Peninsula. It can be argued that some humans are selfish, from small things to the bigger political and international picture. I don't agree with this viewpoint because I have a more optimistic view, but I can still make the case that nation states are selfish.Another theme is the search for the truth. Scientist Karl Popper believed that a hypothesis needs to constantly needs to be tested to be proved true and philosopher John Stuart Mill believed that they was no point suppressing the truth because it will come out eventually. This could be implied to Rashomon as each story tests the information of the provided by previous witness. As an audience we are like the people in the cave in Plato's The Republic: where we only see a limited prospection because we have only need have a limited view of the world which we see as the truth until we get to see the wider world.The final theme is a look at sexual politics and sexism, as the samurai is willing to disown his wife after she is raped and the bandit stating that women are weak, after he raped her. But as the story unfolds all three characters are relieved to be not very pleasant and vile to some degree.At 88 minutes Kurosawa delivered a tout, thoughtful film filmed that is ambitious and wonderfully made. It expresses all it wanted to in this short space of time and is very subversive in its approach to deconstructing of traditional narrative storytelling. It is clear why Rashomon is so influential, with different viewpoints of an event being used by Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick's The Killing, the sci-fi film Source Code, Vantage Point and Hoodwinked.One bit of criticism I do have towards the film is towards Mifune's performance which weak considering the source material and my God did he have an annoying laugh.Rashomon is a seminal film, a film should watch at least once. Rashomon is well crafted and important because of its place in film history.",

            "content": "\"Rash\u00f4mon\" is a Japanese live action movie from the exact middle of the 20th century, so this one is from the year 1950 and at under 1.5 hours not a long movie at all. As you may have guessed from the year, this is a black-and-white film and except the US and very few other countries that also released the occasional color movie by then (also my country Germany I think, at least before that), black-and-white was really the standard there. This film is still very famous today and a key reason for that is that the writer and director is Akira Kurosawa, considered by many one of the finest filmmakers who ever existed. This is maybe not his most known film nowadays, but surely among his most known, maybe top5. It is also really self-explanatory if a film from the year 1950, especially a film that is not in the English language, is closer to 200k ratings on imdb than to 100k ratings. Kurosawa himself was under the age of 40 when he made this, so it is one of his earlier efforts, even if he had already been in the industry for a decade approximately at that point. He is not the only writer credited with this movie. The writer of the base material was Ry\u00fbnosuke Akutagawa who was only in his mid30s when he died from suicide in the year 1927, so he did not live to see this film's success. There have been many other releases based on his works over the years, but this one is by far the most known and most successful. In terms of the screenplay, Kurosawa collaborated with Shinobu Hashimoto and it was not the only shared project between the two. With Hashimoto, one very interesting thing to say is that he lived until the summer of 2018, became him a centenarian. Japanese people really do reach old age.I am not an expert on Japanese movies, but if I look at the cast, I see a handful names and actors that have made an impact on Japanese cinema also through other projects and collaborations with Kurosawa (and Hashimoto) back then. Toshir\u00f4 Mifune comes to mind immediately and he may be the closest to a lead this film has. His energy and screen presence are always easy to identify. Another one would be Takashi Shimura who has been in so many Kurosawa films, also playing much bigger characters than he does here. Of course, as the film is over 72 years old now, it is unlikely to still find anybody who was part of this and who is alive in the year 2022 or soon 2023. Maybe the baby is, the one we see at the very end almost. I think it was a boy. But he would be an old man now too. Still must be interesting for him to watch this film and see all the people surrounding him. Anyway, this film is currently in position 150 in the imdb top250, so the rating is extremely high. This is what got me really curious (apart from the name Kurosawa) when I saw that the film was shown again here as part of a film series on Asian movies. This series has been going on for quite a bit now. Really awesome that they are bringing back old films to movie theaters this way and this was maybe the oldest film so far that they brought back. Simply because it is considered a classic by many. I cannot really agree with that though from my perspective as you perhaps already saw from my rating, but before I go into detail there, let me say that this film was also nominated for an Oscar for its art direction and set decoration and this nomination happened in 1953, so quite a while after the movie's original release. This long it took for the film to get to the Oscars. One of the two nominees also got in again a few years later for Kurosawa's perhaps most known film. But today we will keep talking about this one here and you can also add that it won an honorary Oscar in 1952 already and was picked as the best foreign movie. More praise arose from the BAFTAs, Director's Guild, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics and many others. The film also won the prestigious Golden Lion in Venice in 1951 already, so Europe apparently liked it earlier than America.Okay, now let's look at the story and I will try to explain why I did not like the film too much: I watched the Japanese original with subtitles, but on a side note let me say that the German title is really awful and absolutely not fitting at all. One of the worst I have ever heard in this context. It sounds like some mix between romance and music like many other German films from the 1960s mostly. You can kinda split this film into two parts and there is constant jumping back and forth between these parts. The first would be the now in which a few characters talk about what events from the not-so-distant past and the second part would be the depiction of what happened back then. It is the story of a couple who run into a criminal in the forest. He is interested in the girl. These three characters tell us in detail what happened and we also have another, a fourth character, namely a woodcarver who also gives us his take on the events, but turns out he almost saw nothing, but fled because he was scared. The narrations vastly differ, so we cannot be sure about the actual events and this also does not change at the end. We do not know what happened. We only know what the characters want us to believe. The truth was maybe somewhere in-between. We do not know exactly how the girl reacted for example, although it seems at least that she was not as innocent as she claimed to be. I mean she did not kill her man, but it could very well have been the case that she told the criminal to kill him and take her with him, so she would simply become the criminal's girl and the shame what he did with her would not be as shameful anymore. We also do now know if the criminal simply wanted to leave or was really crazy for the girl, even after he had her. We can only assume and everybody may have a different idea what the reality looks like for them.I actually thought the introduction was pretty good when we find out the male from the couple dies. This is almost the only thing we know for sure. We cannot say for sure if he died in battle or if he even took his own life. The latter is what his perspective suggested. A ritual suicide. What we can be kinda sure about though is that the bad guy tricked him to catch him and tie him up, but he did not kill him in such a deceitful fashion. So the killing was not even necessarily a crime. Just a sword battle for life and death. The bad guy even praises the man for how long he managed to survive in the fight and that he was an almost equal opponent. I kinda liked some inclusions from the beginning like how we find out the man would die already when we see him in his first scene as he is entering the forest with his woman and I also liked how the villain Taj\u00f4maru (Mifune) told us about the wind in the forest and how it was a breeze that started it all, namely how he ended up seeing the female protagonist's face this way. Interestingly enough, Machiko Ky\u00f4 is the only one from the cast who scored a bit of awards attention for her portrayal here. She was decent. None of the cast were bad. It is also interesting to see how the fact that she was probably raped by the criminal (unless she really gave consent as you could assume from one flashback with how she put her arms around the bad guy) was such a non-factor here in this film and how she was nonetheless in almost every scenario depicted as one of the least likable characters too. This could never happen in film today. She would be the full-on victim already because of political correctness reasons. It is a bit sad that this is getting in the way of things nowadays and I say that despite not liking the movie a lot.I definitely liked these flashback sequences more than what happens in the now, namely when the characters are talking about the fateful events in the forest. The \"now scenes\" did nothing for me almost and are a key reason why I give this film a negative recommendation. I also found it difficult to put them into context. The way I understood it the goal in the end was not to tell the audience what happened exactly, but tell them that everybody lies. House would loved it I guess. Everybody lies to make themselves look better and everybody is evil in a way. The film still ends on a moment of good when completely out of nowhere a baby shows up and we find out what is going to happen with it. Who will take it and make sure it is alright. There we also had a skeptic character who then realizes he ran into the good of humanity when his initial thoughts about what the other man would do with the baby turned out wrong. I found all this really absurd. I mean where did the infant even come from? First I thought it is maybe an orphan of the couple from the forest, but then I realized that the woman is not dead and that there was most likely no connection between the kid and said couple. It was just there all of a sudden. This was one key flaw for me. Apart from that, it is of course up to you to decide if you like the idea how the man killed in the forest talks to us through a medium. It was not my favorite scene, but it could have been worse. Definitely very special scene, but also not really in a good way. So there are supernatural elements in this movie too. Maybe many people like this film because of the fight sequences, but after seeing it I would say that the Japanese here and there get away with something that old films from other countries would not get away with. It did seem fairly exaggerated at times. On one occasion, the people in the audience were even laughing about how the two men were moving through the dirt there ready to fight each other. It did look absurd, not gonna lie. This was the only moment when people laughed during this film. There is no comedy to it at all otherwise. 100% drama. But even if I did not like the film a lot and I felt it got worse and worse the longer it went, I am glad films like this are shown at movie theaters nowadays. Audience reception was strong too. I still say skip the watch.",

First for the films of Akira Kurosawa, but later also for Japenese films in general.The film is about the murder on a samurai and the rape of his wife. During the film four different versions of this crime are presented.The theme of the movie is the existence of an objective truth and the question if this truth can be known with certainty. This is a theme \"Rashomon\" shares with other films, but is worked out a little bit differently in every film.In for example Twelve angry men\" (1957, Sidney Lumet) there is an objective truth but you can't know it for certain, and so the accused deserves the benefit of the doubt. In \"Letter from an unknown woman\" (1948, Max Ophuls) on the other hand the man and the woman experience their relationship in a radical different way and there is no such thing as an objective truth, only two subjective truths.The philosophical stance of \"Rashomon\" is somewhere in between \"Twelve angry men\" and \"Letter from an unknown woman\". It is worth mentioning that the cinematography of \"Rashomon\" supports its theme. In some scenes it is really hard to see what is happening. So there are not only four versions of a crime, it is all so hard to tell what each version exactly stands for.",

            "content": "Rash\u014dmon was probably the first genuine masterpiece that the master Akira Kurosawa made in his career. I had watched it for the first time about 4 or 5 years ago. My eyes weren't as polished and my mind wasn't as perceptive back then as it is now from a cinematic standpoint. So when I watched it back then, I remember being impressed by the whole concept of the same incident being narrated by people in completely different manners in an attempt to manipulate others. But I had certainly not grasped everything else that enriches this absolutely masterful piece of work. Now on my second viewing, I noticed the multiple layers, the themes, and the meaning behind the film.The film as I have mentioned before deals with different versions of the same incident. The film starts out with a woodcutter and a priest sitting beneath the Rash\u014dmon city gate to stay away from the heavy rainfall. Suddenly a stranger comes along and becomes suspicious of these two quiet men. Then the woodcutter and the priest decide to tell him what has made them so very depressed and the film's main plot proceeds. The main story is about a murder that takes place. The persons involved in the murder come back to get interrogated about it. Each of them narrate the incident differently. Interestingly we never see the interrogator and hence it seems as if the characters are answering questions and narrating the incident directly to the viewer. This was a thematic break of the 4th wall. Each version paints a good and desired impression of the narrator in the viewer's mind, but a neutral account of the incident might make the viewer question the morality of every character involved. One of the main aspects of this film that is so impressive is the cinematography. The camera effortlessly follows the characters while they walk through the forest in the most serene way possible. Kurosawa succeeds in conveying so much with the most subtle things. The shadow of the leaves fluttering gently on the face of Mifune, the sun desperately trying to make its way through the bushy trees, but failing to do so signifying the truth not being allowed to come to the forefront by the characters, the half damaged city gate, the relentless rain signifying the relentless nature of disasters and calamities,etc.The film is much more endearing and important from a broader perspective. One has to consider the fact that Rash\u014dmon got released in 1950, so just a few years after the devastating World War II. After the disastrous consequences of that war, Japan and the Japanese society was going through an indefinite spell of misery and hopelessness. This film deals with that hopelessness in the most humanist manner possible. Rash\u014dmon really is about existentialism beneath the seemingly simple outer surface. The film deals with the question-whether we should lose all hope and faith in humanity or not after considering and even witnessing all the heinous crimes and immoral deeds that human beings are capable of. The priest and the woodcutter seriously consider losing faith in the human soul after listening to the incident of the murder and everything that followed with the interrogations. But even in the midst of this hopelessness, Kurosawa manages to end the film in the most heart-wrenching and optimistic manner to give hope and a reason to start believing again to not only the Japanese people, but also to the viewers from the rest of the world. Rash\u014dmon is just an essential, transcendental film in the history of cinema that needs to be watched by everyone who is interested in film as an art form.",

From critics saying that it deals with the trauma Japan went through during and after WW2 to it being a work constructed to please ' Western ' audiences. I think both observations partly true, but these critics should be wary of such statements as most of them do not know enough about Japanese life and culture. I hold Japanese film, art and writing in high esteem but to pretend to ' understand ' is futile. But what I do understand is that ' Rashomon ' has greatness. What I see on the screen is a ruined temple which bears the name of the title, and a small group of people talking of a crime in a forest nearby. A woman accompanied by her husband has been assaulted by a bandit, and her husband tied up to watch. Despite the horror of the story the film is conveyed with such visual beauty that I watched it more than the ' story,' interpreted by the people at the temple, and my constant joy was to return to the images of the forest and the multiple actions that took place there. Any one of them could be true, even the supernatural one of the dead husband's perspective. The only real fact is that he does die, but how we will never know, as we will never know what really happens in any situation seen from various viewpoints. Like looking at a Cubist painting I know the ' subject ' is there but so broken up that all I can see is that the separate parts on the canvas are the real painting, and no understanding of the ' real ' subject is possible. What I do see in arguably Kurosawa's greatest film are parts which add up to a questionable reality and the seeing of it visually ( for that is the essence of film ) is all. Machiko Kyo, a great actor playing the woman is superb and her entrance on a horse, veiled in white with a white hat is a splendour of image in itself. A whole image, complete in itself but broken up by the actions of the bandit and by these multiply interpreted actions becomes the broken up ( but still whole ) world of the film in itself and for itself. She is the heart of the film, as still as the temple but ' destroyed, ' but I the viewer of this work of art has to give it meaning. A Modernist masterpiece.",

Perhaps a quibble, but I *hated* the music. The endless loop of what sounded like variations on Bolero for the first half of the movie -- augh! In general, I found it very choreographed; at times, it was more like watching a ballet. It was very overwrought and distracting.2. The acting. Horribly overdone on the part of Toshiro Mifune; at times he seemed to have taken classes at the Daffy Duck School of Acting. He was not the only one overacting, either, just the most prominent.3. The ending. We get through this very subtle and ambiguous movie, where, even at the end, we have no clue which of the four versions (or which mix of the four versions!) of the story actually happened, and Kurosawa absolutely clubs us silly with the theme of redemption. I wanted the movie to end when the woodcutter said, \"On days like this, we have cause to be suspicious\" (or something similar). I don't know what possessed Kurosawa to bugger the ending like he did, but, in my version, it'd be about two minutes shorter.That said, there's a lot to like about the movie. I love how Kurosawa leads you into a false smugness at the end when it's revealed that the woodcutter stole the dagger. \"Ah hah!\" I thought; \"Clearly, the dead samurai was telling the truth!\" I was impressed with my sleuthing, my quick recall of the medium relating that he felt someone removing the dagger. Then it occurred to me that, in every story, the dagger was left behind. Probably my favorite part was when I had to go back and watch the end of all of the stories to ensure that the dagger was still there, either in the samurai or in the ground.Good movie, but in desperate need of a dose of subtlety.",

Many of his movies, including this one, are considered some of the greatest films of all time. For me, this is my very first Akira Kurosawa film. I have yet to see \"Seven Samurai\", or \"Ran\", or \"Yojimbo\". But when I sat down to watch \"Roshomon\", I knew right from the starting credits that Kurosawa was going to live up to his reputation. And the film got more powerful, unique, and creative as the running time went on.\"Roshomon\" is, like many other foreign film masterpieces, left intact in its original language. All of the cast members speak their native Japanese language and we are only able to interpret their dialogue through the subtitles. But this is the way it should be. Foreign films should be preserved like this, otherwise, they can become unintentionally comical with bad dubbing and bad lip synchronization. Even though most of us can't understand Japanese, it suits the film better and makes it more serious and authentistic.The cast of \"Roshomon\" is full of very talented and famous Japanese actors. There is the legendary Toshiro Mifune, who apparently did numerous films with Akira Kurosawa. He was very realistic and chilling as the leading character, a bandit and a womanizer. We also have Takashi Shimura, remembered from \"Seven Samurai\" and the popular Japanese monster film \"Gojira\". One of Kurosawa's neat tricks with the screenplay was to limit the number of characters whose names were revealed in the story. Many of them are credited simply by their apparent occupation. Examples are The Priest and The Woodcutter. It reminds me very much of the classic American film \"12 Angry Men\", in which many principal characters never had a name revealed. Yet, let me remind everybody that \"Roshomon\" was seven years before \"12 Angry Men\". I don't know if Kurosawa inspired this trait for the film or the play upon which it was based, but whatever the case, it was a brilliant idea.Kurosawa had a natural talent for creating innovating and suspenseful sequences and when needed, exploding with high-tension action and then having long moments of symbolism and silence in between. That's how I would describe the basic flow, you could say, of this film. Suspense, action, and then the aftereffects which often result in long moments of silence and consequences that try the morals of our characters. In this film, one does not just sin in any kind of way and then just go off and deal with their affairs without thinking about what they have done and whether it could have been avoided or done a different way. And I appreciate films that utilize this trait of creating an allegorical message for a frailty that human beings tend to have.\"Roshomon\" is one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema history. Even know, almost sixty years since it was created, it still holds out as a powerful and popular film. It has already got me, as a cinema goer, instantly interested in seeing more Akira Kurosawa movies, for this example of his brilliant work has already proved to me at least that his talents were even better than his reputation.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's classic Rashomon is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It is often cited as the reason that the Academy Awards started a foreign film category. Incidentally, it did win an Honorary Award from the Academy for Best Foreign Film. More than a film, Rashomon is more of a meditation on this dishonest nature of man. As we listen to four different testimonies of the same heinous crime, we see that people will lie to save themselves, no matter what the circumstances. The film begins with a priest and a wood cutter speaking within a temple during a terrible rain. Their conversation is a mystery until another man arrives, and begins to ask questions about their subject matter. It is revealed that the men have just returned from court, where they gave their testimonies in a trial against a vicious bandit known as Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune in all of his manic, savage mastery). The bandit tells his side of the story. The woman that he most-likely raped follows with her version of the truth. Then, the story takes an odd twist toward the macabre as a medium is called in to channel the spirit of the woman's murdered husband, who provides an all-together different story. Needless to say, the case is hopeless. The priest and wood cutter find themselves drowning in their own self-pity because of the horrendous state of the world. The priest lamenting that he has lost his faith in man. The other man at the temple laughs it all off, having seen too much tragedy in his lifetime to weep over the injustice which has just taken place. The film does end on a relatively upbeat tone, however. The wood cutter is given a chance to take control of life, a reminder that his life is his own, and that his decisions are still his own, even in the face of the insurmountable odds against anyone struggling to survive in his troubled times. To me, the three men at the temple are the forces of good, evil, and humanity, which is trapped in the middle. The priest is a holy man seeking virtue in a time when virtue was essentially a sign of weakness. The man who approached the wood cutter and the priest embodies the corrupted soul of man, embittered by the harsh cruelties of reality. The wood cutter, neither virtuous nor evil, is confused, and has resigned to be neutral, no matter how much it may hurt him. However, out of the midst of all of this chaos, rain, murder, rape, and perjury, hope is found, and I believe that the wood cutter takes his first step toward realizing his dream by attempting to become that which he prays for - a man of decency.This film is extraordinarily powerful. The contrast of the endless downpour at the temple and the beautiful, sun-soaked forest is magnificent, as is the cinematography on the whole. The writing and directing is wonderful, and the performances of the actors and actresses, while arguably over-the-top (note that this was the acting style being used at the time), are more powerful than anything else. Toshiro Mifune's performance was particularly striking as the remorseless bandit. Emotionally poignant performances from Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, among others create a stirring ensemble which Kurosawa masterfully uses to weave this ancient tale (the film was based on a story called \"In the Grove\") into a cinematic masterpiece that brought him international recognition.I would recommend this film to anyone due to the fact that I believe it to be a work of infinite cinematic value and of great philosophical significance. This is an absolute must-see!",

Watching it now it's easy to see why it took the world by storm and ignited an enduring interest in Japanese film. Yes it's beautifully shot, yes it's got some intriguing symbolism and composition, yes Toshiro Mifune is utterly spellbinding - but the heart of it for me is the purity of that central conceit. It's a story about how untrustworthy stories are. It unfurls like a flower, becoming gradually more engrossing and existential. Yet it's so straightforward that it manages to get away with it's layered narratives. More than that it still has something vital to say about human nature and our perception of ourselves. We are the stars of own narratives and how we portray our motivations to other people can change their understanding of the world. Breathtaking.",

            "content": "Somewhat curiously, Japanese critics were not enthusiastic about RASHOMON when it was released in 1950 Japan. Today, however, RASHOMON is generally considered to be the film that introduced both master director Akira Kurosawa and Japanese cinema to the west; it is also often cited as the film that prompted The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to create an award for Best Foreign Language film. It is widely regarded as a masterwork of world cinema.Set in 12th Century Japan, the film's premise is at once both very simple and very complex. A man is found dead in a forest, and several people are brought forward to give testimony in the matter. In some respects their accounts agree--but in numerous others, some obvious and some very subtle, their stories differ. As each character gives his or her version of events, the various differences pile higher and higher, leaving the viewer to wonder at the motivations involved.Has each person simply interpreted the same facts in different ways? Do they deliberately lie in order to protect themselves? Are the differences in their stories deliberate or subconscious? The film offers no easy answers. Some have criticized the film for seeming to state that there is no such thing as ultimate truth, but RASHOMON is more complex than this: it is essentially a meditation on our inability, be it deliberate or unintentional, to reach more than an approximation of ultimate truth due to the very nature of humanity itself.Much has been written about the look of the film, which is indeed memorable. Filmed by Kazuo Miyagawa, it presents the forest as a living, breathing entity; the images are powerful, the editing remarkable. No less so are the performances, which require the various actors to shift in behavior as each person involved gives their own account of the event; this is particularly true of Toshiro Mifune, a frequent performer in Kurosawa films, and actress Machiko Ky\u001a. But whether lead or supporting player, all performances are equally astonishing.The film has been extremely, extremely influential over the years, and as such it no longer has quite the same \"shock of the new\" that it had for audiences of the 1950s; nonetheless, this is director Kurosawa working very close to the height of his power, and while he would create other films that equaled and bested RASHOMON, it remains among his masterworks. The Criterion edition is quite fine, offering a near-pristine print with your choice of subtitles or dubbing (the former is recommended) and several memorable extras. Strongly recommended for fans of world cinema.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Although I've seen plenty of Japanese movies in the past, this is the first Akira Kurosawa movie I've ever seen.The first thing that stands out when watching the movie is the direction and cinematography which looks well ahead of its time, like the shots where the camera occasionally points towards the sun. As the story begins to unfold, the next obvious thing we notice is the innovative premise of the film, now known in academic circles as the \"Rashomon effect\", where several witnesses give different interpretations of what happened at a scene.The best performance in the movie was definitely from Toshiro Mifune in one of his first major roles. Whether he was over-the-top earlier on or more subtle and realistic later on, his performance was incredibly versatile.After I finished watching the film, I was initially a bit disappointed that the film didn't spoon-feed us with a final answer, but I've realized that this is exactly what makes it such a thought-provoking movie. Now I'm really looking forward to watching Kurosawa's other most famous movie, The Seven Samurai.8/10",

The really old films from this second group always receive overly generous grades on IMDb because they are too obscure to be watched by anybody but film students, whose opinion is clouded by their focus on history and technique.Case in point - \"Rashomon\". Even though the underlying idea is indeed timeless, this Kurosawa classic is clearly in the second group. It's over-the-top acting, rudimentary dialogue, static scenery, sexist characters and tedious pacing make it feel VERY dated. However - the execution of the story is as genius as it is original, and I would recommend this movie to anybody who is interested in screen writing techniques.Compare this to \"Casablanca\", for example - a classic made around the same time. \"Casablanca\" is perfectly suited for modern viewers. \"Rashomon\" is not.",

At first glance, the film is exotic. Kurosawa's films are like that. However, the exotic in this case is reflected in the simple set design, the beauty of picture and sound, emotional acting appearance and excellent close-ups. The essence lies in the fact that the audience is not used to this kind of movies. I am one of those who are enthusiastic.Horrible event narrated with four different point of view, none of which may not be true. Although the point of view of similar and tragic at the same time are thematically different. This is not about rationalization but the understanding of human nature. Kurosawa took the burden to the public to provide answers to these questions and in this down to the darkest depths of the human soul.Why do people lie to themselves and everyone else? I think that any suggestion or an individual assessment of the film does not give much room for optimism. The beginning of the film we just all talk. Three wandering the ruined house hidden from the rain. The country is devastated, people disappointed and full of mistrust.It is interesting that a film, which is so focused on human nature acts like a fairytale, tense and wild at the same time.

It frightens the priest as it should frighten us what we discern about the nature of man.The beginning focuses on a priest and a woodcutter in shock after having heard three separate versions of the same event in a trial of sorts. The priest is a little repetitive about how much of a tragedy these stories are, but it is still a powerful dialogue with a close- up on the priest.The story varies from person to person, but what is in all four of the versions presented (the woodcutter tells what he saw towards the conclusion of the film) is the rape of the wife of a samurai by a bandit, and the murder of the samurai. Things get more tense and dramatic as we switch from story to story, each containing a different version of how the samurai died and a different motive each time. We are constantly asking whether one or more of the witnesses lied to protect the others, or if they are justifying their actions - either way, we get a depressing view of human nature; all three are portrayed as terrible people within the film.What is fairly necessary so that the film is not too pessimistic is the conclusion with the woodcutter making a decision to take care of an abandoned baby which restores the priest's faith in humanity. Like Birdman, I would have liked if this film ended just a few minutes earlier, but it is still powerful at the close of the film.",

The story then becomes a series of four accounts of the events of that day. Each of the participants, including the murdered man gets to describe what took place. It is a story about the sorry state of humanity, but it is more about the Japanese culture. What takes place is hard for a Westerner to really comprehend. Given those circumstances, death, rather than shame, becomes a central issue in the film. Once the woman is raped, her status as a human being is diminished tremendously. She becomes the baggage of the man who wants her. It is totally captivating to see each of the figures tell his or her story. This technique has been used in many TV shows and movies (I remember a show called Petrocelli, years ago where it was the lifeblood of the show), but nowhere is it done better.

            "content": "Rashomon (1950) has all of the charm and atmosphere of an Akira Kurosawa production. However the subject he explores and the tale he tells to us viewers this time round is much more unsettling and much less lighthearted than many of his mainstream movies.I first bought Rashomon on DVD a few years ago as I had just recently became a big Kurosawa fan after having watched several of his most influential works including Ikiru (1952), The Hidden Fortress (1958) and not to mention Seven Samurai (1954). All of which had ranked well among my favourite films of all time. So I thus had to check out more. And this was recommend to me and being a fan of Murder Mysteries the plot's summary excited me.Set in 17th century Japan, Rashomon tells the dark tale of a vicious confrontation between a ruthless bandit (Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune), a wealthy samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his beautiful wife (Machiko Kyo) during which the husband is killed and his body discovered by a local woodcutter (Another regular Takashi Shimura).However upon going to trial all four testifier's, including the bandit, the wife, the dead man (speaks through a local medium) and the woodcutter each give four completely different accounts of what actually happened that fateful day and which make no connection whatsoever with the last.Who is telling the truth? Is only one of them being honest? Are they all lying in order to present themselves in a good light? Or are they all lying to deliberately cover something up? Are they merely giving their own accounts of what happened through there own eyes and from there own points of view? Could Woodcutter's account as the only commoner and passer by on the scene truly be the genuine Revelation of what happened that afternoon? Or is he too holding back on something in order to keep the REAL TRUTH from the audience? All the joys of a \"who done it\" only much more thought provoking and far more deep in the long term sense. Though a black and white film that does not prevent the camera from creating many colourful and mystifying shots aided by the use of light. The Japanese landscapes are again beautiful and the music haunting thus delivering a peaceful setting to this overall tragic tale and making this an unforgettable movie experience.The nearest the 20th century got to Shakespere. Rashomon is without doubt ranked among my twenty movies list and is definitely in my opinion one of the top ten movies of all time in terms of being well made.A must see classic. 9/10 stars.",

He really plays with you -- push pull.The scene that stabbed me most was when the wife told her husband she had never loved him, that she had just pretended to, and she had hoped for someone like the bandit to rescue her whom she planned to run off with. She would not mind at all if the bandit killed her husband. This echoed a melodramatic scene from my own life that knocked me for a loop for decades, so it really punched.You hear the story via the bandit, the wife, the husband's ghost and the woodcutter.

The movie shows four different versions of the same gruesome event of raping of a woman and afterwards killing of her husband. The versions are told first by the dacoit, then the woman who is raped, then by the spirit of dead husband and finally by a wood-cutter who is the sole witness. All stories are different, and whose story is true remains a question. The movie raises moral and ethical questions about human behavior and nature. The end of the movie does not show which story is the one that really happened.Apart from such an interesting story, it is the treatment given by Akira that is magnificent. The picturesque shots of the forests are mind blowing; I will mention a few \u0096the beginning shot of the wood-cutter walking through the forest, the other shot of the sun rays coming down in the forest with the horse standing and the woman sitting besides, and the rain shot of the temple ruins where the priests and commoner discuss the event is classic in scale. The characterization is perfect \u0096 the nuances of different characters, the changing emotions and opening of layers of their thoughts with each story are brilliant.There are in total just eight characters in the movie. All the characters have acted well. But Tajomaru's character as wild dacoit is raw and Toshiro Mifune has really brought that mean and gruesome character to life \u0096 as all time greats to remember in world cinema.Akira shows that with a simple story, with only a few characters, one can make a gripping story if one knows the medium and the presentation. The scripting is excellent and the audiences are left in eager curiosity of what would happen with each passing moment.Last point about the music score \u0096 it is outstandingly tuned with the proceeding.

Basically at the former gatehouse called Rash\u00f4mon a heavy rainfall is happening, and taking refuge from it are a Priest (Minoru Chiaki), a Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a Commoner (Kichijir\u00f4 Ueda), the priest and the woodcutter recall the story of a samurai murdered in a forest grove, the woodcutter discovered the body three days earlier. The film flashes back to the murder trial, when the priest and woodcutter were summoned to testify, the priest ran into the samurai Takehiro Kanazawa (Masayuki Mori) and his wife Masako (Machiko Ky\u00f4) the same day before the murder occurred going through the forest, three other people who are supposedly the only direct witnesses testified as well, notorious bandit Taj\u00f4maru (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself testifying through a Medium (Noriko Honma). The three of them tell structured stories about how Taj\u00f4maru, who claims he did indeed rape the wife and murder the victim, but these stories contradict each other as well, with the way the motivations and killing happened. At Rash\u00f4mon the woodcutter reveals that following the trials he actually knows more than he was letting on, this brings his own actions into question, but another discovery and the actions from it bring the woodcutter's own humanity or lack of into focus, a baby was left in a basket near the scene of the crime and the woodcutter stole the murder weapon, the knife, after finding the body, he wanted to care for the child himself, the priest understands his point of view. Also starring Daisuke Kat\u00f4 as Policeman. The direction by Kurosawa is stylised very well, the acting by all the cast members, especially Mifune as the stressed bandit is great, and the editing techniques for flashbacks and plot are for the experimentation with what is true and what we think very clever, all combined makes an atmospheric and intriguing drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it won the Honorary Award voted by the Board of Governors as the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

I think that is beautiful, and makes this film one of the first -- if not the very first -- existential films.I love the killer, with his physical madness, kicking and shouting.

A known bandit has been caught and blamed for the crime, he recognizes he did it but, in the flashbacks we see, he differs in the details from the wife of the samurai and from a medium channeling the deceased. One of the persons in the temple, claiming to have been a witness of the deed, tells a fourth version of the story. Who is telling the truth? If there is indeed something we can call the truth.This Akira Kurosawa movie from 1950 was a breakthrough film not just for the great master but for Japanese cinema abroad. Before Rashomon, almost no Japanese movies had been shown outside Japan. It is a great film, that 65 years after it was made, has stood the test of time.It is a very stylized movie, full of non naturalistic, over the top performances (seemingly influenced by the Japanese theatrical traditions of Kabuki and Noh), especially by Toshiro Mifune as the bandit, and the beautiful Machiko Kyo's as the Samurai's wife. Also with Masayuki Mori as the Samurai and Takashi Shimura.",

His films should be watched over and over again, their inner depth and cinematic mastery are breathtaking. What is strange about Rashomon is that it was taken among western viewers as a film depicting the inability of memory to capture reality, somewhat like Antonioni's Blow-Up. But, watching the film, that is not what is depicted. What we get to see are three characters, each telling his or her version of a crime that was committed, each blaming himself or herself for an act of murder. The bandit says he has killed a man after raping his wife. The wife says she has killed a man, her husband, after being raped by the bandit. The dead man himself, through a possessed shaman, says he has killed himself, after watching his wife being raped. It's hard to believe they would have doubts about something like an act of murder or suicide and their complicity in it. It is obvious that at least two of them are lying (and not 'simply' remembering differently what has happened). Isn't it peculiar that the characters fake their guilt and not their innocence? I believe Kurosawa tries to tell us about the way people make up their own personal blame in order to get respect, the way they tend to crave self-sacrifice. This critique is then taken even further, once the witness tells his own version of the story, and the monk looses faith in humanity. Kurosawa has dealt with similar themes in some of his other movies. These issues, I feel, are much more complex than what is usually perceived as the film's 'existentialist' theme, and might also hint at what has alienated Kurosawa's art from Japanese audiences.Perhaps, ironically, the real 'Rashomon Effect' could only be found in western audiences' perceptions and interpretations of the film.",

The style of the storytelling, with all the flashbacks and restructured scenes, is really an essential part of the tale itself (based on a story by Akutagawa Ryunosuke, taken from his Rashomon collection) but Kurosawa can be credited with bringing a good few new ideas and crazy tricks to the cinema with this monster hit classic.

            "content": "Boasting a rich and greatly impacting heir of Buddhist ideals as significant to this day as they were sixty years ago, Rashomon stands alone as one of the great classics of film history. This Japanese masterpiece carefully sculpts the stories of a samurai and his wife's encounter with a bandit within in a small grove. Rashomon skillfully bounces back and forth between the incidents as told by all parties involved. One of the most striking features of this film is the way in which Akira Kurosawa avoids ever establishing a clear main character in the film. This is done to truly raise the more earthly aspects of the film such as nature and the society as a whole. This practice is further implemented through the cinematography of Rashomon as the camera chooses to frame long and distant shots most of the time to convey the importance of the environment opposed to the characters individually.Kurosawa's cast is all guilty of overacting their parts throughout the film but it comes across as completely acceptable given the context of the film. Toshiro Mifune, in his role as the bandit, is especially hard to watch throughout his animated performance of his character. Mifune plays the part as a cartoon which gives into his inhuman nature as an evil antagonist to the samurai and his wife. Rashomon backtracks over itself many times in order to tell the story as different characters had seen it happen. Although this practice typically will slow down the narrative in a film, within the context of this story it truly helps to push the plot forward due to clever editing decisions.Rashomon is a remarkably beautiful film to watch because of its well crafted directing, its wholesome Japanese themes, and the one-of-a-kind cinematography used throughout. The movie is rich with the present culture of 1950's Japan and it is a blessing to see everything move so freely together as each scene blends into one another in the passing of this film. Rashomon is beyond an ordinary film, this is an experience and an experience that should be watched by all.",

Who should be trusted? Who's telling the truth?If you're expecting a linear story with no ambiguity, you're watching the wrong movie: in this masterpiece, Akira Kurosawa doesn't want to find out the truth, he wants to tell a story about life, mankind and its future (one of the characters is a monk who's beginning to lose faith in men), and he does it beautifully, moving from one location to another (the abandoned monastery where three people try to figure out what \"truth\" means, the square where the trial is held, and the forest where the crime takes place) and showing conflicted, dishonest, but human, people, played by wonderful actors (Kurosawa-regular Mifune is the standout as the ambiguous thief). It's a world ruled by doubt, fear and lies, although there still can be hope that mankind will improve someday.For those who would like to get acquainted with Kurosawa's enchanting world, Rashomon is an excellent start: I've only seen it once myself but it's already in my personal TOP 50.

While I'm told the framing device was padding to bring it up to 90 minutes, I found the ending perfect anyway - I still think version # 4, with its takedown of chivalry-and-honor romanticism, is Kurosawa's own reading (correct me if I'm wrong), but the ending serves as an announcement that even he can't be trusted, and that this message shouldn't be mistaken for nihilism. What an economical production, and yet there's just enough judicious application of style - I especially like the 'you-be-the-judge' framing in the trial scenes and the dazzling camera movement as the key witness walks through the woods in the opening scenes.

Credit also goes to Kazuo Miyagawa's photography, made of strong contrasts of black and white that keep entangling and overlapping to suggest the ambiguity of the story.The plot is taken from Akutagawa's famous short story \"In a Grove\", and shows how facts can be reconstructed in dramatically different ways depending on the perspective of the eyewitnesses. Kurosawa adds his own ending and moral conclusion to break free from the complete distrust in humanity suggested by Akutagawa's original tale: despite the lies of history and the fallacies of human nature, we have to keep on living, be charitable, and do the best we can. In a way, it almost feels like a modern fable with human characters instead of animals.Not the most entertaining thing to watch nowadays, but still a visually mesmerizing and technically inspiring film.",

            "content": "Leave it to the Criterion Collection to give Akira Kurosawa's seminal 1950 masterpiece its due in this superb 2002 DVD package. First, renowned Japanese film scholar Donald Richie provides a terrifically insightful commentary as he does on classics of other Japanese genres, Yasujiro Ozu's family drama, \"Early Summer\" (1951), and K\u00f4 Ichiwara's sun-tribe melodrama, \"Crazed Fruit\" (1956). Second, there is a seventeen-minute excerpt about the film from a feature-length documentary about its masterful cinematographer, \"World of Kazuo Miyagawa\", who did similarly amazing work on Kenji Mizugochi's \"Ugetsu\" (1953) and Ozu's \"Floating Weeds\" (1959). Third, if you choose to buy rather than rent the DVD, there is a beautifully designed booklet with relevant excerpts from Kurosawa's autobiography and the two short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa from which Kurosawa and co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto based their screenplay. Add a brief testimonial introduction by Robert Altman, and this becomes one of the best of the Criterion Collection DVDs.Set in feudal 12th-century Japan, it is a far more intimate film than its vaunted reputation leads one to believe and quite brief at 88 minutes. Ostensibly a courtroom drama, the multi-layered story focuses on the rape of a woman and the murder of her husband in a forest grove. The events of the crimes are told from four different perspectives - a swaggering bandit named Taj\u00f4maru, a woodcutter who witnesses the crime, the wife and even the murdered husband by way of a medium. Each account unfolds in a distinct style - an extravagant samurai adventure according to Taj\u00f4maru, the wife's melodramatic recollection as a victim, a heroic martyr's tale from the dead husband. In a blessedly economical style, the contradictions in their accounts multiply as the story unfolds.The framing device is the woodcutter's own flashback of the incident as told to a commoner, but his version is far from the definitive one as he may have stolen a dagger from the crime scene. Kurosawa does such a brilliantly dexterous job in structuring the differing accounts that as the film progresses, it becomes less about seeking the truth and more about the power and inevitable conflicts arising from everyone's sense of ego. The only thing that becomes clear by the end is how individual perceptions shape reality and that the absolute truth is a myth. Miyagawa's expert camera-work is stellar in a way that raises the bar for subsequent cinema, especially the vivid facial close-ups of the main characters, the sharp angles of the sun-dappled forest scenes, and the dramatically ink-tinted raindrops.A sterling cast has been assembled with Kurosawa's muse, Toshiro Mifune, a feral presence as Taj\u00f4maru. Masayuki Mori and an especially vibrant Machiko Ky\u00f4, who later reunited in the ghostly \"Ugetsu\", lend particular distinction to the couple ensnared by the tragic situation, and the three legendary actors show impressive versatility in highlighting different aspects of their personalities in the various accounts. Takashi Shimura, who later starred in Kurosawa's poignant \"Ikuru\", is also superb as the woodcutter. Many filmmakers have since copied Kurosawa's then-daring narrative structure (for example, Martin Ritt's \"The Outrage\" and Edward Zwick's \"Courage Under Fire\"), but none comes close to capturing the pervasive sense of ambiguity that makes this movie retain its initial power.",

            "content": "Rashomon, directed by Akira Kurosawa, was his international breakthrough in 1950. The leading roles of it were played by Toshir\u00f4 Mifune and Takashi Shimura, both of whom worked with Kurosawa in his subsequent films. Rashomon is a great example of Japanese modernism which started in the 50's -- ten years later compared to the United States. Rashomon was made just before Japanese films arrived to Europe, and therefore is one of the most remembered Japanese classics. Kurosawa represented a complete different kind of Japanese cinema that Europeans had so admired -- Mizoguchi's lyricism. It is a matter of opinion who is better, but now days Kurosawa is much more well known -- which of course doesn't necessarily mean better. Rashomon is an extremely intriguing film about glory and the loss of it.Three men go to a temple to avoid the rain. They start to discuss about a recent murder trial; a bandit raped a woman in front of her husband and then killed him. Each of them have their own visions of what happened in the trial and in the forest where the murder happened. In Rashomon we see the event from four different perspectives and each time with a different solution. There's even a perspective of the victim, who got killed, because Kurosawa had the brilliant idea to show his view on the murder, through an oracle. But there is no reason to assume that his view on the case would be any more truthful than the others'. Rashomon is a philosophical survey of people and the human nature. How everyone told the story differently, trying to make themselves look better. So who can you trust? Basically it's about truth and the subjectivity of it. As well known, Kurosawa often dealt with strong taboos of Japanese culture. The whole film happens around three men who discuss, quite emotionally, which is unusual for Japanese men -- and not just Japanese, it's an universal taboo. Another important theme of Rashomon is the glory of man. Is life worth living once you've lost your glory? Kurosawa shows the madness of this question brilliantly as the man looks his wife getting raped, insensitively and without compassion. Criticism for the contempt of women can also be seen in the film, as it can in the films made during the 1950's by Kenji Mizoguchi. The wife of the man, who got murdered, was only an object to the bandit as she was to her husband. After the woman betrayed her husband she was worthless. The man had lost his honor and nothing mattered to him anymore. The scene where the woman was protecting her husband from the bandit was extremely powerful. As you see the husband, tied up in the background, you can sense the apathy in his eyes. Once glory is lost there is no reason to live for him.The last scene of Rashomon is something I will never forget. When the men hear a baby crying. One walks away and the other offers to take care of it. Then we see him walking away with the baby which is both, a strong cultural taboo but also a sentimental culmination of Kurosawa's depiction of humanism and the human nature. In the end one can also sense some criticism for capitalism, individualism and the modern world. In the temple one of the men claim that in this world one can't trust anyone and survival is impossible without being selfish. But then the other man proves him wrong as he takes the baby, unselfishly, out of solidarity and compassion. Akira Kurosawa was openly a socialist but, to my mind, his films show that humanism was the greatest ideal of all for him. His films go far beyond political, historical and cultural limitations.Among the great themes of Rashomon, it is visually spellbinding. The poetic, silent-film-like, narrative is amazingly beautiful. The black-and-white cinematography gives a great expressionistic touch to the characters and the visual world; its tight grip of nature and fascination for the subjective truths of individuals. For its cinematography and narrative Rashomon is modernism, which can be seen in its way of showing humane emotions. The camera takes close-ups of tears and drops of sweat; showing us what the characters are feeling below the surface. Many have criticized the work of the actors as exaggeration and over-simplification, but in my opinion it's just perfect. It truly reminds one of theater and silent films, but it doesn't have the same exaggerating elements many silent films did; make-up and expressionistic gestures. I think Kurosawa had thought about the acting carefully, and directed his actors precisely, through which he achieved realism. Not the conventional realism of the outward appearance of reality, but of those things that contribute to this reality which one feels under the surface.",

A year later, it won the Oscar for the best foreign film category. In fact, Rashomon is often credited as the reason that the Academy created the category. It was also the film that catapulted master film-maker Akira Kurosawa to stardom. Such was the fate of Rashomon that it still bewilders many. But like fine wine, it gets better with age. Looking back, it dawned on many critics that this was an exemplary film, a masterpiece in its own right, and unequaled to this day.It runs at a modest 88 minutes, but it packs a lot in that time. Exploring themes such as Man's greed, selfishness, and lust, and the inability of Man to articulate the truth, and how obscure truth really is, Rashomon's story is so simply constructed, it becomes profoundly complex in nature. The film revolves around four key eyewitnesses to a heinous crime, all giving entirely different accounts of the event. Who is telling the truth? No one knows, not even Kurosawa himself. There's no clear solution at the end, but that's not what Rashomon is driving at. The film seeks viewers to understand the nature of Man's actions, and how sometimes the faith of Man himself is in doubt.The artistic direction by Kurosawa is flawless, using rain, sunlight, shades to evoke unique settings, differentiating past from present. The cast gives mesmerizing displays, vicious yet sympathetic at times, especially Toshiro Mifune, and Machiko Kyo, whom are the star performers here. The use of clever flashbacks by Kurosawa, and the courthouse sequences in which we 'do not hear the judge speak' are pioneering film techniques. This experimental narrative by Kurosawa is the epitome of Japanese cinema, the embodiment of film art itself. An influential masterwork that is timelessly challenging, incredibly philosophical, and ultimately, highly rewarding.GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

This can be looked at as boring to some people and that can detract from the overall experience of the movie itself. The actors made the story very believable and worked with the scenery and natural settings very well. The whole unreliable narrator aspect to this movie made it very interesting because there are very few movies, even today, which don't give you a direct aspect of what has happened. A lot of the cinematic elements that are present in Rashomon are ones that have been taken for granted today and are sometimes hard to point out. From the set and on site locations to the actors and the story itself this film was very well made and is one of the more enjoyable foreign films around.The way the film was shot and how it progressed is not suitable for all audiences.

No matter how hard I try, the cultural gap between Kurosawa's creativity and my perception seems to be insurmountable.6/10",

It did have a lot of cool Kurosawa 'movement' effects, but I just didn't find the story very compelling. The divergent narratives were a neat trick, but I think I've been desensitized to it through seeing in pretty frequently in literature. Also, I hate rape as a plot device, and that's the center of the plot. Just not as well developed as his later movies IMO.",

            "content": "Rashomon = literally \"The City Gate\" or \"The Gate to the Ciy.\"Roger Ebert's review is very informative: http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/...205260301/1023This movie tells the story of a journey in medieval times by a Japanese samurai nobleman and his wife through a forest. They are attacked by a bandit and in the fight the nobleman is killed. There is a trial at which we hear the bandit's version and then the wife's. A Bhuddist medium summons the soul of the dead man and gives his version. Many events coincide (a fight, a death) but the meanings and implications in each version differ a great deal. Three men discuss the events and significance of the differences while they take shelter from a pouring rain under the gate to the city. One of these is a woodcutter; he not only observed the trial and tells his companions what was said but he, hidden in the woods, also actually saw the events and he tells his friends his version. Again we find the coinciding events but the differing meanings and implications. He'd not told anyone else what he'd seen or testified because he didn't want to get involved. He's very puzzled and disturbed as to why each version differs, what do these differences say about the nature of people?This is a powerful, beautiful movie which altered the linear style of movie narratives that had existed until then and opened new vistas, e.g., \"Crash,\" \"Hero\" and Eastwood's two \"Iwo Jimas\"s. When I first saw this movie 40 years ago, its slight misogynist flavor (women are manipulative) didn't register on me and probably didn't on most others in the 1950s-60s; our culture has probably shifted a great deal since then.But \"Rashomon\" has significance far beyond its contribution to movie making. I'll point to its influence on Family Therapy; an analogous effect is true for history or ANY field in which there can be points of view that differ with human motivations and alliances (say world history from the point of view of victors or vanquished, or various anthropologists accounts of living with particular tribes, etc.)\"The Rashomon Effect\" (a term used in family systems) refers to the quite different perceptions that even closely related individuals can have of the same event or person. E.g., in any family, say one with several children, no family member has quite the same view of any other family member. In a real sense, none of the children have quite the same mother or father and therefore must view them and each other differently. The first born child entered the family when its parents had a certain financial level and experiences. The second child enters when the parents have been changed by time and the experience of having a first child so they are not quite the same parents. If the parents invested in the first child particular aspirations or hopes, favoritism or disfavor, that must strongly color that child's view of them and any younger siblings, as well as a second child's view of each parent, the older sib, etc. These various views can differ greatly among all members of that family system. \"The Rashomon Effect\" identifies and emphasizes the existence of these differences.",

            "content": "Opening Japanese cinema to the world (particularly to the West) upon its release, Rashomon's enduring qualities is most evident in, along its title having been introduced into the English language (as in the Rashomon effect), its theme's strong resonance even after almost 60 years it was released. Narratively simple yet paradoxically complicated, Akira Kurosawa's widely hailed classic deftly examines the unknowable virtue of truth that even the oft-recited mantra \"To see is to believe\" loses its meaning when thwarted by mankind's ultimate predication to subjectivity and -- perhaps -- psychological egoism. Adapted from two Ryunosuke Akutagawa short stories, Kurosawa's saga concerns itself with an event that transpired in the woods as recounted in wildly differing perspectives three days later at a court trial by the three participants and one supposedly impartial witness as shown in revolutionary flashback sequences. The differing yet equally plausible testimonies are nonetheless bound by one unequivocal truth: a samurai (Masayuki Mori) died in the woods during an encounter with a bandit (Toshiro Mifune) who may or may not have raped the former's wife (Machiko Ky\u00f4) and who may or may not have killed the samurai in the process. The bandit claims the samurai's wife yielded willingly to his sexual advances and he killed the samurai in an ensuing duel; the wife swears she was raped and that his husband committed suicide using her dagger; while the samurai's ghost (speaking through a medium) recounts how his wife wanted to go with the bandit and have his husband killed. Compounding the issue is a woodcutter's testimony that radically differs in details from the previous three accounts that to piece together the details from each perspective into one coherent story is an exercise in futility. No matter, since Kurosawa's concern is less in presenting an objective account of what truly transpired than demonstrating the uncertainty of truth, a theme he and cinematographer Kazuo Myagawa often engage in here -- a murky perspective of the world signified by the torrential rain in the opening sequence, the avant-garde direct shot of the sun partially obscured by leaves, the dense forest where the main action takes place, and one character's continuous monologue that he \"does not understand\". Masterfully buried in ambiguity and anchored by strong performances, Rashomon isn't much about providing a solution as it is a proposal to come up with one's own conclusion based on one's partiality, a masterful artistic depiction of how truth can be flawed.",

            "content": "This is another one of those films that has had wide spread rave reviews about it. It is another classic in most 'all time films to see' lists and is directed by a man who is compared to Alfred Hitchcock. This is seen through the eyes of general movie buffs and some movie critics that I have researched. Through my eyes however it is another film that is no better than some of the films that we slate being made today. I just don't understand how some films keep their classic status when they are very basic and simple with no real excitement to them.We start here with a Woodcutter and Priest seeking dry shelter in an abandoned building known as Rashomon. They are joined by a Drifter who joins in on their conversation regarding the Woodcutter finding a dead body a few days prior. He tells the Drifter however that none of it makes any sense. We then flashback to the Woodcutter listening in on the stories of the three people involved in the murder. The bandit, the woman he raped and her husband he killed, told through the voice of a medium. Each gives their version of events to the listening jury and although each story translates that the bandit had sex with the woman and then taunted her husband they all end with themselves admitting that they killed the him, including himself suggesting he committed suicide. Nothing adds up until the Woodcutter fills us in on what he actually saw and not what he told us at the beginning.The story is full of hidden messages with most of them relaying to how people are perceived through the eyes of another. People see themselves as something extraordinary but others may see them as weak and feeble, this is in the case of the bandit. It is about perception. This shines well in the film with the acting spot on. Each acting differently depending on whose story they are acting in. It really helps to interact with the story.Lies are also a large theme of the film with the Woodcutter at the beginning stating that people are being deceitful and that this is what he doesn't understand but it turns out that in fact he could be the one being deceitful all along.There is a lot in this movie that has and will go on to influence others. Off the top of my head, Courage Under Fire is one as is Vantage Point but to watch them and then watch this you will think that those films were better that's why although this film isn't bad I don't understand how it is rated as a classic.Some of the camera work is bad with it sometimes struggling to keep up with the action. The fight scenes are poorly choreographed, if at all, and at times are laughable, playing on much longer than what they are needed and they also use poor swipe transitions to move from scene to scene. I know this film was made in a day when all this may have been up to date but it isn't know so why is it still raved so highly about. The story is intriguing but all intrigue slips away when no resolution is formed, I just finished watching it thinking what was the point. Some films work in that sense but when one repeats itself for ninety minutes and then doesn't tell you anything different to what you already knew at the beginning I'm afraid to say some will leave feeling frustrated and disappointed. I'm not completely against this film. Compared to some all time classics this is a better story but I just wonder that if this film was re-made today with better cameras, acting, locations and editing would it still get the same response and knowing some of the critics of today then no it wouldn't it would be slated for all the reasons this should have been but wasn't. Maybe it's something I am not seeing but Rashomon certainly doesn't deserve to be in the 'best films of all time' list.",

            "content": "In the Bible, Pilate asks, \"What is truth?\" and, as Roger Bacon puts it, \"would not stay for an answer.\" I felt a bit the same way after seeing this remarkable film by Japan's celebrated film maker, Akira Kurosawa. It is set in 12th century Japan, and while most viewers would say it examines the nature of truth and finds it slippery, I think it more properly examines the nature of the feudal Japanese society. We have as representatives of that society, a priest (Minuru Chiaki) and a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) sitting out a rain storm in an abandon temple named Rashomon. It might pass for a ruined Greek temple except that its pillars and roof are made of wood. The priest and the woodcutter declare that they just can't understand it. They shake their heads and stare at the ground. Along comes a commoner (Kichijiro Uedo), a cynical man who asks what it is that they cannot understand.They have witnessed an investigation into the death of a samurai, Takehiro (Masayuki Mori). He is in some ways the equivalent of a medieval knight. He has a horse and lady, Masako (Machiko Kyo). The accused is an infamous outlaw named Tajomaru (played brilliantly by Toshiro Mifune, who obviously had a lot of fun with the part). He tells his story. He admits to having his way with the lady, but lets the court know that she liked it so much that she began to embrace him while her husband was tied up watching. Afterwards he says that she insisted that they fight over her. Tajomaru obliges. He cuts the rope holding Takehiro and they sword fight. Tajomaru wins.Next the wife tells her story. It is different of course. This causes the court to get a medium (Fumiko Honma) to tell the story from the point of view of the dead Takehiro. His story is different yet again. Finally the woodcutter reveals to the priest and the commoner that he saw the whole thing, and he then gives his version, again different of course.The commoner has some terrifically cynical lines. Here are three: \"It's human to lie. Most of the time we can't even be honest with ourselves.\" (To the priest:) \"Not another sermon! I don't mind a lie if it's interesting.\" \"Man just wants to forget the bad stuff, and believe in the made-up good stuff. It's easier that way.\" He speaks for the natural or animalistic man.His counterpoint, the priest, opines, \"If men don't trust each other, this earth might as well be hell.\" He speaks for moral man.Near the end of the film a baby is discovered crying. The woodcutter, who has five or six children of his own, takes the baby home.He represents civilized man.Masako represents the samurai's view of the nature of women when she is heard to say, \"A man has to make a woman his by his sword.\" What impressed me most about this film is the way Kurosawa was able to create an emotional atmosphere in each of the sittings. \"In the Grove\" we feel the trees and the light that sparkles through the leaves, and the disturbed serenity. At Rashomon in the rain we feel the men isolated and waiting, and in the sterile court scene we feel the severity of the tragedy.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa had been a filmmaker for almost a decade, since his 1943 debut film Sugata Sanshiro, and had some renown in his native Japan, when, in 1950, his film Rashomon rocketed him to international acclaim, including the Academy Award For Best Foreign Film, after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival brought the film and its director, and Japanese cinema, a Western audience. He deserved every plaudit he received for it, as well as every ticket sold, because it is an excellent film. Yes, there are some flaws- minor, such as the all too sunny (literally) ending, and some of the over the top hammy acting of Toshiro Mifune as the bandit Tajomaru, but given what was coming out of Hollywood at the time- mind-numbing musicals and grade B comedies- Kurosawa brought film-making style back to an earlier, simpler place, even as he many times over increased the bar for narrative complexity. Given that the film is not even an hour and a half long, the many interpretations of the multifarious actions of the characters are all the more impressive.The story is as familiar as it is simple. The central ostensible narrative concerns the rape of a woman (Machiko Kyo) and the murder of her Samurai husband (Masayuki Mori), both unnamed, in the 11th or 12th Century, in a wooded glen. The main suspect is the notorious bandit Tajomaru (Mifune), yet, the viewer cannot be certain, for never do we get a single unbiased version of the events that transpire. All three of the main characters tell self-serving versions of the story of how the lady was raped and the Samurai murdered\u0085.The film does stretch real reality, a bit, in that while it is well known that minor differences crop up in people's versions of singular events, such glaring inconsistencies as whether or not the Samurai died of a knife or sword wound are implausible, even given the film's setting. But, we allow for this dramatic license because the resonance of the tale's moral is so profound, as well the fact that Kurosawa does not cop out by giving us a 'real' authoritative version. That said, the end of the film, after the differing tales of the crime have been discussed thoroughly by the woodcutter, priest, and commoner, Kurosawa seems to stumble, as if he did not have a really good way to end the film. The commoner hears a baby, who's been abandoned at the temple. He steals its blanket, and the priest and woodcutter try to stop him, claiming him evil. He responds by implying that the abandoning parents were evil, and that the woodcutter is a liar, and possible killer. Off into the rain he goes, with his booty. The priest and woodcutter stand with the child until the rain breaks and the sun emerges. The woodcutter offers to take the babe as his own, that he has six children already, and another mouth will hardly matter. The priest feels that his optimism about life and mankind, so tested by the events he has seen, is reaffirmed by the woodcutter's generous offer, and the sun shines through the clouds. That such a terrifically subtle and ambiguous film ends so tritely (the emergent sun and abandoned and rescued baby are a simply awful and heavy-handed use of symbolism), and preachily, reminded me of the greatly disappointing ending that Fyodor Dostoevsky tacked on to Crime And Punishment, in his two terrible epilogues that hammer the book's themes into a reader's head, for he distrusted his own book's ability to convey those themes. The visual and musical aspects of the film's ends do much to mitigate the narrative drop to the floor Crime And Punishment bears, and Rashomon is still a great film, partly because its ending is not as bad as Crime And Punishment's, and partly because it reaches greater artistic heights, and dares more conventions, than Dostoevsky's novel. Still, there's no excuse for its veer from even greater heights, even if the last few minutes are not the heart of the film. While all the actors are wonderful, too much attention has been given to Toshiro Mifune's loony overacting (sometimes a necessity for the comic and divergent elements to emerge) as the bandit. Yes, this film made him a star, but the best performance in the film is by Masayuki Mori, already a major film and stage star in Japan. His is a far less showy role than Mifune's, but he conveys the slight differences all the versions the others tell with none of the easy visual pyrotechnics Mifune's almost boobish bandit is allowed. The raising of an eyebrow can mean the difference between truth and lie, and Mori is expert at walking the line between those ends. Machiko Kyo, as the wife, is the least notable performer.This motto of the film is not only true, but so powerfully true that the term Rashomon Effect was coined to signify the differing perceptions of individuals over singular events, and has been used in both psychological and jurisprudential venues. Ultimately, the film is about even more than the difficulties of interpreting reality and truth, but about how and why they swerve under the force of mere human egoism. Of course, the beauty of the film really lies in the fact that all of its viewers think it's about something other than what it may ultimately be about, which only recapitulates the internal characters' dilemmas, further binding us emotionally in their angst, making us feel what they live. In this empathy Kurosawa cinches and twists that bind, and we are turned from mere percipients into purveyors of an art and reality for our own selves that we, unfortunately, too rarely experience.",

It's also filled with fantastic performances throughout. While the premise seems as though it aims to explore the free-flowing nature of 'truth' and how nothing is absolute, instead it looks at the lies we tell in order to project a better version of ourselves and also offers a rather ham-fisted examination of the deceitful nature of human-kind. It's ultimately a hopeful film, though, with the downpour of rain coming to a close with one final act of kindness. It's really its unique take on camera-work and story structure that cements it as a piece of cinematic history. 7/10",

To him, it is a common incidence, nothing to gossip about. Across the world it is, even today, if you just replace the wife with any sort of prized/ costly belonging of the Owner, Husband in the case (sexism not intended).\nA young samurai is waylaid and tied by a notorious bandit . The wife is raped. The Samurai is killed, and a chance wood cutter finds the body. Within few days the bandit is arrested (per chance) and though not for this, he boasts of this incidence. The wife has taken a shelter in a temple, where she had been found, and corroborates the Bandit's assault on her. But the gap between the rape and Samurai's murder is foggy. The wood cutter hasn't seen anything, since when he arrived, except the copse and a few of the wife's attire (hat, etc) nothing living was there.\nThe husband was still alive while his wife was assaulted, and it seemed that there was no intention of killing, from the beginning, then Why ? And also Who killed him? This gap is filled by three people - the Bandit, the wife, and the murdered man (through a Medium) in entirely different manner.\nPractically each claiming the responsibility for the death - Fight -to- death (bandit), Stabbing (probably) to escape the abhorrence of the husband for the victim (wife), Suicide for honor (Samurai).\nAnd here the master class of psychology comes in - each person (not only the three protagonists), but also the Policeman who arrested the bandit and even the wood-cutter had lied or had something to hide. The reason of each lie/ suppression of the truth is quite believable - and even the dead man (who should never) lying.\nThe story is quite fast paced, and some incidents , I found to be a bit stretched (e.g. the fight between the bandit and Samurai, as narrated by witness, who too could be lying, but at least there was no motive for this one to). But then I realised that each segment of it had its place in the narrative to justify the lies, and was unavoidable.\nAnd even more interesting thing is... there was no actual or I would say significant lying by any - the coloring of the truth, as seen by each, to justify the action and reputation (even when dead), which made the stories entirely different. In one review the justification of the wife's lies were not understood, but even those were as required as by the others, each for their own self-sake.",

            "content": "A host of reviewers seem to think this movie is questioning the nature of truth or of reality. Perhaps the late director Robert Altman said it best in his introduction to the Criterion Collection DVD: \"....the proper conclusion (is) that all of it's true, and none of it's true.\" According to this school of thought, Kurosawa's film speaks powerfully to the postmodern consciousness--in effect telling us that there is no such thing as objective truth or objective reality.Nonsense. Many of these reviewers wonder at the inclusion of an \"epilogue\" in the movie--the bit with the baby at the very end--saying that it is unnecessary, but doesn't necessarily detract from the movie. It is no wonder: if the movie is trying to tell us that absolute truth does not exist or that reality is completely subjective, there is no need for this \"epilogue.\" If that is what the movie is about, there is, in fact, very little need for anything but the stories of the participants/eyewitnesses. But the movie cannot be telling us that objective truth does not exist or that the nature of reality is insuperably perspectival, for underlying the competing truth claims and the varying perspectives on reality are hard, undeniable facts: a man is dead, and his wife has been had by another man, and each of three people testified in court that he or she murdered the dead man. These are presented as facts that are undeniably true.The movie is ultimately about mankind: we are evil, so corrupted by our own selfishness that we can't tell the truth to or about ourselves. This was an important consideration for the humanist Kurosawa, for as his priest says, \"If people cannot trust each other, this world might as well be hell\"--in other words, why go on living if humanity is so incorrigible? The priest's problem is intended to be our own as we watch this movie: Throughout the movie, it is the priest's faith in mankind, his belief that life is worth living, that is tried--you never see him wondering if anything can be said to be \"true\" or ultimately \"real.\" He, like us, believes at first that the woodcutter may be a \"good man,\" or at least trustworthy, but the man is human, and is shown to be an unreliable storyteller.Funnily enough, it is the same woodcutter who, in this particular story, is supposed to give us a reason to continue living. We know that man is incorrigible, that he can't do anything but be deceitful (at least to some degree), even about himself. Can there thus be any reason to think that this world is any better than a hell? Yes, says Kurosawa. The hope for man is in the kind of compassionate action displayed by the woodcutter in adopting the abandoned baby. As long as man can show compassion to his fellows, man can consider living to be a worthwhile endeavor.",

            "content": "Rashomon is a groundbreaking film on many, many levels. Directed by Akira Kurosawa in 1950, it stars Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Machiko Ky\u014d, Masayuki Mori and Minoru Chiaki. The gist of the plot is that a man was murdered and his wife raped. Or maybe not. It depends on who's telling the story. The movie's title has become a word in itself meaning a situation in which events and motives are indeterminable, where truth and fact are subjective and uncertain.The film bears repeated watching; first, for the story, then for the potential meanings. For some reason, I'm reminded of \"The Canterbury Tales,\" which is a series of unconnected stories told by pilgrims on their way to visit a shrine. In Rashomon, the stories are about the same event although there are few connections between the versions told. We watch as conflicting tales about the same event unfold, leaving us unanswered questions instead of final resolution. It's possible to see the film as a discourse on the nature of truth, of reality even.Then there's the issue of good and evil: is it black and white or is there gray? Is the nature of humanity to have both good and evil in our beings? Throughout the movie, there is a conflict of how to judge our fellow humans. Each person tells the tale to suit his or her own ends; how can we trust any of them?I thought the camera was a character in the movie, perhaps because of the issue of objectivity. In the opening scenes, we are shown a woodcutter walking deep into a forest. The camera walks with him sometimes, showing him, but sometimes we see from the point of view of the camera, moving through the forest looking at the trees and skies. Somehow I felt I wasn't seeing the forest through the eyes of the woodcutter; I felt I was supposed to be there, looking for myself. So another potential is that there is no camera -- there is me watching the various scenes. This situation is repeated in the trial where the witnesses looked back at me answering questions as if I had put them to the characters. I was made a part of the problem of finding out what happened, since I elicited conflicting testimony and never resolved it. Among the quandaries of the movie is whether I can ever know the truth. It's much more personal than whether the characters ever know the truth -- It's whether _I_ ever know, can ever know.Another issue that Roman Polanski brings to the fore in \"Le Locataire\" (\"The Tenant\") is whether the camera lies. Our experience in movies is that when the camera is used by the director as the objective presenter of scenes, the camera does not lie. Conversely, when we're seeing events subjectively through the eyes of a character, we accept that the events we see may be distorted, even false. Kurosawa gives us no clue whether our objective view is objective at all. All the views seem to be true and mutually exclusive at the same time. We've watched movies all our lives, and we've come to accept the world within the four corners of the screen as 'true' for the purposes of the movie, but Kurosawa rips that convention to shreds and scatters it among the leaves of the forest. Kurosawa's camera has no claims to truth.",

The plot, an adaption of a Ryunosuke Akutagawa short story, concerns a murder trial where each of the people called to testify gives a different account. As the film opens, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki), sitting out a downpour, recount the trial for another man sheltering from the rain. The woodcutter had discovered the body of a murdered samurai (Masayuku Mori) in the forest. A captured brigand, Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune), is accused of doing the deed, and he gives one account at the trial. The samurai's wife (Machiko Kyo), who fled Tajomaru's attack and has been found hysterical in a nearby temple, provides another version of events to the judge. Then, in a twist that is still fresh today, the dead man himself gives his own, yet again different account of what happened through a spirit medium.Each of the different versions, depicted in flashbacks, serve to protect the honour of the particular person who is testifying. But what really happened? The story never makes that clear. In fact, it suggests that the real truth might be unrecoverable, because each of the people testifying isn't just trying to deceive others, they actually believe what they are saying.RASHOMON is rather short for one of Kurosawa's major films at 88 minutes, and shot with only the three locations of rainstorm, forest, and court, yet it is rich with detail. As each of the characters' accounts is shown in flashbacks, the same general events are shown in different ways. Furthermore, the personalities of the characters are shown to be different depending on who is testifying, which lets the actors really shine. Toshiro Mifune gives one of his classic buffo roles as the oafish, laughing bandit, but I really appreciated how Machiko Kyo was deftly able to present her character alternately as a fierce woman, a weak and fragile wife, and a cunning trickster.Besides the great acting, the film also impresses through its camera work, contributed by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa in the first of several collaborations with Kurosoawa. In spite of the limitations of black and white, the film offers an evocative nature setting, with the vivid effect of sun shining through the trees in the forest where the murder unfolds.As RASHOMON is rather on the short side for a Kurosawa masterpiece, this might serve as a good introduction to the director if you are reluctant to dedicate so much time to one of his big samurai epics.",

It's a quick, fast paced, sword fighting drama all about truth, and really if anyone tells it.Its basically allegorical for how we are as humans. The story and major crime is told by four different accounts, and even by the end of the film we don't even know what the truth is. But as Kurasawa has shown us, that's not the point. The point is to show that nobody really does anything for the good of others. We all really do everything for ourselves. Even as far fetched as it may seem, it's partially true I guess. We are always trying to improve our worth to how others really see us.There were a few parts that took me out of it. One being the whole idea that the husband can talk 'through another medium' as a way of telling his side of the story wasn't believable at all. It was a bit goofy for what was otherwise a very serious film. And even for how short it was its a film that is easily re-watchable.In my opinion, it's better than Yojimbo but not as good as the all time classic Seven Samurai. Great film nonetheless.8.2/10",

It encircles a wood-cutter, a priest and a common poor man and an exorcist. Thats all the cast is. The story is quite simple too. The Man travels with his wife through a jungle and a Bandit sees the wife and starts lusting for her. The bandit follows them and violates the Wife. The Husband is dead by the end of the event. Now, the story revolves around this death and the mystery surrounding it. Everyone has a different version for the event. The film revolves around all these four stories told by the Bandit, the Wife, The dead man (through an exorcist) and the wood-cutter. Every version, as told by each, is different. Every story is told and ends in supporting, or rather feeding the ego of the person telling the tale. Thats where the pshycology and the ego comes in. Amazing movie, highly recommended.",

The film's influence can be seen in many current day examples but hardly any of them come close to the response that 'Rashomon' draws. How reliable or unreliable is one's memory? 'Rashomon' tells it through a series of sequences...of the 'same' event. Director of photography Kazuo Miyagawa lets the camera play a part of its own. Each recounting of the story is shot from various angles adding new dimensions to the forest which also turns out to be an important character. There's also something distinct about the way the camera moves. Notice the difference in speed during the sequences in the forest. The actors (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune and Takashi Shimura among others) also deserve credit especially for their non-verbal acting (mainly facial expressions and other body language) as each of them tells their side of the story. The minimal score, sound design and art direction are solidly used.In the end, 'Rashomon' is about truth and that perhaps there is no such thing as an objective truth because everyone has their own interpretation derived from opinions, experience and external factors.",

It takes a Herculean effort of will not to shout at the screen, \"Get on with it!\" Still, good acting can often salvage the weakest story. Sadly, the acting in Rash\u00f4mon mostly consists of odd poses and staring. For the first five minutes, the lingering shots of overwrought facial expressions and contorted bodies can induce an occasional chuckle. After about twenty minutes, you'll wish you had access to a dagger, too. This tedium is punctuated by comically staged sword fights. I mean, how long can two expert swordsmen wrestle and parry without a decent thrust? Again, get on with it! Of the film's many annoyances, the worst are the idiotic laughing of the bandit and the screeching of the woman. With his constant ha-ha-has, you have to ask, is the bandit insane? Is he reckless? Is he a really, really bad actor? As for the woman\u0097well, if she's the vision of a goddess, thank god I'm an atheist! Once you hear the dulcet tones that come from this angel\u0097a scream slightly more annoying than the amplified sound of fingernails running down a chalkboard\u0097you wonder why a sword or a dagger wasn't immediately used on her.Sorry folks, the Chrysanthemum Emperor has no clothes.",

For its time, Rashomon was a powerful and new kind of foreign film and represented the best of Japanese cinema during the post-World War II/Hiroshima bombing period. It's a story of a single act of dishonor and crime, told in four varying accounts in testimony at a trial. A woodcutter and a priest tell the baffling tale to a commoner who is passing through the Rashomon Gate. A newly wed couple, of a high ranking social standing in feudal Japan, encounter a common highway robber who rapes the bride and kills the Samurai husband. Although the act of rape and murder has been committed and is not denied, the reasons as to why this happened at all are entirely different. Takehiro, the Samurai, witnesses his wife Masako being raped and feels shame, for in one version, she is clearly enjoying being ravished. Jealous, hurt and dishonored, he asks the robber Tajomaro kill him, which he does. Another eyewitness reports that the wife attempted to kill herself after being raped and after watching her husband die but she didn't have the courage to go through with it. In yet another account, Masako ordains the robber to kill her husband for his failure to protect her. The simplest explanation seems to be that the robber merely killed the husband and raped the wife, but there seems to be more going on. No one seems to be telling the truth, despite the fact that Masako and Tajomaro are both part of the triangle and know what really happened. Even the murdered Samurai speaks his testimony from beyond the grave using a medium. We don't know what really happens, and Kurosawa purposely leaves the whole thing as a big mystery, layered with ambiguity. This makes for a very engaging crime mystery, one that is well-written and full of a haunting sense of despair, frustration and bitterness. It's as if Kurosawa is telling us that life in general is a mystery and that evil is complex and even unknowable. Without being overly philosophical, this confusing story creates a huge impact over the audience, leaving them to decide for themselves which of the accounts is the best possibility. The music, the cinematography and the fine acting are each components of the beauty of this movie. Kurosawa can credit this one film, early in his career, as the film that launched his fame as director. It garnered the attention of the world to his movies. He became one of the most well-known Japanese directors of the 20th century and was wealthy enough to endorse his own brand of \"saki\" wine in commercials in which he appeared himself. Far from the superficial crime dramas of today, Rashomon stands as a classic example of a good crime movie.",

            "content": "Roshomon, by Kurosawa, is about a murder. The movie is based on two short stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke called \"In a Grove\" and \"Roshomon.\" There is a trial where the viewer is the judge. Four different people give their version of what happened in a murder. There is a bandit, a wood cutter, a wife and a woman medium who speaks as the dead husband. They all observed the murder, but they all have different stories. The Roshomon is a gate with different floors and levels where three men are discussing the murder and trial.This film was thought provoking because in court, there are usually at least two people who agree on what happened. In this case, each person presents different versions for different personal reasons. There are many unreliable narrators. They all lie. While some may say that dead men don't lie, I would say, well why can't they? The woodcutter doesn't tell the complete truth because he profits by selling one of the possible murder weapons. The bandit embellishes the story to make himself look tougher with sexual prowess. The wife calls on the appropriateness of the times and culture to protect herself. It would be a disgrace to show her shame in front of two men-one of them her husband. We really don't know what happened, but even the murdered husband could have lied via the medium to protect himself from embarrassment. I enjoyed this movie because it discusses motivations within the heart of man.The setting and atmosphere was wonderful. The play on light in the forest and grove was effective. The rain represented clearly the dark side of the sadness in life. Even the perspiration on the actors due to the actual temperature during filming worked in favor of the film. Two of the characters \"over acted.\" The bandit's laughing and the wife's dramatic crying was a little too much. However, when the wife abruptly stopped crying and became dead serious, she appeared almost mad. That portion of the film was well done.This film would most appeal to film study students who are interested in the technical aspects of film making and directing. It would also appeal to students studying the culture or country of Japan. Those who are interested in looking at human nature and watching films without the pat \"clear ending\" will like this as well. While this film was quite drawn out in some scenes, fortunately we have the fast forward button. I loved the emotion, tense scenes and the unique look at human nature. The significance of the film in view of reality, is pondering the question, \"can we ever really know what the truth is?\"",

The film is a classic study of the 'unreliable narrator' and is often used as an exemplum of the unreliability of perception and memory, and, in courtrooms, of witness accounts. Director and co-writer (with Shinobu Hashimoto) Akira Kurosawa never reveals what really happened in the forest - there is no objective view of the events - the audience only gets the four character view-points, which are inconsistent, either due to inaccurate memories, bias perceptions, and/or self-serving deception. Pride motivates the bandit, who wants to world to believe that he defeated the samurai in a fair duel between skilled swordsmen and that the women, who had ultimately accepted his sexual advances, chose him over her husband. Desiring to minimise the shame of having been dishonoured, the wife denies desiring the bandit and claims to have no memory of what happened to her husband, who had rejected her after she was attacked. The (dead) samurai accuses his wife of treachery and claims the honour of having committed suicide rather than bear the shame of her actions (this segments begs an intriguing metaphysical question: can a soul lie?). The wood cutter (the great character actor Takashi Shimura), ostensibly the most objective of the witness, also seems to have the most motivation for out-right lying, the valuable dagger that each of the others mentioned is nowhere to be found. He also remembers the battle between the samurai and the bandit as being singularly cowardly and inept - at odds with the heroic and skilled combat the bandit recalls. While the woodcutter has reason to lie about the dagger, he has no reason to lie about fight (if there was one) whereas the bandit is motivated by pride. All of these stories are told in the first person or through flashbacks to an earlier trial amongst three men (a commoner, a priest, and the woodcutter) as they take cover from a torrential rain storm in the burnt ruins of Rashomon, a vast city gate. The story is beautifully told although some of the acting may seem stagy and overly-theatrical (notably Mifune's laughing) but the film's narrative structure (audiences aren't usually seeing an event, they are seeing someone else's memory of the event) accommodates, even encourages, excesses. The ending is a bit maudlin, considering the rest of the film's nihilism, but the beautifully lensed, written, and acted film, like all of Kurosawa's oeuvre, is worth watching at a number of levels.",

Which results in a fascinating storytelling experience.It is also an effective tale about the human nature to lie, and about the human nature of selfishness, as all of the stories in the movie differ in a way that favors the one telling it. No character is truly likeable, but that's the way Kurosawa wanted it to be. They do not have to be likeable as long as they are well developed, and that it is. The characters are telling the story to an unseen Judge behind the camera, basically telling it to the audience themselves. There are no definite answers, as it all comes down to the human nature to lie. There is minimal dialogue as Kurosawa understood the beautiful cinematography and the faces could speak for themselves. It is both an effective visual and psychological experience.One of the couple of gripes, however, is a couple of overacting sequences, ridiculous hysterical yelling that seemingly comes out of nowhere ( Especially by everyone's favorite Toshiro Mifune, who in all other ways, was brilliant ), and the relatively short running time.However, all in all it makes Rashomon an effective and revolutionary movie due to its non linear concept, and is definitely up there as another one of Kurosawa's masterpieces in his extraordinary career.",

It describes a situation in which an event is given contradictory interpretations or descriptions by the individuals involved.'' And if I may add, none of these interpretations are true and all of them are somehow true, like there is a kernel of truth there blurred by everyone's subjective perspective.And I still can't figure out what exactly happened. Even though one of the perspectives towards the end seems a bit more reliable I can't take it for granted.SPOILER ALERT, skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the movie: I can see why both men said the woman asked the bandit to kill the husband. In the woodcutter's perspective the woman said ''A man has to make a woman his by his sword'' and suggested that her love (or better said loyalty) is not unconditional, saying a woman only loves the man who fights for her. Even if she was raped and wasn't pure anymore, she managed to make the men fight to death for her, this battle resulting in the death of her husband. In other words, even if she didn't have a gun, she was the one who pulled the trigger that resulted in her husband's death. Thus ''she said'' kill him. But it's more than that. ,,Saying'' kill him is like killing him. And the husband killed himself by fighting for her when she wasn't worth it. And the bandit killed the husband for her but she left and nothing was worth it.Changing the subject to cinematography I think the close-ups could not have been done better. I remember one scene when I saw drops of sweat on Tajomaru's face or his look at the beginning of the battle as he was gripped with fear and horror of what he's going to do. I should also mention that this is my first contact with Akira Kurosawa's movies and it was a bit over my expectations, surprising to say at least. I'm going to watch more movies by him and I hope he's going to get even better, though I can hardly imagine for moment how much better a movie can get.A 10 out of 10 from me.",

But, believe it or not, Hollywood preceded him by 21 years! In 1929 Fox released a courtroom drama that is startlingly similar in theme to RASHOMON. Three witnesses tell different stories of a rape and murder in court. The last one is accepted as the truth. Don't believe me? Check out THRU DIFFERENT EYES (yes, that's the right spelling) on IMDb. At the age of 9, I saw this film when in general release, and was much impressed, although truth to tell after three quarters of a century, I don't remember actual details. It had an impressive cast, too: Warner Baxter and Sylvia Sydney, among others of note. The credited authors of this story were Milton Gropper and Edna Sherry. Was there a connection, possibly unconscious, to this story in Akutagawa's \"In the Grove\"? Maybe, maybe not, but strange things happen in literature, stage and cinema.In RASHOMON, all four versions by witnesses are tainted, including the woodcutter's. His seems most plausible, but then he lied about what he saw to begin with. In the end, we do not know what is Truth, no more than Pontius Pilate did. But the apparent non-sequitur of the abandoned child and the rescue by the priest and woodcutter seems to indicate that there is some good in mankind, even if it does lie.Puzzling and gripping as the action and mystery is, it's not satisfying in any usual sense. It's doubtful that Kurosawa meant it to be. A great group of actors in the forest grove, and the incessant rain at the ruined temple, keep us enthralled as the stories unfold.

Also the slow paced editing helped us observe the nuances of each character and build up the tension. The acting performances were exceptional, especially from Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura.Overall, Rashomon is one of the major works in Japanese art and culture, and It had a huge impact not only on Japanese cinema but on world cinema.",

MAN, IT WAS 1950 AND SOMEBODY ALREADY MASTERED THE USE OF A TERRIFYING ART OF PHOTOGRAPHY !!! if you know what i mean, that scene when the wife looking into the water at the river. holy motherrr, that lightning set was BEAUTIFUL. all the action scene when the husband and the bandit, its like they use a real sword, they slash everything and it is all damaged over there and there. i really feels like Unbelievable ! yet the camera movement and the position they took shot of the camera, it was near perfect as a well-made movie. and the cutting time skill from the director, oh my god ! all was beyond imagination, it is too fkng pro, even director nowadays still not reach that level but this man did in 1950 ! i even didn't believe japan have this legend director in their history. all that i know, japan was really good with their animated movies likes spirited away, grave of the fireflies, etc (these movies too rich and really dense yet out-of-the-box, surprisingly creative !the other things that i like from this movie were the fabulous act, they all totality on their own. all the emotion was acted excellently with japan style of act. yet what makes this movie considered as one of the most influental movie was it's richness of the story/plot. the ending was not the best, but that keeps the viewer had their own answer to it. this movie tells to us, human is WEAK ! we all live for evildoing. we all sinner. they show us ourself, this is what we are. and in the end, we are trying to change to be better person in our life also for the other's life. that's how to live our life !maybe this movie is not for young/kid/teenager who prefer a vibrant action or old-crime style. but for those who enjoy movies not for it's entertaining category or it's magical visual effect. for those people who can see a movie as it is, as how the movie made with good directing and cinematography which contains everything. you will find something that surprisingly unbelievable, and it is what professional movie- maker called it as ART, GREAT ART.",

It took me a while to find Akira Kurosawa (I discovered him just a short time before his death, in fact), but find him I did. As the Western World was introduced to him via this 1950 masterwork, it is appropriate that this would be the first film of his that I've ever seen.As I watched \"Rashomon\" (so named for the place where the tale is told), it struck me that I had seen inferior variations of this story before over the years, some good, most of them dogs, but nothing even coming close to this grand vision of mankind's ability to shut out the truth if it's to his advantage. First we hear the basic undisputable facts. Then we get three wildly disparate accounts from the participants (the thief, the wife, even the dead samauri through a spirit medium) about what happened afterwards. Then we get the \"solution\" account that tells the answers. If there is any one phrase that could sum up all these various tellings of the same tale (and I include the \"solution\" in this batch for reasons the film can explain better than I), it would be this: \"It's not my fault things turned out this way.\" Yet it is clear by film's end that EVERYONE contributed to the tragedy. No one comes off as innocent or sympathetic as a result. Maybe that's what they mean by \"Truth hurts\". Man's ability to delude himself is nothing short of disgusting.",

            "content": "Rashomon is a movie based off of the short stories \"Rashomon\" and \"In a Grove.\" It is the story of a bandit who leads a couple into the woods, ties the man up, and rapes the woman. Somehow the man ends up dead, but there are differing theories as to how this happened. The movie takes place on a rainy day when two men are discussing how much this story confuses them. A third man shows up and asks what they are talking about. The story is told from the perspectives of the bandit, the wife, the husband, and a woodcutter who saw the whole thing. It is then up to the men to decide whether or not humanity is inherently evil, or if there is a glimmer of kindness in men.This movie is all about how humans lie, cheat, and steal to impress others or to make themselves feel better, and to gain an advantage over others. Since there are four differing accounts, at least three, and maybe all four, of the storytellers are lying. Each character gains something by lying. The bandit portrays himself as an honorable man who challenges the husband to a sword fight instead of killing him in a deceptive way. The wife says she does not remember murdering her husband, thus distancing herself from some of the blame, and then proceeds to say that she was so struck with guilt that she tried to commit suicide. The husband says that his wife only betrayed him because she was brainwashed by the bandit, and that he was so grief-stricken that he killed himself. And finally, the woodcutter lied to the police so he would not have to get involved, and lied to the two men to cover up the fact that he stole the woman's expensive dagger. All four of these characters are selfish; Tajomaru is a rapist, the woodcutter is a thief, and any of the four could be the killer, including the husband himself. The movie portrays humans as horrible, self-centered creatures, and the story even causes a priest to lose his faith in humanity for a while.However, the movie also shows hope for the plight of men. At the end of the movie, a baby is abandoned. It is left all alone on that rainy day, unable to take care of itself. But the woodcutter, who already has six children, agrees to take the baby home and raise it as his own. He has given this child a second chance at life, and has restored the priest's faith in the kindness of humanity.The movie was black and white, somewhat repetitive, and slow-moving. I do not recommend it to anyone who has a problem with those things. Because of the rape, it is a mature film and not for children. It is also pretty depressing and up until the very end, shows only the negative aspects of people. But overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie about human nature, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of people.",

Well, that's the problem. If this was the first POV I've ever seen, which is certainly not the case here, I would probably have loved it like everyone else. Well, I've seen many more POV films before this, like \"Vantage Point,\" which takes the same idea but uses it in a more sophisticated way.The whole POV thing in here is pretty simple and really easy to understand and I was disappointed in that. I just expected more. More complicated things. Small significances that I wouldn't have noticed the first time when watching the film a lot more. But no, it's just a simple plot compared to the other films which took the idea and turned it into a much more complicated way.Away from that, the film was still good, especially close to the end.

Kubrick didn't use the coloring right until 'Dr. Strangelove' because there the blandness was intentional and, I might add, effective in making the depressing shades of gray more apparent. Unfortunately for Kurosawa, the B&W doesn't help here.I really don't consider this one of Kurosawa's best.  I feel he hit his real visual chord with 'Throne of Blood' then amplified it through 'Ran'.  Even 'Yojimbo' rings stronger than 'Rash\u00f4mon'.  Perhaps it's because we've had so many \"twisted story\" movies by upstart writers (much like the \"running man\" genre) that we don't get the fresh feel of the story like we used to.

All three stories are equally plausible, as one might expect from the three different viewpoints.The highwayman (to be sure a sociopath, as shown in a deliberately hideous laugh that underscores the ugliness of his character), doomed already, for once has the freedom to tell his owns story because what he says will no longer change his destiny The wife has her story, part of which is that she got a little choice -- in view of the lack of choice typical for women in medieval Japan, and in that momentary choice she can even talk the highwayman into settling down to a normal life and giving up crime. The dead man, the husband, has no cause to say anything but what he experienced -- of course in an unearthly way.This was clearly a risky story (actually a trilogy within a framework) to set to film -- and Kurosawa leaves no doubt that he and only he could have done this. The imagery is, of course, spectacular; Kurosawa shows genius there too.A definite 10 due to its uniqueness and its excellence in every detail. This is an absolute must-see.",

            "content": "A must see movie for film technique.\"Rashomon\" is a movie that encompasses both, \"In a Grove\" and \"Rashomon,\" two stories written in pre-war Japan, into one cohesive, post-war film. In the movie, a samurai is found dead in a forest. The movie is the accumulation of accounts from different people, each telling their story of what happened. Conflict ensues when the accounts, while similar, have vastly different conclusions.From a technical standpoint \"Rashomon\" is a movie that is a pioneer it its time. The use of nature, sky, and weather are truly one of a kind. For example, when people are shown as small creatures inside of a huge forest that envelops them, the insignificance of one man over all of nature shines through.While on the topic of shinning, deliberate shots of a sun-filled sky are scattered throughout the film. These spots of intense sun splashing through the tree tops is always paired with a time in the story the when viewer beings to think they are listening to an untrue portrayal of events.Knowing that in film, sunshine is typically used to show truth and purity, this indicates that while there is bad in all humans (as seen through the incessant lying) there is at least a little bit of good that lives with the bad (as is seen through the sun.) Keeping this same theme in mind, the sun points to the individual accounts as not being a total fabrication, indicating that there is a little bit of truth in all of the accounts. However, the film indicates that while there is perhaps some good in people, the bad side is what will always prevail, it is the easiest to satiate.A step further.The words of the characters tend to indicate that they are all false and all bad (this is a post-war perspective.) The environment, tells a different story, allowing for the possibility of some good (this is a pre-war perspective.) With these ideas in mind, it is fair to say that the language of the film is modern, while the ambiance sends a traditional outlook.These subtleties make the film. By bring many opposites and situations into the same screen, Akira Kurosawa (director), is allowing the viewer to draw many of their own conclusions. Each person can take a different message from the film. In fact, it would be fair to say that within each person a different meaning may come to pass with each successive viewing.Check it out.",

The thing to ask yourself, while watching the film,is this: What is the motivation of each character? Each story reveals that person's deepest fear. In the story each person tells, they are trying to protect the one thing they are most afraid of losing. Given this perspective, I find the film is actually quite understandable and makes a lot of sense. One other comment I'd like to make is that Kurosawa-san once said, \"Women are not my specialty.\" I beg to differ! The wife's emotion is so very real, certainly just as real as the men's. I could name my favorite women characters in his other films too...but that might wander outside the scope of this review.",

            "content": "You just need to watch Rashomon to understand why Akira Kurosawa is considered one of the finest directors in world cinema. For most of the viewers, it is an unsolved crime told in an interesting yet different fashion, and he/she can try to arrange the puzzles to form a solution. For movie freaks, it is much more than that; in addition to being a fine work of art, it conveys beautifully a simple message through a complex movie.One can easily gather from the movie, that the main idea conveyed was that there is no absolute truth. We see 4 different people narrating a story, in completely different ways. While each of them tells their version of the story, the idea expressed is simply how much one's perspective can distort reality. Or in the deeper sense, that there is no absolute reality. Reality is relative. We could relate it to the story of the blind men and an elephant, where 6 different blind men touch different parts of an elephant and each of them assume, interpret and argue that elephant looks like the part they touched.Now, probably to what was mainly conveyed through the movie - the rationale behind the different stories. None of them were lying to protect themselves, as one can notice from the bandit's and the lady's story, they say they might have killed the samurai. Obviously, protection from law is not what mattered. In the bandit's story, he glorified himself; he portrayed himself as a brave and a great warrior, who easily lures the lady. In the lady's story, she portrayed herself as a helpless victim, trying to stand in dignity. In the samurai's version, he was portrayed as being noble, brave, and the best thing he could do was committing suicide. In the woodcutter's version, he is portraying each of the 3 characters equally culpable, which makes his act of stealing the dagger a trivial one. Even though, we tend to go with the woodcutter's story because he is a neutral person, we cannot believe his as well, as he was the only person who admitted that he was lying (earlier).In each of the version, we see that the person is glorifying themselves. It is not protection from law that mattered, but protecting one's own ego. In every one's story, we see the story-teller polishing his character so as to suit his ego. It portrays the insecurity in humans, the fact that no humans can survive without lying to themselves and creating a make-belief world where they seem to be a better person than they actually are. A simple message that no human is completely honest with himself! Other than the message conveyed in the movie, the way in which the movie unfolds, the way the characters are molded, the way the 3 characters differ in the different versions, the acting, the sensuality of the woman, all plays a great role in shaping the movie into a masterpiece. For instance, the initial scene in which the woodcutter walks through the forest till he finds the dead body is breathtaking. We walk with him, and when he stands still seeing the body, we also freeze. Even such a trivial scene, shot with amazing beauty and intelligence, is what makes Kurosawa one among the best! Usually, when a movie ends without a climax, or when no solutions are provided to the crime, I end up a bit frustrated (exception being Nolan's inception). Have to admit though, this one left me fascinated!",

I recognize the qualities that make it great, in terms of the theme (i.e.--a visual examination of the subjectivity of knowledge), but their are aspects of the cinematography that are very off-putting for a 21st century American audience. Most notable are the exceptionally long takes focused on an actor's face while he/she emotes for the camera. After the first few seconds of this type of shot, no new intelligence is communicated by continuing to view the actor's face. I did like the realism of the fight scenes, which struck me as much more in line with reality than the highly choreographed demonstrations of virtuoso sword-play that many more modern action films offer. Overall, I give the film a 3, based on the fact that it's just not all that accessible to most modern viewers, due to differences in culture and aesthetic values between 1950 Japan and 2004 America. Since the purpose of any text is to reach out in a meaningful way to its audience, that inaccessibility constitutes a fatal flaw in the film. In other words, it's dated, badly.",

However a \"Rashomon\" plot structure has today become a term for any storyline in which events are told from multiple points of view. This pioneering film will be long remembered as a landmark achievement.This was the film that first brought Kurosawa \u0096 and Japanese film as a whole \u0096 to worldwide attention. Ironically however it is not quite a typical Kurosawa picture. The minimalism of locations and characters makes it something like a stage play \u0096 a far cry from his massive historical epics and social dramas. Also while his films dealt with a variety of social issues, this was usually on a down-to-earth, personal level. It was rare that he would deal with something as abstract as the nature of truth. Having said that, Kurosawa was himself dismissive of any highbrow interpretations \u0096 underneath the unusual plot structure and philosophical musings it is a simple story about human relations, in this case why we are compelled to lie.This is also often referred to as the first truly great Kurosawa film \u0096 the one where he really worked out his style. I would argue though that he wasn't quite there yet. In particular some of the action sequences seem a little too long drawn out. They aren't as tightly directed as those in his later period films such as Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress.One area in which Kurosawa clearly was fully matured was in his use of location. The picture only has three main settings, all highly contrasted: the dappled shade of the forest where the \"hidden\" crime took place; the ruined gatehouse symbolising the feelings of the people huddled inside it to escape the rain; and the plain, formal courthouse. Kurosawa's trademark use of weather is also fully developed in Rashomon. This is most obvious in the heavy rainfall at the Rashomon gate, but there is also clever use of cloudy skies in other scenes \u0096 particularly in the incredible shot of the bandit riding along silhouetted against the horizon.The acting is highly melodramatic, particularly in the flashbacks, and more so than is usual for Kurosawa films. For the most part this is the perfect style \u0096 in particular with Toshiro Mifune as the bandit who snarls and lunges like a wild animal. There is also a mesmerising performance by Fumiko Homma as a possessed medium. Other times the over-the-top acting doesn't quite work. For example I'm not personally convinced by Machiko Kyo as the wife.The music is a bit disappointing for Fumio Hayakawa (who did great scores on Ikiru and Seven Samurai). But then in this case a grand score would most likely detract from the visual elements of the film rather than enhance them.Of all Kurosawa's films, this is the one I recommend as a starter for people new to his work. Despite Japanese audiences apparently being confused by it on initial release, the story is actually quite simple and it can be easily taken in in a single viewing. And while very different to his usual output, it does at least feature the sentimental humanism, reversing of traditional roles and of course the stylised swordplay that are Kurosawa hallmarks.",

Yet, despite the lack of production value and limited time frame and color, the movie tells a compelling tale that demands the audience to question the story itself and its broader implications for human nature. As such the film has earned its place amongst Japanese period classics.",

            "content": "Rashomon runs only 88 minutes, which to me is fairly short for a feature-length movie, but it seems this could have been accomplished in about 45 minutes or an hour. Many of the scenes are too drawn out, simply taking too long to achieve what we already know is going to happen.You can notice this early as we spend minutes just watching the Woodcutter walk through the forest. There are interesting shots and directing techniques in this scene, but it goes on for too long.Also see the wife's extended bouts of crying, although her performance is great in the Woodcutter's version of the story, in the scene where her tirade on the male species motivates the two men to fight each other.But it further drags as the wife takes forever to kill the husband, then the husband takes forever to kill himself, the final sword fight that goes on longer than it needs to. The outcomes of these scenes are predictable. The predictability is not the problem. The problem is that these scenes linger on when we already know what the result will be. We know the final sword fight will end with the bandit killing the husband with his sword because the Woodcutter has already swore that the husband died by sword before we entered his version of the truth. If we did not know the result, this might be suspenseful, but since we already do, it just drags.The story itself I found to be very good, but the case here is that the screenplay has been cursed by having been directed by its own writer. So I have settled on rating it a 5. Luckily for Kurosawa, many of you don't feel the same way.Having said that, I have seen Seven Samurai before this, rated it an 8, and though it's damn long at nearly three-and-a-half hours, I did not feel it was as drawn out, though maybe it would be easier to swallow if it were two separate movies.",

As another reviewer pointed out, Rashomon is decidedly _not_ about differences in perception, but rather about self-deceit. Each of the three \"false\" versions serves the purposes of its teller -- the last, \"honest\" version serves nothing but the truth. Like most Kurosawa pictures (Ran and Ikiru make especially good examples), it doesn't have a specific moral. He lays out the questions in detail, and lets the viewer chew on them. And it doesn't hurt that he does so with such visual brilliance....",

            "content": "May contain spoilers!!!I'll be honest, this is the first Japanese film I've ever seen, but I'm hungry for more, particularly those directed by Kurosawa.Rashomon is set in Medieval Japan, (exactly when is not stated, and irrelevant), and revolves around the murder of a nobleman and the rape of his wife. The story is related by four separate people, and is being discussed by three men sheltering at Rashomon Gate from torrential rain. The stories are told by the suspect, (a bandit), the murdered mans wife, a woodcutter, (a witness to the murder), and the dead man himself through a medium. Each story is different and all have reasons for lying. During the court scenes the judge is never seen, and the witnesses are facing the audience. Therefore the viewers themselves are the judge.Key differences are in the fight scenes between the bandit and the nobleman; in the bandit's story they stage a skilled, heroic battle, whilst the woodcutter describes a shambolic fight where both men are weak and untalented.Who is the killer? You decide.Key to this film is the cinematography which distinguishes the film from mainstream Hollywood movies. The fight scenes seem long and drawn out due to a mostly static camera, with none of the modern fast editing associated with Hollywood action films. This does appear to slow the film down, but I don't feel that this is to its detriment. Those who have described the film as 'too long' should note that the running time is only around 85 minutes.This film put Japanese cinema on the world map, and deservedly so. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest Japanese director, and is often credited with 'auteur' status. I would personally agree despite the fact that I have only seen this one film, but in the course of my studies I will see more of his work.I really enjoyed this film for its open ending which leaves so much to individual interpretation. The ending is more optimistic, marked by the ceasation of the metaphorical rain that had set the mood of the film up to this point. Cultural differences must be overlooked, and it must also be remembered that this film is now over half a century old, as it should not be judged by its dated appearance.I hope people enjoy this film, and look deeper than its surface. There is a lot to be found.9/10",

            "review_title": "Personal Experiences from Rashomon",
            "content": "Rashomon displays how masterful director Akira Kurosawa truly was at creating a beautiful story. Rashomon is a series of flashbacks that try to piece together the events of a murdered man and a raped woman. It retells the stories of a wife, a dead husband via a medium, a bandit and lastly a woodsman. Kurosawa explains to the audience that perception and reality are often two very different worlds. Rashomon was made in Japan and released in 1950, well after the horrific events of World War Two. Kurosawa views humanity as weak, corrupt, and morally lost for the duration of the film. The actors portray deceitful and hellish beings up until the rain ceases and a child is brought into the picture. At this moment, Kurosawa shows a glimpse of hope for humanity as the woodsman walks away with the child and the screen fades to black. Not only did the war have an affect on this film but also the styles of German Expressionism left an impression as well. The contrast of light and darkness played a prominent role for each of the character's stories. As the story changes from each character, one can see the light and shadows shifting from one actor to the next. For example, as the bandit tells his story the shadow is cast upon the husband and a gleaming light is proudly shown on him. Additionally, the light is focused more so on the wife (up until the shaming of her) than on the bandit for the husband's side of the story. The use of a gloomy setting and antiheroes are also key indicators of German Expressionism. The storytelling and the depth of the characters made this a captivating film to behold. The different viewpoints of each story about the wife were the most fascinating. She depicted a sad widower, a 'child-like' innocence, a goddess, a con artist, a liar, and a whore. Kurosawa gives the viewers a puzzle but only half of the pieces required to create a clear picture. Overall this motion picture creates a clear portrait on how Kurosawa views humanity. At the last minute, he changes the direction of the film by having the woodsman carry the abandoned baby back to his home. Even though there is much turmoil and disgust in humanity's present state there is also a sliver of hope according to Kurosawa.",

            "content": "Rash\u00f4mon (1950)By the time that Kurosawa was shooting Rashomon, other genius film makers were involved in crucial projects: Luis Bu\u00f1uel was filming \"Los Olvidados\" (1950), Ingmar Bergman was writing the screenplay for \"Summer Interlude\" (1951) and filming two full length movies (\"To Joy\" and \"High tension\", both in 1950) and Federico Fellini was shooting his first film \"Variety Lights\" (1950). Probably was only a fortunate coincidence that four of the best filmmakers ever were involved in very personal and decisive project in the early stages of their careers. It's important to mention that by those days the Italian Neo-realism was clearly the most dominating and extended film movement. In the international film festivals a lot of pictures in that style were awarded and directors like Visconti, Rosellini and De Sica were considered the top of the list. But in 1950 something happened and changed the film industry forever. Bergman was acclaimed by his early works and the 1950 projects and the decisive film \"Summer interlude\" (with the Sweden star Maj-Britt Nilsson) meant for him enough budget to start shooting other more personal movies. His first major film was filmed three years later (Summer with Monika (1953) with his first collaboration with Harriett Andersson) and since then, Bergman had one of the most admirable film productions. Bu\u00f1uel, on the other hand, was filming his first personal project since \"the golden age\" (1930). The film received an award of Cannes festival for best direction. (For further information about this film refer to my comment in \"Los Olvidados\"). Fellini by his side had a well received debut with his first film and a young actress was awarded with an acting price (Gulietta Massina, Fellini's wife). The three of them had very solid and world acclaimed film careers. But I would like to talk in more detail about Kurosawa's first major film: Rashomon.In 1947, Kurosawa met Toshiro Mifune (the most important actor for Kurosawa, along with Takashi Shimura). In his book \"Something like an autobiography\", the Japanese director mentioned the impact that was to met Mifune. He described the young actor as a strong presence, with hard character and natural acting skills. Actually Mifune and Shimura had a collaboration with Kurosawa in the 1947 film \"Ginrei no hate\". By 1950, Kurosawa invited those two actors again and left the main male character to Mifune. The result is brilliant. A murder story involving three persons (one woman, two men). The film started at Rashomon (a ruined temple) during a rainy afternoon. Two persons were sheltered there and a third one arrives. Then, one of them (The woodcutter, played by Shimura) started to tell a very confusing story. He was walking into the woods and found some personal objects and a body. Then we can see the trial (where only the witnesses are visible) and the woodcutter version was heard. During the movie, the director change from the scene in the rainy temple to the trial several times. Then we can hear the version of Tajomaru (Mifune), a well known thief and he described his version as a love and honor tale. He was touched by the woman and cheats the other man in order to possess her. At the end, the killing took place after a samurai style combat between the two men. Then we witness the woman and the death character's (through some magic conjure) versions. Every story is totally different from the other. In one, Tajomaru is a brave and fair warrior, in other is a villain with no feelings, in other is a coward. Beautiful sequences where we can see the same action viewed and told by four different characters. At the end the woodcutter told the real version (totally opposite from the others) to the stranger and at that stage of the movie is very difficult to know which version is the truth or at least the closest. The decision is on us. The final sequence with the baby is magnificent and the acting performances (especially from Mifune) are superb. All the characters took the human emotions and feelings in a very emotive way, the existential questions are present all the time and this simple history is told beautifully by this great Japanese director.The film received the golden lion award in the 1951 Venice film festival along with the Italian film critics award. One urban legend said that the category for best foreign movie was created after the honorary Oscar given to the film in 1952. This is, with no doubts the first Kurosawa's master piece. After this, several major films were produced during the 50's through the 90's under Kurosawa's direction. A must see movie and reference.",

This one falls into the second category. I was just Wow-ed by this movie. This movie exploits an interesting method of perspective narration. Stories are often perspective oriented and in this movie, one story is narrated by many people involved in the story.What the viewer as well as the person who is listening to these sets of narration has to decipher is - which one is the truth? While you start with this idea, you end up taking it to a whole new level and not knowing if there is a true perspective you would want to search for? The plausibility of some of these perspectives as well as the intertwined self interest of the narrator implies that there is this haze in everything. That is when the film leaves you hanging and you're stunned by the turn of events. Its as if someone has tempted you and left you high and dry. Thats what's the Rashomon effect.",

Because it sucks ball.The movie grants me with an ending of extreme discomfort that I have to bang my head continuously against the DVD-cover and question what was the 88-mins content I just spent starring critically on the screen is essentially about? I finally come to term with myself and realize that it's just a bunch of baloneys. What's even better is I get to watch the stupid story told 4 times differently. Very nice! The story's plot is embellished with characters that capable of bringing the art of silly overreacting to a higher realm of mastery, especially Toshiro Mifune. It also has one of the best sword-duel scene in the history of cinema that consists of the constant tripping over twigs, running around trees, dropping swords, ridiculous facial expressions and screaming. This particular scene, with an addition of a cheesy Indian song, would make a perfect blockbuster Bollywood flick.The movie has no resolution afterward. You just have to take in the 4 different versions of the account without knowing the truth in the end even though I don't see the motivation for the woodcutter to lie but you never know what's the real story. Perhaps, it's better that way because up to that point, if given that the woodcutter lies too, I'm too fed up for the real account even if they decide to reveal it.Do yourself a favor and watch Yojimbo - Kurosawa's best.",

            "content": "If you like Asian movies, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon is a definite must-see because it is not only an overall great film but also the first Japanese film that became an international success, a classic that started it all. Plus, Rashomon is now in the public domain, so you can watch it for free legally on the Internet. Which you should. I watched it for the first time when I was very young, but it wasn't until later years that I could fully appreciate it. It's a movie for adults in the best sense of the word.Strangely, while Rashomon was celebrated by international critics, Japanese critics didn't like it and suggested that it appealed to Westeners only because it was exotic, as Kurosawa bitterly noticed. Well, a prophet has no honor in his own country. Although it cannot be denied that the exoticism of Rashomon adds to its appeal, that alone cannot explain the out-of-nowhere international success of this movie. There has to be something about Rashomon that strikes a chord in viewers independent of their cultural background. I think it has something to do with the fact that - intentionally or not - Rashomon plays with an archetypal constellation, a pattern more or less subconsciously known, and thus understood, in all cultures (and often expressed by mythological figures): The Trickster. A trickster constellation is a pattern where several or all of the following occur simultaneously: deception, disruption, reduced sexual inhibition, blurring of boundaries, and magical practices. Rashomon is about all of that. The tragedy begins with an act of deception by the bandit Tajomaru, and the deception doesn't end there. The events are disruptive - especially, of course, to the murdered Samurai and his wife. Obviously, uncontrolled sexuality plays a role as well, as does the blurring of boundaries. Ultimatily, Rashomon blurs the boundaries between truth and fiction. Even the supernatural aspect is there: A dead man speaking from his grave through a medium, once again blurring a boundary, namely that between the living and the dead. The feelings of dread expressed by the monk near the end are also in line with trickster phenomena. At least that's what Jungian psychology says. Looking at the creation of Rashomon and at its international reception, I have come to believe that there's more to archetypal psychology than I once thought.Now, I think there is a reason why foreign critics liked the movie better than Japanese critics. It is simple but paradoxical: It is easier for foreigners to detect the psychological content of the movie. For a foreigner, much of the movie is exotic. Yet the more exotic a movie is for a viewer, the easier it is for him to spot the aspects of it which are familiar, which are fundamentally human and independent of culture. Hence, foreigners are in advantage when it comes to noticing the psychology of the movie. This paradox, again, fits nicely with the trickster character of Rashomon.",

            "review_title": "Ambiguous Perspectives",
            "content": "The film Rashomon is a relatively simple story about the recollections of four individuals who testify to a rape of a woman and a samurai's murder. There's the bandit (Tishorio Mifune), the samurai (Masayuki Mori), the samurai' wife (Machiko Kyo), and the woodcutter (Takashi Shimura). Each of their own perspective is told through flashback, and leads the viewer down a path of wonder and keen interest. When the film draws to a close, the plot does not resolved itself. We do not know who is telling the truth. Nor do we know the fate of the accused bandit and the helpless widow. It is entirely up to the viewer to decide which character is telling the truth (if they even are). That's the beauty of this film. I have my own theory of what happened, but another viewer may not agree with me. That's the lesson director Akira Kurosawa successfully makes with this film. Every person has his or her own perspective. As a result, each individual will see something different within this movie. Unlike some of Kurosawa's later work like The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress, Rashomon is not a fast-paced movie. Much of the slow pace has to deal with Kurosawa's famous use of the long take. There are many shots in which the camera lingers on one character as he or she delivers some form of action. One scene that comes to mind is when the bandit is shown killing the samurai. As he slowly creeps towards his victim, the camera tracks him until he makes his final deathblow. Some may argue that the long take, especially in this scene, draws out the action much longer than necessary. In my opinion, it works very well. The purpose of this use of the long take is to emphasis the tension and intensity that the bandit experiences right before he murders the samurai. His gritted teeth and bulged eyes show that he is not very accustomed to murder, despite his profession as a thief. The acting is pretty thorough when it comes to Tishorio Mifune and Masayuki Mori. Mifune is an icon for exaggerated emotion. His over the top, devilish laugh, and his intense facial expressions work perfect for him as the merciless bandit. Masayuki Mori is subtler as the samurai. He does not have many lines, but much of his accomplishment derives from his facial expressions. This is particularly noteworthy when he watches as his wife is violated before his eyes. There is such an anger and passion in his face during this scene that it borders on frightening. I was not impressed with Machiko Kyo as the samurai's wife. This is very apparent when she taunts both the bandit and the samurai as being weak. Her constant screeches and ridiculous laughter in this scene was enough to make me feel nauseated. Takashi Shimura as the woodcutter did not do much for me either. He merely told his side of the story and adopted an abandoned infant at the end of the film.A bigger problem I had with this movie is the fight scenes. I understand that this film was made sixty years ago, but more money needed to be spent on the choreography. It is lame to watch as both a bandit and a samurai constantly fall over during a duel as well as throw leaves at one another as a means of fighting. In my concluding opinion, Rashomon is a decent movie. It is not for the average audience, for there is little action and even less humor. This is movie is not meant to be popcorn-loving entertainment. It is meant to make the audience think about the plot's ambiguity and decide for themselves what is true and false.",

That being said, the movie is far from being nihilistic, nor merely pessimistic. Because if we see the whole picture, we will find that the movie also affirm that the human has as good characteristics as he has bad ones. Without going into any details, some of these good characteristics are Sympathy, Truth-seeking, and pleading guiltiness.All the performances are as good as possible, but whose performance stands out for me, and arguably for most viewers, is Toshiro Mifune's as the notorious bandit, Taj\u00f4maru. He delivered such a kinetic performance that will stand the test of time exactly as the movie itself. Also Machiko Ky\u00f4 was phenomenal; the fact that she frequently changes her facial expressions in such a graceful way is unbelievable.There's only one character that I think isn't necessary. It expresses the viewer's doubt to convey, and end the moral aspect of the story, while we already drawn into the story that we can grasp everything because, as I mentioned above, it's a story about us. That made the conclusion of the movie feels a little bit on the nose. Nevertheless, the interplay between this very character and the Woodcutter helped to set the tone at certain points, hence made the viewers know how to feel at the very beginning, and the very end of the movie.All in all, Rash\u00f4mon is a thought-provoking study of human nature. It's an ageless piece of art not just because its universal themes, nor the revolutionary narrative, and visual techniques, but because it takes advantage of us, as humans, to prove its moral.(9.5/10)",

In the end, an event with an abandoned child and the symbolic appearance of the sun shine return hope in human race for the priest as he has shown disgust on the lawlessness of humanity. Although some may interpret that the little bit of somewhat ominous music as the woodcutter is walking away from the temple suggests he's expedient intentions of taking the baby. Or could the resolve have been just the priest's character arc of regaining hope in man despite the fact that he might have been duped by the woodcutter - who is unprincipled like the woman, the husband and the bandit? There is much ambiguity here which is what makes this movie interesting and as I've been told a more sophisticated storytelling for it's time. Although, out of personal taste I prefer YOJIMBO, Rashomon's ending was a payoff,and maybe even a twist (if the woodcutter was just as evil as everyone else is), but Yojimbo was more a payoff to me with the town inevitably becoming a quiet place... for awhile.

            "content": "The true irony in Rashomon is that the only person whose guilt is proved is that of the narrator's, despite the fact that majority of the film involves its three central characters claiming responsibility for one crime. While the focal point of Rashomon involves unraveling the event involving the death of a Samurai where the Samurai himself, his wife and a bandit claim to be the culprit, the film isn't a clue-solving mystery where new revelations in subsequent scenes make it easier for us to judge who the criminal is; instead, Rashomon places us in the jury box with its characters appealing to us one by one and the only way we can reach to any decision is through moral considerations. Can the wife be a woman of such loose morals that she immediately agrees to elope with the bandit and asks him coldly to shoot her husband? Can the husband be so stone-hearted that he rejects his helpless wife because she has been raped? Can a bandit be smooth enough to woo the married lady with just a kiss? It is hard to find a concrete answer because a) believing one version would be discarding the other equally credible versions and b) in each version we find the characters supporting the unexpected person ( for example, the samurai's version is more sympathetic to the bandit than his own wife). What makes the tale more complex is that there's another narrator who's retelling the different versions of the three characters. Later, it is his crime which is revealed and positively true, unlike the ambiguity of the murder case. In this way, Rashomon is revelatory as a film whose acclaim and relevance has lasted over the years because of its universally understood themes. I remember having gone for a local play held at the city hall about a year ago only because my friends were included in its cast and crew. I hurriedly slid out of the theater during interval because I couldn't endure the play anymore and I didn't want to lie to the cast, who'd called me backstage, about how much the play sucked. A year later, I rented Rashomon through a movie rental store and saw it at home. That day is today, and why I'm mentioning about a year-old play is that I realized that it was based entirely on Rashomon! Unlike the film, the play however was overburdened in dialog and reduced to shambles by substandard acting and technical achievements. I 'RAN' out the second the curtains dropped for interval (hope you get the silly capitalized pun. It's improvised!). Rashomon on the other hand has fewer dialogues, more pantomime and is a great technical achievement; it opens up like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, giving us very long shots of rain pattering down the city gate and slowly taking us inside, closing in on its two actors who are first seen at a distance from the camera's eye. Even the opening line in both Kane and Rashomon has the same function of defining the crux of the film; while you hear the protagonist Kane going 'Rosebud', Rashomon has the character of the woodcutter uttering \"I just don't understand\", not once but four different times. He has four conflicting versions of the same incident to tell, first from the point of view of its three characters and lastly himself. The companion sitting beside him is a priest who's also a witness to the incident, albeit a minor one. The film needs somebody apart from us to whom the story has to be told, and so a third character is introduced. Taking shelter from the rain, he enters the city gate and finds the two men sitting sullenly as the woodcutter murmurs his opening lines. With brazen intrusiveness, he asks the woodcutter what he can't understand, and then proceeds to question the priest like he can't mind his own business. But that's the catalyst for the woodcutter, our narrator for the rest of the film, to begin with the incident that's been bothering him for long.He starts by telling about the body of a samurai he found while walking through the woods, and then proceeds to share everything that happened in court (with no jury except us and maybe the skies). The stage is taken by the bandit first, who's been accused of killing a travelling samurai and raping his wife. The samurai gives an account that glorifies his deeds and presents him in the light he'd like to see himself in \u2013as a cold-blooded murderer who also entices the samurai's wife. The wife gives her account then, which reminded me of the tale Ramayana from Indian mythology; in it, Lord Ram's wife Seeta is abducted by Raavan, and after Ram defeats his sworn enemy, he brings Seeta back home but banishes her reluctantly after his subjects suspect her chastity. Here the samurai looks at his wife, who's been raped, with a look of contempt that frightens her and compels her to plunge the dagger into his heart. It is the dead samurai's version we hear next through a medium, and finally we hear the wood-cutter's own version. And while the woodcutter's tale would seem the most trustworthy at first, he being a stranger to the three characters, his words can't be relied upon wholly after we learn that he too may have something to hide. Even the sum of parts cannot make a whole in Rashomon as the sum itself has fluctuating variables. Instead of acting sleuth and trying to solve the case, watch the contrast in the personalities of the three characters through the four versions. You'll find yourself pulled into Rashomon's story until you can't tell what's true and what's not. And when you find yourself saying \"I just don't understand\", you got what Rashomon is all about; you weren't even a witness to the incident, so how would you expect to know the truth?",

            "content": "Rashomon forces you think. It presents the same event from four incompatible perspectives. Kurosawa never tells us which version, if any, is correct. Instead, the viewer is left with multiple characters, each skewing what happened. Which ones are lying? Perhaps all of them are.The movie has been so influential that the term \"Rashomon effect\" exists outside of cinema. It is easy to stop there and conclude that the \"true\" version of events does not matter, because the point of the film is to show that different people perceive an event in different - possibly irreconcilable - ways. But, stopping there does not give an answer about the end of the film.Upon finding the baby at the end, the woodcutter tells the priest that, having six children already, he will take on this additional one too. The woodcutter walks away from the shelter holding the baby, with the priest allegedly having his faith in humanity restored. That certainly seems to be an uplifting view of humanity after a film based entirely on person after person slanting the truth. In this view, maybe there's hope, notwithstanding the negative traits people display sometimes, and people can undertake profoundly redemptive actions. But the woodcutter lied already, when telling his version of events. How can we be sure he isn't lying now, as he walks away with a child? Maybe he's being dishonest again and has ill intentions. There is the real question. The film, again, gives us no answers, but it does give us a great deal to think about.",

This was Kurosawa's first big international hit, from then on his films would be avidly watched and (usually) feted as Art.

            "content": "Rashomon Temple sits, half-ruined, framing a sky that pours rain. The rain is relentless, but the temple, though uninhabited and worn, provides succor for those seeking escape from the downpour. The men gather round, pull off planks of wood, the very skin of the temple, to make a fire. Thus, the story begins.There are a lot of movies out there. Bold claim, right? However, only a very select few can be said to be absolutely perfect. Rashomon is one of them. Rashomon is, without a hint of qualification from me, a perfect movie.From the opening framing device of the temple, we are told the same story, four times, from four different points of view, about a specific event, where a bandit leads a man into a trap so that he can force himself on his wife. Each version of the story is very different, and we see each version play out in immaculate detail. Who is telling the truth? How do we parse and interpret the differing accounts, and who is truly the most wicked actor in this multifarious drama?Every frame of this film is gorgeous. Kurosawa is in true master mode here, as every movement of the camera, every still shot, every little movement is astonishingly evocative. The actors are perfect, engaging in multifaceted dimensions of their characters to suit the diverging narratives. Each one, moreover, plays a range that covers reprehensibility as thoroughly as they do a sad, quiet grace. This depth of texture is emblematic of the core of the film itself.The beauty, and the brilliance, is that we never know the true nature of events. It is as if to say, at the end, that deceit is endemic to the human soul, and the truth of things is, and always will be, hidden under a cloud of obfuscation. And yet, without spoiling the tender final moments of this beautiful film, there is also a small and transcendent grace that imbues humanity with dimension. Just as the rain finally subsides at Rashomon Temple, so too does kindness act as a parting of the clouds. This is the best thing that art can do, in my opinion, and what all the best art does: it takes both the beauty and the horror of humanity, meshes them together with exquisite craftsmanship, and offers it with open hands.The human spirit, the film seems to say, is like Rashomon Temple. A marvelous structure, half-ruined, and yet still capable of offering protection from the ceaseless storm.FINAL TAKE: Do you need one? Just find the restored version, and watch the damn thing.

            "content": "I can't really say anything about this wonderful film that hasn't already been said.  What I do want to comment on is the brilliance in construction of this film and most others by Akira Kurosawa.  His movies can be watched foremostly on a purely entertaining level due mostly to the well-formulated characters, brilliantly portrayed by some of Kurosawa's stock actors and the man of a thousand expressions Toshiro Mifune, and also the gripping action scenes perfectly choreographed.  Second, there's more to them just in the plots than what's written to entertain. I can't think of one of his films that has a straight and simple plot that's at all predictable.  Finally, and most importantly, the proof a true cinematic genius, there's always underlying meanings and subtexts, things that could be easily ignored but would be blasphemous to do so.The other thing I have to say about this film is that in many ways it's a horror film.  Baring great resemblance to the style and makeup of many Hitchcock films.  It deals with rape, infidelity, back-stabbing husbands and wives, channeling of ghosts, and the most horrible of all, human greed.  And the scene in the beginning where Shimura's walking through the forest is extremely suspenseful, evident by how it's filmed and a lot like the plethora of forest scenes in horror films throughout the 70s and 80s.  And that \"medium\" scene where the husband is channeled is genuinely creepy.",

            "review_title": "Why do only classic movies get away with bad acting?",
            "content": "There is a major issue that not enough critics of modern day are addressing. The major issue has actually plagued this critic for quite some time, and now the straw that broke the camel's back pretty much lies in this movie. Why on earth can classic movies get away with bad acting? Why is it that if the movie is old, and in black-and-white, it is forgiven and receives the green card whenever lines are delivered badly or the acting does not become believable in the least bit. An excellent story has been ruined and tainted by bad acting yet again, and it's time that more critics become harsher to these old flicks rather than uphold them to the highest degree. Who cares if they are groundbreaking? Groundbreaking does not mean incredible. The very first first-person shooter video game is a slow-placed repetitive little game called Faceball 2000. It is the first of its kind, but that does not make it great.Rashomon is a superbly told story, yet acting hampers the experience. Does it matter? It should, excellent films, films that receive perfect scores are those that excel in all levels, not just a few. Movies like Shawshank Redemption, Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Forrest Gump did not just succeed in storytelling: they had a great blend of acting, cinematography, editing, music, sound, and pacing. Rashomon does not deserve its status as one of the best films ever simply because it did not deliver in all aspects of film-making. It's time that we begin to criticize instead of just quietly accept all shortcomings of older films like Casablanca, Wizard of Oz (e.s.p.e.c.i.a.l.l.y), and this unique flick.In Rashomon, we follow three people that are caught in a downpour, two of them reliving the events of a trail in disbelief. Then the events of the trial and the events leading up to the trial are being told in different perspectives, each of them with their own truths, but also their own faults. It is up to the viewer, who unexpectedly plays the role as the judge, to fit the pieces together and craft the true story as to what really happened. The narrative in this movie is very jumbled and out of order; the first of its kind in any film-making. This would influence tons of later classic movies and television shows like Pulp Fiction, Annie Hall, The Usual Suspects, The Simpsons, Lost, and Memento. The script is excellent and well ahead of its time with highly-structured pacing, timing, and dialogue (even if some might be lost in translation). Written and directed by the famed Akira Kurosawa, this movie is the defining example of how Kurosawa's experimental work influenced the way we see movies for decades to come.The camera-work isn't consistent or repetitive, which keeps the movie at the edge of your seat. Whether its long shots of characters realizing a harsh truth, or swooping shots of scenery, the cinematography is also ahead of its league. Kurosawa keeps the pacing quick, and also is very detailed in his shots, which enhances the experience. He truly was one of the better directors in the first half of the 20th century. Unlike the predictable works of modern times, you couldn't really figure out just what happened on that fateful day until the very end, when all was revealed in front of your eyes. The clues were there, but it requires multiple viewings to piece them all to a coherent tale.However the movie hits the deep end with the acting, which for some reason critics find forgivable. How come movies of today can't get away with bad acting and badly delivered dialogue, but older movies like this can? Kurosawa may be a good director, and it's obvious he has a knack for details, but he should not have saved some of the footage of the actors. The worst ones include Machiko Ky\u00f4 who plays the wife, and Toshir\u00f4 Mifune who played the thief accused of murder. They both made the drama laughable, which is a shame considering the emotional intensity of the story. For whatever reason, they really screwed up in certain points. This cannot just go away softly, there is good acting in older films, but not all of it is good. It is not fair to the actors and actresses of today to receive such heat when films like this don't. That's the main and pretty much only gripe of this film, but it's a major one. Everything else, from the cinematography to the writing to even the musical score, was superb.Bottom Line: The movie touched on a theme about hypocrites (just slightly), and it's time that critics like Ebert, the entire ensemble of Entertainment Weekly and New York Times, and especially the American Film Institute should look into that a bit more. They are all hypocrites. This movie has an excellent story, and does indeed break some new ground in terms of making movies, but does it deserve a nomination into the top films of all-time because of it? No, not at all. The acting should have been much better, and Kurosawa should have whether a) hired other people or b) forced them to perform better. Strip away the bad acting, and we have ourselves easily one of the best movies of the 1900s. Sadly this isn't the case, and the movie overall loses points because of it. Nonetheless, everyone, whether aspiring filmmakers or someone who wants a good story should see this, because a beautifully woven story full of lessons and themes about humanity can be discovered here.",

            "review_title": "A great movie which is almost perfect",
            "content": "While \"Seven Samurai\" is usually referred to as Kurosawa's best film as it usually ranks the highest out of all of his films in \"Best of\" lists, \"Rashomon\" is often compared to it, and the 2 films can often be seen as rivals. The impact that \"Rashomon\" has had on cinema history makes it a pretty strong contender to top it as well.After a priest, a woodcutter, and a commoner take shelter in a former gatehouse, they discuss a murder which happened days earlier. They discuss different sides to the story that the people involved in it said when questioned by the police, all of which contradict each other.What this film is most famous for is its use of flashbacks. Flashbacks were practically non-existent for old movies back then, and most of them were straightforward. \"Rashomon\" stood out from them, and it was very influential when it was released. In the scenes where it shows the suspects giving their sides of the story at the courtyard, they are faced directly at the screen. The police in front of them who you'd expect to be asking questions are never shown on screen, and they never say a word. It feels like the characters are communicating with the viewer, and they're telling them so they can decide which story they believe. This is known as \"Breaking the 4th Wall\". It could be possible that this film influenced this film technique.Another aspect of this film which deserves recognition is its cinematography. The symbolic use of sunlight gives the movie a greater sense of ambiguity. Film critics and professors have discussed what it means in the film. Some critics have said that it's used to represent evil and sin in the film. There was one scene where the woman gave into the bandits demands after she looks up at the sunlight. You could argue that sunlight is used to represent good, while darkness is used to represent evil. Also, director Akira Kurosawa wanted to film in only natural light. However, he had trouble getting enough of it as it was too weak. To solve that problem, he used mirrors to reflect the light. Also, the water used as rain in the gatehouse had to be tinted with black ink so that the cameras would be able to capture it.The weather is a crucial aspect in this film and it also is in many other Kurosawa films. In the scenes at the gatehouse, the weather is rainy most of the time since most of the characters are in a depressed mood after what they experienced at the courtyard. The parts of the film where they discuss the murder all happen during the rainstorm. The rain symbolizes mankind's wickedness. It is present up until the ending where the priest finally restores his faith in humanity. After that, the rain immediately stops and it is replaced with sunshine.A common criticism people have with this film is that they think that its acting is over-the-top. It bugged me at first, but the more I thought about it, I began to realize that there may be a deeper reason for why the acting seemed weak at times. The several scenes of the crime aren't really happening in real life. These are all secondhand accounts of the crime told by the criminals. For all we know, the criminals could've been acting real mellow. We don't know for sure. We are relying on different viewpoints of the crime told by people who all probably have unfavorable opinions of the other people involved in the crime. Even during the scene where the bandit does an over-the-top laugh at the courtyard isn't really happening as well. Those scenes are flashbacks as well told by the 3 men at the gatehouse. This is a very creative technique that Kurosawa added in the film. From what I read, the acting is an extension to a common style of Japanese theatrical acting. However, while the acting may be over-the-top, I still liked it, because it was passionate and charismatic. Something tells me that the acting would've been more sterile if the movie had been released today.Overall, this was a really great movie. It's not my idea of a masterpiece as I felt like the priests' sudden change in opinion at the end of the film was a bit vague. However, that's the only flaw to this film in my opinion. Everything else in it is really good. The flashbacks that Kurosawa presented were really good and original for their time, the cinematography is really symbolic, the weather contributes to the film (which is only the tip of the iceberg), and the acting is actually pretty creative. Despite being over-the-top, it gets much deeper than what many filmgoers say about it. Overall, this is a really great movie, and I'm glad that I watched it. It changed cinema many years ago, and it remains just as vital today.",

And consequently, surprises come with some little disappointments (that generally don't hurt this classic though).One of the early scenes which tells the farmer's encounter with a situation shows Kurosawa's use of lighting. I found it very fascinating, because lighting really plays a big role in this film. In later scenes, some deliberate dynamic lighting effects can be noticed as well, which build up the climax, especially the inner thoughts of characters and certain upcoming twists.Many of those who still haven't watched it might know that the film's talking about honesty and the human nature related to it. It certainly deals with something like self-deception too in this case if you ask me, while I found certain points a bit too exaggerated by today's standard. For instance,the bandit's motivation for admit the kill is quite vague (if everything he tells is true). Even if he just wants to show his bravery and fighting skill, you can't say that one doesn't care about his life most. Average guys would do anything to avoid a death sentence for example. That doesn't quite follow the purpose of lying in this movie: to benefit ourselves that is to say. Another thing is the monk, who stands for a symbol of fairness and righteousness, seemingly cannot tolerate anything that's not righteous, even not much as \"doing evil\". The \"striking\" case can kinda be viewed as something that frequently happens in today's view.But as a movie that was made in 1950, nothing much can be expected perhaps. The ambition it has is really ambitious. The case itself still feels like it can be expanded to deeper depth IMO, but the ending the film is a solid put and leaves the audience huge suspense, depending on how you treat a man that has lied. I'd say due to the era during which this classic was born, some acting seems sort of unnatural. And it over- criticizes dishonesty and selfishness, taking them as considerable dark sides in human nature.",

I'm not sure why I have seemingly avoided this one having watched many other Kurosawa films, but I think it is that it was difficult to believe I would no longer be able to fully appreciate its qualities. The greatness of the film's revolutionary nature has been so absorbed by others as to no longer appear so very inspiring. Another problem is that the more I have been immersed in Japanese cinema the more I have tended to sympathise with the oft held Japanese view that the director is too influenced by the West. This influence has gone both ways, Yojimbo/Fistful of Dollars the most well known example but also his treatment of the plays of Shakespeare. In any event, at least the Blu-ray technology and recent restoration work mean that the film can be seen in all its b/w glory with most of the shooting taking place outside and in the woods. It is beautifully photographed and interestingly structured although the whole notion of people's memories of events differing now seems rather obvious. It is also unfortunate that the conclusion with the baby seems a little heavy handed and to somewhat undermine the earlier 'nature of man' arguments. That it was not unheard of for people to leave dead bodies and newborn babies at temples in the hope that they would be appropriately dealt is something that might be missed by an audience today but in any event does not seem particularly pertinent to the story.",

Everything in the film speaks of the director and his crews' brilliance at their peak, right down to the didactic conclusion that leaves you rather warm and fuzzy inside.[If the ending seems unbelievably abrupt and a cop-out, perhaps it's time to view it as a Kurosawan tendency and plea - at least in his younger years of the 50's - that \"Willpower can indeed cure all human ailings.\" Indeed, it is this willpower to transform the self and social, to presevere in such humanistic ideals that characterize what is widely considered Kurosawa's peak period (50s-60s.)]The sin of EGOISM of the INDIVIDUAL at the cost of SELF and SOCIAL, that is what RASHOMON aims at and achieves masterfully -in a style that emulates the subtle beauty of silent films: the dance of light and shadow in a naturalistic (forest) setting.And yes, the acting cannot be any better (100%+++ for Shimura, Mifune, Mori, Kyo, Ueda.... everybody!!!) If I've made this film sound like serious and heavy-handed stuff, that's because it IS! Equally important is RASHOMON's ability to ENTERTAIN. The film's desire to be visually pleasing as well as intellectually challenging make this a simply unique artwork of AK's genius. Rest in peace, Kurosan.",

Originally a tale in an old Japanese book, the film is the story of a murder told from the four perspectives of the people involved (including the victim, who is chanelled through a gyrating spirit-translator). It has a moral, and is in my opinion one of Kurosawa's best. This is what film is capable of, this is what the medium should be producing - great stories that will stick with us for the rest of our lives and live on far long after.",

I have to say I expected its twist a little bit, but it is the year 2020 and I've seen too many movies already. The film had great intentional lighting in some scenes, and the murder mystery told through its flashbacks only adds to the suspense and intrigue. This film had a great score and for some reason the way the film was shot and told reminded me of Wes Anderson's films. In conclusion, this is a great film cause it demands that you solve its puzzle while you watch. The suspense only escalates throughout the movie, and the climax couldn't have been more satisfying. I give this film a solid 8.9/10 for being entertaining through its web of mystery. The film ended in such a good fashion by having hope being the final factor against the badly infested place of Rashomon.",

            "content": "The concept of \"Rashomon\" is one that resonates within all of us as it demonstrates effectively and clearly a fundamental aspect of human nature. You can see the so-called \"Rashomon Effect\" demonstrated everywhere everyday, be it classrooms, offices, homes, online chatrooms or even in the streets. Anywhere you can find a human. As a species, we are highly opinionated and our impression of events, of people, is largely influenced by what we know of them or how we see them.This is demonstrated by an incident involving a traveler, his wife, and a bandit. The bandit ambushes the traveling party, immobilises the husband, has his way with the wife. What follows after leaves the traveler dead and the bandit and wife fleeing. A woodcutter and priest, who narrate the story through flashback, tell of the three similar yet conflicting accounts of events told from the perspective of the bandit, the life and the traveler)speaking through a spiritual medium)with each claiming to be the killer. A fourth account is given by the woodcutter at the end of the narrative, as he witnessed the whole thing but even his account is unreliable as he lacks a clear vantage point and has reason to lie.This is a rather deceptively simple concept but one which spurred endless versions, imitation or derivative. But it could've all been terrible if not for the skill with which it was shot. Starting from the woodcutter's opening sentence \"I don't understand\" said while taking shelter from a torrential storm, it sets the atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty that fuel the narrative. The acting is well done while Kurosawa's use of lighting, deliberate slow-motion, and zooming in on the facial expressions, generates suspense that could rival Alfred Hitchcock. But one of the best aspects is the ending, which quietly but effectively summarizes the concept. The priest, knowing what the woodcutter has done, immediately assumes that he intends to steal whatever little the baby has while the truth is that the woodcutter wants to adopt the boy. This shows clearly how a person's interpretation of another's actions can effectively colour their perspective of \"truth\".A person who hates another sees nothing but constant affirmation and justification of his hate in each and every one of the other person's actions while a person who loves another comes up with endless excuses for their behaviour. As far as they are concerned, their impression is fact. Truth is somewhere inbetween these two extremes.You can see this everywhere. Even in something as simple as watching a movie. If people hate the director or story, they will nitpick if they have to for something that affirms their hate. If they love the story or the director, they will make endless excuses. Somewhere inbetween is truth and freedom from bias.In conclusion, Rashomon is one of those rare movies that speaks of impressive visual direction, good acting, good concept and excellent storytelling.",

Each time one of the witnesses tells their side of the story, it changes. There's never any question that a murder did occur. The mystery in Rashomon is figuring out who is telling the truth. Or to be even more descriptive, who's story has the least amount of holes. It was a pleasure to watch this. This is what is missing from modern day mystery movies. A great mystery doesn't need to be spelled out to the audience. It's always better to leave a lot up to the individual viewer's interpretation. There are three pieces that hold Rashomon together. The script, which written in 1950 is still smarter and more compelling than all the countless Kurosawa imitators in the years that have followed. The acting brings out the script with so much life and energy. I'm not sure anyone can match Toshiro Mifune's insane madness. The woman gives the most interesting performance in the movie. She actually changes subtle things in her performance from one flashback to the next. Last, the third piece is of course Kurosawa himself. He has become the greatest Director who ever lived. Rashomon was his breakthrough, and it has actually become more well received over time. While it won the Oscar for best Foreign film in 1950, these days it would be handed every Oscar it would be eligible for. Kazuo Miyagawa captured in Rashomon the best Cinematography for any black and white movie. It actually looks more stunning than most color movies. While Seven Samurai and Ran are my very favourite Kurosawa films, Rashomon has to be the most interesting structurally. Mystery does not get better than this.",

Or was it even earlier than the early methodic filmmaking of world cinema? Okay I got it. So, it's just a One Story from 4 different perspectives and at the End Universal Message on Humanity is given. But how is it even possible to tell the same story from 4 different perspectives? How four characters of the film can be subjective and selfish while making up the same story with thier own contradictory versions. This is Amazing. This is never seen before. This is Art and Methodology of filmmaking meeting each other in purest form possible. The rape of a bride and the murder of her samurai husband are recalled from the perspectives of a bandit, the bride, the samurai's ghost and a woodcutter. This confuses everyone in the film and of course audience out of the film and then Dramatically thoughtful climax takes it even Higher. The Dialogues of the films are like knives, knives that cut filth, selfishness hidden in human mind. It applies on both male and females and that's a brilliant move to make it look more universal. Akira Kurosawa displays his Masterclass storytelling. The way he used the camera differently in every storyline for the same incident forces us to reconsider what we just saw and we forget it eventually. He trained all the actors to give four different expressions in all four stories of the same event. Ohh, it's getting so Awesome while reading, no? I haven't seen any other film of Kurosawa but i guess this single one is enough to remember his name. In a nutshell, Rashomon takes you on a methodological ride of filmmaking and believe it or not it took off far ago in 1950.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Not revealing the true plot to the audience is Kurosawa's metaphor of how we all lie to ourselves and to others and how we barely know the truth in so much deception. Then, at the end, Kurosawa provides a moment of beauty and belief, sharpening our faith in human kind rather than fading it. This moral statement is among the best of all films and remains one of Kurosawa's greatest works of art. It is conceivable that Kurosawa made better films, but this early gem is still hard to beat.",

She is filled with shame asks the bandit to free her husband for a duel. He unties him and they battle to the death.The samurai's wife says that she was raped by the bandit and she begged her husband to forgive her, but he refused and she untied him, fainted and woke up with the knife in her hand and her spouse dead on the ground.The samurai's tale is told through a medium. He says that after his wife was raped, she was asked to travel with the bandit and she agreed and asked her attacker to kill her husband as she did not want to be with two men. The samurai killed himself and a passerby removed the knife.The final version is told by a woodcutter who says that he witnessed the assault. The bandit asked the woman to marry him. The woman asks them to fight for her, and at first they are reluctant. After constant ridicule, they have a duel which results in the death of the samurai. The wife takes off.At a temple, a priest, the woodcutter, and another man hear a baby crying. The child has been abandoned and left in a basket.

The lessons i feel Rashomon strongly emphasizes are the fact that each person thinks of their profit, and will do many things to protect what they value the most and/or gain something more, and the fact that truth told by a single person is never the actual truth.That is achieved through the characters retelling what happened between the three of them in the forest, each spinning a new tale that makes them look as the most noble, strong, or innocent, trying to earn sympathy or not lose the pride they have, as previously stated, valuing their own gain more than telling the truth. Through the same points of view, it becomes clear that no single narrator is reliable, because even if you are willing to tell the truth, small exaggerations, omissions, lies, will most likely show up, especially if you were involved in the story you are retelling.A stunning movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime.",

Selfish excuses vs trust in other people. Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.This sort of storytelling different testimonies but no truth at the end, is being utilized by many other later films, the most recent one being 'the white ribbon' (though a little different...because it was about different unresolved cases that seems to appear as signs of a greater evil). However as far as I can tell, none achieved the same level of intensity from such a simple tale as did Rashomon. When the 4th tale is being told, thinking viewers may form assumptions on the motives that made the 3 characters in question declared themselves guilty through their own tales.The woodcutter clearly was not the murderer but there is a motive hidden in him; this leads almost immediately to the full awakening of the general theme of Rashomon. The monk was the character that questioned on the theme throughout the movie, and we as the viewers are cleverly placed in that monk's position towards the end. I think many people did not realise that the main theme was already pointed out early in the film. Many reviews mentioned the 4 tales but there was no account on the tale of the person who caught the bandit. Perhaps, the one dialog in the courtroom right after his tale properly concludes the film itself, \"obviously, a fool can think only foolish thoughts\".

Ilked so much this adaptation, its very simple, but also very well-treated; the actors were great and also the screenplay. First I must say that Kurosawa took a short story from Ryunosuke Akutagawa and extracted all its elements: The Era, the clothes, the traditions, the houses and the bad face of the people, in order to make an excellent movie; all the atmosphere can take the watcher into the Edo time (a bit more ancient than Tokugawa, and introduce us into the realistic environment of that time: the scenery and the photography is another thing that we can include, the sunshines and the forest were some of the best parts, and Kurosawa knew how to balance them. For the other part, Toshiro Mifune should be called \"The Japanese Marlon Brando\"; I mean, he made an excellent Tajomaru, a dirty, but serious thief; many times I thought he was really like that, perhaps one can't see if he is acting or not, and that's something that gives credibility to the movie; the part in which he was tied in the court, just like a dog, is so impressive; I wonder if that was part of medieval Japanese customs, or if both Akutagawa and Kurosawa made that for show a symbolism. \u00a1The Actress! She was also brilliant, I don't know her name, but he creates an excellent, pathetic, weak and coward character; the way he escaped form Tajomaru showed her fear, her cowardliness, and also the infidelity: First she was with the husband, but then, passed to Tajomaru. \u00a1How Pathetic! The character is \"double-faced\" and I love it, and so the actress. Finally, the best part of the screenplay, is that Rashomon is not just a story, but a lot of stories, seeing by each character's eyes: Each tells what they remember about the murder. And all of these are full of reflections about humanity, oneself, the others. Love, loyalty, madness, and great style of samurai fight between two man. In spite of all my comments, however, I must accept that I had problems identifying all these elements, but now since I enter deeply on the movie; all I have to say is that the film industry could not survive without Rashomon. But there are a lot of movies that we still have to see, such as \"The Last Tango in Paris\", from Bernardo Bertolucci, and \"The Last Emperor\" as well, but have faith. Watch movies, and decide if they are one of the greatest or not: the cinema and literature are very identical anyway. Technically are different, I know, but deep inside, they show art, story, love, passion, and tradition, from the countries or from the director's vision.Thank you Mr. Kurosawa, for sharing your talent with the world, and thank you Mr. Mifune, for let us know your unmoral name.",

            "content": "This is essentially a silent film. The dialogue, which is sparse and straightforward, is almost unnecessary. Everything we need to know is shown to us, and shown to us with amazing skill. I can think of few other films that have been as visually profound as this one. Kurosawa is a master painter. He has such an deep, innate understanding of composition and framing. Another such genius is Bergman. They have such skill in conveying emotion and mood with every frame. Speaking of Bergman, this film is similar in many respects to his masterpiece \"Persona.\" Both films undermine their own authority by questioning whether or not film, or mankind for that matter, can be objective. Do we have the ability to determine truth? Are we competent enough to convey that truth? The films are very different in subject matter, but in artistry and philosophy, they are nearly identical. I find it amazing that \"Rashomon\" was made over 10 years before \"Persona.\" I read one comment that compared \"Rashomon\" with \"Hero.\" I thought \"Hero\" was a pretty good movie. It certainly was good looking, with striking choreography. However, \"Hero\" \"cheated\" in that it used color to establish mood and perspective. Though it did do it rather expertly, Kurosawa was working in glorious black and white. He had to use composition and shading--a far more difficult task. Yet he pulled it off with panache. I never doubted that I was looking at the same \"truth\" from a entirely different perspective. This film, though highly cynical, did end on a note of optimism. It wasn't forced or contrived. It fit perfectly smoothly into the storyline. Not many directors could do that. Kurosawa didn't remain as optimistic. One of the most cynical, dreadful endings I have ever seen was Kurosawa's later film, \"Ran.\" That film ends with no hope, no glimmer of goodness, no confidence in mankind. The films were made 35 years apart. Amazing how an individual's perspective can change over the years.",

            "content": "Rashomon deals with a concept embodied in Japanese culture - the subjectiveness of truth - and presents it in a way that is intelligible to western audiences.The film is rich and multi-layered in its use of montage, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, the play of light and shadows in its forest sequences - Kurosawa always admitted that Jean Renoir had been one of his earliest influences. The make-up is skillful, especially in the sequence where the wife is \"possessed\" by her dead husband's spirit. The theatrical opposition of the players contributes to an other-worldly ambiance and the movie has a haunting score. These factors give it a texture which is intriguing and almost dream-like.The characters are supremely well-performed, especially by the always-impressive Toshiro Mifune (playing the bandit) and also by Machiko Kyo (playing the nobleman's wife). It is said that before shooting began each day Kurosawa showed Mifune a short film of a wild lion in the jungle and asked the actor to imitate the creature - after seeing the agitated, nervous and mannerism-ridden bandit he represents I can believe it. Kyo was apparently a relative newcomer to film-making and if so this was a very impressive debut as the in-turns faithful, treacherous, child-like and manipulative wife.Of course, the film attracts its interest chiefly from the story itself - four people tell differing versions of a murder and rape, with three of them individually taking responsibility for the murder - endless analyses have been made to explain it or pronounce it unexplainable but most people agree that it deals with the subjectiveness of the concept of truth. What we regard as true seems to always be heavily influenced by our own standpoint.Although re-filmed by Hollywood as the Outrage (1964) and obviously inspiring more recent films (Courage Under Fire, Snake Eyes) the original is unsurpassable in visual splendor, the vividness of the characters and its enigmatic plot.",

            "content": "Although it might seem like an odd starting point, the first time I heard of Kurosawa's Rashomon was when I read Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking for the first time a few years ago. Within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in Nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information. Anyway, a couple of years after that I read Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's short story \"Rashomon\" and noticed that it really did not fit Chang's brief description of the movie and it was not until I read a later short story in the collection, \"In the Grove\", did I find the actual short story the film was based on.The film Rashomon was Western film audiences' first real exposure to the films of Kurosawa Akira and it ignited the flame of interest in Kurosawa's films for decades to come. And with good reason, because Rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly.During a terrible rainfall three men, a priest, a woodcutter, and a bandit, duck into the ruins of the Rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour. The priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit Tajomaru. Listening to Tajomaru's testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case. He wanted the samurai's wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do. However, after listening to the wife's story and even the dead husband's story through a medium, it is hard to say what the truth\u0085is The old saying goes \"History is written by the victors\" and Rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events, but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it. Kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai, his wife, and the bandit Tajomaru four times within the film's 88 minutes, and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable.",

The basic story is about conflicting testimonials of a particular event, but truely deals not with the audience trying to determine who is telling the truth per se, but rather how everyone \"remembers\" events to their own advantage.The even in question concerns a woman who has been attacked by a roaming bandit, and how she, her husband, and the bandit react in the aftermath. If the film were to be remade today, it would probably star Gretta Scacchi or someother busty beauty, the rape would be graphically displayed as the bandit rips off her clothes, paws at her tits, and humps her on-screen. The rape in  Rashomon was never actually shown, but inferred, and was very obvious. The terror and violation of the woman had to be imagined by the audience making it far more involving than simply passively watching it on-screen. Film directors should take note as to how to properly engage an audience.The acting may not transcend as well to modern audiences, though.

            "content": "This is one of those movies that has become so influential that it almost feels like homework to talk about it. However, it really shouldn't be. Rashomon is a tight 88-minute film that's alternatively funny and incredibly taut while leaving a mountain of material to talk about. It's the kind of art film that can easily break into mainstream conversations because of the kinds of questions that it leaves with its audience. Which of the four stories that we hear are true? It's a very literal question that has no real answer on purpose, so people can navigate clues, intentions, motives, and details day in and day out until they are blue in the face. That central question doesn't concern me, though. I know going in that I'm not going to get a solid answer, that each tale is going to have holes, inconsistencies, or outside reasons to doubt their veracity, and I focus more on the big picture.The film begins with Kikori (Takashi Shimura), a woodcutter, and Hoshi (Minoru Chiaki), a Buddhist priest, sitting in the middle of a rainstorm under the titular citadel gate, joined by the unnamed peasant (Kichijiro Ueda) who becomes the audience for their strange tale. Kikori had come across a dead samurai in the forest three days earlier when he ran to tell the police. The morning of the rainstorm, a court was held to determine the guilty party of the murder, and the pair of the woodcutter and the priest heard the three accounts of the bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune), the samurai's wife (Machiko Kyo), and the samurai's ghost (Masayuki Mori) through a medium (Noriko Honma). All three tales vastly contradict each other to the point where all three have different perpetrators of the murder.The humor of the film largely comes from Mifune as Tajomaru. Instructed to act like a lion by Akira Kurosawa, his movements are animalistic and, as told by Tajomaru, bound as a captive, he's both cocky and seemingly hiding something while being contradictory at the same time. Before he begins his tale, he insists that he did not kill the samurai but that the policeman who captured him did the deed. We then go through his tale and yes, he kills the samurai in the end after a pitched battle that has them crossing swords more than twenty times, a first for an opponent of Tajomaru, according to him. The conflict arose, though, because Tajomaru saw the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest and he decided that he wanted the woman. One detail that is never denied by any of the four total stories is that Tajomaru rapes the wife, her level of willingness and regret is an open question, though. In Tajomaru's telling, for instance, she simply cannot overcome his animalistic sexual appeal, and she simply gives in.The wife is next, and she was discovered in a temple, hiding from the world. She's a broken woman, and her telling begins after the rape where she begs Tajomaru to take her as his wife and kill the samurai to save her shame. Tajomaru simply leaves laughing, and the wife takes her expensive dagger to free her husband, tied up to a tree stump. The samurai simply looks at her with contempt, though, driving the wife into a state of despair and, perhaps, madness. She passes out with the dagger still in her hand, waking up later to find the dagger in her husband's chest.The ghost is third and, as told through the medium, the details change even more. His wife begs for Tajomaru to kill the samurai after her shame, but Tajomaru is not persuaded. In fact, he's disgusted, offering to kill the woman if the samurai wishes it. His wife flees, Tajomaru cuts the samurai's bonds, and the samurai is left alone with his wife's dagger. He plunges the knife into his own chest, killing himself, but, the medium explains, the dagger was taken by somebody.Those three stories were told by the court, but Kikori has a secret. He didn't happen upon the aftermath of the crime, he witnessed it. He refused to recount it to the court out of a sense of self-preservation. He recounts how Tajomaru and the samurai ended up in a pitched battle, much less exquisitely executed on the part of either combatant with the pair rolling around in the dirt, losing weapons, and fighting dirty the whole time, ending with Tajomaru killing the samurai, fleeing after the wife afterwards.So, who's story is true? There are reasons to believe that none of them are. It seems to me that Tajomaru was trying to protect the wife, the wife was trying to protect her own shame and one of the two men, the samurai was trying to damn his wife, and the woodcutter was trying to cover up for his own crime of stealing the wife's dagger from the scene. There's no one telling the story who's free of any bias or motive to elude the truth. There's no answer. Life is messy like that sometimes.So, then what's the point? The point ends up manifesting around the waking and wailing of an unseen infant, hidden under the awning of the gate and out of sight of the three men recounting the tales. The listener steals a nice kimono from the baby, eroding the priest's belief in the goodness of humanity even further after the soul shaking incomprehensible stories he had just heard, but Kikori takes the child to care, adding to his collection of six children already at home. In the messiness of life, we have to find ways forward. Those can be good like Kikori taking the child to care for, and those can be bad like the listener swiping a valuable kimono from a helpless infant.There's a common motif in Kurosawa's films developing at this point, first noticed in Drunken Angel, of characters talking about the meaning of the movie they're in, focused usually around the meaning of the lives of those involved. This is the fully developed form of that idea, completely dominating the whole film as the three characters under the gate in the rain discuss what it all means, coming to no real conclusion. That lack of a conclusion ends up being the conclusion itself, and to get there Kurosawa wrote (along with his cowriter Shinobu Hashimoto) and directed a compelling story of four people with no real answers. It's rare to find a film that is so unwilling to offer up answers to its own questions that gets so embraced by so many people. And yet, this is the film that brought Kurosawa, Mifune, and Japanese cinema at large to the attention of the world, most particularly the critical community. Japan was telling interesting, compelling, and intelligent stories with real flair. The fight as described by Kikori is amazingly tense in its chaotic execution. The rise of the medium is wonderfully creepy, combining the voices of Mori and Honma. The film, to no surprise, is really quite beautiful to look at with Kurosawa's expert eye creating marvelous, natural, and organized framing that helps highlight the right subjects at the right time.Rashomon isn't homework. It's fun. It's interesting. It's classic in the best of ways.",

            "content": "The Japanese film, Rashomon, depicts the story of a single event told from several contradictory perspectives, told through a series of flashbacks. The main elements remain the same through their various tellings, but the emotions and motivations of the characters vary greatly. Director Akira Kurosawa utilizes this approach to great effect, crafting a story that leaves the audience feeling unsure of who to trust and who is to blame.\nWhat each version of the story shares is a young woman catching the eye of the bandit, Tajomaru, resulting in her probable rape, and the cuckolding and death of her husband. What is unclear is who killed the man and why. Somewhat ironically, rather than placing the blame on one another, they each seem to point to themselves as the perpetrator, pointing to the importance of honour in Japanese culture, placing it above honesty or even freedom.\nThe depictions of the flashback are actually one step further removed from reality, as they themselves are recollected by a woodcutter, a priest, and a commoner, who are discussing the trial. The film opens with one of these men proclaiming generally that he just doesn't understand; a theme that continues throughout the movie.\nThe emotions of the actors accentuate the tone of each version of the story and how their characters come across to the audience. Starting with Toshiro Mifune, who plays the bandit Tajomaru, he appears to be the most crazy and unpredictable in his own depiction, feeding into his reputation as a notorious outlaw. The samurai's wife, played by Machiko Kyo, arguably has the largest emotional range and greatest discrepancy in terms of the emotions her character undergoes. Kyo pulls this off very well, ranging from helpless victim to conniving conspirator. The samurai's story doesn't change as much as the others, but since he is unable to tell his version in death, a medium is brought in on his behalf. Although convincing, the medium's depiction serves more to promote herself as divine than to tell the dead man's tale.\nThe camera also plays a role in depicting the tone of the various stories. The trial is shown as each character symmetrically facing the camera directly, answering unheard questions from an unseen interrogator, creating the sense that the characters are speaking to the audience directly, trying to prove their innocence to the camera. Panning wide shots express the passing of time as Tajomaru lures the samurai into the forest. Close-ups reveal the absent look in the wife's eyes as she succumbs to the bandit forcing himself on her. Showing the scene take place from different perspectives of the camera goes a long way to depict the different perspectives of the characters.\nThe idea of a single story told from multiple perspectives has become a classic cinema trope over the years, becoming a favorite for filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, and in films such as Vantage Point and more recently in Bad Times at the El Royale. The device poignantly addresses questions of morality and undermines the reliability of the narrator. Rashomon pushed the audience to question events as they are shown on film, and filmmakers to explore the powerful effect of perspective.",

It was those authorities that conducted a trial at which a priest (Minoru Chiaki), the woodcutter, the widow/victim (Machiko Ky\u00f4); the ghost of her deceased Samurai husband and, finally, the renowned bandit \"Taj\u00f4maru\" (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) are required to testify. We are shown manifestations of each testimony: all smilier but different. Who were the two victims? Was he honourable and decent? Was she demure or a temptress? Are those testifying embellishing what they saw, what they did? What makes this film great is that there doesn't appear to be a right answer. Each version is plausible, nobody is entirely trustworthy and at the end of each story, you could easily agree that was an accurate report on the turn of events. Accompanied by the relentless sound of the rain and by a soundtrack that reminded me very much of Ravel's \"Bolero\" we explore each permutation with some super performances from all concerned, but especially from the almost maniacal Mifune and from Miss Ky\u00f4. Kurosawa packs loads into less than ninety minutes in a salutary lesson in classy and enthralling film making that is quickly paced, characterfully delivered and suitably exasperating at the end!

One of the things that comes to mind the fastest about 'Rash\u00f4mon' is its structure. The essential story of the film is the re- telling of a crime: a murder(?) and a rape. The incident involves an infamous bandit named Taj\u00f4maru (Toshir\u00f4 Mifune), a samurai called Takehiro (Masayuki Mori) and his wife, Masako (Machiko Ky\u00f4). The trial is told by a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) to a skeptical and cynical commoner (Kichijiro Ueda). The three men are seeking shelter under a gate during heavy rainfall when the film opens, and through out most of the film the rain is there. As the film progressives and different stories are told, the viewer notices something different about each story. Perhaps its what happened to whom, or what happened to what exactly, but these changes mark an interesting note about human nature. This same method, albeit used less psychologically, was always featured in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Killing' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Jackie Brown'. The narrative definitely works, and if anything its what defines the film. Kurosawa effortlessly weaves a magnificent tale of treachery and deceit as well as kindness in the end in an elaborate tale about humans and the way they act. The performances, especially by Mifune and Ky\u00f4 are definitely superb. Mifune (who also plays a great character in two other Kurosawa films: 'Yojimbo' and 'The Seven Samurai') is filled with kinetic energy and definitely chews his scenes up. Ky\u00f4 gives a more feminine performance naturally, and adds to it some more emotions of a woman emotionally weak yet at the same time quite cunning. The direction by Kurosawa is sweeping as the story progresses on and on, and observe how the characters are practically talking to the audience during the trial scenes. The script, based on two stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa is also brilliant, filled with not only memorable dialogue, but cutting edge dialogue from its time. To say the film is paced slowly is correct, yet at the same time it manages to hold the viewer's interest. Also deserving mention is the gorgeous cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa, the scenes in the forest look absolutely stunning. All being said, 'Rash\u00f4mon' is more than deserving of its status in film history, and should also be remembered as a great masterpiece. 10/10",

In a nutshell, a terrible crime is committed and various people tell their wildly differing tales of the transpired events.A man dodges torrential rains to shelter under a town's gate. Two other men, one older and the other a priest, are already there. The older one keeps muttering that he \"can't understand it.\" What can't he understand, asks the new guy. And so the older man, a woodcutter, tells his tale. He'd been out in the woods a few days prior and came across a lady's hat, a samurai's cap, pieces of cut rope\u0085and a dead man. The woodcutter explains to his companions that he ran to find the police. The scene shifts to a minimalist outdoor courtroom, where the woodcutter testifies. The next witness is led by a rope by a man who claims to have caught him \u2013 the prisoner is a bandit, played by the legendary Toshiro Mifune. His captor says he came upon the bandit after the latter had apparently been thrown from his horse and was slaking his thirst at a lake. After the captor tells his tale, the impulsive bandit ridicules him and gives his version, which begins with his spotting a young lady riding a horse in the forest, being led by her husband, a samurai.The bandit says that he wanted the young lady for himself, so he lured the samurai away from her and then attacked him, tying him up with rope. Then he abducted the lady and had his way with her, with the husband still tied up. The end result is that the samurai is killed.The lady follows with her story, and then we get a third version from the deceased samurai, through a medium. Each of the speakers blames someone else for the murder, and other details in their stories don't match, either.Okay, so there's plenty more that I'm intentionally leaving out so I don't spoil this 60-year-old movie for you all.

It's definitely a classic. But there is a plot point I have an issue with. We hear these stories, and it's obvious that only one can be the truth \u2013 they contradict each other, but they do so consistently. That is, the same detail will differ from story to story.

I have read the short story by Akutagawa(which is great), which is about 20 pages.  Consequently, I do not understand why the film lasts so long. So I do not say that it is an awful movie, but I don't think that it is worth calling \"the best movie in the world\".  I do not want to forbid to see the movie, since it is still interesting, but think by yourself before saying that it is super, as almost everybody say.",

I think that Kurosawa and Co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto(I love his works) didn't wanted to tell nothing about any story. They maybe wanted to create some form of inside human, so no wonder every character's testimonies in this film are changing all the time. Never still, no one knows what is the truth. In my opinion, I got it like this that if you dare trying to understand something, why don't you start trying understand yourself first. If you knew yourself well, you can understand anything. as well as whats happened in that bush. Just my opinion.",

            "content": "The movie's use of conflicting flashbacks has been copied a great deal since 1950, and so it does not amaze us the way it must have viewers of the time. Eventually, however, Kurosawa's powerful images and emotions do engross us: The numb shock of the men recalling the testimonies, the mysterious, bleak self-hatred of the people who confess to the killing, the passionate extremes of behaviour in the flashback sequences. These combine to reach an extreme pitch; the film even manages to pull off the gamble of showing us a speech straight from hell.The ending is curious. If it were to be taken at face value and we were to simply accept that the priest's faith in human nature had been justly restored, I might find it tacked-on and blindly faithful. But it seems more complex than that -- appropriate for Kurosawa, who throughout his life went through bouts of severe cynicism and depression. If there's positivity to be gotten from it, it's this: Yes, humans are terrible animals, and we do not have an innate sense of principle, but at least we're able to learn from our mistakes, understand the concepts of right and wrong, shame ourselves into doing better.",

            "content": "Rashomon is the movie that put Japanese cinema on the map internationally, marked the breakthrough of renowned director Kurosawa Akira and brought lead actor Mifune Toshiro to stardom. More than seven decades later, experts and fans agree that this movie has certainly stood the test of time. Let's take a closer look at where this film excels and what could have been improved in hindsight.First and foremost, this movie convinces with a truly intriguing story. It tells the story of a love triangle between a ruthless bandit, an honourable samurai and his emotional wife. When the samurai is found dead in the forest and the bandit arrested by a villager, the entire case goes to court. This film tells what might or might not have happened from four different perspectives. The bandit claims that he experienced love at first sight upon seeing the wife, tricked her husband witfully and then fought an honourable duel with the skilled samurai whom he ended up murdering after a long fight. The wife claims that the bandit left after raping her and that she then got rejected by her cold husband as well which led to her trying to commit suicide to atone for her shameful situation. The dead samurai speaks through a medium and claims that after having been raped, his wife tried to convince the bandit to murder her husband since she couldn't accept belonging to two men but the bandit refused, the wife fled and the humiliated samurai committed suicide. A woodcutter who was hiding in the forest and didn't testify in court describes that the bandit asked the wife to leave her husband and marry him to which the wife replied that the two men had to fight each other to the death, so that she could join the survivor which led to a pitiful duel that the bandit won through a stroke of luck while the wife fled the scene in disgust. As it turns out, none of the four testimonies is entirely true as the witnesses are guided by self-interest and try to make themselves look better than they actually are by twisting the facts. It's up to the viewer to put the different pieces of the puzzle together and imagine what could actually have happened.Another element that stands out is the use of settings in the film. This movie wants the viewers to focus on the twisted story and avoids adding too many characters, locations and side stories. There are only three different settings. First of all, there is a heavily destroyed city gate where a woodcutter, a priest and a commoner seek refuge from a storm and discuss the trial. This setting serves as prologue and epilogue to the story and the location also gives the film its title. Secondly, we can observe the courtyard where the bandit, the wife and the dead samurai speaking through a medium give their testimonies. This setting presents us the aftermath of the crime and how the different characters are dealing with its consequences. Thirdly and lastly, the movie introduces the scene of the crime, a clearing in a dense forest in medieval Kyoto. This setting shows us how the actual crime might or might not have happened through the perspectives of the three characters involved in the crime and a hidden bystander.One more element that deserves to be mentioned is the use of weather throughout the film. The first shot shows a particularly heavy storm that sets the atmosphere for a tale of deceit, honour and murder. Throughout the movie, the element of enhanced sunlight with the help of mirrors is used in contrast with darker shots. This element is used to portray good and bad intentions of the different characters. The film's final scene portrays how the woodcutter saves an abandoned baby as the storm comes to an end and sunlight emerges to evoke a happy ending since the priest's faith in mankind has been restored by the selfless woodcutter after having listened to so many deceitful tales. However, there are already clouds on the horizon, showing that good events are often followed by bad events and the other way around as life's twists of fate are unpredictable.Despite the aforementioned excellent elements, this movie isn't perfect and I will point out the few elements that bothered me. First of all, this movie is very slow-paced and includes too much repetition. The opening scene is quite revealing in that regard. The woodcutter is sitting under the city gate, his stare is blank, his head is shaking and he keeps repeating over and over again that he doesn't understand what he has just been witnessing. He keeps saying this to himself, then to the priest sitting nearby and then to the commoner who joins them. This scene could have been efficient and to the point in thirty seconds but is stretched to three exhausting minutes. The anticipation that is being built up is completely exaggerated here as one expects something truly shocking to have happened to the woodcutter only to realize that he is merely talking about a court trial that he has been witnessing over the past few days.Another element that is typical for the early years of Japanese cinema and inspired by traditional theatre is the overacting. While this element is supposed to make the scenes more intense, one has to admit that it hasn't aged well at all. This element of exaggeration lessens the element of authenticity and unintentionally makes serious scenes look slightly amusing. For instance, the fact that the bandit keeps laughing loudly and wildly for no reason becomes quite exhausting throughout the film. The same could be said about the testimony of the wife in court who keeps crying, screaming and rolling herself in the dirt over and over again.Despite those minor flaws, Rashomon's reputation is excellent and the film's creative qualities in terms of storytelling, special effects and directing have stood the test of time. Anyone interested in the history of cinema or in Japanese art should definitely be familiar with this film. There are other movies by Kurosawa Akira that I appreciate more such as Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and The Hidden Fortress but Rashomon is certainly his most influential film and deserves much credit for its remarkable innovation.",

            "review_title": "Roshomon: The First CSI?",
            "content": "If you are a fan of CSI or courtroom dramas, the style of this film may seem familiar. Director Kurasawa Akira broke a lot of ground with this film from the cinematography to the storytelling. He adapted two short stories by Akutagawa Ryunosuke called \"Roshomon\" and \"In a Grove\". The film is told in a series of flashbacks by four witnesses to a rape and murder, including the murder victim (a samurai) through a medium. To make it somewhat more complicated, these flashbacks are told through flashbacks of a witness at the trial. As with those shows of today, such as CSI and courtroom dramas, each person has a completely different story and it is left up to you to be the judge.The film visits the idea of truth. Who is telling the truth? Can anyone ever really know the truth? What is truth? The film also visits the state of man at the time, filmed a few short years after WWII in 1950, Kurasawa seems to be asking a question about the selfishness and self-centeredness of man. Does man need to be selfish to survive? You will have to judge for yourself if you agree with how he answers these questions by the end of the film.I enjoyed this film. Reading the short stories the story is based on helped my understanding of the film, not to mention some background information on the director. The setting was very appropriate for the story. I liked the flashbacks from the different characters' points of view. The camera work, from a film history perspective, was very well done and I enjoyed the music which added to the overall effect.If you don't like foreign films or story lines with flashbacks, stay away. Also if you are expecting great sword play or fighting scenes, I will warn you now\u0085it's not what you'd expect",

            "content": "So as an American audience you might tend to think \"so, who did it?\" which means we're missing the entire point of the story. It isn't about whom really did it; it's about the fact that you may never know. But what's more important than you never knowing is that a person can fix his or herself which is what you see at the end; a sort of light at the end of the tunnel effect.Kurosawa is an excellent director. He was the first to point out the deception of human beings, through camera angles and verbal cues. I thought the actors were amazing. I thought he sort of showed that anyone, even those of court, may be deceptive, but he did so in a very respectful way. He had the poor man flicking off bugs and laughing like a crazy man, which I thought was hilarious because he was so unbelievably psychotic. He then showed us the very well put-together wife and samurai. Kurosawa then smacked everyone in the face by showing us even those of court can be deceptive, which is hard to take.However at the end when he showed the woodcutter showing that he really wanted to change his ways and not be evil, Kurosawa gives us a taste of hope. The most interesting thing in the whole movie, though, is when we see the woodcutter walking away from his own ignorance, and the rain stops, but the monk is still stuck in the ignorance. I thought that was such a good way of showing that even if you're religious you may still have to find your own way. The monk didn't show him the way, the woodcutter found it on his own.Despite so many genius ways of portraying an idea, there are still some things that may drive an American audience crazy, such as the very long camera shots that follow the characters, but to get the point of the movie you'll just have to get over it. To find out what Kurosawa is really saying you have to look at it through a non-American perspective. You have to get over the long camera shots following the people, the screaming baby the monk can't hold it the right way, the very weird eyebrows on the women, and the fact that you want to know who committed the crime. So the only people I would not recommend this to those who cannot get past this, but if you can it's worth watching.",

            "content": "1st watched 11/21/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Akira Kurasawa): Well done mystery morality tale by acclaimed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. The story is told in flashbacks and is about an encounter between a bandit, a samurai and his wife in the woods. The samurai is found dead but how did he die and who killed him? The story is told initially by the man who found the body supposedly during a rainy day where there is not much else to do. The story ends up being told from many other perspectives and each telling is different. There is an evil aspect in every telling which causes one of the listeners to lose total confidence in man and his negative possibilities. This is a very deep and emotional film that mostly involves male characters, which is very unique in films of any kind. The lone female character is deceptive, evil and not to believed. Of all the stores told, we really don't know what truths are within each of them -- only that a man is dead. This is the beauty of this film made by Kurasawa as he plays with our thoughts to the very end. When it's over we're still thinking and this, in my opinion, is the mark of a good film. We really go away not caring who did it, but we learn a lot about human nature and it's inadequacies and what really matters most to us. This is a classic movie by this brilliant Japanese icon of film.",

            "content": "Rashomon the movie, which was released in the 1950's, has many traditional and modern Japanese themes integrated into it. Everything in the movie represents some sort of traditional or modern period aspect of moral decay. Akutagawa is credited with writing Rashomon in 1915, and Kurosawa produced the movie in the 1950, but there views are very different. Akutagawa's depiction of Rashomon shows how there was no hope for survival, but Kurosawa shows how there could be hope for mankind through symbols like the sunlight at the end of the movie. Everything in the movie has symbolism; the gate that was falling down can be looked at as the moral decay in humans, and evil taking over. Kurosawa filmed the movie from traditional time periods, and reinterpreted it as modern problems. Kurosawa represents moral frailty in the movie through the wood cutter. The wood cutter sees moral decay, death and killing all around him, and he finally gives into evil also. But what Kurosawa represents is light at the end of the tunnel, or hope for man kind through the wood cutter. Even though the wood cutter gave into evil, his willingness to accept a starving child into his famished household shows how he forgot about his attachments and thought of helping someone else. This Buddhist idea does not show up in the Akutagawa story. Rather, Akutagawa only showed how there was no hope for mankind. In the movie each person told the story that made them look the most noble and respectable, this made the narrator very unreliable, and made the story unconcluded as a whole. Even today, in the western culture there are very few movies that have narrators that are unreliable, and the movies that do always conclude with the facts. Rashomon as a whole was a very well filmed movie with non-traditional ways of capturing the audience, between its odd views of the landscape and the obscure camera angles, this movie paved the way for creative directing and movie producing. Rashomon was a well written well filmed movie about 11th century Japan reinterpreted as modern problems of moral decay, that is thought of as one of the best foreign films around.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful metaphor of \"The Passion\"",
            "content": "Japanese cinema dealt with some huge philosophical questions during the early 1950s. Ikiru with the significance of a man's life, Seven Samurai with an elaborate twist on class distinction and Godzilla with fears of nuclear devastation. This was inevitable after such human and environmental tragedy that was experienced in Hiroshima, and more importantly Nagasaki. Rashomon itself, is a beautiful metaphor of Christ's Passion. The same story told in four different ways, ending with same conclusion i.e. the death of an innocent man. Like the Passion, the audience cannot say for sure if one is correct, elements of all four stories are correct or the whole story is false. Kurosawa earns his crew's jocular nickname \"wind man\" in this film as the movie is played out in incessant rain and howling wind, apart from rather ironically, in the outdoor courtroom, possibly so as not to deflect from the witnesses statements. The heavyweights of Japanese acting appear here, Shimura, Mifune and Chiaki are all excellent as is Kichijiro Ueda (who I'd never seen previously) as the refreshingly honest and intellectual bandit. Kurosawa's films at times use dialogue only as means to move forward the plot and this can make them seem stilted and even clich\u00e9d, I have always found this was meant as a time saving device rather than an under-cooking of the story, particularly as Kurosawa finds some wonderful imagery both visually and via the plot. Summing up, there will never be another director who is able to ask such poignant questions of man so elegantly as Kurosawa and this film delivers for me his understanding of such an important period of our written history.",

It was certainly not that... well it was in one part, but I'll leave that out. Anyway, what I was amazed about was that as each character told their part of the horrible crime of humanity that took place, I completely forgot that it was an old movie and was focused on who did what. This movie is in the top ten for many directors out there for a reason. Despite it being considered an antique by most young people out there, the message and story have withstood the test of time- it's a work of art that brings up that question of human nature and how we even bother living with all the bad things going on in the world. Thanks to pretty much every aspect being open to different interpretations, the story is unique to each and every viewer. Whatever they've experienced in life, they probably can relate to the story.The choreography and cinematography was a great combination that is sure to keep even the modern viewer at the edge of their seat (particularly the frantic fight scene).

The moral of the story is excellent, but the plot doesn't seem to take you any deeper than that. I \"got it\" after watching it the first time, and see little reason to go back and see it again. Technically, the film is outstanding. The shots in the forest are beautifully filmed, and the shots looking directly into the sunlight are certainly very interesting.

Even for the styles of 1950s, this film does not seemed as a movie of great content to me.The main reason the movie was mediocre is the story. The story was about mystery but they hyped it as it was a great mystery which baffled the characters of the film. But actually the mystery was stale and unappealing. In every version of the story the final outcome stays the same and there was not much variation between stories.In my opinion it was an average film, does not deserve this high ratings.

Then from my standpoint, I prefer to insist the writer's name; Akutagawa Ryuunosuke, the novelist who has been well-known as a distinguished creator of Japanese tales for 100 years. His works are still outstanding and amazing! About the story, unconsciously I was being absorbed in the three witnesses' recollected scenes which are beautifully idealized by their ego. They are described well enough to show Japanese-like individualities. One of the samurai is so impudent and esteems a strength as a soldier. Another samurai is much more loyal person who tends to respect the beauty of transilent life. A woman thinks much of obedience to men and modest temper. The other extras, that consequently organize the story, are also true as obvious Japanese feature, for example a priest. The description of each character doesn't complete this film as just a mysterious ,silent, or gloomy story as a usual image toward Japanese film. It is rather an extremely funny and well-arranged fairy tale.",

I know I'm not very original, but some of my favorite movies are Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia, and one of my favorite directors of all time is Hirokazu Kore-eda.I've been looking forward to seeing Rashomon, since it's a classic which has been highly influential in movie history. It almost feels a bit like blasphemy, but I didn't like it.The concept, the very basic idea about the subjectivity of truth, unreliable narrators etc., is great, and it's easy to see why so many other films have been influenced by this movie. But the execution leaves much to be desired. Perhaps it's unfair to judge an old movie according to modern standards, but here we go.Both the story and character work is stretched gossamer thin, which is not very surprising since the movie is based on a 20 page long short story. The acting is so over the top, a phenomenon far too common in Japanese movies (especially by Kurosawa), that it pulls me right out of the story. Especially Mifune is chewing the scenery so ferociously that you'd think it's the last bowl of rice in a North Korean labor camp. But the others, especially the wife, aren't far behind. Perhaps there's a reason for why the women's eyebrows are in the middle of their forehead, but I have to say it was quite distracting. However, I most likely wouldn't even have paid attention to it if I was engaged in the story. It was only 95 minutes long, but it felt like an hour longer. A producer once told me that he knew a movie was successful if he didn't look at his watch. If that is anything to go by, this movie failed.",

Is there a way to overcome individual biases?I think it presents these questions in an interesting manner and at the end, there is no final answer to the question of what the objective truth is, if there even is one. So, philosophically, I think it's an interesting movie. Some parts I found very entertaining, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't kind of bored throughout the movie. Maybe it's the part about me that prefers a more conventional story in the sense of you actually kind of know what happened.I understand Kurosawa's choice to not reveal the truth, or perhaps it's that he doesn't believe there is one, I'm not sure, but I think I would have been more satisfied on a personal level if it what actually happened were revealed.

            "content": "In the late 50's, Akira Kurosawa was deemed a rather outlandish director before he became an auteur and a real innovator. This was essentially because his range included a large repertoire of Western Conventions with the crossover of Japan's Conventions that he executed so differently, yet so powerfully. A contingent of japan would deprecate him, not because of the quality of his work, but rather the aberrance of his movies. But when his movies really spanned across the world that unconventional streak Akira had with his movies in Japan slowly piqued American audiences eyes at the genre crossover (the influential luminary he would become in the 20th century would be tenable by directors such as George Lucas, who had the concept of the lowest character Point of View for \"Star Wars\" from \"Hidden Fortress\", Sergio Leone's inspiration from \"Yojimbo\" to create the leading character for his Dollar Trilogy, Steven Spielberg honouring him at his Life Time Achievement Award and lauding his work and Darren Aronofsky, who has said that one of the scenes in \"Requiem for a Dream\" became inspired and heavily dictated by Kurosawa's unique usage of camera angles that was so overbearing for him to imitate, testifying that Kurosawa was really beyond time) and by explicating it more into the 21st century, you will notice this in many movies with his use of music (leitmotivs), his use of segues, his skill with rain in dramatic scene, his mise-en-scenes. The only thing from \"Rashomon\" that has never seemed to catch on is the One Dimensional Character coming centre stage as we go through the environment of \"Rashomon - or more accurately, the uncertainty of \"Rashomon\". So this wasn't Kurosawa's debut film (in fact, he actually directed 11 movies before this and a couple of scenes in Uma), but it was his first lofty film and Kurosawa's first shot at becoming fully fledged master of cinema. Rashomon - everybody should really know what the movies story is - but if you don't, it's about 3 Narrative POVs that include a couple of wood cutters, Toshiro Mifune (portraying Tajomaru implicated in a crime case - if you look at the character development of his illicit character, it's so disparate now to see him in protagonist roles, where he would become the symbol of morality, anti-hero or fallen warrior. In this movie he is clear-cut evil) and a wife of the man who got killed by Tajomaru (apparently). With the one dimensional character that comes to the Rashomon under a shelter from the rain, we see that he will spark contention and bring an audience's confusion through his subordinate POV to the whole story about these other events whether fabricated flawlessly or feigned unconvincingly. The movies premise: lies; the movies focal point is more about fearing the truth, as the heinous crime that the plot centres around brings our characters to boiling point - and how Akira Kurosawa directs the flashback scenes to show how implausible some of the stories really can be. Times, places, points and evidence - This is where the movie really shines is how it revolutionised the Narrative Structure that Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" would adopt. Some of my favourite things about this movie to me is the the real human condition that gets analysed and the foundation of the world that Kurosawa composes. It has amazing Black and White, making the images and iconography eidetic. It really shows how eclectic the art of Japanese Cinema can really be (I have always misunderstood Japanese cinema until I found Kurosawa and When you listen to the wife's story this subtext element becomes cognitive to the audience that... something is going wrong and something flagitious is changing the ideas aforementioned. I think it's one of these movies that can be set aside after watching it, but you feel the veritable impact it has. I gave this movie an 8, as while I still love the movies arresting plot devices and low brow characters, I still feel subsequent from watching it, you will feel like you're missing something (a very indifferent ending), the sun, however, makes this unclear and kind of leaves this in the dark. However my score is really because I feel it is very much variegated in our understanding of what the movie is - will there be retribution? Will there be salvation ultimately climaxing the events that merry the films Aesop/point? Was that guy who exited the frame, deciphering the story, know who they were? The movie is quite ambiguous, while it still tries to make you embrace the facts already exposed, although this is notional. The movies set up may just be a suspenseful artifice to make you feel a certain visceral impact to whether or not something was omitted or something was substituted due to being too multi-dimensional or faceted. Either way the narrative with what it has backing it, tells it with substantive eloquence. I moreover feel Stanley Kubrick (my favourite director) actually takes inspiration from this movie, in terms of its assiduous study of the human condition and his style backing this notion.Anyway, I feel the longevity of Rashomon shows that it is not as antediluvian as its age suggests. It's an adroit study of deception being a crime heinous enough to equate to the crime being studied bringing us back to the epigram \"What you don't know can't hurt you\" and then slanting the meaning in it.",

Man desires hope to achieve his goals, ironically, it is man who is also the one who can take it away.The entire movie is about 90 minutes with just enough dialogues to fill about 3 pages. The cast has only 6 characters with no special effects, no trick photography(if even existed at that time), no panoramic locations, not even a fake blood spatter. Yet, it has unparalleled detail and complexity. If not the best, it certainly is one of the best implementations of directing and screenplay in the history of cinema. Basic synopsis : \"Spoiler Alert\"Three people tell their version of a heinous crime committed near osaka, Japan. All have different details with each one trying to save his honour. The mystery of who is right and wrong seems to have been solved when the 4th version is revealed. Little does it matter thought when even this version has its own new culprit. A display of \"evil\" and an act of retribution brings about the twist and unravels ideology behind the movie.Overall, one needs about 90 minutes to watch this movie and a lifetime to show their praise for it.

            "content": "A stunning breakthrough in Japanese cinema, Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" is a film like no other in playing with the expectations of moviegoers from the East to the West. Nearly six decades after the movie's release, it still remains strikingly fresh and original.In 11th-century Japan, four witnesses (Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Fumiko Honma & Takashi Shimura) narrate different versions of the story of a man's murder and the rape of his wife. Each story is told so thoroughly flawless that you might ask several questions: Which character is lying? And which character is telling the truth? However, you might need to figure those answers out for yourself.Acknowledging the innovative cinematography from Kazuo Miyagawa, Kurosawa conveys his meticulous attention to detail and stylized compositions into a film that would break cinematic conventions. Nevertheless, \"Rashomon\" is a groundbreaking achievement in movie-making for many reasons: It is among the first films to utilize non-linear storytelling, to deal with taboo subjects like attempted rape and to be a major Japanese picture released outside of the homeland.From a reviewer's prospective, the actors really gave perfect performances by being naturalistic instead of borderline melodramatic. Mifune delivers bravura enthusiasm in the role of Tajomaru the Bandit with fierce tenacity and wicked magnetism. Of course, I wouldn't forget about the two actors that stood out among the eight principal players: Machiko Kyo and Takashi Shimura. As the suffering female victim, Kyo certainly brings a shred of innocence into her character's fatigued state of mind. And as the amiable woodcutter, Shimura becomes a humane focus for the final story that leaves an open conclusion.Masterful and way ahead of its time, \"Rashomon\" is just a perfect film in every way possible to spend your 88 minutes. As a deserved reward for his triumph, Kurosawa finally becomes the master.",

I usually took his word in such situations but when he gave me the DVD and I saw that it was an old black & white Japanese movie I never made an effort to watch it. After watching Rashomon, by Akira Kurosawa \u0096 same director as Seven Samurai, I must say that I'm intrigued to see his other work now.Not only is his directing and scenery like what we are use to seeing in movies today, he is the pioneer of this. His camera angles and lighting are amazing. I like the way that he shows the sun through the trees as the woodcutter is walking through the woods and also as the camera follows the bandit and Samurai. Also, I must say that I am a fan of the way he incorporated the rain as a mood throughout the movie.Another quality thing about this movie was the characters. I would say really good job on the actors' parts, although the bandit's laughing annoyed me. I really like the way the Samurai's story was told through a medium. The scene was dark and scary; an element I didn't know could be used so well in older movies such as this one.Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie. Although, just as all movies, its not one that everyone will like. I would say fans of film, movie buffs, and fans of Japanese work would love this. Hats off to Kurosawa, I pay close attention to the way that films are directed and edited because it is one of my favorite elements of a movie, and he did a fantastic job.

            "content": "Before there was Kurosawa, there was \"Rashomon;\" the Japanese master's cinematic triumph is what began to open Western audiences to his country's rich film history. Though most of the reviewers here understand the power of Kurosawa's revolutionary narrative, I think some have placed a bit too much emphasis on the surprise and plot-discovery. Though correct, the classics don't become classics unless there's something besides the occasional plot twist, and its for these other reasons that \"Rashomon\" will continue to endure beyond original but thematically empty works like \"Memento.\" Other than the traditional staples accorded to this film like the maniacal acting and gritty cinematography, \"Rashomon\" is quite simply a testament to the visual power of cinema. Adapted from a short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa, the device in literature of multiple perspectives telling different versions of the same story is nothing groundbreaking; what is remarkable is Kurosawa's presentation. We aren't really ever told what happens; we SEE each and every story, and it's those obvious and not so obvious differences one must note and observe to get the entire idea. Kurosawa here was doing something extraordinary: he managed to deliver one powerful message on the darkness of the human heart through four ostensibly different narratives of the same event, but without ever providing any semblance of a corrective; it's a mystery that is unexpectedly \u0096 and inexplicably - never solved, but because of the distinct characters and intensely dramatic nature of the situation, we forget this while realizing afterwards such obfuscation of a \"correct\" version is the very point.\"Rashomon\" goes beyond the short story it is based on by delivering not just different events in each telling, but also a totally different mood via sparse music and flawless camera placement. No story ever duplicates itself in technique, and the result is essentially four separate short films tied together with one unflinching narrative thread. The themes of despair are thus delivered on several levels: the narratives, the performances, and the actual structure of the film itself. This, frankly, is something cinema can only accomplish. The glib bleakness of the thing presses upon us further and further upon every warped retelling. But perhaps Kurosawa thankfully couldn't completely stomach the hopeless nature of mankind just yet (as he would show in the unrelenting \"The Lower Depths\" and even \"The Bad Sleep Well\"). As the too-pat but ultimately uplifting ending suggests, mankind is merciless, but family life can provide shelter against the onslaught of a storm.Lastly, like nearly all of his other films, I don't think Kurosawa was trying to deliver any existential message on the loss of truth in contemporary society here as well. The director himself said he wished this film was more timely when he accepted the Palme d'Or at Cannes. More to the point, if we consider that there is no truth, none of these characters \u0096 the bandit, the aristocrat, et.al \u0096 could willingly lie right? To quote another insightful reviewer on IMDb on a different Kurosawa classic, the man was a humanist, not an existentialist. Even with its tiny flaws and detractors (Pauline Kael infamously carped that the film was marred by a score that sounded like Ravel's \"Bolero\"), \"Rashomon\" is perfect enough. It's a classic, after all.",

While the heavy rain is pouring down to the ground, the woodcutter and the priest take turn for telling the commoner the stories of the dead samurai from the mouth of the bandit, the samurai's wife, and the samurai himself (in the ghost mode). From this point the film continues repeating the same event, but there is always something which creates contradiction with the previous or the latter version of the event. As you are watching the film, you would get confuse and eventually feel frustrated because you couldn't tell what really happened inside the woods. And perhaps we don't suppose to figure out at all. Akira Kurosawa, the director of Rashomon, told his assistant directors who didn't understand the script that the script is comprehensible already, even though there isn't any solution given inside the script. In Rashomon, Kurosawa didn't create a film which is formed in classical narrative structure (exposition, rising action, climax, resolution). What he created is a film that doesn't treat flashback as reality of the past. This is perhaps why Rashomon become one of a few films that being discussed over and over again in film studies classes.",

            "content": "It is hard to overstate how innovative Kurosawa was when he filmed 'Rash\u00f4mon'. Flashbacks had been used in earlier films, but always as a storytelling device. Kurosawa, by contrast, used them to demonstrate two essential aspects of life: First, that lying is human (as one of the characters points out), and second, that when we depend on verbal accounts of the past, there is no way to be sure of what 'really' happened. You might say that there are as many realities as there are people who remember the past. 'Rash\u00f4mon' is extremely well-acted, with Kurosawa's favourite Toshir\u00f4 Mifune standing out. It is also beautifully filmed: For example, the way the rain is used to to make it immediately clear which scenes are flashbacks and which are not is brilliant. The pacing is slow, but that actually helps the viewer to compare the stories the protagonists are telling. Combining and comparing these stories turns 'Rash\u00f4mon' into a cautionary tale: It cautions us against believing others not merely because they may be dishonest (including to themselves), but because human memory is bound to trick us. Our brain distorts our memories, frames them in inappropriate ways and modifies them without us being able to control this or being aware of it (as J. Fried has shown in 'Der Schleier der Erinnerung' (The Veil of Memory), 2012). This puts detectives trying to solve criminal cases just as much in an awkward position as historians who attempt to reconstruct the more distant past. In fact, 'Rash\u00f4mon' should be required viewing not only for them, but for anyone interested in the past.",

            "content": "There has never been a film like \"Rashomon\" ever before, and there will never be a film like \"Rashomon\" ever now. \"Rashomon\" is in my terms, \"the perfect film\". I'm aware that some people will of course say \"Godfather\" is better than \"Rashomon\" because well, \"Godfather\" is always ranked in the top #10 greatest film lists from critics and the internet all the time. I am also aware that there is no perfect film. However, when you can achieve a level of power by visual storytelling like \"Rashomon\" or \"Godfather\", you might as well call it \"the perfect film\", even if it's close to perfection because we can never achieve that \"perfection\" that our human minds so need desperately. What qualifies \"Rashomon\" as a perfect movie is that all technical aspects and detail has been examined and executed well enough to lure us into the world of the film itself. \"Rashomon's\" specialty in this case, is the strong voices of its cast, the cinematography that's still stunning, and the overall influence that still makes the movie cunning. \"Rashomon\" also started the future careers of Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and several other Kurosawa mains outside of Japan with their well received films.A story can never be made without having a character that is, human or unhuman. Without a character, it is simply a moving gallery of moving pictures. The choice of actors and the wonderful actresss as the main characters was the jackpot of Japanese cinema. Getting three powerful Japanese actors/actress into one movie where each of their voices can be heard clearly with levels of emotions planted on each line. Toshiro Mifune plays as the crazy bandit who is the one that commit the crime of the murder a swordsman and the rape of an innocent lady. His role probably influenced him few years later when he plays another character with the same characteristics in Seven Samurai. Interesting enough, he created his own character for Seven Samurai. The strong and fast moving athleticism of the bandit certainly was an important ability that the actor will need for the role and Mifune himself executed this to his max. When watching the battles throughout the film, Mifune constantly squirms and run while running away or towards his opponent which is Masayuki Mori, who plays as the swordsman. Both have excellent stamina when battling each other off in their own battle scenes that are constantly wrestling each other in the leaves and the dirt while trying to grab a quick weapon to kill each other with. Fights more intense than many modern films today that is. Machiko Kyo is the most powerful when it comes to emotions. Here twisted cries of help and mercy certainly gave the audience themselves several feelings from sympathy to betrayal. A wide variety of feelings flow out of Machiko's performance. Every single scream that escapes her lips is an instant stab to my heart like it was real. Other actors including Takashi Shimura, Minoru Chiaki, and Kichijiro Ueda also had their own special places in this story as well. These three were destined to be at the Rashomon gate on a violent, rainy storm. Each one lashing their anger out into another, slowly going insane like the millions of droplets that explode in an army of hundreds. And that's basically the entire cast of the movie. (Except for the Medium which is only for a brief chapter of the story). However, when it comes to lying, these actors/actress are able to hide their lies so well and so clean, that it's impossible to tell whether the statement was true or not. For the acting is definitely on it's own level and cannot be supported greatly without the stunning cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa.Kazuo Miyagawa wasn't a big name when it came to film. Yet, he also did the cinematography work for another of Kurosawa's essential masterpiece, Yojimbo (1961). Film itself is not always created for fun. Great directors who want to achieve something big in the film industry knows that every detail in a film counts, and this also counts on cinematography. But if it's cinematography, how can you make each shot important as the other you ask? Think about that 1.33:1 aspect ratio of \"Rashomon\" as a room. When you encounter close-ups like Screenshot #5 of the Blu-Ray review for this movie for example, you really don't have that much space to breathe and it gives off rather an intense atmosphere when combined with the actress' exaggerated look which Kurosawa is well known for using. There is also a type of shot that Kurosawa loves using which he will use in his most biggest work of them all, \"Seven Samurai\" which uses three actors/actresses into one shot in equal height. Now there's not a example screenshot for this in the Blu-Ray review but in the Japanese Blu-Ray boxset with other Kurosawa classics like \"Ran\", \"The Quiet Duel\", and \"Madadayo\", take a look at the second screenshot as it's close to what I'm saying, except that it's like a medium shot with three people in it. Normally, it would be the person in the middle will be close up in front and the other 2 on the side will be in the back. In my view, it shows how all three characters are the same level, no one is far more superior than the other, they're all the same. And with the fact that most of the time, the characters are looking in their own different directions give it more dramatic power that you can see in a play. Each one with their different thoughts but they know that they're still the same. Kazuo Miyagawa played a huge role in making the film as how it is and without these spectacular shots, the audience wouldn't be interested in going further into the story. However, the story is the biggest hook of them all, providing an influential idea/effect that changed film history and printed the words KUROSAWA into any film historian's textbook of film.\"Rashomon\" is most commonly well known for it's bizarre story of a murder case but with a big twist into it. The story first based off on the short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa called, \"In A Grove\". It is actually Ryunosuke Akutagawa that deserves the praise and credit for making this movie come true and starting off careers for many people and influence many ideas and other cultures today. Sadly, he died at the age of 35 from suicide on an overdoes of barbital. Even to this day, he is considered the, \"Father of the Japanese short story\". A murder case that's been fogged up by 4 different perspectives from the witnesses themselves. Three of them are lies and only one is truth is what we really think of. Kurosawa destroyed that idea in every way possible. The story itself has been shattered so the that only little bits of truth comes out of all four of these stories. Yet, it's still a mess to even decipher and unlock the truth of it. And through this puzzle do we learn more about human nature through each one of our stories as one character is protecting themselves in their own stories while making others look foolish. A disturbing truth of human nature is that people will eventually rat you out and betray you out of greed. With the painful truth of human nature, we, the audience, are never able to find the real truth ever again. Forever alone on the bottom of the ocean of truths and lies. It is that once we have been treated with these scary ideas of human behavior are we given a happy ending. An ending so satisfying, it gave us the meaning to live and to respect our precious lives to the fullest. To control and create your own destiny and relive life in a whole new perspective. Well, maybe not that powerful. Now if you're wondering what it does with the film industry, there's a lot to say about that. The movie itself spreads a new idea that was named after the movie called the Rashomon effect. Rashomon effect is where an event is told in different perspectives and views of the people or witnesses. This effect would be later become the main idea or tool of every other mystery/murder movies in American movies.Powerful acting, clever cinematography, and the creative influences are only a few examples of what makes this a \"perfect\" film. \"Rashomon\" is a film that manages to jog our emotions while sending us many horrifying truths on human feelings/behaviors. And right when you can't take it anymore, the movie cheers you up with an ending that will brighten your day a lot more and finally gives you that air to breath after all that pressure and the cramped areas of suspense. A film so wonderful, that any movie fan can talk about this for hours and not get tired of it. That is if they like watching art films. Watching it the first time might be slow for some people. But after multiple viewings, you will find yourself more interested than ever. A film that started off an entire generation and a successful start of one of the world's greatest decade in film.\n10/10",

Starring Kurosawa favourites, Takashi Shimura as the humble woodchopper, I'm damn sure the priest was in The Seven Samurai (the one from the \"Wood Cut School\"!), and of course, the irrepressible Toshiro Mifune as the crazed bandit Tajomaru, the film is incredibly well acted  all round, yet any credit due for the performances pales in comparison to the supreme achievement of Akira Kurosawa, who of course directed and partially wrote the screenplay.With a surface complexity on par with \"Citizen Kane\" (yet admittedly not quite as good, but hey! How many films are?), \"Rashomon\" is incredibly gripping, and packed to the brim with great GREAT scenes. I'd had my money's worth after about 15 min into the movie, even IF I'd gotten the parking ticket I risked to catch the movie at the cinema! (I just LOVE that bit where Shimura walks in the woods with the axe on his shoulder!) 'Rashomon' is everything a movie should be, it's funny, sad, frightening, horrific, exciting, tense, depressing, uplifting, thought-provoking, even haunting.Every single movie ever made has flaws (some movies simply have more than others) and 'Rashomon' is no exception (it is JUST outside my top 10). However, I believe this movie belongs to an imaginary select group that stand as gospels of cinematic technique ('Citizen Kane' and 'Battleship Potemkin' included. I would also like to nominate Tsui Hark's 'Once Upon a Time in China', but I think the real critics might be against me on that one!), and stands today, almost half a century old, as 90 of the most rewarding minutes you'll ever spend in front of a screen.This movie is testament to the genius of one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, and embodies some of the most important and greatest messages that have ever needed saying. I should also add that it's nothing next to \"The Seven Samurai\", but that's another story.'Kurosawa' was understandably passed over for the Academy Award for Best Director.

These stories reveal the political, social, and economical reconstruction evolving in Japan during the 1950s. The cinematic elements portray the dilapidation of Rashomon not only in the set but also by the actor's clothing, for example the rags worn by the bandit and Tajomaru. The idea that humans are evil and corrupt beings and the world we live in might as well be hell provides the central theme of the movie. The individual tales told within the structure of the larger story of the day, waiting for the rain to subside inside the gates of Rashomon. The conflict between an individual and their own conscious, perceive the nature of human beings to be weak and corrupt, this realization takes heed through the recounts of each character. Verification to the priest that the world we live in is a state of decay. Furthermore, it is ironic that the bandits reveal most of the moral lessons and insights on human behavior in the movie. For instance when Tajomaru recalls that if not for the wind, he would not have killed Takehiro that day, maybe it was because he only caught a glimpse of her that he felt the urge to follow them. Another illustration of irony, in the movie, occurs when Tajomaru takes Masako to her husband. Tajomaru almost looks ashamed. In addition, it is ironic that Tajomaru would even worry about killing someone honorably. Yet, this reveals the mentality of Japanese society in the 1950s. Moreover, the conversation between the Bandit and the Priest reveals the tendency for dishonest people to generate significance of a message to obtain what they want. Although, in the same instance the bandit tells the priest he does not want to hear his sermons. The bandit informs them that it is human to lie, that half the time we are not honest with ourselves, let alone others. Whereas, the priest tries to unveil that men are weak and this is their reason for lying. The bandit also points out, that maybe even the thought of good things is a farce and man wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the make-believe good stuff. Beyond, the medium tells Takehiro's side of the story, revealing the mentality and nature of Japan in the 1950s. Considering the fact that a medium's testimony is valid in their political hearings at the courthouse, demonstrates the Japanese beliefs in the supernatural or ancestral realm. The medium also reveals the nature of forgiveness, how Tajomaru asking him what to do with his wife, makes Takehiro want to pardon him for his crime. Additionally, the woodcutter's account of the situation relates the nature of the Japanese to change their opinion of someone close to them. This occurs when Masako wants Tajomaru to kill her husband due to shame and describes her opposition to living her mundane life. Rashomon is definitely worth watching, and helps portray the outlook the Japanese have on the world and what they consider important. For the westerners that watch this movie remember it is not always the words that can tell a story, and at times one might wish the movie would move quicker, but just a thought, take that time to inquire about what has happened thus far.",

            "content": "Rashoman in FocusBased on the writings of Akutagawa Ryunosuke, the movie version of Rashoman tells the story of the death of a samurai warrior as told by various witnesses (and possible perpetrators), including the warrior himself, by way of a medium.To appreciate this movie requires some background into its making. Filmed in war-ravaged Japan just five years after World War II, a time when national optimism was elusive, director Kurasawa Akira projects a ray of hope, literally and figuratively, into the minds of his viewer. He uses a Toaist perspective by filming entirely in an outdoor setting and by showing the insignificance of man in the vast world. His depiction of the characters as small in relationship to nature and the use of excessive rain, gloomy locations and the macabre music of Ravel's \"Bolero\" convey an ominous aura from the onset. The tangled woods add to the confusion and obscurity he presents, lending itself to the mystery of this production. A film history buff may also appreciate Kurasawa's innovative genius -- he was the first filmmaker to shoot directly into the sun. Another innovation he employs is the use of an interviewing process through which each of the eyewitnesses tells their unique version of the events. This leaves the interpretation of the evidence to the viewer and creates a thought-provoking \"whodunit\" aspect to the story. Incorporating an additional witness not depicted in the original stories allows the director to take the artistic liberty he feels is necessary to modify the otherwise pessimistic viewpoint of the misanthropic author.The trend of movie makers during this era was one of \"feel good\" art in an effort to escape the miserable reality that befell most of the public up until the end of the Second World War. Kurasawa clearly strives to instill some hope in his viewers, too. Rashoman, from a cinematic point of view, does all the right things, especially in the final scene in which the viewer is moved from pessimism to optimism via the redefined woodcutter character who first represented the evil that tempts all mankind. As a result of the woodcutter's transformation, Rashoman restores faith in the heart of the viewer, leading him both symbolically and literally out of darkness and into the light.",

The setting takes place in what seems to be the late 1800s, but I can't say for sure and in Japan.The film starts off with men taking shelter from the rain and start talking about a strange murder that took place. There were three people involved in the murder a husband and wife, and a bandit known as Tajomaru. The husband is murdered by Tajomaru, that is not what is so strange about the murder, what is strange is at the trial all of the people's stories differ. The testimonies of the bandit Tajomaru, the wife, and even the dead husband through a medium are heard and all of them are quite different. The men taking shelter try to sort out what is the truth and truly find out about what happened during the murder.The direction of this film was absolutely stunning and proves why Akira Kurosawa is a legendary director. There were plenty of beautiful shots of the landscape, and also the rain at the shelter where the three men were staying. The way he chose to film the trial was also magnificent especially when the dead husband was talking through the medium. The close ups on Toshiro Mifune were as well stunning and overall just a brilliantly directed film.The acting in this film was not so great, a bit over the top in my opinion. There was much cackling and overly strong showings of emotion. The only acting in here that could be considered somewhat good would be Toshiro Mifune's as Tajomaru. He was over the top, but his character was as well. He does not act as well as he does in later films such as Seven Samurai or Yojimbo but still does a fine job. The men in the shelter acted well also, but the acting needed for their roles was not very demanding.Overall this was a solid 7/10, it was slow at points but had a strong finish. This is not Kurosawa's greatest film but it is definitely worth seeing. I would definitely recommend this to fans of Akira Kurosawa, the samurai genre, and the mystery genre.",

            "content": "Kurosawa's film, Roshomon is the story of a murder, told from four different points of view. A samurai husband was murdered, he, his wife, and bandit, all claim that they are the murder. A woodcutter also claims to know who was responsible for the crime. The film is made up of all of their testimonies, given to a court, which is actually, the film's viewers.This film was very thought provoking, because it showed how all people like to see, and even retell situations, in a fashion that makes themselves look good, or moral. The atmosphere of the film was eleventh-century Japan, and from what I have read about that point in history, the film was a good representation of what the Japanese environment was at that time. The dress and dialect of the characters seemed realistic, to what I imagine eleventh century was like. The way that the court room was made up of people just sitting on the ground, outside, gave reflection to the destructed atmosphere of Japan during that time. The plot did follow all the way through the film. From beginning to end, a viewer will continue to focus on who really committed the murder and the morality issues of all of the characters. Although, I viewed the film through subtitles, I didn't concentrate on reading the words, because the setting, and camera work was so realistic that I could tell what was happening, just by watching.The characters were extra dramatic, but because of that, they were convincing in their stories. The wife's constant tears, the bandit's annoying, menacing laugh, and the confused gaze of the woodcutter, all added to the films effect. A viewer would know the imposed personalities of all of the characters from the small personal traits that Kurosawa assigned to them. The camera work did add to the drama of the film. When the married couple was traveling through the forest, the camera caught them in the same way a person who was sitting under a tree might see them. The shots that focused directly up at the sky made me think of a journey, or traveling. I think that is the affect that Kurosawa wanted to receive from those shots. The music in the film is the characteristic that drew emotion from viewers. When the medium was giving testimony, her story could have been told directly from the music, because it was a perfect reflection of the pain and terror that she was describing. Because I was born almost thirty years after this film was recorded, I don't feel it was an editing masterpiece, but compared to other films that were recorded in the 1950s, Roshomon was distinctively creative. The long emotion shots of the faces, and the scary voice of the medium, were both creative and new ways of expressing drama.Overall, I enjoyed the film, and could understand the main message. Kurosawa was using this piece of art to explain the moral standings of eleventh-century Japanese figures. In the film's conclusion, the viewer is left feeling that although everyone has some bad inside, they also have good, so there is hope for the future. For anyone interested in morality issues, eleventh-century Japan, or film making, this film is a winner.",

Because those who do not lie will be spurned.At the end of the rain, the suffocating dark atmosphere in the heavy rain remained for a long time, and I couldn't help wondering whether the last clear sky was just a lie. Can the child be treated well?If the man who cut the wood told the truth without any concealment, then the truth of the case is this: the robber took possession of the woman and said the best to promise to marry her, when the woman let the two men duel decide who they follow At that time, the husband was afraid of not fighting, but said that the filth of the woman was abandoned and let her commit suicide. The robber was afraid that the husband of the woman looked down on him and gave up, but under the mocking of the woman, they were even more afraid of losing their dignity in front of this humble woman So the duo clashed with fear and the robber won, but the woman was afraid that his force would have forgotten the rhetoric of the original, and fled in embarrassment.In the statement of the woodcutter, all three were fragile cowards. But each of the three people's statements covered their cowardice with lies, and described themselves as their ideal.The robber said that he used his charm to occupy the woman without any effort and conquered her heart. At her request, the woman's husband was killed without hesitation, but the woman was scared away. In his statement, he showed everyone that he was a rough and brave tough guy. In fact, he was just a pitiful worm that humbled others' eyes.The woman said that she had killed her husband because she was extremely distressed after being defiled. She wanted to seek comfort from her husband, but the husband was indifferent, so she was killed by her emotions and unconsciously. She wanted to show everyone an innocent woman who loved her loyalty to her husband but was ruthlessly rejected by her husband and forced to kill her husband. In fact, she was just a coward who played with emotions and could not bear the consequences.Husband cheeky said that he was too desperate to commit unethical shameful behavior towards others and committed suicide, but it was obviously greedy and cowardly.All three are lying. The purpose of lying is not to exonerate themselves, but to maintain the ideal image of being carefully guarded and disguised, so that even life is second.And why didn't the man who cut the wood tell the truth? Are you afraid of being involved? No, he was just afraid that everyone knew that he had watched everything indifferently and took away the jeweled knife, even he himself could not accept the ugly truth. So he lied.People always use falsehoods to pretend to be very beautiful to win everyone's admiration, but they lack the courage to face and change those ugliness. Once they see their ugliness, they are either rogue or scared.I hope that the wood-cutter will treat the child well.",

            "content": "\"Rashomon\" (1950), is extremely effective in its minimalist qualities and stunning cinematography (American Director. Robert Altman extremely admired this picture, his opinion is worth looking into). Whereas I enjoyed this movie overall, unfortunately I couldn't say I adored it as much as I have Kurosawa's later work (Or even earlier works I've yet to see them).In a day of particular heavy rain, a commoner takes shelter beneath a city gate with two other individuals. These two men are definitely fazed by a disturbing story that took place, where the woodcutter (The wonderful Takashi Shimura) tells that he found the body of a Samurai in the forest and went to alert the authorities. So begins a trial as we hear multiple interpretations from each individuals, the woodcutter, the deceased Samurai (Through a medium), the Samurai's wife and ultimately that of the bandit (The iconic Toshiro Mifune).\"Rashomon\", outside its narrative has many appeals. It was the first Japanese film to make it big on the International circuit and coined the real life term \"The Rashomon Effect\", where multiple individuals deliver conflicting information. The pacing throughout it's running length is stunning, and the way they used mirrors to reflect natural light really gives the picture untold depths of beauty. I think the acting on all fronts is pretty decent, but some of Machiko Ky\u014d's performance as the Samurai's wife took me out of the seriousness of the situation.Final Verdict: It's over 60 years old and even though I don't highly regard it as much as his other work, Akira Kurosawa's \"Rashomon\" still remains proudly influential. It's been analysed to death and some of those theories are downright absurd, but as our story suggests the true nature of actual events is lost among interpretation. 7/10.",

            "content": "If there is one filmmaker who really understands movies, it is Akira Kurosawa. His films (I have only seen \"Ran\", \"Seven Samurai\", \"Ikiru\" and \"Rashomon\" so far) are the epitome of complete cinema. Kurosawa, like Stanley Kubrick, has a great history of not directing bad movies out of his career. \"Rashomon\" is probably his first great masterpiece, and became an instrument for the spark of his international fame. The movie was not adored at Japan upon early release though, despite being received positively in the west. After the worldwide success of \"Rashomon\", Kurosawa began to work on other Japanese greats like \"Ikiru\", \"Seven Samurai\", \"Throne of Blood\", \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran\". To receive the honour of a preservation by 'Academy Film Archive' and became a major influence for movies internationally, \"Rashomon\" is now regarded as one of the greatest works in the canon of cinematic art.\"Rashomon\" revolves around characters The Bandit (Toshiro Mifune), The Wife (Machiko Ky\u014d), The Samurai (Masayuki Mori) and The Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), whom later 'recall' about an accident at a forest. Although the stories from the four characters do not favourably support one another, we can at least agree that a murder and rape do happen. It is interesting that in the story, the court places its importance on the murder (victim \u2013 The Samurai) but not the rape (victim \u2013 The Wife).According to The Bandit, The Samurai is only dead during a duel between the two men. The Wife never mentioned of a duel but keeps trying to suggest that she is docile and innocent. About what causes the death of The Samurai remains a mystery in her story. The Samurai (through a medium) talks of his wife's wicked betrayal and still, never hints about an incident involving a duel. The Samurai, according to his version, sees death through suicide. The Woodcutter's report, however, bears some resemblance to The Bandit's story but later becomes questionable when he actually attempts to conceal his crime of stealing a valuable from the scene of the murder.This masterpiece runs at a modest runtime of 88 minutes but still manages to be not straightforward. \"Rashomon\"'s story is beautifully problematic, and what so great about it is the deliberate sketchiness of it. The idea that four accounts of the similar incident are not identical concludes that either only one of them tells the truth, or all four of them lie. There is no need to find out on who is being truthful; the message that Kurosawa tried to put across is how a motivation from self-interest could easily overturn one's innocence. When \"Rashomon\" is so close with matters linked with human nature, it made it made it to be even darker than his films like \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Ran\" (I have not seen \"Throne of Blood\", \"The Hidden Fortress\", \"High and Low\" ). It quickly ranked as one of his best works by many. But darker is of course not necessarily better.Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa has been described as one of Japan's most accessible directors for the Western audience and this is often quoted as one of his finest hours, along with the more famous 'Seven Samurai'. In my opinion it is vastly overrated.Admittedly, it is a fascinating premise that drives 'Rashomon'. Shirking traditional narrative structure in a manner that would later inspire such films as 'The Usual Suspects' and to a lesser extent 'Go' and 'Run Lola Run', 'Rashomon' has the same story (of banditry, rape and murder) told from several different perspectives, all conflicting and causing the viewer to constantly reassess each character. However the potential of this concept is completely undermined by some truly unfathomable   motives on the part of the main protagonists. Some of their actions are completely inexplicable and this isn't helped by some woeful overacting by Toshiro Mifune and Machiko Kyo. The whole plot spirals further into the preposterous and then suddenly becomes a debate about the twisting of truth driven by motive that, like the monk's character, was unnecessarily preachy. A special mention must be reserved for the sword fights which are some of the most amateurish ever filmed.This could have been terrific if the storyline had remained sensible; thankfully the one thing the film has going for it, the structure, has been salvaged by the movie world so it is not a total waste.",

            "content": "There are some aspects of Rashomon that struck me as a little weird the first time through, but by the end of the movie made more sense.Mifune's explosive acting in the first third struck me as overdone, but as the movie went on I realized that whatever happened in the woods unhinged him as much as Masako or the woodcutter.  It's just part of his story, the exaggerated bravado in the face of shock.The orphan and the musings of the priest initially seem to be an example of Kurosawa's tendency towards sentimentality, but do serve to balance the structure of the film.  The priest is a counterpoint to the amoral prodding's of the commoner.  Taking on the abandoned baby stands opposite of the events portrayed in the film (adults dominating and possessing each other).  The piano bits in the score seem a bit odd, but that sort of piano piece hadn't come to be regarded as quaint in 1950.Another thing that took a few minutes to get used to was the degree to which Rashomon is a silent film.  Five or ten minutes at a time pass without dialogue.  Much of the film is conveyed through stylized facial expression, almost Fincher-like quick cut action or painterly compositions.  It must have seemed awfully old fashioned at the time to produce something that comes so close to pantomime and iconographic painting.One of my favorite things about film is the way movies flesh out relatively simple ideas and stories.  Like the way The Godfather dresses up a pulp crime novel and makes it a national myth.  Kane, Seven Samurai, Grand Illusion, and Rashomon are all stories so simple they can be summed up in a few sentences.  The philosophical heart of Rashomon is a variant on the question about a tree falling in the woods, answering that whatever people thought happened, in effect, happened.  All three characters claim to have killed Takehiro (including Takehiro himself) and claim to have done so because of the values they live by.  They must have killed him, because not to would imply that they are not the person they thought they were.  None of them lies to shift the blame of the death off themselves, quite the opposite.  The event itself is lost, even with multiple witnesses, because there is no such thing as a disinterested party.One of the things about this movie that stays with me is the four characters that were participants and observers are so finely balanced.  It's like a spider web and each retelling is like pushing at one end of it, dragging and deforming the whole thing in that direction.  The woodcutter is clearly the most easily swayed of the bunch.  So Kurosawa has him offer up his story only after he has watched the three other stories told, obviously confusing his take on the thing.  (The upshot of his story seems to be that they were a bunch of awful people and that no one should miss the knife he picked up when the coast was clear.)  At the other end is the bandit's tale, a tale of passion and cleverly subverted nobility.  It creates an aura of menace to Mifune's bandit that is slowly eaten away during the film until the woodcutter's story when the bandit and samurai are finally shown squalidly fumbling around in the dirt.

Akira Kurasawa's thought-provoking, meditative, and inovative film asks philosophical questions about the nature of truth, by showing one act of                as seen through the eyes of four different people. The results are varied, and obscure the truth. But this is far more complex than one would imagine, for the characters do not, as it is often said, tell the story to make themselves seem the more        . In fact, 3/4 claim to have commited the        themselves. This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film. The visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget. As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel. Scenes of the sun playing through the trees, dappling the ground in dancing shadows, come to mind as being most effective. But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene. Kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western     ure to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that ure.

I was very excited to see this movie and so, going into it wasn't sure whether I'd like a Japanese mystery movie.'Rashomon' has a very basic premise to it with a story regarding a woman and his husband's murder being recounted by various people. Despite such basic premise, the movie is simply far more than just that and is such a mindbending yet such a challenging movie to watch. It is a strange movie and the eeriness is masterfully portrayed by the opening scene. This scene set me up for what I believed to be a truly amazing mystery movie.There were many things I loved about this film. The characters were definitely great, the story was interesting, the direction was great and the dialogue was well written, considering having to read subtitles for 90 minutes.I did like certain viewpoints and recounts by different people but just after the one hour mark, I was beginning to get a little wreckless as I felt the movie just shifted and a bit of the greatness dropped. I was beginning to lose my interest and some of the scenes did feel weird but there was so much good things towards the very end that dragged me back into the film. One was the duel between the Samurai and the bandit. The woodchopper's story was great as was the bandit's story but boy, I felt the woman's story to get a little dull and just awkward.Some things that happened in the film such as the girl screaming in a horror like creepy way did creep me out. The eerie tone was certainly there, the movie is mostly intense and interesting and for most of its 90 minute length, I was drawn into the movie.Ten slow minutes of the film doesn't make it a horrible film or a mediocre movie as this is paid off by generally amazing story, great acting, some great characters and a well directed Akira Kurawasa film.

I appreciate Kurosawa for his craftsmanship, for his skillful shots and beautiful compositions. I realize that he was hugely influential on directors that came after him, and I can appreciate elements in his films that, while typical today, were inventive for the time. All that being said, Rashomon, for me, boils down to this: it was the first time in either film or television that the audience was presented with different versions of the same set of events. In the end you don't really know what happened, and the various possibilities, combined with your uncertainty about them, are supposed to hit you with a kind of bleak power, subsequently tempered with the (if I may say) rather blunt hope of a man taking in an abandoned baby. The problem is (for me, at least) that the notion of relative reality is pervasive in today's culture. It is neither a surprise, nor a shock, nor a revelation. After all, wasn't it the author Nabokov, roughly contemporary with Kurosawa, who said 'reality' is the only word that should never be used without quotation marks? There is a shot in Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" where the bandits are seen cresting the hill in the distance before they descend on the village. That kind of shot has been imitated so many times today that you don't even notice it, but it was a genuine first in \"Seven Samurai.\" The shot is a few seconds long, and you can think to yourself \"wow, that really was a great idea\" for a few seconds, and then the movie continues. The problem with Rashomon is that that same thought it supposed to sustain your attention and substantiate your appreciation for the duration of the film. And even if it is 2 hours shorter than \"Seven Samurai,\" 90 minutes is a long time to be constantly reminding yourself that Kurosawa invented what has become a fully integrated concept in modern film and television (think: Law and Order). Kurosawa certainly did a competent job, but unfortunately, Rashomon is not a case where the first is also the best.",

Four different views of the incident are given to us, from the the Bandit, the woman, the dead husband (via psychic medium), and a woodcutter who witnessed it from the bushes.For simple minds, they will try to decipher who is telling the truth and who isn't, as if the situation is that simple and absolute. My friend 'Jenni' is convinced the woodcutter had to have told the truth, and everyone else is lying. There, simple as that. Not to get all philosophical, but everyone is right. Each person tells their version of it, and in their minds, nothing can be disproved. It is THEIR truth.But don't listen to me; go rent the movie and judge it for yourself. A definite recommend.",

While I can see why the theme and structure of the narrative was groundbreaking when the film premiered, I'm sorry to say that, after my first viewing, I was not really caught by the story or the way it was told. What I really appreciate, however, is the great camera-work, the beautiful black-and-white photography (by Kazuo Miyagawa) and the iconic music (composed by Fumio Hayasaka).",

It's hard to believe it's 59 years old, and I can imagine the original must be in bad shape.The restored version definitely looks good, but I was disappointed with the sound. I know they have the modern tools to make something like this sound better. It needs lots more noise reduction in some scenes, and some good use of multiband compression. For the layperson, that means the loud parts are too loud compared to the quiet parts. Unfortunately, in the theater I saw this, the quiet parts sounded just fine which meant that the loud parts - the wife's wailing, the baby's crying, etc. - were just earsplitting and painful.As for the story, it was very innovative at the time. As far as I know, no film before this used the storytelling technique of multiple unreliable narrators. The acting and directing is pretty good, not surprising, though the style is dated nowadays and some of the performances feel more like they should be on stage instead of on camera.I'll give this a 6/10. Knowing what Kurosawa and Mifune were later capable of, this is not even close to their best. But it's got historical significance and is a film every film lover should see at least once.

Now the story must unfold through the evidence of each character to find out who is truly guilty of the crime.

Each character might have told the story as they perceived it which is unlikely since the murderer changed in each story. What is more likely was that each told the story in a way that they wished to have happened.

We get to see the same event from three different points of view, plus that of a by-stander who arguably has an objective viewpoint. We're then left to decide--who is right? Who is reliable and under what circumstances?It seems a little dry in concept, except for the fact that the different versions of the story seem to reveal more and more about human nature as they go along. The bandit, after all, we do not expect to be honest--he lies for a living. It soon becomes apparent, however, that the other versions are just as unreliable, just as encumbered with personal baggage. As a result, the tension grows by leaps and bounds, not just because we start to wonder about what really happened in the movie, but also because we wonder if our own perceptions of anything can be accurate.I rarely give 10 stars to any movie, but this one is unusual because you may not be the same person after you watch it.

Life has a habit of getting in the way.All that lived life, and watched films, since first hearing about Kurosawa back in the 90's, have no doubt had a dulling effect on Rashomon's impression me. It's not one of the greatest movies of all time, that's for sure.The biggest issue is that the build-up at the beginning promises a quite extraordinary tale. But what we got was a humdrum assault story. It significantly hamstrings the entire film, as the whole time I was holding out for a mega plot-twist that never came.Thankfully, there's a bunch of good stuff too. The plot-device of showing this story from each character's perspective was interesting. The bandit character was entertaining, tho' the highlight of the film was the section with the dead Samurai's perspective via the medium. Surreal and even comedic! All the actors' did a good job. The woman was starting to annoy with her constant crying (however understandable) but that was partially offset by it being a potential narrative factor: 'women cry to hide their lies', and totally offset with her great scene when she cut the two men down to size, berating them for their lack of manhood (of all things!)I enjoyed the rainy scenes with the storytellers, felt quite immersive. Some very nice camera work generally. The sunny ending was appreciated too.A 6/10 is decent, good enough to have felt worth watching. And there's enough good stuff in there to make me wanna check out another Kurosawa. However, while I understand this movie's historical influence on culture, here in the year 2023 it feels a little too lightweight & inconsequential to warrant big praise.Some old films like Citizen Kane, What a Wonderful Life, Moby Dick, Ben Hur, The Innocents and a bunch more count among my all-time favourites...they're still excellent pictures now. So I'm interested to find a Kurosawa to count among them. Rashomon isn't the one, tho'.",

Its truly unlike any movie you've ever seen before. It examines and questions the very essence of truth. Its incredible that it was made in 1950, even today, its still a staggering and enduring influence on cinema throughout the world.'Rashomon' is truly an unconventional and existential film with a non-linear narrative. It is such a profound film that even if you see it numerous times, you'll still be picking out things you didn't notice previously. Its punctuated with poetic metaphors and symbolisms throughout. Now I know where great American directors like Robert Altman, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, etc, all get their inspiration from. I love Kurosawa's expressionistic approach to film-making. His use of camera angles, lighting, etc, is a treat to behold.This film basically tells the story of a priest, a woodcutter, a thief and an ordinary man who all take turns narrating, through flashbacks, the same series of events while waiting out a heavy rainstorm. They all discuss the brutal murder of a Samurai and the rape of his wife they claim they witnessed in the jungle. You, the viewer, like the characters in the film, are never sure what is real and what isn't. It is never explained, you're forced to draw your own conclusions. What you hear is four completely different stories of the crimes committed in the woods. Every storyteller is untrustworthy, especially the woodcutter's, who was the first to see evidence of the crimes.This film has a very powerful and spiritual ending where the woodcutter get a shot a redemption.

To find hope in such a terrible story of rape, adultery, revenge and murder. This sounds like quite an ugly story but Kurosawa tackles it in a softer manner. Part like a court room drama, and part like a Citizen Kane structure of reflecting on the past. What's interesting is the way Kurosawa has created multiple perspectives on the vital events of this story. The truth depends on the good or evil of each character. This is no clich\u00e9d approach to morality. It's sophisticated yet the story itself is very simple, with everyday types of characters. The big difference is the villain of the piece. He is almost cartoonish in his mannerisms, and I wonder why Kurosawa wanted this. Perhaps to show the animalistic nature of man when he is down to his base senses of fulfilling his desires?",

Given the differences in filming in Japan from Hollywood, this was an entertaining film while being educational.Kurosawa gets your attention from the very beginning. From the monsoon rain, to the dilapidated gate, it all sets the mood for the film. Unfortunately, Kurosawa stresses the picturing of nature so much that it drags the movie out so much in some places; it takes the focus away from what is happening at that moment. Despite of these lengthy scenes, the movie still manages to remain entertaining through the story and the characters. The most entertaining character is by far the thief. From his creepy laugh and the most unexpected times and his poor sword skills keep the viewer intrigued as to how the movie will finish as well as keeping a small amount of humor. Akira Kurosawa did an excellent job of portraying each characters story by easily distinguishing the differences. These scenes make it really easy to end the movie the portrayal of good and bad in all men and most of all wondering who did it.Overall the movie was very enjoyable even with the lengthy scenes of nature. Kurosawa's ability to keep the audience entertained with fairly short tale is outstanding. The movie follows more of the story \"In a Grove\" rather than \"Rashomon\" and it would have been interesting if Kurosawa could have finished movie more like the short story.

            "content": "I recently had a conversation with one of my friends about how much we liked films shot in a forest in black and white. It seems that forests and art-house cinema go hand in hand (i.e. SEVENTH SEAL, MARKETA LAZAROVA etc.) Of these RASHOMON may be the earliest, popularizing the setting through avant-garde techniques that would seem audacious even if made today. Breaking continuity, pointing the camera directly at the sun, constantly tracking from beneath twigs and branches. At times the cinematography appears almost impressionist, blending the characters into the background, literally forcing man to become a part of nature. This immersion of man into nature comes at a point when we are expecting excitement and action. Entering a flashback prefaced by horror and death, Kurosawa instead decides to spend 3 minutes tracking a woodsman as he wanders through the forest. In one of the most brilliant sequences I have ever seen put to film, Kurosawa introduces man at its most honest, alone, and unassuming. When the woodsman stumbles upon the deceased samurai, his hands are splayed upwards, mirroring the branches that framed the woodsman previously. All of this acts as a preface to Kurosawa's exploration of the folly of mankind through lies, manipulation, and hyperbole. The very nature of film is to exaggerate and embellish characters by placing them into easily understandable categories of protagonist and antagonist. Here Kurosawa exposes this by retelling the exact same narrative 3 different ways, with each character placing themselves as the murderer, only pretending to be in control of their own actions. It is only until the 4th version, where the woodsman appears to tell the \"truest\" version of this story, exposing how fragile these people really are. Note that I say truest since his story is the only version of the events that are revealed to be an outright lie because of the exclusion of the bejeweled dagger. When we witness the fight sequence between the samurai and Tajomaru, the bandit, the first time it appears well choreographed like an elaborate dance number, with Tajomaru noting that he fought honorably and crossed swords 36 times. When we see the fight scene the second time, however, it is much more barbaric and fearful. The fright appearing through the slight trepidation on Mifune's hand during the battle. This dissonance between the perceived \"noble\" samurai and the brutality of war would be explored 4 years later in Kurosawa's own SEVEN SAMURAI. Many times throughout the film institutions based on trust and the unknown are explored, such as the priest and the medium. Their reliance only affirmed by the others' willingness to believe them. The film ends with a man stealing a blanket from a baby. When confronted by the priest he affirms his actions by shouting that we are no different from dogs. Selfishness is the only thing that provides for self-preservation and you can't trust anybody but yourself. This idea shatters the priests faith as this solipsistic notion puts all of mankind at odds against itself, painting a backdrop of war and conflict as a continuation of false bravado and self aggrandizement. At this point when the axeman tries to take the baby off of the priest's hands he is met with hostility as there would be no way to trust a bandit with the fate of a small child. It is not until the bandit reveals that he already has 6 other's that the priest reaffirms his faith by allowing himself to believe a complete stranger. Although this may seem like a tacked on happy ending, the film has set us up to assume that we cannot put our trust in anything but our own perceptions. The bandit could very well be lying to the priest and kidnapping the child for alternative reasons. Like the religion the priest blindly follows, mankind is an institution that we have to either commit to fully or not at all.",

            "content": "The Rashomon gate is ran down, dilapidated, and the paint is chipped up. This is the scenery used on the films' DVD cover, and where the Buddhist monk, the woodcutter, and the servant tell the story of the murder. The three men hear the story from the servant's point of view, and as he tells it, there are flashbacks to the actual scenes. The whole story is centered on a trial, trying to find the killer. Each suspect and witness tells his or her side to the story to the police. However, whom they are telling their side of the story to, is unknown. It seems as if they are telling their side of the story to the audience. The film shows different camera views that were brand new to the time. In 1950, no one pointed the camera to the sky, or followed the character. The camera work, to the time, was very good. To the modern audience, it may look bad, but realize that they didn't have computers or enhanced cameras to add special cinematic elements to the film. As in most Eastern films, nature is shown to the extreme. Certain parts of the movie seem to be dragged out by showing too much nature with the woods and the weather. However, nature is common in eastern culture films. In addition, it is a very Shinto idea to show nature as being very large, and the actor being rather small. The actors did a very good job, especially Tajomaru, the bandit, who loved to show off his annoying, and sinister laugh. The movies whole set was taken outside, which was very uncommon in the 1950's. The movie had some bolero and traditional Japanese music to add some flavor. The plot of the movie was very smart. It showed flashbacks, new to the cinema in the 1950's. The central idea may seem old and overused, but it seems that murder cases never get boring. The ending leaves the audience in shock on who the actual killer is. The social commentary wasn't noticeable due to the English subtitles. This film is entertaining if the audience will view it from a 1950 perspective and not a 2007 perspective. The camera work is amazing to the time when it was filmed, and the plot was very good. However, the pace seemed a little slow, but once you can get over that it is entertaining. I suggest that you view this film with an open mind, allowing the slow pace to not bother you (or the subtitles), and get a quick background of the movie and director before you watch the film.",

            "content": "This is a pretty simple-looking film that disguises an Old Testament story about the challenge of a man's faith. I the story of Job, Job is a reverent man who loves God and family. He is known for his wisdom and wealth. One day, Lucifer wagers Job's soul that he can make Job curse God. God takes the bet.Pestilence and disaster reign in Job's life. All the while, he holds his faith close as others prompt him to curse God by saying \"God hates you. He is playing with your soul because he is a whimsical God. Curse him.\" Though he questions the reasons for what befalls him, his faith never wavers. God wins the wager.In Rashoman, there is a converse story. A priest's faith is in question, not of God, but of the true nature of humankind. He hears of a hideous crime and the controversial accounts of what happened. Other people, witnesses to the crime, come forth and give contradicting testimony. These people are like Job's neighbors, all revealing their philosophical \"conviction\" by confessing to a crime. Each story accuses a different culprit, and each suspect is motivated and justified by extreme self centeredness. At the end, no one knows who is telling the truth. But the man who offers to adopt the orphan restores the priest's faith in humanity. Each of these people, like Job's neighbors, challenge the reverent man's faith by revealing a different aspect of man's (lack of) character.Every account revolves around the woman's relationship to the men in the movie. In some way, each man wants to possess her and justify his existence in so doing. And let's face it; in 1954 post war Japoan, a conservative state by our standards then and now, you wouldn't likely see a woman laughing at a man and insulting him openly like the wife in this movie. In that context, you can conclude this is socially a consciousness-raising film for that time and place.As Kurosawa goes, this is an early, foundational work that appears to establish him as one with broad knowledge about western culture and literature, astute cinematography, and a talent for taking the traditions of theatre and film as a cornerstone for expanding his work instead of resorting to cheap and hollow impressionism.I give this a 7.",

The significance of this event is that I have mentioned more than once in reviews the influence of Rashomon's narrative technique, most recently in 'Avatar'. This new print shows the detailed close-ups, but it shows also the lighting flaws. Hanging reflectors in the trees to reflect sun into the shadows might have saved a few yen, but the movement of the light spots was sometimes disturbing. Artificial, to say the least. The sound in this well-equipped cinema emphasised just how unbalanced it was, both thematically and acoustically. Nevertheless, Rashomon has earned its place in the pantheon of iconic motion pictures. The complexity of the story remains a model for film-makers. Perhaps the acting is wooden; we expect more than lengthy shots of blank expressions. Only Eisenstein seems to have mastered that trick. The rain was well done, in contrast to,say, 'Singin' in the Rain'. The Japanese used dark colouring in the \"rainwater\"; Hollywood used milk!",

But after watching Roshomon I was highly disappointed, too much hype of this movie and I won't even say it's good (forget great). I mean this is a drama movie involving 3 main characters and very limited freedom for director as far as visuals are concerned, since the movie repeats same story 4 times from different perspectives. So how strong or weak the movie is, is going to depend on - how spellbinding is storytelling and performance by protagonists. And alas Roshomon lags far behind expectations in both departments. Apart from Toshiro Mifune no one was able to hold the screen with their presence. Expressions were too weak to potray the kind of emotions, intensity and dilemma required for the storyline. As far as script is concerned for this genre of movies, audience shall feel connected to some character in the movie, but to me it wasn't the case, the characters were half baked.Conclusion: there are much better movies, too overrated.",

When it was released, it was one of the films which even the western world knew they couldn't miss out on.If you were to discuss it's formal elements, the handheld projections in it's restrained settings, the utilisation of contrasting bright and dark lighting, the worn down buildings, the downpour of the rain, all submerge together effortlessly to create a mesmeric feel to the film.The component of the film i admired the most however, was the attentive exploration of the theme of human nature. Each character displays a varied aspect on the main event of the film, providing a sense of relatability for the people watching. Watching Rashomon is electrifying, it's far beyond beautiful when you focus on the themes of the film at hand. I feel as if Akira Kurosawa made the film to keep us thinking about the good things in the world despite all the catastrophe, it was hopeful to me which is why i cherish this film. It's a cinematic titan which not everyone knows about, but it's had an impact on what they do know about. On a final note,Takashi Shimura is a prodigous actor, to see him in this is an unsurpassed experience, sheer brilliance. Be sure to definitely check this one out!",

When the movie first opens in which seems to be a rundown house, it has a very slow storyline, but after the first 20 minutes, I was drawn into the story and found myself thinking ahead trying to figure out the mystery that was going on. The movie seems to take place in the past, but I can only assume this because the people were using samurai swards and getting around by foot and horses. The acting in Rashomon was different, but not necessarily bad. You must remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and realize that it is completely different than American movies during this same time period. The editing and framing was pretty much what one would expect from an older movie, and did not affect the film in any negative way. Like I mentioned earlier, the plot seemed to develop kind of slowly, but picks up about half way through the film when you started to get different stories on the murder and tragedy that has happened. For being a movie from the fifties, I was quite surprised with the details of the characters conflict.To my pleasant surprise, I really enjoyed Rashomon. This story has many valuable lessons to life in it that can still be used today. It addresses the cruel nature of man and the way we are deceitful to fulfill our greed. I only had a few problems with the movie. First was the slow pace that it moved in. Although interesting, when the last man who actually witnessed the murder tells his story, I was still trying to figure out what the real point of the movie or message of the movie was. Eventually I figured it out, but after a couple \"this has to be over soon\" quotes. Next I found the wife of the murdered man to be extremely annoying. She cries in 3/4th of the scenes she is in. And finally there was a random baby at the end of the movie to prove that there was still good in some men. I think that this could have been accomplished in another way. The baby just appeared and it was kind of awkward. Overall, Rashomon was a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys older movies.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon has totally revamped my cinematic outlook. It is because of this sole reason that I find necessary to write this review . Rashomon is a very simple piece of cinema, a subtle plot handled with great passion and care, alluring the viewer into believing each one of the characters etched out by Kurosawa. Right from the first frame showing the commoner's run in the muddy water in the rain to the exemplary fight sequences of the husband and Mifune to the concluding final shot of the movie, everything shouts of a work of a true genius. No! correction; it is the work of a real and able-story-teller. I saw Seven Samurai before watching this one, and I can assuredly say this now that Kurosawa is a master story-teller. The way he manages the narration of any given story is a gift very few of us can imagine to possess. Movie-maker or not, the art of telling a story stems from the vast canvas of the mind that is thirsty of imagination after imagination, sprinting furthermore with grand images and visuals that are nothing short of an adventure with heaps of euphoria by the end of it. And cinema is the greatest gift for the mind to express its great voyages that take place so often and so beautifully. Kurosawa does exactly that; pick a story from some folklore and create the ambiance that almost perfectly replicates the one in his own mind, sculpt those amazing characters, fill in the scenes with marvelous music and tell the story as it is meant to be, by engaging the viewer quite effortlessly and convincingly. A good film-maker will most certainly know what he wants out of the cinema right from the onset of those colorful reveries in his mind, and etch out exactly that on the reel and on the screen. And by the looks of it, Akira Kurosawa didn't just master that art-form but actually enjoyed the magic of cinema. That explains his desire in inventiveness when it comes to technicalities as a director.Now, The interweaving music plays a huge role in an narration and that justly separates great stories from the insipid ones. Here, I must definitely speak of Rashomon's music, in one word; breathtaking! The right kind of music at a proper appropriate timing in a movie definitely enhances the experience. And the music in Rashomon is a pillar on its own, carrying the great weight of the narration with such ease and beauty. Leaves the viewer with nothing short of enchantment!The center theme of the movie from the ethical point of view is very philosophical and emotive. The seriousness of the underlying tale is innocent without being pretentious, does not cry for attention by relying on simplicity and magnificently binds the strong, powerful characters ; a trend sadly missing in today's pieces of cinema. The ambiguity leaves the viewer to form his own interpretations of the story with the desired conclusions. The quest to know the truth very quickly establishes in the viewer as the story carries forward chapter after chapter with the setting of the three men taking shield from a rainstorm, recounting variant narrations of a single incident and trying so hard to comprehend the happenings echoes with that of the viewer himself. And all three men here do find a reliable standpoint towards the end. The solemn want of the woodcutter and the priest to believe and reason with what they witnessed makes the viewer almost feel like the commoner in the movie and sure does demand to subject oneself with a moral-questioning of the self . These are the after-affects, bound to spring in after watching any movie, and they are free to roam about in any direction you wish for. But what spellbound me the most is the way Rashomon created that path towards those after-affects. I leave with a sense of appreciation and awe, and a superior form of admiration and with a greatly enhanced respect towards the makers of movies; a feeling I encounter so rarely when it comes to the mystic world of cinema. Rashomon is that quintessential classic. Enigmatic, charming, gripping and thought-provoking in a true sense. And I bow down to such creations with my humble devotion and a polished passion that act as the magic elixir for the cineaste in me. ~ Long Live Good Cinema ~",
