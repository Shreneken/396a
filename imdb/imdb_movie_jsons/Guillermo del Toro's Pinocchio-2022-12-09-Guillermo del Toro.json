            "content": "This film is NOT meant to have the light-hearted happy-go-lucky vibes of Disney's 1940 Pinocchio movie, but rather a modernised take praising the wonders of childhood, faith and friendship; up against the all-consuming tyranny of fascism (its take on Mussolini is hilarious), deceptive show-business tactics; and the double-edged sword of Time (and Life) itself.Pinocchio is a conceptually HEAVY film that doesn't condescend on its younger audiences nor it's older ones: it respects all the age groups equally and without compromising the story and fairytale-qualities of the Pinocchio story at its core. It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years. And it was worth the wait on Del Toro's part too.All in all, Pinocchio was WORTH IT; big time! And hella better than Disney's 2022 live-action turd too.It's a 5/5 star experience.",

            "content": "Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is exactly that, a beautiful and unique interpretation of a classic that explores death and grief in ways that are often emotional and heartbreaking whilst still delivering a fun adventure with gorgeous animation against a classically disturbing Del Toro backdrop.Gregory Mann gives an incredible lead performance, imbuing Pinocchio with a boundless warmth and naivety that thankfully never becomes annoying. Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience. Rounding out the cast is Christoph Waltz, on point as usual with another truly evil character.Guillermo Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson's direction is absolutely phenomenal, everything from the movement of the characters, to their designs and the vibrant colour palette is gorgeous and endlessly watchable. The music by Alexandre Desplat is amazing, giving the film a perfect sense of whimsy for a fairytale.",

            "content": "With less than 1/4 of the budget of the soulless Disney live action remake earlier this year, Del Toro & Co. Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version.But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden.",

            "review_title": "A delightfully different take",
            "content": "Not surprisingly, Guillermo del Toro's version of \"Pinocchio\" is defiantly unique. In his version, Geppetto (David Bradley) is a wood carver who's beloved son Carlo dies tragically during WWI leading him down a spiral of grief and drunkenness. One night he creates Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) in a drunken rage as a replacement for Carlo and the Wood Sprite (Tilda Swinton) takes pity on him and gives Pinocchio life. She makes a deal with Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor), an insect who lived in the tree Pinocchio was carved from. If he can guide Pinocchio to being a good boy, he can have a wish.The first thing that stands out in this film is the magnificent design work. Pinocchio looks very much like a wooden puppet carved in a drunken stupor ... spindly with nails sticking out, missing an ear, and he moves like a monstrous insect until he gets his physical bearings. Sebastian J. Cricket is ... a cricket. The Wood Sprite (and her sister Death, also voiced by Swinton) are blue, sphinx-like beasts with eyes along their wings. The afterlife is inhabited by blue-black skeletal bunnies ... the whole film is a macabre delight.The message of the film also reverses Disney's emphasis on conformity. Set in pre-WWII fascist Italy, this version emphasizes non-conformity. Ultimately, it's not that Pinocchio needs to learn to behave like Carlo, but Geppetto needs to learn to love Pinocchio for who her is. The fascist elements of the plot are a little heavy handed and lead to the only section of the film that drags (the film's main point could easily be made without this element), but they aren't bad. It's a really delightful film.",

            "review_title": "A good film that might not be for everyone",
            "content": "A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go ignored.It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).",

            "review_title": "What a vision of grief, learning, and being a good person (made of wood)",
            "content": "In case you were wondering what was missing from an adaptation of Pinocchio: 1) more Fascist commentary (not to mention Tom Kenny voicing Mussollini); 2) Frankenstein allusions (or sorry did I say allusions I mean he's clearly so in love with ol' Frank that the imagery is just there in spades); 3) a showstopper Ewan McGregor musical number that hilariously keeps getting interrupted until the ending (you'll hear it at the Oscar's live I bet); 4) the word 'Burden' made existential and harrowing for a child of wood; and 5) and an even more gnarly designed sea beast. It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.I'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it? Uh... how young did you see the Disney one? Go a year younger!",

            "content": "Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.Final Say -An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.3 1/2 hot chocolates out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.",

I watched it not because I am a fan of the original story or the Disney animated film, I watched it because I love Guillermo del Toro. Once again, he has delivered a beautiful film. This adaptation does deviate from the original story, but doesn't hurt it. It changes the setting, Fascist Italy instead of the 1800s. The story also takes a look at Geppetto and why he created Pinocchio. This is a film that takes a very deep look into loss, the terrible loss of a child, the anger and grief that never goes away, Having lost a child myself, I thought the way Geppetto's sorrow and loneliness was beautifully portrayed. This and Pinocchio's love for his father and sorrow and confusion when Geppetto yelled at him. This is probably the most realistic portrayal of people dealing with grief and how it can effect other in their lives.The story, the stop motion animation and voice acting was superb. I am not a huge fan of musicals, but the songs were not too annoying and didn't stop the story from moving forward as they so often do.This is set to become a modern classic for all the right reasons, although it is a darker version that some younger and more sensitive children might find frightening.This is very much a Guillermo del Toro film, dark, beautiful and intelligent.",

The church turns out to be an adversary. The people who saw him as a veritable saint now turn their backs. We have the cricket living inside him which is an interesting twist but so appropriate. There are friendships, discoveries, and war to deal with. Also, the little wooden guy has immortality. But is that a gift when you outlive those whom you truly love?

            "content": "Guillmero del Toro's Pinocchio is a movie that was cancelled until Netflix helped him revive it. While the year already had a movie on the wooden puppet in the form of Disney's live-action remake (which I felt was nothing more than another in Disney's long line of soulless remakes meant to serve as nothing more than to milk money off nostalgia while changing stuff like making Monstro a sea monster instead of a whale and the clock scene that was done for nothing more than a cameo of Disney's other movies), and let's say the movie does a better job in its own way.Taking a different direction, the film has Pinocchio made by Gepetto as a way to replace his late son, Carlo, who was killed in the Great War. However, he goes into various misadventures with a cricket named Sebastian, Pinocchio is put on various misadventures.Yeah, this is a lot different than how Disney's version went, and it's for the best. However, it is not for younger kids, as given the time this adaption is set in, as well as the fact that one of the characters is Death (who is portrayed as the sister of the Wood Sprite, the one who gives Pinocchio life), it can result in scenes that can be too scary or intense for younger kids.

I could not have admired the spectacular stop-motion animation anymore than I did on my first viewing. Every scene looks like a work of art in its set design and detailed characters. The story is astonishingly more expansive here as well, including the story of Gepetto's original son, Carlo, much more focus on the carnies who capture Pinocchio, and a look into the afterlife. Del Toro also tells a cautionary tale against fascism in place of the notorious boys-turning-to-donkeys scene (the joke being the fascists are a**es). While I enjoyed all of these new elements to the story and the phenomenal animation, I was left underwhelmed by the music. I think this movie is thrilling for kids (especially those 10-14 years old) and I would re-watch this again.",

This movie took some creative liberties, some really good creative liberties, in fact. The movie is set during World War II, in an Italy under Mussolini. War plays a huge role in this film, and I think Del Toro did a good job of taking the basic ideas from the original story, and expanding on them. For example, a certain island setting from the original story is not present in this film, but in its place is a genius substitute that serves practically the same kind of purpose in a way. Every character is interesting and the worlds are very dense with details. While having a dark tone, the movie also finds a way to be upbeat and charming at times. Also, the music is great, the musical songs are pleasing to the ear. Best of all, the visuals are stunning, the puppets capture emotion even though they're puppets.

That also goes for the much-altered narrative with the story planted firmly in between-the-wars Italy and the rise of fascism under the dictator Mussolini although it seems to me, in doing all this, that the director is alienating his younger audience.It didn't help either that this Pinocchio is so much of a pain-in-the-proverbial when he first comes to life, with an especially irritating voice plus it has to be said, Sebastian J Cricket, by Jiminy, really doesn't register much as a presence throughout the movie.And then there are the songs which are flat, tuneless and distinctly unmemorable. Of course, they enhance and elevate the Disney feature, but here if anything, they slow down the action. I also found the caricature portrayal of Mussolini to be just too obvious and dull.It had some nice ideas like Pinocchio's \"Groundhog Day\"-type revivals every time he dies and the epilogue is sweetly executed to at least end the film on a nice note but I have to say, on the whole, I found this modern-day take on Pinocchio to be longer than a lying nose and distinctly wooden, into the bargain.",

The colours and visuals are stunning, giving justice to the grim world of 1940s Italy.The characters are distinct and memorable, each brought to life with the help of excellent vocal performances. While Gepetto and Pinocchio take centre stage, their relationship is the true star of the film. The relationship between this father and son is both heart-warming and heartbreaking as Pinocchio wrestles with his conscience and emotions.The music also adds to the atmosphere, creating an additional layer of emotion that helps bring the story together.GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S PINOCCHIO is a remarkable piece of art that captures the horrors of fascism and celebrates the bond between father and son.

So, imagine my anticipation when Netflix announce a new adaption of the Pinocchio story, done in possibly my favourite animation style (stop-motion) and by a masterful filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro, whose gothic sensibilities shone in 'Pan's Labyrinth'.So, it's 2022, the film has released, and, it somehow managed to better than my expectations.The story, largely follows what you'd expect, but with a couple notable changes: it is set in fascist Italy, it is more spiritual and it is more philosophical. There are a couple more changes, but I don't won't to spoil them here.The film from the offset is darker and more mature than the Disney original, encompassing themes of war and death within the first ten minuets. It also uses its titular character as a 'puppet' to convey humanity's worst and best impulses, which albeit, the Disney original did too, but in a more 'after-school' way, chiselling down its moral core to a nub of simply 'don't lie' or 'don't get addicted to vices', whereas GDT's version poses more questions than moral lessons.GDT's version also feels equally more realistic and more fantastical, blending the two seamlessly, and, despite, his change in medium, it still feels and particularly bleeds GDT's style, feeling pulpy and gothic, while retaining its PG family rating.Del Toro and McHale's writing elevates the story to new heights, the character writing feels very reminiscent of McHale's previous, the masterpiece that is the TV mini-series 'Over the Garden Wall', as each character feels loving crafted to be fully three dimensional, Pinocchio himself feeling incredibly reminiscent of Greg from that very series. However, the scene stealing character is Sebastian J. Cricket, voiced by Ewan McGregor, who, is this version's Jimminy Cricket, fittingly, unlike his predecessor, Sebastian is, at the beginning at least, a somewhat misanthropic writer, focused on writing his memoirs, as opposed to the generally high-sported Jimminy. McGregor's performance here is great, giving a wry delivery to the jokes with an unexpired sense of vigour, delivering some of the film's funniest and saddest lines. David Bradley is another stand-out, bringing life to a sadder Gepetto.The animation here is simply breathtaking, with puppets from The Jim Henson Company, Del Toro and Gustafson bring the world to life with their intricate and delicate stop-motion and well-placed CG, everything here is tightly framed with a blazing level of artistry and elegance, brought together by stunning cinematography, it feels like two auteurs at their peak. Crisp and efficient editing ties the whole thing up brilliantly too.The score is provided by the legendary Alexandre Desplat, with a couple of songs too, the score is exquisite, but the songs are the only element that feel like they should have had more time in the oven, other than two, 'Ciao, Papa' and Sebastian's Ending Melody, the rest feel a tad pointless, not bad, but slightly unnecessary.Overall, Del Toro's Pinocchio is a staggering cinematic achievement pushing boundaries in craftsmanship for both live action and animation, with an intelligent script that honours and diverts form its origins that explores every theme it sets out superbly, making it the definitive version of the fable for me, firmly pushing Disney's vision out of mind. Easily, one of the year's very best, animated or otherwise.",

But yes, the voice of Pinocchio is the most annoying and entirely out of place. And what's with the singing?! It was totally uncalled for to make it a musical - it doesn't match the mood, singing is mostly awful and just as out of place as the voice acting itself...Alas, it's not a good film, which is a terrible pity considering how much effort was invested into making it, and how it could have been with a matching cast...",

            "content": "4* out of 10*After watching GDT's latest work \"Pinocchio\" I went online to see if people were as disappointed as I was. Surprisingly, I couldn't find a single professional review that didn't applaud the film as a wonderful masterpiece. If movie critics don't have the balls to say it, I will: GDT has lost his mojo. What started to show in the mediocre and over-hyped Shape of Water and became even more apparent in the over-long and lacklustre Nightmare Alley is obvious after Pinocchio: GDT is not a very talented storyteller - and subtlety is NOT his strong suit. None of the two mentioned earlier films caught me on an emotional level and Pinocchio also completely failed to do so. It felt a bit like it's main character: wooden and without a true heart.The film might look brilliant on a technical level but even the optical surface lacks heart. I was surprised that supposedly this was all stop-motion, because it felt like CGI all the way. I don't know what it was exactly but the film simply looks too perfect. The characters and scenery never come across like puppets, everything feels animated. Even if they put in years of handy work, I am sure they glossed over all the frames digitally and enhanced the images.The first twenty minutes of the film were great and showed GDT's potential. However, as soon as Pinocchio showed up, it all went down the drain. If the film's biggest weakness is its main character, you have a problem. I did not like the design and looks of Pinocchio, at all. He looks creepy. Plus, the dude is a completely obnoxious jack-ass who is super-annoying. His voice was particularly bothersome. How are we supposed to root for him? I knew it was over when he started to sing his first song and my ears started bleeding. That song made absolutely no sense. Pino knows perfect English and knows all the words, until he doesn't when the song need him to.Why was this a musical anyway? Every single song was terrible and the lyrics were so bad. The music added nothing to the narrative but catapulted me right out of the film, as I had to resist the urge to fast forward whenever they started singing.The film generally drags a lot and could and should have easily been cut about 30 minutes. It struggles to find its tone and therefore its audience. Is it aimed at children? Too dark and all over the place. At adults? Not really dark and emotional enough and too childish.Another major flaw is the over-bloated, weak script. The story is messy and all over the place. GDT shoves so many narrative threads and sceneries into the film that it completely loses fo-cus and fails to tell a cohesive story. There is the church theme, the carnival, the war camp (?), the Mussolini thread, the fish monster part, the other-world-hell narrative - it's just too much. All these disjointed scenes sure try to bring across a message. And they do so VERY heavy-handed. As I said, subtlety is not GDT strong suit. For example, we all know that war is horrifying and fascism is evil. However, both these topics were handled way better in GDT's early (and ONLY) masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth. This time around, he just crams these things into the film without saying anything new about them. He just shows them and spells them out. The terror of Mussolini's fascist regime is never felt.Unfortunately, everything is literally spelled out in this film. Be who you are, don't try to be someone else. Don't project your dead son into a puppet. Religion is dumb. War is terrible. Let go, don't lose yourself in grief. Immortality is worse than dying. Lying is bad but sometimes, when it gets you somewhere, it's fine (??).One gets the impression that either, GDT doesn't truly care about his messages or he simply doesn't have the narrative capacity to convey them in a convincing manner. He kind of picks them up, looks at them, briefly shows them to us and then drops them to pick up the next shiny idea he finds on the ground. For the viewers, this is unsatisfying and left me feeling stale.One cannot help but have the impression that GDT only truly cares about himself and showing off all he has accomplished while neglecting careful story-telling. This can best be seen by the fact, that he puts his name in front of the movie title. A thing, film-makers typically do once they are past their prime. GDT marvels in the glory of his own name and the technical flex of the animation. This hubris culminates in the casting of friggin Cate Blanchett - only to have her voice a darn monkey without a single word of dialogue.The Scottish cricket voiced by McGregor is tasked with watching over Pinocchio and providing him moral guidance to become a good boy, which is set-up big time in the beginning. I have never seen a character fail more miserably at their quest. He does not once guide the guy or even speak to him much during the film, for that matter. In the end, he goes like \"Yeah, I did my best, that's all you can ask of me.\" and is granted his one wish.I did like Mr. Filch as Geppetto, though, he did a fantastic job! Swinton and Pearlman did al-right, too.All in all, a pretty big disappointment.",

He buries a pine cone with the body. It would grow into a large tree and a cricket named Sebastian starts living in it. Geppetto uses the tree to make a wooden puppet. The blue Wood Sprite gives it life and names it Pinocchio.This Guillermo del Toro animated movie has made some changes to the story. The most obvious is the change of the time periods. It does lose a bit of its old world charms, but the relative modernity does give it a fresh angle. It may be a surprising idea, but Pinocchio needs more humanity. In this one, he looks very much an animated wooden puppet walking the Earth. When the Fascists show up, the movie feels awkward especially for a kiddie audience. It definitely has some darker del Toro touches. The ending is rather poignant and that feels very human.",

That's the First World War. Gepetto is devastated, doesn't work much, but somehow always finds enough booze to be drunk, until one day he decides he is so lonely he will make his own son. The story continues on through the Mussolini years and the Second World War with Ewan MacGregor voicing the cricket, Cate Blanchett the monkey, Christopher Waltz the show man, and Tilda Swinton doing the wood sprites -- what we know as the Blue Fairy -- and Death.I enjoy Del Toro's movies for their rococo designs, and bizarre plots, and that's pretty much what this movie delivered. His collaboration with Mark Gustafson borders on the creepy, with Pinocchio not being a finished wooden boy, but a rough-hewn piece of pine that shows a lot of grain, and the details offered, from the cards the rabbits play with to the head of the walking stick that Count Volpe carries shows the elaborate details that Del Toro seems to delight in, and the songs are seriously thoughtful. A woman had brought a small small to the theater, and I remarked that I wouldn't take a very young person to see the Disney version, let alone the horror-infused sort of visual phantasmagoria Del Toro delights in without careful vetting. Nonetheless, for my tastes, this is a fine version of the story that considers the issues of love, and what it means to be a good boy.",

            "content": "The beloved story of Pinocchio gets a fresh new look thanks to visionary director Guillermo del Toro.Those of you who follow my blog might have noticed I hated the original 1940 version of the film, for various reasons.While the 1940 version was aimed almost exclusively at a (very) young demographic, 'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio' is a film young and old can enjoy. Apart from being visually stunning, the story itself is much better. The character motives are better defined and this film is not as cartoonish. There are still a few moments that were indeed resembling cartoon humour, but that's fair enough - since this is a film for the entire family.In this version, Geppetto has a 10-year old son, Carlo, who dies during an aerial bombardment. By this time the relationship between Geppetto and Carlo was well established and I sympathized with Geppetto. After years of mourning, he decided to carve a wooden doll to fill the void left by Carlo. As we all know, the puppet, Pinocchio, then comes alive with the help of a Fairy, or Sprite. The Fairy also requested a cricket named Sebastian J. Cricket to guide Pinocchio, and promised to grant him one wish in return. This plays a pivotal role towards the end.In the original film Geppetto decided to send Pinocchio to school just minutes after he became alive. Here, Pinocchio is depicted as a naughty, spiteful 'kid' who lacks discipline, and it is recommended that Geppetto send him to school. This is much more realistic, and makes more sense.Off course, Pinocchio decides not go to school and joins the circus after circus owner Count Volpe made false promises to him. Count Volpe also serves as the film's main antagonist. What follows is a coming of age journey filled with fun and adventure, tears and laughter, and above all, a very powerful message.I must be honest, I didn't really like the Pinocchio character, but his unruly behaviour was essential for character development, and a heartfelt finale.",

I have lived 10 years of my movie buff life with the personal opinion that Guillermo del Toro is one of the most overrated directors of our time. Be it \"Pan's Labyrinth\" (2006), \"Pacific Rim\" (2013), \"The Shape of Water\" (2017), or \"Nightmare Alley\" (2021), those all have been nothing more than a one-time watchable flick for me. Maybe I need to change that opinion now. Disney's groundbreaking animated flick, \"Pinocchio\" (1940), unveiled the world of the Italian novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" on the silver screen with pathbreaking visuals and techniques, and that's why it has lived for years and continues to live even today. It will be loved for many years to come, but I think people will also consider Guillermo del Toro's remake with it. 5 has not only managed to pull off an honest remake, but he has given it an extension and a modern version that expands its legacy. It is more like an adaptation than a remake because there are so many changes in the script, and all of them are so beautiful. Guillermo starts off by telling the story of Geppetto and his son, which no other film did. Then he gets into Pinocchio and the world war zone, leaving you with a little flavour of Michael Curtiz's classic musical, \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942). It's a long film-2 hours precisely-for valid reasons. You see Pinocchio's death, again something new and unique; Cricket's arguments; two angel sisters; the monkey's change of heart; and then there is a fulfilling climax that takes you beyond the happy ending you saw in the 1940 animated film. A big thank you to Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson for delivering an extended version of a timeless tale that none of us predicted to be so modern and philosophical. The current social media generation has something to preserve from Pinocchio's World and a lot to learn. Give it a watch, but first see the original to understand why you have more to enjoy this time.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "\"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" is a stop-motion animated film based on the novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Carlo Conti. Featuring the voices of Ewan McGregor, David Bradley, and Ron Perlman, it breathes new life into the classic Italian children's story with a superb blend of poignancy, great animation, and that signature del Toro charm.Twenty years after the death of his young son Carlo during the Great War, the carpenter Geppetto (voiced by David Bradley) is still unable to move on from his loss and remains in a depressed state. One night, a drunken Geppetto decides to cut down a nearby pinecone tree to carve out a new son to honour Carlo's memory. After Geppetto passes out during the carving process, a blue wood sprite (voiced by Tilda Swinton) appears before the incomplete puppet and brings him to life, bestowing him with the name \"Pinocchio\". The following morning, Geppetto is shocked to find that Pinocchio (voiced by Gregory Mann) is now alive but soon decides to let him learn about the outside world and everything it has to offer a young boy.After several decades of adapting Carlo Conti's beloved story about the puppet \"Pinocchio\", there is only really one that people remember best - Disney's 1940 animated feature film. This groundbreaking movie helped set the standard of what traditionally animated films could do at the time with its memorable characters, songs, and morals that audiences of all ages can appreciate. Unfortunately, Disney had to tarnish the great legacy of that film with their terrible 2022 live-action cash-grab remake, which contained nothing of what made the original so magical in the first place. However, thanks to the unique vision of a filmmaker like Guillermo del Toro, we now have an adaptation that rivals the 1940 movie in almost every way, with a fantastic stop-motion feature that washes away all the bad aftertaste of Disney's recent offering.What separates this film significantly from its 2022 Disney counterpart is that it was clearly made with the intent to both entertain and pay respect towards the source material. Right from the very beginning, we are properly introduced to the characters of Geppetto and Carlo, a father and son pair whom share a loving bond with each other. What I liked is that the film actually took the opportunity to show us how close the two really are, with scenes that involve Geppetto reading his son bedtime stories and Carlo desiring to work with his father when he grows up. Then when the inevitable tragedy of Carlo's passing occurs, the audience better understands the grief Geppetto is experiencing over losing his son, which of course leads to him carving a wooden puppet bearing his likeness. This hasn't been extensively shown in other adaptations and it is small moments like this that demonstrate the stark contrast between the actual effort of this film and the lazy, by-the-numbers approach from Disney. In fact, I felt more emotion from this film's first two minutes than I did the entire duration of Disney's poor attempt.Something else this film greatly succeeds at is its wonderful stop-motion animation. Everything about the way this film operates brims with so much visual beauty that it is hard to look away for even a second. I absolutely loved the attention-to-detail used on each of the characters and setpieces. It is clear that Pinocchio's wooden body has been cleverly constructed in such a way that he will always be the most distinguishable character on screen. No matter the location, Pinocchio always stands out among the various places he ends up, whether it is a bright Italian village or the dark underworld. It definitely helps you understand the painstaking love that went into crafting each frame of this movie. Stop-motion animation is always a long and arduous process that can be draining on all of those involved so I have great respect for everyone who poured their heart and soul into what can be best described as a labour of love. Best of all, stop-motion films always stand the test of time so this movie is going to age really well.I also appreciate the entirely different time period of this film. Unlike the original novel, which was written and set all the way back in 1883, this film actually takes place within the backdrop of World War II, a time when Italy was under the leadership of dictator Benito Mussolini. With this new time period, we get to see Pinocchio experience the darker aspects of being a young boy during this era, such as his exposure to fascist propaganda and potential drafting into the Italian Army. It is during these parts that we get to see Pinocchio learn important lessons about having free will and the resulting consequences of his actions. Very few movies made today would have the guts to set a children's story during one of the bleakest periods of the 20th century, let alone one that everybody is already familiar with, but all of it works so well. This was a dangerous gamble on del Toro's part, a gamble that thankfully paid off.All of the voice actors sounded great as their respective characters, with the young newcomer Gregory Mann carrying the film in the lead role of Pinocchio. I liked the enthusiasm Mann injected into Pinocchio's character, who in spite of his initial naivety, soon learns the necessary lessons about the world around him. Ewan McGregor was also a standout as Sebastian J. Cricket, this film's equivalent of Jiminy Cricket. In addition to being Pinocchio's personal guide, Sebastian also serves as the film's narrator, with McGregor's energetic voiceover offering some occasional comic relief whenever necessary. There are also some frequent del Toro collaborators rounding out the cast, such as David Bradley, who appeared in the del Toro created TV series \"Tales Of Arcadia\", and Ron Perlman, who of course played Hellboy in the two films directed by del Toro. Everyone felt right at home in their roles and it was fun to anticipate what each actor could bring to the characters they were voicing.In a year where we have had not one but two film adaptations of a classic children's story, it is quite surprising to see that the movie with the least financial backing behind it (US$35 million vs. US$150 million) was what won out in the end. It just goes to show that with the correct visionary outlook behind it, you can create something truly magnificent that does justice to the source material. On the other hand, if you have plenty of money but are artistically bankrupt, you will not reap the benefits you may have hoped for. With all of that said, which 2022 Pinocchio film would YOU rather see? A passion project that utilises the intricate talents of everyone involved or a soulless cash-grab that does little more than waste people's time? The choice is yours.I rate it a solid 9/10.",

It is obviously darker than regular Disney movies. It is more similar to Japanese Anime movies. Good movie for all ages. Guillermo Det Toro proved once again that he's a great director.

            "content": "Surprisingly, this is the first form of Pinocchio that have been exposed to. I likely saw the original Disney Pinocchio but I was too young to remember. This version is a far more mature telling of the story, with an all-star cast and gorgeous animation.This film's animation has had so much effort and care put into it. The models are glorious and expressive, the environments beautifully realised and the imagery is exquisite. Guillermo Del Toro continues to excel with his direction. The voice acting is also top notch especially David Bradley as Geppetto. This movie is as much about him as it is about Pinocchio. The movie deals with themes of loss, grief and the struggle to move on extremely well and the more mature moments are balanced with some good humour. The soundtrack is also superb although some of the songs have some clear uses of autotune.The characters are all equally memorable. As said earlier, Geppetto is the highlight but Gregory Mann wonderfully portrays Pinocchio and his dialogue is child-like yet brilliant. Christoph Waltz also shines as the abusive Count Volpe and he is a perfect antagonist. However, the weakest part of the story is the fascist element. While it is mostly executed well, I feel the arc for Candlewick, played by Finn Wolfhard, felt as if it was not fully developed. His defining moment just doesn't have as much weight behind it. Despite this, the film still hits hard in its emotional moments, almost bringing me to tears.Overall, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is fantastic and one of the best animated films that I have seen recently. The animation is gorgeous, voice acting superb and the soundtrack wonderful. It is well-worth watching and it might be my favourite film from Guillermo Del Toro.",

            "content": "Magnifico. A thoroughly imaginative feature with passion in every scene, every frame. This film is what stepping into fantasy feels like. The kind of inspiring creativity we only see fully realized from filmmakers like del Toro, Miyazaki, and Selick.Yet what elevates this reimagining is not the aesthetic alone, but in how its thematic focus is firmly centered on Gepetto's loss, loneliness, and the meaning of life, death, & life after death. It hovers over some profound and difficult ideas, such as coming to grips with the fact that no one of us will be here forever. It gets pretty dark, and the ending rivals Toy Story 3 in the way it pulls on the strings of emotional devastation.The film takes place in Mussolini's WWII Italy, presenting a simplified war is good/bad morality tale, while simultaneously digging into deeper themes that contrast the effects a father's expectations can have on a young boy. There is one segment that doesn't quite fit seamlessly into the flow of what is otherwise an intimate story about Geppetto and his son. However, the strong thematic arc still connects everything well. For instance, Gepetto's real son's name in the film is Carlo, which is the same name as the original author of Pinocchio-a beautiful gesture from del Toro that, after countless iterations of the story, he intends to finally bring the \"real\" Pinocchio back to life for audiences around the world.The score by Alexandre Desplat has some memorable tunes composed fittingly in the Minor key, with heartfelt lyrics all co-written by Guillermo del Toro himself. He dedicates the film to his parents, and has said that his mother was his main inspiration to make the film. Sadly, she passed away just a month before the film's premiere. It is just apparent with each stop-motion frame that this is an earnest and intimate work from the wooden pine center of del Toro's heart.Personally, this is the best animated film I've seen in years. I hope it wins Best Animated Film and gets a Best Picture nom. It drops on Netflix this weekend so clear a few hours from your schedule to watch.",

Whilst Gepetto becomes very fond of the boy, he doesn't always do what he is told and starts out on a number of sometimes dangerous adventures with his new father always searching for him.3rd adaptation in as many years and the only one that is fully animated, this is by far the best nicely mixing a wonderful fairytale with some often extremely dark material, helped along by a Pinocchio's character that is not always that sweet. There's a wonderful array of actors voicing the various characters with Evan McGregor and Christophe Waltz, standouts.

It was done in collaboration with the Jim Henson studio, so I suppose it's mostly puppetry filmed in stop-motion photography. The effect is quite enthralling and visually creative.Technically, the movie is a 10. But . . . Having said that, 15 minutes of this foreboding journey into the abyss is enough. Because I can't figure out who this dark and stupifying version of Pinocchio is meant to appeal to let alone entertain. You can't take kids to see it, or shouldn't, and it offers nothing for any adult 16+. There are themes (like the Musolini fascists and heavy presence of oppressive religion) in this script that either are not in the original (the setting is WWI instead of the late 19th C when the original Pinocchio was written) or I just can't recall; but in any case, they seem out of place in a fairytale, even one with heavy moral messages. Yet the writing here is quite juvenile, making the movie, in spite of its aesthetic appeal, seem ponderous and, well, wooden. On top of it, it's a musical!

Cricket, also Christopher Walts ,as a re imagined/clever twist on some characters by Del Toro, fits perfectly.The war setting was undoubtedly clever, well executed & never mocked ,as sometimes happens especially in animations.No major flaws for me, the only reason I didn't give it another star its because I felt that Geppetto, for the weigh of the role, maybe needed a more familiar voice. Having said that, David Bradley does a great job, Geppetto's desperation is really well portrait but most of the times he sounds like he is constantly drunk.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Looking for someone to create the opposite of a whimsical childhood fairy tale? The obvious answer is filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (an Oscar winner). He has built his career on delivering dark thrillers that dig into the recesses of our nightmares (PAN'S LABRYNTH, THE SHAPE OF WATER). In fact, he's a master of this, which makes his vision of Carlo Callodi's 1883 book a must see. GDT shares a director credit with animation expert Mark Gustafson (FANTASTIC MR FOX, 2009) and screenwriting credit with Patrick McHale. Matthew Robbins has a 'screen story' credit, and of course it all links back to Callodi's source material.From scene one we immediately sense the different approach than both the light-hearted Disney animated classic from 1940 and Robert Zemeckis' sentimental live-action version starring Tom Hanks released just a few months ago. It's darker and gloomier with a unique stop-action look saturated in browns. We also recognize that GDT has chosen a different timeline, as the effects of one of the last WWI bombs takes the life of Geppetto's beloved young son, Carlo, and Mussolini and fascism are referenced throughout the story.Everyone knows the story, and the core remains intact - though GDT adds his special touches and twists. One night, a drunken grieving woodcrafter carves a wooden puppet. As Geppetto sleeps it off, the Wood Sprite brings the puppet to life, and just like that, Pinocchio is born and Geppetto has his new son. Another unexpected twist is how much of the film is musical with song lyrics and music by del Toro and the film's composer, two-time Oscar winner Alexandre Desplat. But don't mistake songs for an upbeat movie. It's still dark and bleak, and of course, GDT nails the sea beast whose belly houses Geppetto and Mr. Cricket in the most thrilling segment.Young Gregory Mann voices Pinocchio and Carlo, Ewan McGregor voices Sebastian J Cricket, and David Bradley is Geppetto. Beyond that, the all-star voice cast features Ron Perlman, John Turturro, Finn Wolfhard, Cate Blanchett, Tim Blake Nelson, Christoph Waltz, Tilda Swinton, and Burn Gorman. No one does fantasy-horror better than Guillermo del Toro, and even with his first foray into animation, delivers a unique look and spin on a familiar story. He even makes it easy to pick up on the Frankenstein (the Mary Shelley novel) influence, so I'll say it again ... don't mistake this for the family-friendly Disney fare you grew up on.Opens in theaters on December 9, 2022.",

Instead I found myself hoping he'd turn back into a real puppet and shut up.I liked the idea of updating the story but I feel like it didn't add anything. Just a lot of side characters who's storylines felt rushed or unnecessary. If this is aimed at an older audience then it would've suited an even darker take on the story and if it was purely for kids it would benefit from some more fun and excitement.So overall pretty dull and too long.

            "content": "The film we have here is \"Pinocchio\" from the year 2022 and this is not the Zemeckis/Hanks collaboration, but the film with a longer running time by Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro. He was a co-writer and co-director here. As for direction, he collaborated with Mark Gustafson, a successul stop-motion animator and Emmy winner a few decades ago and the co-writer is Patrick McHale, who has worked on more recent programs too and scored more recent awards recognition. But the big name is del Toro. He had a new film out in 2021 too, not an animated movie, so he is pretty prolific these days as his 60th birthday is getting closer. I like him, he seems like a nice fella and I also like some of his movies, so I was curious about this one here too. You do not see it really too often that defining directors go from live action to animation, which means this film here is surely a bit of an exception, but looking at the success and praise it has received, it is a step that del Toro will be happy to have taken, especially if we look at other recent takes on (very) old cartoons or animated films. There were quite a few that got remade with modern technologies in recent years, but not one of them was loved as much by the critics as this one here it seems. Maybe because the technology does not look too new. Just look at Pinocchio himself. He is all about the wood here rather than about being a human. By the way, Carlo Collodi who invented the character in the 19th century is also credited on imdb for this film. Good for him, even if he died during a time where he did not find out anymore about the success Pinocchio would have as a movie character. Barely find out about movies at all.This film is pretty long for an animated movie as it comes extremely close to the two-hour mark and you could argue if it is too long for children's patience, but the response is that this is not really a kids movie, at least not for very young kids. No surprise here. Del Toro has worked on other films that involved children at the center of the story, but weren't really for children. With his name attached to the project, it should surprise nobody that you will find some really big names as voice cast members here. Gregory Mann and David Bradley (looks a bit like Willie Nelson) people are perhaps not too familiar with, but I think their voices felt extremely right for the two main characters. Especially Mann was a spot-on addition. The big Hollywood players you find then with the supporting characters. Oscar winners Blanchett, Swinton and Waltz are in here and add to that Emmy winners Turturro and McGregor plus of course the always appreciated Ron Perlman, who has worked with del Toro on so many occasions. I watched the English-language original today with German subtitles, so I got to hear these voices. Looking at these big names, I would not have recognized them, but I find it interesting that Blanchett gave her voice to Spazzatura and not one of the two mysterious magical cat characters which might have been the obvious choice. I really liked Spazzatura by the way, maybe even my favorite character from the entire movie, the little monkey. I will not compare this new film to the one from 1940, from the days of World War II, because it has been a long time since I watched that old movie and my memory there is not too good. So you see there were over 80 years between them. Completely new approach on the tale.What I find interesting, however, is how in this new film here there is crucial elaboration on the rise of fascism and this is where/when the film is set. So it is set during the days when the old Pinocchio classic then got made. What you see in here were the days back then with constant danger of getting killed. Mussolini is also mentioned and shown here. This was mostly a mockery though, no historic impact whatsoever. Actually, you could have thought that this scene with the performance for Mussolini could be the end of the film and the spectacular highlight, but it was not and that was alright. We all knew at that point what was going to happen and that Pinocchio surely would not let his (at that point) captor look good in the eyes of Mussolini. Also pretty telling that Pinocchio got shot once again. Or killed once again I should say. The other times when he got killed it was not through gunfire. Dangerous days for little boys apparently though with how often he suffers lethal (or fatal?) injury in here. Or add to that also the second biggest character's son who dies relatively early on and turns Geppetto into a broken man struggling with alcoholism and more. Maybe the beginning and end of the film were actually the highlights. The scene in which Geppetto loses his son was sad and touching and same is also true with the ending in which we see Pinocchio live on, but the three characters near him die eventually. The story is told from the cricket's perspective, so the cricket does not know what happened to Pinocchio in the end and where he went and neither do we as a consequence. But he seems alright. This was also a somewhat touching inclusion there not only because of the three tombstones, but because of the moment when Pinocchio finds the cricket lying there dead and it is something that will surely hit harder for everybody who has once or more often found their pets in the same state. Nothing nice. But good job to the filmmakers here for evoking these emotions.As for everything in-between, it was never a remotely poor movie by any means, but also not super great I would say. The sudden switch to how they all end up in this monster from the sea came a bit out of nowhere. It was still fun to watch with how Pinocchio then could let it all out and lie about how he loves war and about many others things in order for them to reach the \"exit\" and be saved. Finally, Pinocchio must make a crucial decision and sacrifice his eternity in order to save Geppetto. This was one of the most dramatic moments of the film, but not one of the most emotional for me either. The moment towards the end when the cricket uses his wish to bring Pinocchio back to life was better and more touching from my perspective. You knew what would come, even if he had to convince this magical creature first, but of course the cricket would make the altruist choice and not go for the wealth or fame he was talking about earlier. Said cricket was always inside Pinocchio. The tree that Pinocchio was made of was his home already and then later on Pinocchio turned into and stayed his home, also long after the cricket's death as we find out in a nice little memorial inclusion towards the end too. By the way, these two fateful characters resembling cats were voiced by Tilda Swinton and I thought the one representing death reminded me a lot of a character from the relatively recent video game King's Quest. There the character was an antagonist though. Here it is neutral and just following or even making the rules. If you thought the same about this character, feel free to check out my King's Quest review, especially if you loved the game as much as I did.But now let's get back to this movie and I will just do a little brainstorming now: This is not the only 2022 film that tells us about a Mussolini car accident that may have cost a child's life. Well, here it was not Mussolini in person who was driving the car, but basically the character who represented Il Duce and his vision of fascist Italy. It was the father of another boy, so there was in fact another father-son story in here, but that one did not end so well. It does end well with the boys though as we see a nice depiction of friendship here. That came a bit surprising how well they got along eventually, not because of what happened during their first meeting, but rather because of how they did not really spend a lot of time together to get there and become really close. So I am not sure if this was the wisest inclusion, but it was kinda cute. Pay attention to the scene early on with the boy telling Pinocchio to get closer to the fire. I think he knew exactly about the impact fire would have on wood and did this because he was not jealous when his father said a few positive words about Pinocchio, even if everything else he said about the character was negative. What else? Oh yeah, the Italian background is recurring because of the Italian flag being used here and there, because of Mussolini being a (minor) part of this film, because of the Italian-sounding names of the characters and also because of how Pinocchio keeps calling Geppetto his \"papa\" on many occasions. That is all then. This film gets a positive recommendation and I am glad I saw it today. Was a bit of an exception because I think with the movie theaters where I go to it was only on today and will be tomorrow, but not the full next week. It is shown in many other movie theaters though. I read that this is the film that is considered the maybe even comfortable frontrunner this year for the animation Oscar and if it was really this good I cannot say and would rather negate, but the thumbs-up was never in doubt for me here. Animation, voice work, character design, all is convincing. The music is fine too, no surprise with Desplat in charge here and on the song front \"Everything Is New to Me\" is such an incredibely positive and catchy tune that you simply have to groove along. I hope that Collodi is maybe up there somewhere looking down on us and seeing how much of a factor his little puppet is still over 130 years after his death. Go see this film that is absolutely no burden at all.",

And that was because the core of the story is really more than solid.That all being said, the amount of work Del Toro put into this movie ... is astounding to say the least. There is an extra behind the scenes feature on Netflix ... and while I have not watched it all, the things I saw make it more than worthwhile! Voice acting, puppet work ... special effects, photography, the little tweaks to the story ... there is so much to be enjoyed here ... even for those who already know the story inside and out ... this really was worth waiting for. And hopefully it did not get spoiled by the other movie ... it would be more than a shame .. I won't lie!",

            "content": "Set in Italy during the rise of fascism, Geppetto (David Bradley) is an alcoholic woodcarver who still grieves over the death of his son Carlo (Gregory Mann) who died in a bombing during the Great War. In a drunken rage, Geppetto chops down the pine that marks Carlo's grave, unaware of Sebastian J. Cricket (Ewan McGregor) is currently residing in said pine and crafts a wooden puppet with the intention of bringing back Carlo. Taking pity on Geppetto, an ancient Wood Sprite (Wilda Swinton) visits Geppetto's home and bestows the gift of life to the puppet, named Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) as he's made of Pine, and assigns Sebastian to guide Pinocchio. Geppetto is taken aback by Pinocchio not only because of his status as a living puppet and his calling Geppetto \"papa\", but also of the puppet's insatiable curiosity which coupled with his flagrant disobedience leads to misadventures.Pinocchio has been a long time passion project for director Guillermo del Toro who although initially announcing the project in 2008, del Toro had wanted to make his own version of the story since he was a teenager intending to hold the tone closer to the darker tone of the original story by Carlo Collodi. Del Toro co-directs the film alongside Mark Gustafson, a veteran animator who has had extensive experience in stop-motion having served under the legendary Will Vinton on several of his projects, and del Toro also writes alongside Patrick McHale who wrote the critically acclaimed Over the Garden Wall. Despite its relatively inexpensive budget of $35 million (in comparison to other larger films) del Toro and co. Often found themselves in difficulty in acquiring the resources for the film leading to the film falling into development hell until it was acquired by Netflix in 2017. Now appearing on Netflix's streaming service after following on several other Pinocchio movies (including two this year one of which was a big budget Disney production), del Toro's Pinocchio undeniably stands as apart from the crowded field with a unique take on the story that embraces the darkness of Collodi's original source work, while forging ahead on its own terms.To start off, the animation and visuals on display in Pinocchio are gorgeous. When I heard this film cost $35 million while the Disney version from earlier this year cost $150 million my jaw came pretty close to hitting the floor. Pinocchio is just incredibly beautiful to look at with its realization of the Italian countryside in 1930s fascist Italy a fully realized vision that transports you to that place and time. The character models aim to capture the stylistic choices of the original illustrations with some adjustments made for the transition from 2D drawings to 3D puppets and it does so very well with the character's faces, movements, and designs carrying emotion and grace in every frame. The movie features a more earthly colored color palette in comparison to the 1940 Disney film (or its live-action remake) and thematically and tonally the fit couldn't be better.In terms of the writing and storytelling, this version of Pinocchio hits all the major beats you remember from the story but while similar events happy they've been recontextualized to make themselves less isolated as individual episodes and smoothed into a running narrative. The movie features Christoph Waltz and Ron Perlman as our primary antagonists, Count Volpe and Podesta respectively, and they're very much analogues for Stromboli and The Coachman from the original story. The way these characters and episodes are incorporated into this depiction of fascist Italy is pretty seamless all things considered with Pinocchio's stage show becoming more like a propaganda piece and the Podesta's elite youth military training center starting off with the naive young boy's fantasy of what war is only for the dark reality to come forth. David Bradley is great as Geppetto who is a much darker and hardened take on this character is than we've seen before with the film actually following through on what the Tom Hanks version of the character only briefly flirted with in the live-action film. Bradley's performance is fantastic and you feel the rage, frustration, and despair in his voice from the opening scenes where his son is lost to his interactions with the troublesome Pinocchio later. Ewan McGregor is also very good as the overly abused Sebastian J. Cricket and much like the Collodi story this poor cricket is abused by everything but the kitchen sink (and even that's probably in their somewhere). We also have Tilda Swinton in a dual role as the Wood Sprite who grants Pinocchio life and the Wood Sprite's sister Death with both positioned as ethereal and ancient beings who embody two sides of the same coin.Last but certainly not least in Gregory Mann who plays both Pinocchio and Carlo and he does both incredibly well despite this being his first lead role. The contrast between the quiet and good natured kindness of Carlo versus the energetic, selfish, and often destructive actions of Pinocchio is really well done and the movie does a good job of capturing Pinocchio's character from the book in comparison to the wide-eyed naive innocent of the 1940 film. Despite Pinocchio being absolutely out of control in the opening act of the story, you can still see a good heart underneath the rougher edges. There's a satisfying arc with this character and it follows through on an ending that is equal parts happy and tragic and I'm sure will leave very few dry eyed.What more can I say about Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio that isn't already on display? This is a true labor of love as it survived a 14 year development hell cycle and has now finally come out and done what the Disney version couldn't despite possessing nearly 5 times del Toro's budget. If you watch this movie you will not regret it.",

            "content": "Make no mistake - this is a visually stunning animation accomplishment with stellar moments and interesting new ideas and themes that seem to haunt del Toro quite a lot.The biggest difference is probably the change of the original story's setting from the late 19th century to World War II era Italy. Yes, even Mussolini plays a minor role, and his design is glorious.But even if you're willing to go with the flow and accept all the changes, some things still are a bit confusing. This is a much more mature version of Pinocchio, so why put in so many musical numbers?Speaking of which - the music was great for the most part, except for the singing. I have no idea why so many modern movies have to resort to such horribly executed pitch correction, but boy, was it horrible here. I'm guessing that mixing engineers with no music mixing experience had to do it, because it's so obvious and bad that I refuse to believe that it was actually done by someone with musical ears. It kinda takes you out of the story if it's a warm-hearted story about being human, but the singing sounds like it was generated by some first generation A. I.But in the end there are way more positive aspects to this film than negative ones, so don't listen to all those geniuses who take their kids to a Guillermo del Toro film and then complain that it wasn't for kids at all and enjoy an emotional ride with a lot of sad and dark elements, realized with a beautifully designed approach in its design and execution.",

            "content": "The Guillermo del Toro/Netflix project, produced in 2022, competed in many festivals and received awards.Dishonored by Disney+, Pinocchio has been brought back to life, this time with the Netflix/Del toro collaboration.Del Toro chose stop-motion while telling the story, which is a pretty good idea.The screenplay of the movie is signed by Adventure Time and Over the Garden Wall screenwriter/producer Patrick McHale, and it's quite palpable in some scenes.Gregory Mann character Pinocchio\nDavid Bradley gave life to Gepetto and they did their job properly.The dubbing cast of the movie is like the champions league.Del Toro paid homage to his additions to the character of Cricket (Ewan McGregor) by adding the author of the story, Carlo Collodi, to his story.Having watched Spielberg's movie A. I and reread Carlo's book as well, I don't understand why Del Toro changed the character of The Blue Fairy to Wood Sprite as a movie.What I love most about the movie is that the darkness does not just remain as a color gamut and is reflected in the spirit of the story from time to time.The attitude of the public towards Pinocchio in the church scene reminded me of Quasimodo in Victor Hugo's book Notre Dame de Paris - which is said to be influenced by Carlo's book Notre Dame de Paris written in 1881 in the book Pinocchio published in 1883.Del Toro has done a lot of reading/research on this subject. He had already said that he wanted to make a dark version of this story for the first time in 2008. He even described Pinocchio as a 'Passion Project' and said, 'I have never wanted to make a story so many films in my life'.Del Toro watched the classic 1940 Disney animated film adaptation in Guadalajara, Mexico, as a child, and liked it very much, as he felt the film feel like a \"horror movie\" all its own because of the few intense hearings it contained.This project was first put into practice in 2011, but the production was interrupted because producers Grimly and Mark Gustafson did not like the draft version of the film.On May 7, 2012, del Toro takes over from Grimly, in February 2012 del Toro draws (charcoal) with some concept design with Pinocchio, Geppetto, Talking Cricket, Mangiafuoco and Fox and the Cat designs.On July 30, 2012, it is announced that the film will be produced and animated by ShadowMachine, and the film is planned to be released before 2014, but the project is in crisis due to various financial reasons.On January 23, 2017, Patrick McHale, the creator of Over the Garden Wall, announced that he will write the script with del Toro, which does not have the expected effect because McHale was not such a popular name at the time.In 2017, del Toro told IndieWire and at the 74th Venice International Film Festival that the film's budget should be increased by another $35 million or it would be cancelled.On November 8, 2017, it was announced that the project would be canceled before it took place as no studio was willing to finance it, but on October 22, 2018, it was announced that the film would be re-projected with the acquisition of Netflix.Del Toro states that the Netflix investment that came at the last moment and the references to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein should be added to this movie because it makes the two characters very similar to each other.Interestingly, Netflix is negotiating with Disney for the animation portion of the movie, and Disney is keen on this, but Del Toro opposes the deal, saying the movie shouldn't be in the Disney fabric.Unlike most versions of Pinocchio set in 1800s Italy, Guillermo del Toro decided to set up this version in 1930s Italy under Benito Mussolini and the National Fascist Party.This is del Toro's third film set during a real-life political conflict, after The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth (set during and after the Spanish Civil War, respectively).Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio goes down in history as the longest Stop-Motion movie ever made...The idea that the name of Gepetto's deceased son would be carlo was an idea put forward by Del toro at the last moment... The boy is mentioned only as 'Boy' both in the script of the film and in all the shootings... Del Toro says he chose this name to pay homage to the author of the story.This isn't the first Pinocchio adaptation to dig into Geppetto's past by adding the loss of his own family. The 1972 Italian miniseries The Adventures of Pinocchio/Le avventure di Pinocchio did something similar, making Geppetto a widow and the Blue Fairy the ghost of his deceased wife.Four wings have been added to the character of The Wood Sprite... This is a complete reference to the biblical book of Ezekiel, which Del Toro added more references from the Old Testament to the movie, although I didn't like it much.Ron Perlman and Burn Gorman, who often work with Guillermo del Toro, feature in this film. This is also Cate Blanchett's second del Toro film after Nightmare Alley (2021).In November 2018, the Netflix side announced the release date of the movie as 2021, but in January 2021, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos announced that Netflix has six animated films per year.",

Every song sucks. The composer of the music is no Danny Elfman. Worse than The Nightmare Before Christmas in every single possible way.

While this is an original concept I'm just puzzled at what age demographic the Director is pitching his vision towards.I my opinion It's certainly to scary and dark for children and I doubt an adult audience,especially if like me they love the original story will be very impressed.The only film version of Pinocchio in recent years that I've really enjoyed is the 2019 Italian version by Director Matteo Garrone that starred Roberto Benigni as Geppetto it seem to come and go in a hurry .I rated that live version a 9/10 it's also much darker than the Disney versions but it followers the original Collodi version to the letter.It retains the magic and the appeal of Pinocchio which I can't say Guillermo del Toro's new version.There's some impressive stars voicing the famous characters Ewan McGregor as Cricket without much personality, Cate Blanchett as Spazatura a Dr Who 'ish dalek version of The Blue Fairy with a voice to match and David Bradley as a very crusty Geppetto.The most important character Pinocchio is voiced by Gregory Mann who does a good job in creating the most petulant unlovable Pinocchio I've ever met ,he's a real brat .As I began my review I praise the technology and puppetry animation and I enjoyed some of the songs by Alexandre Desplat one of my favourite film score composers I'm sure the song Better Tomorrow's will be an Oscar nominated song.",

How mistaken I was!Del Toro gives us the best version of Pinocchio, the most emotional, the most meaningful (and it was difficult because the classic is already so much), the darkest, the heaviest thematically, and the best balanced. The script works perfectly, with the feet on the ground and never forgetting the origins of the character. This is a markedly more Italian film. Markedly more incisive and critical about war and fascism, with huge metaphors and great lessons. It's also a film with a brilliant father-son relationship, never forgetting the friends and the importance of having good people around you.The score is beautiful and super catchy and there is a song (Ciao Papa) that moved me so much that I had to go back and repeat the whole sequence. Not being the biggest fan of stop-motion (although recognize the big effort to put it into practice), I never thought I would like the way the technique is used here so much. All the characters have their own life, identity, and personality. I loved everything that is done with them and everything that these characters represent.The first minutes immediately start to break your heart and the film never stops touching your soul until its impactful ending.

A loner Italian man who was so bereft by the death of a son that he created another one. The ending is what I think bothered him the most. Much like in \"Beauty In the Beast\" the message being that beauty is skin deep doesn't bode well in Disney-esque fashion IF the beast becomes a handsome prince. Fair enough. In Del Toro world, we are left with so many questions. Top of the list is: why are the townspeople so quick to accept a walking talking...uh...puppet? Why is a 60 year old man...a father and NOT a grandfather? What happened to Geppetto's wife?The unfortunate part of this flick is the same thing that burned me with \"JoJo Rabbit\" - The anachronistic world which dips its toes in reality (fascistic World War) with the fantastical - magic fairies that grants wishes. This movie is so muddled in its message and ends with a melancholic thud.Does Pinocchio have feelings or what? Think he does. None of it earned or learned. It's a really frustrating ride if you are married to the original story. I found myself racking my brain over what was from the source material.It also has the same problem the Kubrick/Spielberg adaption of \"A. I.\" Where the manufactured boy isn't suppose to have emotions. Again, to make a child so unconditional in its affection stinks of the worst things we accuse Hollywood of: a word I've been censored on here. This project adds its log to the fire.Pinnochio was never a story I cared about. But was always fascinated why Hollywood was determined to repeatedly hammer its tale. Why? Still have no idea. Perhaps it's to show the idea that we never want to grow up? Eternal life versus a mortal one. Falls flat. The comedy elements of it also hits the ground with a thud. It speaks louder of the storyteller's own psyche.The movie is depressing and miserable to sit through. This movie drains itself of the joy of reconnection with family. The ending DESPERATELY wants you to feel the swell of emotions but doesn't It is actually kind of grim comment on life and death. I really wanted to like this movie. It left me with the same melancholy that \"Nightmare Alley\" had. It refuses to be a fairy tale.Summary: Meh.",

It's dark, yet whimsical. There is rage, love and excitement. The plot was beautiful and the animation, while not technically realistic, was dreamlike and stunning. It was also emotional and hard. I have never much liked any of the Pinocchio movies, but this one won my heart. I do wish there wasn't so much singing, but as it's a dark tale, perhaps it helps to lighten the mood.I laughed and cried and smiled. I was moved from beginning to end. I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Del Toro once again drops another banger of a movie. Coming off of Zemeckis's film, this is the Holy Grail. First off, the stop motion animation looks absolutely spectacular and is easily the best animation from a film that I have seen all year. I desperately hope this wins Best Animated Film at the Oscars this year. Del Toro made a great decision when he decided to set the film against the background of the start of WWII and the rise of fascism as the film's core message talks about staying true to yourself regardless of what other people or leaders think of you or how you look. The story does take some creative liberties here like removing anything to deal with donkeys and pleasure island and instead replacing them with an Italian Youth Camp which accomplishes the same goal and after having a bunch of Pinocchio adaptations recently a change of setting is very much appreciated. The voice acting from everyone is great especially Ewan McGregor, David Bradley and Gregory Mann. Mann and Bradley especially have some great chemistry together and Mann has a beautiful singing voice. All of the characters are interesting to follow especially Christoph Waltz's Count Volpe who was one of the more interesting characters presented here. The score from Alexandre Desplat is whimsical and wonderful while also having that dark element in there which compliments the tone of the film greatly. The humor also tends to land a lot here as there were many jokes and moments that got me but the film also leans into its darker setting a lot as well with some very heavy scenes here and there. This is easily the best animated film to come out of 2022 so far so definitely check it out.",

            "review_title": "Incredible Retelling of the Good Hearted Wooden Boy",
            "content": "As of this month, acclaimed fantasy filmmaker Guillermo del Toro has released his biggest passion project to date, his own retelling of Carlo Collodi's classic book series Pinocchio. Released to Netflix in time for the holiday season, the film reimagines the famous story in 1930s Fascist Italy, as well as taking influence from artist Gris Grimly's illustrations. On top of Grisly serving as co-producer and lead character designer on the project, the talents of co writers Patrick McHale and Matthew Robbins shine on screen in a film far deserving of its current acclaim. It's safe to say that this is one of the stronger Pinocchio iterations out there.The film follows the story of Italian puppet maker Geppetto, who is so heartbroken by the death of his son Carlo that he builds a wooden boy called Pinocchio. Once Pinocchio is given the gift of life, he learns about love and disobedience while struggling to live up to Geppetto's expectations, discovering the true meaning of life. From the very start, the themes of childhood wonderment and societal demands are made clear as the film's setting is emphasized in its war grown setting. What could've easily turned into a truly dark take on the story ends up with a lot of whimsy and heart thanks to Pinocchio's curiosity affecting both himself and the people around him, complete with genuine consequences of whether he can truly live or not. Much like del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, the blending of surreal fantasy and tragic warcry actually holds the story together, as for every fun filled moment in the wooden boy's life, there's a grueling reality he has to face amongst his own country. By keeping the theme of being oneself against the expectations of others, this iteration of Pinocchio remains as faithful as ever.As for the cast of characters themselves, they are not only defined by their roles, but also their actors. Gregory Mann provides a lot of joy and angst portraying Pinocchio amongst David Bradley as the more realistic yet frightened Geppetto. One can see from their chemistry how difficult it is for them to bond as father and son based on who they are and how drastic their current situation is. Speaking of father and son, a bigger example of demanding too much from your kid lies in the fascist government official Podesta and his son Candlewick. One wants his son to be a war bled man regardless of what Candlewick wants to do, and Ron Perlman makes him menacing through so much determination. On the most lighthearted side of things, the narrating Sebastian J. Cricket acts as a spiritual guide for Pinocchio despite him only being able to do his best, and Ewan McGregor clearly had a ball bringing this bright storyteller to life through heart and soul. On top of many other characters that aid the plot in wanting Pinocchio for their own needs, the cast truly make the feature intense in many different ways.Now it's time to delve into the true highlight of the feature: the animation direction and musical accompaniment. In recreating the look and feel of 1930s Italy, during its then prominent fascist rise no less, the environments scream authenticity down to the core of posters, village houses and forests. By translating the gritty rough look of Collodi's artwork, the characters appear naturally believable and grotesque and move with believable humanity that the acting comes through the performance, especially in regards to Pinocchio's simplified yet broad expressions. The effects work is also a nice touch, with a lot of attention to detail in the compositing of each different layer, lighting element and overall effects piece in place of the specific scene. In addition to Alexander Desplat's enchanting score, the few musical numbers sprinkled throughout offer some nicely touched choreography and subtly placed motion to allow the character to say something on top of merely putting on a performance. Whether or not this film's production was done during the pandemic, everyone's efforts paid off gorgeously.In a day and age where family films are lacking in risk orientated narratives and maturely dark themes, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio stands as a remarkable achievement in both stop-motion animation and bold cinematic storytelling. Regardless if you're familiar with Collodi's book or other iterations, this film is a must watch for anybody this holiday season, let alone any day of any given year. It's only a matter of time before this feature becomes a true classic in years to come, for its heart lies in how much it dared to tackle so many serious themes through integral fantasy, and that alone makes it a truly gifted work of art.",

            "content": "I initially gave this film by Guillermo del Toro five stars. I thought the story was okay but nothing special while the art direction and animation I thought stunning. I watched the beginning of this again and have had to reduce the number of stars. The art style is still great but everything else is just annoying. This is evident from the very beginning. I'm not going to go into this too much (for fear of a very long post) so I will focus on the film's premise.A very old man, who cannot be younger than 70, has a son who cannot be much older than 10. The son is killed in an airstrike in a church after retrieving a pine cone and then choosing to stare up at the wooden Christ above the altar for some reason.The old man plants the pine cone (which has somehow survived the fiery explosion utterly intact; for that matter, so has the old man who was not that far from the bomb) and it grows into a tree. I'm fairly sure trees take a good while to grow but it seems no time for a tree to sprout from the ground to a goodly height very quickly, and roomy enough to house a very annoying and useless cricket. Otherwise I guess we're to believe the old man has stopped aging at 70+ years.Anyway, the old man is apparently a drunk and sits drinking and mourning his dead son. He decides to cut down the tree and make a wooden puppet, but he is so drunk that he decides he'll finish the puppet later.I could go on, but this to me is already fairly awful. We have this pathetic old drunk who cannot deal with grief who makes a creepy wooden puppet that starts breaking stuff as soon as he is brought to life by a freaky winged blue creature. By the way, I have heard this version hews closer to the original story by Carlo Collodi but Pinocchio's destructiveness when he comes to life is one of the few elements from that story (which is bizarre in its own right) that are present here.Anyway, it gets weirder from there, including the fact of Pinocchio's bizarre appearance being quickly excepted by the townsfolk. Also, Pinocchio can be killed but magically comes to life thanks to the blue winged creature's sister, a sphinx-like being. In \"hell\" or wherever Pinocchio goes when he dies, there are some skeletal rabbits who play card games and carry the dead to their destinations. Or something. Again, I could go on an on but I don't feel like I can spare the effort. I'm guessing anyone reading this will get a sense of how strange this is.This version also bears resemblance to Disney's recent remake of their own classic 1940 adaptation. In Disney's 2022 remake version Gepetto has also lost a son and wishes him back, though he doesn't drink himself stupid and carve the puppet out of a magical tree. Another resemblance between this film and the Disney remake is that there is a situation where lying is actually presented as a good and useful thing. It's a coincidence I'm sure, but the point is neither element works in either story.Both versions complicate the 1940's simple premise of a lonely woodcarver who wishes his wooden marionette to come to life and become a real boy, and it doesn't work in either case. The 2022 Disney remake is utterly pointless, while del Toro's version feels pointless in its own way; rather bloated, a waste of resources and a fairly terrible story.",

The movie traverses through new Pinocchio territory which includes overt ridicule parody of fascism, likely the whole point of the original story evidently as Hitler and Mussolini did their mutual admiration and allegiance dance together when this allegory was penned. Pinocchio does a delightful number mocking the wee Italian dictator.I need to go back and rewatch the film after I understand a little more about Italy and what the social commentary of the time was saying about El Duche.There's that and there's the remaining wide variety of topics that are highlighted in the film, the uneasiness of war, loss, pain, hope, searching for that which we love. And of course redemption.We often think of Pinocchio as a carefree boy, naive and an easy mark and kind of a bad boy. Del Toro goes further than that and helps us love Pinocchio for the newly sentient creature he was created to be (by fairies), his purity of love for his father, and (in the interest of time) his desire to be real. And to be loved.I think this finally is the definitive version of this story and, long overdue and relevant during a time in which we promised not to forgot and to \"assure never more\".Ps: beautiful score: \"Ciao Papa\" is an eye.",

            "content": "It takes very little to be a good person, right? Guillermo del Toro has once again demonstrated his mastery in handling what is seemingly a children's world, bringing to the screen a bleak and moving story, in some ways closer to the portrayal of the character from the Pinocchio adventures' original book. Indeed, the original Pinocchio is a disobedient, lying, difficult child who, while loving his father, cannot resist the temptations that surround him. He is not a perfect child and he is not a model child. Carlo, on the other hand, is a model child. But both are perfect like they are. And both are worty of the same kind of love. What the film wants to make explicit is a valuable message for children as much as for adults, that is, what is important in life is not being perfect but being good, and being good means doing your best (which is the best there is). It's really as simple as that. While non revolutionary, it is a very sweet message indeed. In this way, Pinocchio is a film that looks at life (and death) very gently.On the technical note, it is accompanied by spectacular animation, and great aesthetic attention, expressed in the design of the characters, in their movements, and in the beautiful shots. The world the viewer is accompanied into is made with great care and attention, and it is nice to hear the little homage to the Italian language given by the secondary characters exchanging pleasantries. Also well done is the representation of Mussolini's fascist Italy as a historical backdrop, which, going back to the message of the film, also represents the only example of human behavior that really needs to be corrected.",

            "content": "Guillermo Del Toro managed to take a well known story that was already told many times, added his personal touch and delivered an original and entertaining production. The plot obviously is not faithful to the original Collodi's story, and it is more mature, as there are a few historical references and deep topics that children would not be able to fully understand. But if you are a teenager or an adult, this film is definitely a must watch, especially if you are into fairy tales. I really liked the fact that it does not take itself too seriously and there are many parodistic elements. However, there are also many serious and emotional moments. I liked the eccentric character of Count Volpe, who is basically an alternative version of Mangiafuoco, played wonderfully by Christopher Waltz. Cricket is mainly the narrator, and he is the comedic relief of the movie. The original songs fit well, and they are well performed. Overall, the director reached a good balance.The artistic direction is wonderful. The stop motion technique perfectly matches with the whole mystical mood. The locations are well realized and there was for sure a maniacal attention to details. Everything was on point: lights are spot on, puppets look extremely realistic in their movements and the special effects are well integrated in the different scenes.

There was not one moment were I found that the interpersonal conflict between the charachters was stagnent or disinteresting and the circumstances of the film always having me at the edge of my seat.Overall, I would give \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" a 10 out of 10 rating.

Sebastian (the cricket) brings a great warmth, Geppetto feels so natural, Pinocchio is so innocent, and so on for the entire cast. Additionally, each of the characters I mentioned gets to perform at least one song, and they all sound wonderful. All of the music for the film was done with woodwind instruments and it really gives the movie its own unique sound.I really loved the world of this movie: the character designs were exceptional. You are able to feel for the tragic old Geppetto, Mussolini's physical appearance is a great gag, the whale is terrifying, all of the designs fit right into this strange and beautiful world. I also very much enjoyed the more unearthly elements of this world: the designs of the spirits is very unique, the world of the dead is creative, it all just somehow works connected to the backdrop of World War II fascist Italy, a time period I would never have guessed could work so well with a Pinocchio movie.This movie is near perfect in my eyes, an excellent stop motion animation which is up there with the greats. I highly suggest you watch the Netflix video about the creation of this movie afterwards: it is insane how much fine work went into the creation of the world, the characters, the story, the environments, all of it. I highly recommend this movie, although do not be fooled- this may be an animated movie, but that is just the medium- this is not a movie aimed at children. While some older kids will enjoy the beauty and fun of this movie, there are very dark themes and visuals, so be prepared to have a talk with them afterwards.

            "review_title": "A Profound Retelling",
            "content": "First Impressions:This was the classic \"Pinocchio\" story in every way, but with the Guillermo del Toro twist it deserved. It was almost completely hand-made, in the truest sense of the word. From hand-crafted characters to stop-motion style filmmaking, this movie genuinely took several pages out the traditional handbook.Dark and dreamy elements further defined this fascinating retelling of an exceptional story that has still not lost its lustre since Italian author Carlo Collodi first penned it in 1883. Outstanding voiceovers, engaging animation visuals, and laudable practical effects added meaning and substance to this Netflix production.The Crew:Guillermo del Toro masterfully directed this project along with Mark Gustafson.He also wrote the screenplay with Matthew Robbins and Patrick McHale.Alexandre Desplat's musical scoring lent the movie an aura of traditional charm.Frank Passingham's cinematography was aces.The art direction, sound effects, and animation departments did admirable work.Set decoration and production design were great.Special effects, practical effects, and editing were amazing.The stop-motion and hand-craft teams did brilliant work.The Voice Cast:Gregory Mann as Pinocchio and Carlo was exemplary.Ewan McGregor as Cricket was superb.David Bradley as Geppetto was praiseworthy.Burn Gorman as the priest was memorable.Ron Perlman as Podesta was quite good.Finn Wolfhard as Candlewick was great.Tilda Swinton as the wood sprite and Death (!) was great.Christoph Waltz as Count Volpe was notable.Cate Blanchett as Spazzatura was shockingly ill-cast (more on this soon).Everyone else contributed amazing voiceovers to this project.Plot Summary & Analysis:The first thing I noticed was the timeline. Guillermo apparently chose the 1930s instead of the usual 1800s in which the \"Pinocchio\" story was originally set. His creative decision to place his characters in Fascist Italy - ruled by the National Fascist Party under Benito Mussolini - added to the distinction of this retelling. Historical conflicts of the political kind are not new in Guillermo's work, so this came as no major surprise.I don't think any movie fully explored Geppetto's reasons for wanting a puppet-boy. In this one, however, they covered the loss of his son (Carlo, voiced by Gregory Mann) and used it as the perfect emotional foundation on which to base the old woodcrafter's need to make Pinocchio (also voiced by Gregory Mann).It was heart-wrenching and realistic to see the toll war took, especially on children. This element played a strong role in the script and adequately conveyed Guillermo's vision and meaning.The musical numbers in this project deserve special mention. They felt old-school yet modern - I can't quite explain how Alexandre Desplat managed that. The entire score for this production felt perfect and genuinely highlighted the essence of its characters. Also, none of the songs were even close to what came before in \"Pinocchio\" remakes.Just the right amount of fantasy and paranormal tropes made \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" feel like a fully fleshed out version of the original.On a related note, the wooden doll itself felt realistic and credible. One might even call it grotesque. In an almost 'how it started, how it's going' way, Pinocchio's journey gradually attained a deep gravitas because of such well-crafted re-characterizations.I had to remind myself these characters were hand-made and moved using traditional practical effects. One may say that Pinocchio was, in a manner of speaking, real in the Guillermo-verse.The wood sprite (Tilda Swinton) was supposedly the Blue Fairy. I liked the angelic twist the character was given, more so since the design was based on the true biblical descriptions of what angels might look like. It all fit in well with the time and setting in this production.Cricket (no Jiminy, by the way) received his own twist, and I admired how compelling it was. This character always felt a little too 'goody two shoes' to me. But in this movie, he was given a much-welcome raison d'etre that felt real and grounded.A strange chimaera-like creature fulfilled the role of Death (Tilda Swinton again). This too made for a captivating addition to the retelling. The rules of dying, in connection to the wood-crafted Pinocchio, were remarkable, to say the least.As for Spazzatura, Cate Blanchett's voiceover may well have been admirable, especially since her character was supposed to be a male monkey that 'spoke' in different voices though a few puppets. Even its simian screeches and sounds were on point. However, I couldn't be sure if the actress actually performed those particular sounds and noises, and therein lay my greatest disappointment. They apparently gave an illustrious artist like Cate Blanchett a quite forgettable role. I barely heard Blanchett's voice anywhere. Was there any real value in casting her in such a thankless side-role? I wonder.On a positive note, I liked the twist around how Pinocchio became a real boy after demanding Death send him back prematurely. He returned to the same wooden body but his soul - if I can use the term - had been quietly transformed into that of a real person. To save his father, Pinocchio did what he had to do and thus could no longer remain immortal. A metaphor like 'break the rules to truly experience reality', and other existential extrapolations, gave this scene an aura of profound meaning.The circumstances that followed then led to a heartwarming reunion, and made me feel like I was watching an alternate version of the 1940 Disney classic. \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\" did not stray far from the source, but it broke the rules needed to create a brand-new reality and identity for these beloved characters.Final Notes:The way Guillermo went about re-inventing the fairy-tale of the wooden doll-child who wanted to become a real boy added a fresh sense of wonder and inspiration to this project.I personally enjoyed his stop-motion and hand-crafted takes on the classic, and it somehow - I shall even go so far as to say miraculously - felt refreshing and original. The war-time plot-element was especially admirable. This movie was, therefore, unlike any of the \"Pinocchio\" adaptations that preceded it.In this lay Guillermo del Toro's genius as a filmmaker and Pinocchio's enduring legacy as a motivational character whose story was packed with meaning.\"What happens, happens. And then, we are gone.\" - Cricket, \"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\".",

They do a fine job at delivering their lines and their character's personalities across, and the QUALITY of the production and design are very commendable. In fact, creators still using these kind of methods is very reassuring for the medium.Personally, hearing the words \"a model fascist youth\" was not how I expected to spend my afternoon. Much less a Pinocchio complaining that people like a wooden carving of Jesus better than him. So, I found these and many other details as added layers of unnecessary world-building that made for a \"pointlessly darker\" story without much reason, or connection to the plot of a toy that became real. It seems Guillermo wants to re-tale a lot of stories that don't need further tweaking.. yet he insists. He also doesn't seem to have a personal style, so again, this movie is very Tim Burton-y (reminded of Sweeney Todd, musical style and all). Well, they do say that changing something to a new flavors IS a way to broaden a product's appeal.. but it's a bit too weird for me, and I can't pretend to like it, much less that it was positively memorable.Judging by the many positives reviews, I'm part of a minority, so you might as well give it a try!",

This is one is quite a bit different, and much more interesting for the seasoned film watchers which you have all become.First off, it is an absolutely beautiful film to watch. The producers (Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson along with Jim Henson studios) actually used real puppets for their characters in a \"stop-motion\" form of animation. Background scenes are hand painted and are striking. This version of Pinocchio is more closely aligned with the original book written by Italian author, Carlo Collodi, in 1883. It is far edgier than the cute Disney movie which most of us grew up with.So much edgier, that some of the themes (mortality, violence, fascism, and warfare) are probably not appropriate for younger viewers. Pinocchio himself is created to look like a rough-hewn pine carving. When he lies and his nose grows, it develops branches and leaves (Yes, it probably should have been pine needles). We even get a brief appearance by \"Il Duce\" himself, Benito Mussolini, as the plot takes us through Italy during both World Wars.This is a definite must-see.

I have personally grown up with the likes of Pokemon, DragonBall, and Naruto; in short, the Japanese Anime. Unlike gazillions of children around the globe, Disney narratives were not something I would usually turn to. As a result, Pinocchio and its contemporaries were simply out of contention.Perhaps that's the main reason why I struggled so much to find my connection with the story.Don't get me wrong, it is adorable, well made, well dubbed, the animations are crisp, and the score is fine too but somehow as a relatively new viewer, I could not get myself emotionally invested in the narrative not as much as I had hoped for anyways. The shrouded metaphors & messages were plentiful, and whilst I relished those particular facets of storytelling, the lack of emotional attachment acted as a stumbling block in my overall experience.",

            "content": "Third time lucky, I guess. Following the worthless live-action reskin of Disney's Pinocchio and that absolutely unhinged Pauly Shore movie, Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio (full title) is the third and best Pinocchio joint of 2022.Now it's a lushly designed stop-motion film that sticks closer to Collodi's novel than the other two versions -- complete with giving the Talking Cricket (Ewan McGregor) the name Sebastian instead of the expected Jiminy.Parents should also be aware that, true to the tone of the book, this film has its share of disturbing moments; the eponymous wooden boy gets damaged at several points and looks like something out of Svankmajer's Little Otik during the scenes of his birth. The movie also isn't shy to speak plainly on the evils of Fascist Italy -- while nowhere near the sort of imagery Del Toro put forth in Pan's Labyrinth, it is still possibly a bit too heavy for kiddies. Having said this, it also has the occasional attempts at making the material more crotch-dumpling-friendly, which may annoy some viewers.Still, with first-rate animation and the vocal talents of McGregor, David Bradley, Tilda Swinton, Christoph Waltz, and Cate Blanchett in the role of a lifetime as a many-voiced simian, it's certainly a delight to watch and listen to, if sometimes a bit predictable -- which, admittedly, is more to do with the age of the source material. The songs didn't really grab me either, but I recall \"Everything Is New to Me\" and \"Ciao Papa\" as being fairly enjoyable tunes.Weird nit-pick: At one point, a fascist officer (Ron Perlman) sings the praises of his son (Finn Wolfhard) by dubbing him a promising \"fascist youth\". Maybe I'm not well-read enough on the lingo of Mussolini's Italy, but in my experience, fascists don't use that term to describe themselves, especially not favorably. (In my experience, it's something they call other people when said people criticize them on Twitter or tell them to stop saying slurs or whatever.)So yeah. Foul! Unrealistic movie! -100/10!

It is incredible how good this technique has improved in terms of quality, feeling each frame so smooth that it feels like 3D animation.But, beyond the outstanding visual and technical elements, the story is really well told.

Another thing that he depicts greatly is acceptance. Embracing who you are. But while adding these new ideas, he did not lose it's original magic. The philosophy of being real has been modified to another level in this version.I cried the whole time while watching this movie. The animation was great. But for me the voice acting was a bit down. It was not bad. But it was not as good as the 1940's version. The music also was not that great.

The cast is perfectly chosen, with Ewan McGregor's pompous Sebastian J. Cricket providing a wry and often humorous narration, and Tilda Swinton delivering a captivating performance as both the Wood Sprite and Death.Overall, \"Pinocchio\" is a must-see for fans of del Toro and stop-motion animation.

            "content": "I am going to point out the symbolism i noticed. The background theme throughout the movie is death and grief. Carlo (a reference to the original Pinocchio's writer Carlo Collodi), son of Geppetto, is killed unexpectedly from a bomb that's been thrown upon the church he is in. The whole story takes place during the era of Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. Geppetto uses alcohol as a copying mechanism for his grief, and one night, feeling extremely desperate and angry, cuts the pine tree (pine trees symbolize virtue and eternal life. Pine tree is also mentioned in the original) that has sprouted in his son's grave and makes a wooden boy. Sebastian J. Cricket (Jiminy Cricket), who lived inside the tree (he has a photograph of the famous pessimist philosopher and transcendental idealist Schopenhauer) watches a Wood Sprite fulfilling Geppetto's wish to bring his son back to life. The Sprite's wings look a little like a peacock's tail and she also resembles the faun in Pan's Labyrinth. (Another del Toro antifascist movie. Pan, along with Death are also depicted in the church's glass) Peacock in ancient Greece believed to be Pan's gift to Hera. Her sister, another Wood Sprite, is Death, who resembles the mythical creature, Sphinx. I believe that del Toro chose this type of symbolizm, because Death makes cryptic statements about life, death and sacrifice. Del Toro said that the Wooden Sprite, Death, the Cricket and the underworld bunnies come from the same universe, hence the similarities. Despite the obvious self sacrificial symbolizm of Pinocchio in order to save his father, and the sacrifice of Cricket's wish to save Pinocchio, i noticed another biblical reference, that exists in the original movie as well. The sea monster that swallows Geppetto and Cricket. Jonah and the whale. This is a perfect adult fairy tale. Antifascist, antiwar, inkling of labor rights, and most importantly, embracing acceptance and love. Del Toro put his heart in this movie and he gave us a rare spectacle.Favorite quotes:\n\"You'll never know how long you'll have with someone, until they're gone.\"\n\"People are sometimes afraid of things they don't know.\"Important mentions:\nGuillermo del Toro in an interview(The Tonight Show) said that the only character who doesn't act like a puppet, is the puppet. Pinocchio is a free thinker. He later quoted Hayo Miyazaki, \"If you animate the ordinary, it will be extraordinary.\". He said that Disney understood one thing. In order to appreciate light, you need darkness. Then, he referred to a poem of Jaime Sabines, that says: \"Someone spoke to me every day of my life\nOn my ear, quietly, slowly\nHe told me: Live, live live!\"\nIt was the death.\"\nAlexandre Desplat, the composer said that he chose only wooden instruments.",

There of the adaptations did try to do something different for the story of Pinocchio, and some of them have failed terribly. But this one had a story that was different in the best kind of way. This would feature a really exciting journey of what Pinocchio himself would go through. This would have some of the best stop motion animation ever put in a movie. This would have charming characters that stand out brilliantly from other adaptations. This would have songs that would add great detail to the movie's storytelling. And this would have a powerful commentary on war and fascism. Honestly, this movie has been released at a perfect timing since there actually are wars going on in another country. I know we have gotten a couple of bad Pinocchio adaptations this year. One is a direct-to-video film that many say it's laughable, and the one that could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. As for this one? Probably the only one that was released this year that's an absolute must watch. I can promise this movie will leave you heart warmed the way it tells its own adaptation.

I took a week for writing this because I felt I could not do it in a hurry, but I still feel myself unable to be fair to the greatness of this masterpiece (and having more time will not change it, and I need to rate my 10 anyway).

I know it's a bit harsh, but I decided to give the film 5 minutes to impress me and at about minute 4, I was hooked. The animation style was just magical and as soon as the voice acting and the music kicked in, I couldn't stop.While the story carries many core values of the original, it feels different and in a good sort of way. Afterall, it's Guillermo Del Toro and this man wouldn't have bothered himself if he didn't plan on making it good. While it is considered to be a children's story, this version will quickly show you that it has a lot of adult elements making it engaging for audiences of all ages. Of course there is Guillermo's iconic style, that at times threads the line of horror, but because of the joyful voice acting and music, it never completely crosses to the dark side despite portraying some serious themes like death and rise of Fascism.In addition to looking and sounding good, Pinocchio carries so much meaning on topics like obedience, burden, war and fatherhood which are intricately interwoven into this rich tale. The animation team deserves extraordinary praise as some of the sequences felt incredible considering it was all done in stop motion. I don't think there is any competition to this film in the Oscars animated category and to top it off, it's now one of my favorites from Guillermo.

Directed by the mind of Guillermo del Toro, who makes it clear that it is his own look at the story of Pinocchio.It is the perfect adaptation for these times, that is what the new film by Mexican director Guillermo del Toro conclusively depicts. The director signs one of the best animated films of the year and surely also one of the best films of the year.A story full of allegories, with that unique look that the director possesses, is the perfect mix for us to enjoy a tremendous film that transports you through all the available emotions you may have.With delicate work on both the character of Geppetto and Pinocchio that lead us to the imperfections of parents and children. A journey through the constant learning of how to be parents and how to raise with all the good and bad that surrounds the world and in turn how to receive each teaching that those who have the longest journey in life give us.Once again, the director places us in a story that houses the war as a great companion in the background. The mastery with which the director confronts the war as a great enemy is what penetrates the strongest into the story we are seeing. He also does not skimp on bringing the great core of everything we know about Pinocchio, but always giving it a new look that allows the story to feel refreshing and current.A beautiful job is the one that Guillermo del Toro and the entire creative body behind this film create. The magic and triumph of Stop Motion is the most comforting of what the director proposes to us. An artisanal work that leads us to fall into the magic of its director's mind with the greatest satisfaction that we can have as spectators. What the director proposes is pure authenticity, it is a life story brought to our eyes and to the deepest emotions that our soul can contain.The songs are beautiful and their script, a strong message that receives both adults and children with all the emotion of touching a fiber that reminds us of something from our lives. The authenticity of the true story of love, loss, education and life is the path to which Pinocchio invites us in the dark and the daring of an entertainment that is still hopeful, full of humor and humanity.It is a film that deserves to be seen, enjoyed and loved in this 2022.",

The original story doesn't have much to do with the happy-go-lucky Disney cartoon: it's more mature, crueler in some ways, and amazingly deep (including biblical references as much as philosophical ones!). And Del Toro's \"Pinocchio\" manages to capture this very essence while also making it appeal to children and adults alike at the same time, creating a sweet deep tale about loss, grief and, most importantly, love.The setting of this visually stunning film is spot-on: it perfectly captures rural Italy under the dictatorship of Mussolini. I admit I was not expecting such a historical take on this movie, but I have to say it fits really well and adds new and interesting content to a well-known story.Basically, just watch it.Oh, and maybe don't forget to keep a few tissues by your side because, whether you like it or not, this film WILL make you cry.

I loved it!So, this new movie. They make a big deal out of it being stop motion, but a *lot* of it looked like CGI, to me, and there are, indeed, plenty of digital VFX credits at the end. The story itself bears precious little resemblance to the original book, and I'm not sure moving the story to fascism-era Italy makes any sense. Then again, the Italian people have apparently forgotten their history and recently elected a fascist Prime Minister. Anyhow, I didn't much care for the new story, I loathed all the songs save one, and I really hate that they *drastically* changed the ending. They also did *not* need to make it two hours long, in my opinion. It felt interminable to me, and I kept checking how much was left.It did look nice, though.Oh, I used my translation app on the monkey's name. Spazzatura is Italian for Garbage. What the heck?",

His take on this classic story is brilliantly refreshing, sharply written and wonderfully self aware. It leaves you laughing and crying, sometimes simultaneously. The animation, direction and voice acting is superb - but the music and Pinocchio singing (along with his entire character) is truly something else.

The stop motion, is, as usual phenomenal, and carries Del Toro's trademark style along with it. The film can also go to some dark places sometimes with the war plot and some villains dying in rather scary ways (usually offscreen) the music also accompanies with the emotions well.

Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is an adaptation that subversively reworks the original story's intention to teach children the importance of obedience, and instead aims to teach children the utility and moral value in rebellion and self-advocacy, framing Pinocchio's unruliness not as vices to be ironed out, but as acts of anti-fascist heroism. Every interaction any character has with Pinocchio is one in which he bristles against them, opening up wounds, forcing them to relive and confront past traumas that they've opted to bury in their own ways, whether it be through substance abuse, blind submission to authority, or blind nationalism. Every character before meeting Pinocchio is an open nerve for Pinocchio to torment, though through his chipper prodding at social expectations he finds silly and pointless, those around him are able to find healing, and courage. In that way del Toro's version of the story is a direct rebuke to the moralizing of its source, celebrating the unexpected virtues in disobedience, dishonesty, and poop jokes.",

While I did love some of the added creep factor, It didn't do enough to make up for the elements that were lacking.

However, with more than enough topics, the movie barely has time to explore each in depth, which is one major let-down in my opinion. Despite that, I am amused if not surprised by Del Toro's personalized interpretation and alternation to the original story, especially with adding a historical background. Don't be fooled by the childly musical components into thinking that the film is children-friendly, for the whale (spoilers) looks like a literal tumor, and it's nostril a throbbing anus -- one thing I love about Del Toro, you never know when his fairy tale is intruded by loathsome figures or the cruel reality.

Del Toro's version rumbles with tough love that has the burdens we all experience. It adds Italian Fascism around WW1, with the puppet targeted for extinction by no less than Il Duce, Benito Mussolini: \"These puppets, I do not like.\"It's an odd choice of time and place, especially given the recent victory of a fascist-rooted regime in Italy, although the filmmakers couldn't have known the return would happen. For a movement dedicated to strict obedience, this Pinocchio represents clear and present danger. When local fascist functionaries raise their arms in salute, it's scary given their bloody history.Carved from a pine tree that represented Geppetto's (voice of David Bradley) lost son, Carlo (voiced by Gregory Mann), Pinocchio is a rambunctious, disobedient boy, curious and affectionately rebellious-in short, the kind of independent individualist that could become a world leader. But, alas, he's different from the rest-wooden and defiant, a fine example of people of a different color, creative innovators, and people who just don't fit because they are misunderstood.Del Toro, co-directing with stop-animation guru Mark Gustafson (animator of Fantastic Mr. Fox), emphasizes the early-twentieth century fascist milieu the little hero faces, with Mussolini and his henchmen determining moves citizens can take. With that encumbrance comes the chance for the little stringless puppet to become a real boy of resolve.Del Toro imagines a world of eventual equality and inclusion as Pinocchio becomes his destined hero who loves even enemies, such as evil showman Count Volpe's (voice of Christoph Waltz) henchman, Spazzatura (voice of Cate Blanchett), a macabre goblin monkey with a growing love for Pinocchio. Gepetto accepts a wooden substitute for his lost son, and the slightly comic but un charming Cricket (Ewan MacGregor) narrates with some sympathy and sparse wisdom.Although del Toro could be accused of morphing a Disney-like story into a dark tale of survival, he laces the tale with thoughts like the need to love others for whoever they really are, not what you want them to be and recognizing the cycle of life to death not even a woodland sprite (Tilda Swinton) can change.Del Toro's Netflix musical version (scripted with Patrick McHale) is a new spin on an old story, and the tunes are forgettable. Light and airy like Disney's version it is not. Dark it is.",

But quoting Guglielmo Del Toro himself \"this film is the retelling of a story you think you do know.. but you don't know\".Some detachments from the original story are quite interesting.I found Pinocchio a different character, more inquisitive, struggling to understand what is to be human, what is right and wrong, what is socially acceptable. And I liked the fact that Pinocchio remained a puppet throughout the film and did not turn in a human boy, as to say \"you don't have to change in order to be accepted\".Geppetto is not quite as pleasant as in his typical representations; he drinks a lot, he gets angry and does not understand Pinocchio, until the Cricket reminds him that the wooden boy loves him and his trying to be appreciated.The antagonist villain is not the huge Mangiafuoco with his big beard, but rather a more sophisticated and even good-mannered Mister Volpe.References to the fascist-era events, together with the battle against the Dog Fish, provided material for more action, avoiding the movie to abound with predictable sentimental moments.The animation is superb.The Stop-Motion techniques allow to put the right emphasis on the characters and to fit them into lovely sets, especially those who are evocative of beautiful Italian towns.Also Live Action Videos are used, which implied the animators turning off with a little video of themselves doing the action.Overall, I enjoyed watching Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, the story and also some peculiar aspects of animation he wanted the audience to appreciate, summarized as follows: \"If the character is thinking, You wanna see the eyes inputting the information\". \"If you animate the ordinary you will achieve something extraordinary\".",

Pinocchio is the tale that has been the most in my life, probably because of my Italian roots, but also because that innocence of trying to do good, while never lying, has always spoken to me. This movie starts with the story of Geppetto's son, Carlo, that he lost during the war, which made him create Pinocchio later on. This is a story of love, of how an old man can learn to love again after losing so many people in his life, while navigating the fascism that wants him to fit into \"proper\" boxes. It's a story of a little puppet, learning about the world from an extremely positive point of view, and getting knocked down so many times, but never letting anything go between him and love. This is a story that will make you cry, from good feelings, or drama.

It's that good.I love how real and depressing it is with that colors that tie it all together into a magical movie. But shortly after thr movie starts we get a song about how everything is new to Pinocchio...except for english. What's this what's this...sound familiar? Except when he is told something is a hammer he knows you smash things with it..And okay the whole sending children off to war was a great metaphor for what we actually do in real life.. but then they actually send the children off to training camp that consequently also gets bombed...this is where the movie is its weakest. Ploy bombs that confidently only have a 10 foot explosion radius...bombing children not only makes this movie not a children's movie buy it also makes the movie feel desperate in trying to stir up a reaction from its audience. Too many things happen so quickly where before the movie had a great pace.. it could have worked differently but I feel this part ruins the film. The monkey as a third character also feels cheap.And the finale of Pinocchio giving uo his immortality only to get it right back and not become a real boy\n..was pointless and cheapened his sacrifice...and it goes further by showing the future...like ****.

Guillermo Del Toro films are all great he can't wrong, he's done several horror movies and you can tell although the bulk is a family story.

Pinocchio is very deserving of a nomination in the Golden Globes in the animation category and might win. I don't like to spoil so I will just say there's a little bit of adult subject matter that shouldn't be seen much by kids under a certain age.

            "content": "When I saw the trailers, I knew that it would surpass how disappointing the remake was, but not to such an extent! It is literally one of the best animated movies to come out recently.Although I clearly notice that I am not going to extend myself too much with this review, but I will tell you some things that I loved. Oh my gosh, stop motion animation is so underrated. It is incredible that it is so rare, perhaps because of how expensive it can be? Although what I did not expect was that he combined it with CGI as well, and this is not noticeable at all, it still looks like stop motion all the time. The new songs composed also surprised me and they continue to maintain the classic charm. But now let's talk about the most important part... the story... How to say it... Its different... like... really really different. I know they were inspired by the original book, but it seems to me that they may have also taken inspiration from other adaptations, as well as things invented by Guillermo himself. The fairy having eyes for example and the constant references to the religion may not been coincidence too.This \"reboot\" to call it in a way, contrary to the remake that we had recently is practically the opposite of this, if we think about it carefully. This reboot is not afraid to show anything. We are talking about showing war situations, drama, there is even a scene in which you are given to understand that Geppetto is drunk. The remake wanted to include new situations such as the fact that he had a son who died, but they never say why nor do they expand on any of that, apart from flanderizing the entire original story. This reboot recovers part of the lost magic of the original, in addition to introducing situations that do not break the tone. I loved how dramatic they made it honestly... Although that could also be its biggest flaw... at least for some people, since as dramatic as it can be sometimes, it almost seems like I'm watching another movie. Did I mention that Benito Mussolini appears? Yep, in a Pinocchio movie. At those levels of \"different\" we are talking. They could have even changed the name of the movie and no one would have noticed the difference.If I had to mention flaws that bothered ME personally, I would have to say that it shares two small problems with the remake, which in the remake made it much worse than it already was, here they don't affect it as much but they still exist. First, the cricket is still not as relevant as in the Disney classic... It is definitely much more relevant in Guillermo's than in the remake, don't get me wrong, but in the original he was so charming, he accompanied Pinocchio constantly and he gave you very good messages... Here, again, they wanted to get rid of him very quickly. And second, but much more subjective, I'm not a fan of the new message of lies. To escape from the whale, in Guillermo's, Pinocchio lies to get out, the same in the remake but to escape from the circus' cage. Some could tell me that it's fine, and that the original was very vague about it, and although it's partly true, I'm not a big fan of the way they implemented it in both situations. Again, just my opinion... And lastly, and also very subjective... was it necessary to call her \"Guillermo Del Toro Pinocchio\"? Have you ever seen a movie that has the director's name as its name? It's not something that subtracts points obviously, I'm just curious. You can tell the guy was very proud of his work.In short... almost a masterpiece. Disney should be ashamed of what they did and that in just a month they were far surpassed. It is not as perfect as Disney 1950 original imo (just because it was one of the best animated movies of all time), but Guillermo's Pinocchio doesn't have anything to envy.I hope Guillermo Del Toro continues to surprise me with more animated movies like this in the future.",

            "content": "Guillermo Del Toro has struck again and has proven once again that he is an amazing writer and director that cares about whatever he writes and what he adapts to the big screen. This time however, he tackles the old story of Pinocchio, taking inspiration from the original novel and Disney film and adding his own twisted spin.David Bradley (Filch from Harry Potter) voices Gepetto, a woodworker who loses his son in a bombing during World War I. This devastates him so much that he chops down the tree next to his grave (grown from a pinecone that his son got and which got him killed) and carves the wooden boy out of a drunken rage and grief. The Wood Spirit (voiced by an always amazing Tilda Swinton) decides to bring the puppet to life in order to make sure that he'll never be alone again. And so begins Pinocchio's adventure. Oh and the story takes place in Fascist Italy/WW2.Tonally, this is a much heavier film than you would expect from an animated film (in fact, Del Toro himself has said that it's not for kids). There are some surprisingly dark scenes throughout the film, most of which revolve around Fascism and the dangers of over-obedience (there's a Fascist Youth Camp that starts off fun but takes a surprisingly violent and realistic turn. And these kinds of camps actually existed during WW2), and we even see Count Volpe (voiced by Christoph Waltz), our stand in for Honest John, Gideon, and Stromboni, beating his monkey (voiced in screeches by a completely unrecognisable Cate Blanchett) with his cane. So yeah, this might be one of the best animated films I've seen, but it's not for the faint of heart. And considering that Patrick McHale (Over the Garden Wall) is co-writing, this is to be expected. Thankfully, there are some funny moments sprinkled throughout to balance out the tone (one highlight is a scene involving Mussolini, who's voiced by Spongebob himself, Tom Kenny).Another thing I should mention is that all of our antagonists actually get their comeuppance in comparison to the book and the Disney film, where they get off scot-free. The Podesta (voiced by Ron Perlman) get blinded with a paint gun by Candlewick (who is his son this time rather than just a random kid) and is promptly killed by a falling bomb, Count Volpe's monkey turns on him after being abused by him for too long and he ends up falling to his death and even the Dogfish is blown up by a sea mine.The voice cast actually does a good job with their voices and are all perfectly cast. David Bradley depicts the sorrow and the grief as Gepetto masterfully well, while making him more three dimensional than the Disney version. Newcomer Gregory Mann does an amazing job as the cheerful and hyperactive Pinocchio. Ewan McGregor provides a funny and unique turn as novelist cricket Sebastian J. Cricket. And the rest of the cast does an amazing job with what they're given, especially Cate Blanchett as the monkey.The music is also amazing, as I'm a massive fan of Alexandre Desplat since Rise of the Guardians. This film not only has an amazing score that has me convinced that he should compose a Pixar/Disney Animated film, but there are also some original songs to go with it, the highlights being \"My Son\", \"Ciao Papa\", and \"Better Tomorrows\".Courtesy of Mark Gustafson, animation director of Fantastic Mr Fox, the film's animation is his best effort to date as the animation for all the characters and environments are smooth and full of life.In short, this is an amazing animated film that's not only Netflix's best animated film to date, but it's also one of the best films of the year and it deserves to win Best Animated Feature.",

Del Toro has done it before but the context in those films were agendas that matched the film and characters.I admit to fast-forwarding because it was dragging like molasses on a cold, winter's day.The music was out of place and maybe del Toro and crew thought this would be \"lighthearted\". NOT! It was unintelligible trying to get some emotional moments squished in and made to sound \"Broadway\", but the context was out of place.I'd put this film alongside the 2019 mess called \"Cats\".Del Toro was out of his element, but I do give him credit for the attempt.Not everything is a success, and his fans will, and have notably applauded the film as a great work, unique and one for the ages.At least, as I always say...the cast and crew got a paycheck.",

Ever since his work with Wesley Snipes in Blade II (2002) all the way to his work just last year with Inc Nightmare Alley (2021), it is clear now in his career he is particularly meticulous surrounding the way in which his film's sound, production, soundtrack, cinematography and more is used, and is it no clearer in his filmography than within his adaptation of the classic story of Pinocchio. Not only is the film soaked with rich, golden colours but is additionally shot in the stop-motion animation format giving it a very warm and stylistic nature that will leave you bathing in the atmosphere for hours upon hours more.

            "content": "Guillermo del Toro is a very hit or miss filmmaker for me. I loved PAN'S LABYRINTH, I thought CRIMSON PEAK was a pretty bag of meh, and I found the much acclaimed THE SHAPE OF WATER to be a cringy, self-indulgent, hamfisted lecture. My reactions being all over the place, I was unsure if I'd like Del Toro's take on PINOCCHIO. Turns out, I loved it a lot. Beautifully animated, wonderfully voice acted-- just a great fantasy all around.This PINOCCHIO is about as faithful to the original novel as Disney's famous 1940 version is, and like that film, it excels in giving the audience its own unique slant. Like the 1940 film, this Pinocchio is more sympathetic and not an irritating brat like in the novel. However, this Pinocchio is more marked with a distinct anti-authoritarian slant. Del Toro clearly distrusts any authority-- some overtly (the state, represented by Mussolini's party here, and the entertainment business, represented by a greedy puppeteer who employs Pinocchio in his show), some covertly (the Catholic Church, represented by a shifty priest). Even the sprites who give Pinocchio life are authorities to be questioned and ultimately disobeyed.But what stands out most to me in this film is its treatment of grief and joy. Time and again, life is highlighted as something precious. By not shying away from emotional pain and the painful vicissitudes of life, the joyous moments shine all the brighter. Even the bittersweet ending brims with an appreciation for how lovely life can be.Still-- and this will be an unpopular opinion here-- I think the 1940 film is better, if only because the pacing is snappier (this film, wonderful as it is, does drag towards the end due to a surplus of plotlines) and the music is far more memorable than the enjoyable but ultimately forgettable numbers here. But in terms of blending whimsy and darkness, and affirming the goodness of life in spite of the presence of evil and foolishness, both films are about equal.And both are certainly more worthy of your time than any \"live-action\" remake Disney craps out.",

The screenplay (by Del Toro in collaboration with Patrick McHale and Matthew Robbins) is still set in Italy, but during WWII under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. There are several other changes, some to accommodate the setting and time period, while others come from this being a passion project for Del Toro.Del Toro has long been known to be fascinated by objects d'art and other baubles and bits (one could probably watch his remake of NIGHTMARE ALLEY twenty times and still discover new curiosities in the background each and every time). Working with the Jim Henson Company and artist Gris Grimly, the design for Pinocchio is well imagined. The character really seems to be made out of common wood (or as Geppetto calls it: \"Good Italian pine!\") rather than being overly anthropomorphized to look like a little boy. The other figures are also done with flair.Planting the story during wartime in the 1940s doesn't always work, and it tends to pad out some sections of the movie. The voice work by David Bradley as Geppetto and Ewan McGregor as the Cricket are fine, but, occasionally, Gregory Mann's Pinocchio is anachronistic, too much resembling a modern boy. The vocal cast also includes Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Ron Perlman and John Turturro (it's convenient to have a good address book). It's not a true musical, but there are some okay tunes written by del Toro and lyricist Roeben Katz; Alexander Desplat provides the music including the background score.Give del Toro credit - he hasn't 'Disney-fied' his Pinocchio. It deals with mortality and what it means to be truly alive. It doesn't speak down to the youngest children. The bookends are truly impactful. As with all del Toro films, PINOCCHIO is visually appealing. The combinations adds up to a very satisfying production.",

At first, I wasn't too sure about the decision of putting the story of Pinocchio in a real world historical context, but by the end, I believe I see what Guillermo and crew were trying to go for and see the relation between the title character and the setting. The animation, needless to say, is wonderful and is so fluid at points that you forget you are watching stop-motion animation. Guillermo also utilizes the best aspects of the character to tell a touching (and admittedly sometimes dark) story that both children and adults can appreciate. The plot could've used a little work as I questioned certain directions the story went, but I thoroughly enjoyed the end result. Whether it's as good or better than the classic Disney film is debatable, but I can safely say it is the best adaptation we've gotten since then. Final verdict: 8.5/10.",

Yes Del Toro, facism is bad. Thanks. I've seen Pan's Labyrinth and most of your other movies, I get it. That was a real hard one or me. This movie fails at humor- the funniest part is seeing pinocchio being recruited into the hitler youth for his immortality. Everyone just accepts a puppet is alive and is not too bothered after initial shock. The songs consist of \"my son my son I love my son woo wee i do love you\" that's word for word the music in this, literal nails on chalkboard in melody and lyrical content. The poopoo mussolini song was impressive too, but fortunately he has the sense to put a bullet in the puppets head for at least his own moment's reprieve. Jiminy cricket or should I say Ewan macgregor showing up 1 day in a recording booth to read lines plays no role in this but a gag trying to sing a song about his father which they milk incessantly.The overall tone and all of the designs for the setting/characters especially monstruo make it obvious this movie's style is a frank ripoff of not only Selick/Burton's Nightmare before xmas, but ESPECIALLLY Selick's own James and the Giant Peach. Selick reached his own rock bottom in the equally patronizing, political, unfunny Wendell and Wild that was also stuck in development hell like this trash this year, but\nI would recommend skipping this and revisiting James and The Giant Peach for your own sake, please.

Oh and the voice actors doesn't really do that much of a good job. They just use their natural voice? Yes they speak and change their tone in the terms of showing emotions with their voice, but it's still just their natural voice when they could have made some new and interesting voices for their characters! At least that's what I think of when I hear \"voice acting\" and animation/cartoons. The pace is also all over the place as there is a alot of things/sub plots going that doesn't have to be there for the mainplot and of course we don't get any explaination for some of the of the characters/creatures. They are just there. And you are supposed to accept that.You are also supposed to accept that Pinocchio doesn't know how anything works and then the next day he knows how to open doors and he knows what a bed is and what \"good night\" means....\nBut the worst part of was definately the fact that the voice actors don't make up voices anymore for their characters? Is that not a thing anymore? Have I missed something about animation and cartoons today!? The only \"voice actor\" who ctually did a great job was Kate Blanchett being that annoying monkey. Would have never guessed it was her if I hadn't skipped through the \"making of\" documentary. But yeah to say that I am disappointed by this would be an understatement. It didn't have to be an awful musical, trying to be directed towards children and failing at both being for children and/or grown ups. This could have been more like Pan's Labyrinth and darker and less cheerful and \"Disney-Musically\"?? And it didn't have to be this confusing and yet so empty...It's Guillermo Del Toro! What happened!? Suddenly he doesn't know who he wants as his audience?? I truly expected this to NOT be like a Disney musical wannabe, but this is what we got.

            "review_title": "A retelling of Pinocchio that actually has a point",
            "content": "Pinocchio is a story that lately hasn't been left alone too much. We got something like 4 different remakes of the story in a few years. Of those, the Garrone remake was pretty much a faithful and not really surprising adaptation of the initial whimsical fairytale, the Disney remake is (surprise!) a cashgrabby remake that adds nothing to the original movie with Tom Hanks that by now basically plays every role that needs to be filled in Hollywood, and then this one. Now in this case, we could say that Del Toro took the original story and basically subverted the premise of the original. In the original story, you have a very clear idea: Pinocchio is a puppet, he does whatever he wants, he skips school, he chases unruliness and fun and doesn't show respect to authorities, and his lack of boundaries and good behavior confines him paradoxically in a state of puppet-ness, of being a fake and manipulable human, because there's no real freedom and adulthood in chasing your own desires and your own whims endlessly. In this movie however, the idea is completely shifted: Pinocchio never becomes a real boy, he stays a puppet, and the idea is that there's nothing that would make him truly \"complete\" because he already is. It's a statement that contradicts the pedagogical meaning of the original story; whereas before Pinocchio was pure childish potential needing to be tamed, in this movie Pinocchio is pure childish potential needing to be loved and appreciated for what it is. The benevolent fairy, sort of the guardian angel of the original story, is transposed through this creepy exoteric metaphysical lens and becomes two separate creatures, one being a mystical bible-accurate angel that bargains and works in mysterious ways and the other being a sinister guardian of the underworld. This is the most intriguing change in the story, and I personally loved the second characters and felt a bit underwhelmed by the brief presence of the first. Another element of subversion is the cricket, previously the representation of conscience and good morals and (emotional) intelligence, now becomes a sort of third party, an independent character that sort of \"uses\" Pinocchio in his own way. The idea of \"being his conscience\" is turned on its head and the Cricket's intelligence is framed as snobbish, bourgeois, almost narcissistical in nature. Also our Geppetto gives us a very clear perspective of the idea of Pinocchio being a \"real boy\": he lost his own son, a very good boy who chased the idea of perfection almost to his death, prompting the dad to desire that very same thing, and so we can see that fundamentally the expectation that Pinocchio should become more real is something born out of societal and familial expectation, of him having to be like the others that came before him.Anyway, this is an interesting and worthy retelling of an old story that poses the idea that Pinocchio, as flawed and defective and monstrous as he is, is already complete and just needs someone to accept him. I have some gripes with this philosophy but it's worth hearing nonetheless. The fascist part is very one note and doesn't really go sufficiently deep, so it was sort of pointless imo. It's ultimately a movie that works for a young audience, full of whimsical and disquieting imagery, a dark but uplifting fairytale. Oh and also the scene with the dogfish looks kinda bad: you don't perceive danger, the ocean and the setting and the atmosphere and the pacing of the action makes it look extremely fake. I don't know why that is, considering that the other parts, the stop motion in the first Pinocchio scenes, the underworld with the crow-like creatures, all looks extremely good. There's a lot to say about this movie, but as a cinematic effort it's definitely worthwhile.",

While the animation is a technical marvel it refuses to humanize its characters.Now to the story...I know del Toro likes to overlay fascist regimes onto fantasy. Honestly, this story was not well served by its references to Mussolini. The horror of his iron fisted rule of WWII Italy just never comes through. He is portrayed as a buffoon (he was) but he was a buffoon who did horrifying things. To make him ludicrous without conveying the nightmare that was Mussolini is to miss the point.In the end, I would far rather have seen del Toro do a stop motion film with an original story and animation less technically perfect but with more heart.I cried bitterly over the ultimate fate of the young heroine in Pan's Labyrinth.

But one of the great merits is given in the script, Pinocchio is a film about accepting death, the discussion of whether or not to be a real boy takes place in the acceptance of human frailty, we are all going to die, and that is what makes us human, is it? Pinocchio talks about this idea. Pinocchio reminded me of another film by Del Torno, the great \"Pan's Labyrinth\", which in my opinion is still the best film by the Mexican director, a cold and brutal film with a slightly lighter outfit, great film, great story , great animation. 9.5/10.",

            "content": "The Battle of the 2022 PinocchiosNetflix Pinocchio Director: Guillermo Del ToroStory By: Guillermo Del Toro, Patrick McHale, and Matthew RobbinsCast: Gregory Mann, David Bradley, Ewan McGregor, Ron Perlman, Finn Wolfhard, Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett, and Christoph WaltzVSDisney Pinocchio Director: Robert ZemeckisStory By: Robert Zemeckis and Chris WeitzCast: Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Tom Hanks, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Giuseppe Battiston, Kyanne Lamaya, Keegan-Michael Key, Lorraine Bracco, Jaquita Ta'le, Luke Evans, and Cynthia Erivo** ** **Story & Theme\nWinner for me - Toro's Pinocchio\nThe original story of Pinocchio is obviously a classic, and Zemeckis' live action adaptation was done amazingly and loosely well, heightening the adventure aspect of the story. BUT...I do feel that the themes were not as adhesive throughout due to the focus on Pinocchio's day of adventure vs his day of learning while on this adventure.With Toro's adaptation, I appreciated the colorful darkness of the story, especially taking time to give a story of Geppetto's son. Thematically, the film focused on the relationship between a father and a son, expectations of boyhood/being a boy, the spirit of being a child, and the consequences of childhood and adulthood intersecting.** ** **Pacing\nWinner for me - Zemeckis' Pinocchio\nSo honestly, I think both films had solid and appropriate pacing for the story they were telling. When it comes to Toro's adaptation, pacing felt a little choppy and rushed in regards to the relationship between Pinocchio and Geppetto. Some of the frustrations by Geppetto weren't fully justified based on the knowledge we had of Pinocchio, in my opinion.With Zemeckis' adaptation, the adventure focus gave it that extra nudge forward for me. Though pacing sort of took over thematic followthrough, it did move the character through situations to at least check off the tasks given to him by the Blue Fairy, while also being super engaging.** ** **Character Arc\nWinner for me - Toro's Pinocchio\nAs mentioned with my pick for best story and theme, Toro's adaptation put effort into the character of Pinocchio. He wasn't just a means to move the plot, he was written as, what seemed to be, a \"real live boy/child.\" It reminded me of the most recent Child's Play remake where the film gave space to this unknowing and ignorant character to actually learn and pick up habits with help in making sense of them when possible. Even Geppetto had more purpose and range as a character than in the original.Zemeckis' adaptation, though loose, was loose for the engagement and adventure, not necessarily Pinocchio. From the very beginning, Pinocchio was an upstanding puppet looking to do right, and none of the situations really brought about enough tension for him to be swayed either at all or for too long. The moment that stands out most is Act Three with the Pleasure Island which I would've liked to have seen showcase a more faithful version of Pinocchio.** ** **Creativity\nWinner for me - Toro's Pinocchio\nThe setting. The backstory to Geppetto's son. The more \"realistic\" adaptation to the Pleasure Island climax of the original. And the overall production and storytelling medium. All things that should be admired and given due props, in my opinion.With Zemeckis' adaptation, I wouldn't say creative liberties were taken, which is probably because the owners of the story were also spearheading the adaptation-so why take creative liberties with their original concept, when doing it \"live action\" is \"creative\" enough...maybe??** ** **Entertainment Factor\nWinner - Zemeckis' Pinocchio\nBy default, if I were to suggest one to watch to the general public, it would be the Disney live action adaption. I chuckled more during my viewing, the visuals are great, and the focus on adventure really helps with engagement, so it's the most accessible of the two. I also loved the Pleasure Island song.However, for viewers looking for story and substance, I'd definitely suggest the Toro adaptation on Netflix.** ** **Overall, my pick between the two is #TorosPinocchio which gives Pinocchio of 1940 - meets JoJo Rabbit - meets Up - meets The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonBoth are definitely interesting in their own way due to their individual creative paths, but I genuinely appreciated the depth that Toro applied to the Pinocchio story.Also, the score for Toro's Pinocchio sounds like quality, and Erivo's When You Wish for Disney is stunning.",

In my opinion it could have been far darker and not marketed for kids to be able to do so. It seems they wanted to show the true story (which we all deserve by now) but instead they still produced a semi disneyfied version. The movie was long yet somehow felt so short of context/meaning/soul. This Pinocchio revolves around one event he endured and then they quickly and quite clumsily added two more events to ramp up the story a tad bit. But those additions didn't blend well and felt separate from the theme they went with. They managed to make him even more annoying but only when he came to life after than he was pretty well behaved almost adult like. As if he already learned all the lessons we know he was supposed to learn but didn't actually endure them. Overall I wish I didn't see it. Perhaps this will light the fire under other creators to retell all the true story versions stolen and ruined by D.",

Motion of all times. Each frame is an explosion of detail and imagination with jaw-dropping designs, there were moments that even took my breath away and my eyes were shining stars with what I saw on the scene, it is simply a great visual achievement. And Del Toro's reimagining of the story is a very clever one, he's managed to keep the childlike charm but also mix very heavy themes like war, mortality, identity and grief in a way that works really well and makes for some very emotional moments. Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack is also absolutely impeccable, elevating the film even more in the moments in which it is present. I'm really happy that this movie is finally here and I'm really excited to see the public's reaction to it.\"In this world you get what you give\"A beautiful and sad film at the same time, which makes us reflect on the time we still have... That it's never too late to dream... About hope, about death, about second chances, about the unconditional love of parents in their children, and of children to their fathers. Impossible not to get emotional. And it also talks about the pain that is loss, conscience (the cricket) and the consequences of lies. Timeless work... and also more faithful to the Italian tale!There are countless versions of the book \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" that Carlo Collodi wrote in 1881, from the 1940 Disney animation to films by renowned directors such as Matteo Garrone (2019), Roberto Benigni (2002), Robert Zemeckis (2022) , but none of them come close to the marvel that Guillermo del Toro has now done.His Pinocchio is heartbreaking and charming at the same time, it's dark and delicate, it's pure cinema, the kind you leave the room remembering why it's so good to be moved by the movies.Nowadays, people watch movies with their cell phone in hand, they don't give themselves to the work, they don't allow themselves to dream for two hours, forgetting the real world. If you're one of those people who doesn't turn off your cell phone during a movie session (even at home), allow yourself to dream of Pinocchio by del Toro, disconnect from the world and then reconnect with more passion for life.Because life is short, the film talks about that, about time, about moments. What happens, happens. And then we left.And it's a shame most won't be able to experience it where it was meant to be seen, but I'm glad that on Netflix it got funding and worldwide distribution for all to watch.",

The stop-motion animation is impeccable and the set design is gorgeous and awash with colours. Del Toro's influence on the set and character designs is unmistakable, with all the creatures and scenery reflecting his signature twisted creatures, painstaking details and dark tone. A nod is also given to the costume design of the Angel of Death from Hellboy II, shown in the eyes on the wings of Pinocchio's own angels of death. The following making of feature afterwards is also a must-see to gain a full appreciation of the wide range of talent and hard work that went into this film.

            "content": "As I understand it, the original story of 'The Adventures of Pinocchio' essentially boils down to a morality tale deriding the shallow pursuits of selfish and naive hedonism in favour of hard work, study, honesty and listening to one's elders.Would Del Toro dare to try and encapsulate such an unfashionable message for today's viewers? Would he dare to challenge the moral hegemony of Hollywood?The short answer is no.Del Toro's version opts for 'lessons' like: fascism is bad and shouldn't be blindly followed (really? I never would have guessed); children are naturally good in nature and therefore shouldn't really listen to their parents - who are mostly corrupt, evil, selfish, greedy or self-obsessed anyway; breaking things is just a part of a child's exuberant nature and should be celebrated...and so on.Although Pinocchio dies several times, he never seems to truly suffer in this version. Death isn't real to him, therefore there is no chance for ultimate sacrifice (or is there?). Notably, the Christ features here as a dusty wooden relic, constructed by man, standing in the shadows of a bombed out church.Rather than have to struggle to gain wisdom and see the error of his childish ways - Pinocchio's inate 'innocence' and 'goodness' is what others have to learn to appreciate.Where the Disney version felt Pinocchio required a conscience to become human, Del Toro's seems to imply that Pinocchio, being essentially nature imbued with spirit (Gaia, anyone?) is pretty much perfect already and it's humans, especially the adult variety, who are the problems.Here, Pinocchio quickly decides education is not for him, it's 'too hard', but rather than suffer directly for such a choice it simply sparks a new adventure. His character arc has been gutted and the movie feels empty, meandering and pointless without it.Meanwhile his 'father' Gepetto (representing callous and oppressive patriarchy, no doubt) fights over his 'ownership' of the puppet son/sun with Count Volpe. Volpe, a hideous looking creation, employs a slave monkey (Del Toro's symbolism, not mine ) and is obsessed with money and exploitation. It's not subtle.Del Toro decides to move the original tale forward in time, to Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship. In doing so, he renders all the adult characters intrinisically corrupt/complicit in evil, including the church priest (who enthusiastically performs a nazi salute). What is required is the innately good activism of children - acting in comradeship - to rise up and overthrow the unjust system.Although the 'heroes' learn to be less selfish by the end, it feels tacked on and messy rather than a natural evolution of the narrative, as if Del Toro remembered at the end what the tale was supposed to be about. Any moral 'heart' it has feels cannibalised from a tale, and a time, the makers have no respect for.As for the animation, it's undoubtedly technically classy, though I found the whole look of the thing unattractive (and not in a way that was dark enough to be truly unsettling - which might have been interesting). The songs weren't insufferable, but seemed an afterthought. The choice of voices was mixed - Ewan McGregor sounded all wrong as the cricket, the only other voice that stood out was Christoph Waltz, who was reliably creepy.",

This can't be said about a lot of reboots and sequels nowadays.What I didn't like about the film, like the ugly (in my opinion) animation style, it makes up for in heart. Geppetto and Pinocchio's relationship is the highlight of the story.Whilst I don't want to go into spoilers, this film is really sad at times and had me tearing up. The soundtrack definitely added a lot to certain scenes and the movie as a whole, which is to be expected by Alexander Desplat, who is an absolutely amazing composer, and he brings his A game.Another thing I loved about this film was the antagonist, the puppeteer. Very rarely do I feel physical anger towards characters as movies play out. This definitely occurred towards him.Overall, Guillerman Del Toro's Pinocchio was an emotional rollercoaster ride that feels more like it's own story then just a \"remake\".8/10.",

It's so full of life and soul. It is thought provoking, funny, entertaining. The only thing I'd change is wishing this had come out when I was a kid so I could see it through the lens of a child.

The original version has more overtones of a horror movie than a children's story and Del Toro wanted to tell it as it is, however, he omitted some lurid themes from the original plot For example, the Cricket (Pepe Grillo) was crushed with a hammer, at the beginning of the original book, or that Gepetto couldn't take Pinocchio anymore and hanged him, so he spent time in jail, or when Pinocchio he was robbed to steal some coins, they hung him upside down and stabbed him. That was how he originally died. There are so many macabre events in true history that may well have been the inspiration for \"Chucky.\" In Pinocchio's original conception he was spoiled and disobedient to the point that when he comes to life, he punches Gepetto, steals his wig, and runs away from him. This version of del Toro is the most faithful to the original to the point that it also has political overtones of the time. In the original version, Collodi frames the life of Gepetto and Pinocchio during the reunification of Italy which brought hunger and poverty to the Italian people. In Del Toro's version, it frames the life of Gepetto and Pinocchio during the Second World War and the birth of Italian National Socialism led by Mussolini, which functioned as a dictatorship, in fact, they also keep the greeting of the fascists that later was adopted, by Hitler. Technically the film is perfect, in stop-motion and a hit is the voices of McGregor, Waltz, and Blanchett.",

            "content": "I found out the term \"twin films\" very recently, but I knew exactly what it was. It is when two films with the same or similar plots are released at the same time by two different studios. Famous examples of twin films include: Octopussy / Never Say Never Again, Dante's Peak / Volcano, Deep Impact / Armageddon, Antz / A Bug's Life, The Prestige / The Illusionist, White House Down / Olympus Has Fallen, and No Strings Attached / Friends with Benefits. The most recent example of this phenomenon is the two versions of Pinocchio, the Razzie nominated live-action Disney remake, and this acclaimed animated version, based on the story by Carlo Collodi, directed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, Nightmare Alley) and Mark Gustafson. Basically, set in Italy during the Second World War, twenty years ago, the carpenter Geppetto (David Bradley) loses his son Carlo (Gregory Mann) during an inadvertent aerial bomb. He plants a pinecone beside his grave to honour his memory and spends a long time mourning the loss of his son. An anthropomorphic cricket named Sebastian (Ewan McGregor) makes a home inside the resulting pine tree. One day, in a drunken rage, Geppetto cuts down the pine tree to create a new son made of wood. When Geppetto passes, a Wood Sprite (Tilda Swinton) brings the puppet to life, naming him Pinocchio (Gregory Mann). When Sebastian appears, the Sprite assigns him to become Pinocchio's conscience, to guide his decisions and help him choose between right and wrong, with the promise of a wish as reward. Geppetto wakes up to discover Pinocchio is alive; he is terrified and later fed up with his antics. Pinocchio wanders the streets, and enters the church, the townspeople are scared of him. Geppetto follows him, and while there, Pinocchio discovers when he tells lies that his nose grows longer, with many branches. The village Podest\u00c3\u00a0 (Ron Perlman) sees Pinocchio is living, he orders Geppetto to send him to school. On his way, Pinocchio is intercepted by showman Count Volpe (Christoph Waltz) and his monkey Spazzatura (Cate Blanchett), who bring Pinocchio to their circus. Pinocchio becomes a performer in a stage show, entertaining crowds as \"the puppet with no strings\". Geppetto attempts to take Pinocchio back, but Volpe insists the wooden boy signed a contract that makes him his property. An ensuing confrontation causes Pinocchio to run away, and a truck fatally hits him. In the afterlife, he meets the Wood Sprite's sister Death (Tilda Swinton), who explains he is immortal. He can only be revived when an hourglass empties, she cautions him that the more he dies, the more time he will spend in the afterlife. After returning to the mortal realm, Pinocchio and Geppetto have a heated argument. Pinocchio decides to stay with the circus and perform to earn money for Geppetto and to avoid being recruited by the Podest\u00c3\u00a0 into the Royal Italian Army during World War II. Jealous and wanting to reinstate himself as the star of the circus, Spazzatura reveals to Pinocchio that Volpe is keeping all the money he falsely promised to send to his father for himself. Hearing this, Volpe viciously beats Spazzatura, upsetting Pinocchio, who tries to defend him. Pinocchio sabotages and humiliates Volpe by ridiculing Benito Mussolini (SpongeBob SquarePants' Tom Kenny) in song during his performance. Mussolini orders Pinocchio to be executed, sending him to the afterlife, while the circus burned. Once revived, Pinocchio finds himself being taken to a boot camp by the Podest\u00c3\u00a0, where other boys are trained to fight in the war. Pinocchio befriends the Podest\u00c3\u00a0's son Candlewick (Finn Wolfhard) who is afraid of disappointing his father. The Podest\u00c3\u00a0 splits the boys into two teams for a training game to retrieve and raise a flag; Pinocchio and Candlewick are in opposite teams but agree to end it in a tie. The Podest\u00c3\u00a0 is angered and orders Candlewick to shoot Pinocchio. Candlewick refuses and finally stands up to his father. The Allies then bombs the training camp, the Podest\u00c3\u00a0 is killed in the blast, while Candlewick and the other boys flee. Pinocchio is captured by Volpe, who tries to burn him to death as revenge for ruining his career. Spazzatura saves Pinocchio, Volpe falls off a seaside cliff to his death, alongside Pinocchio and the monkey who fall into the water. Pinocchio and Spazzatura are lost at sea and swallowed by a giant dogfish. Inside the belly of the beast, Pinocchio and Spazzatura find Geppetto and Sebastian, who were also swallowed, searching for Pinocchio. Sebastian introduces himself to Geppetto and suggests Pinocchio tells lies to grow his nose to create a bridge and climb out of the monster's blowhole. As they escape, the monster tries to eat them again, but Pinocchio sacrifices himself by detonating a naval mine inside the monster, killing them both. Returning to the afterlife again, he demands that Death sends him back early to save Geppetto from drowning. Death warns him that doing so will make him mortal, but Pinocchio breaks the hourglass to return and ends up drowning while saving his father. The Wood Sprite reappears to Geppetto, who mourns Pinocchio's death. Sebastian reminds the Sprite about his wish to be granted; he uses it to make her revive Pinocchio. Pinocchio returns home with his father, Sebastian and Spazzatura to live together as a family. But as he was warned, Pinocchio outlives Geppetto, who dies of old age, as do Spazzatura and Sebastian eventually. Pinocchio decides to travel to parts unknown until the day his time is up. Also starring Burn Gorman as Priest, John Turturro as Dottore, and Tim Blake Nelson as the Black Rabbits. The voice cast are all great, McGregor as the cricket, Bradley as the anguished father and woodcarver, Mann as the young wooden boy, Swinton as the sibling fairy creatures, and Perlman and Waltz as the villains. It is a completely different approach to the story, changing the setting from 19th century Italy to the time of fascism in the Second World War, but it was a surprisingly clever idea that adds to the surreal atmosphere. It sticks mostly to the source material, adding grief as the reason for the old man to create a puppet, obviously the war element surrounds many events, and the ending never sees Pinocchio becoming a real boy. But it has good ideas about what it really means to be human, the stop-animation is impeccable, and the music and original songs, including \"My Son\", \"Everything Is New to Me\", \"Ciao Papa\", and \"Better Tomorrows\" by Alexandre Desplat are charming, it may a darker alternative adaptation, but it is much better than the rubbish Disney counterpart, an exceptional animated musical fantasy. It is nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for \"Ciao Papa\", and Best Original Score.

My only gripe is that it lacks prominent women characters, especially considering del Toro previously gave us fantastic protagonists like Ofelia (Pan's) and Elisa (The Shape of Water) as well as strong secondary characters in other films.Watching the end credits, it was really heartwarming to see that he worked with an animation studio in his birthplace, Guadalajara (the end credits say \"Second Unit,\" but del Toro says in the Netflix behind-the-scenes segment that they animated Pinocchio and Cricket).It's fortunately still in theatres, so I'm hoping to experience it on the big screen!",

Being an essentially children's work, we are not facing a return to the terrible universe of Pan's Labyrinth, but the tone is dark and fascism returns, in what seems to be an obsession by del Toro.An original version of the classic, intelligent and with an undeniable author's stamp.",

I loved the original Disney Pinocchio when I was a child and now I am totally delighted with this version.I do agree with the people saying this is not a children movie, it is not, so it is not fair to rate it as it was because it contains many sensitive topics indeed. As I see it, it is an animation movie for adults and as that is a jewel. In less than two hours the movie managed to retell the story in a very original way and it manage to include so many clues of the political situation in Italy during those times. I just loved how political the movie is. Also, there are many small details that show the genius in the construction of each one of the characters. For example, it fascinated me that the cricket had the picture of Arthur Schopenhauer in his house. On my eyes it was a very melancholic movie, it portraits dead as it is: sad and unavoidable, and both traits are just beautifully displayed with very good dialogues and visuals. In addition, I loved how some of the iconic scenes of the Disney film were kept in this version, just to mention one, the scene of Geppetto looking for Pinocchio at night is portrayed both in the Disney movie and in this version mastering the way of transmit sadness. This movie is just excellent, will watch it at least twice.",

Mr. William of the Bull has always intrigued me with his anti-fascism and him injecting that into this story about being a good person is so well done and very touching. Plus he includes some anti-capitalism which will always win me over. I think he does the political messaging well considering he's ultimately making a film that seems to be less overt and more aimed at general audiences.Everything about Pinocchio's innocence and his attempts to navigate and understand an unjust world is so heartwarming. The little puppet boy just makes the other characters better people (all of them except the capitalists and fascists who all die).I'm not a huge fan of stop-motion and I am not sure if something was up with my internet or TV but it looked a bit frame-y.

            "content": "It's fitting that this story of a hand-crafted wooden boy who is brought to life by the magic of an ancient spirit is itself comprised of hand-crafted wooden-looking characters who are brought to life by the patience and skill of a plethora of underpaid and overworked animators. 'Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)' (I'm not a fan of having the director's name in the title, by the way, especially since he's actually only the co-director of the piece) is nothing if not beautiful, with its breathtakingly tactile aesthetics clearly being the best part about it. It's a fairytale in the traditional sense of the word, one not just of rainbows and wishes but also of darkness and grief, and this is reflected in the way that it looks. With splashes of scariness and dashes of the uncanny, the picture constantly plays with the assumption that its source story can only be one of wonder and whimsy (though, to be fair, there has been some grimness in most adaptations of it). It's a treat to behold, for sure, even if some of its visuals don't quite meet the standard it sets for itself early on (such as the water, which seems to be a straightforward computer-generated particle simulation, for instance). Unfortunately, the narrative doesn't quite have the same effect. In many ways, the film is somewhat disappointing, primarily because of its rampant tonal inconsistencies and the uncomfortable push-pull between its slapstick humour, musical numbers and sometimes saccharine sweetness and its underlying rumination on fascism, grief and mortality. This is one of the rare examples of a movie which would genuinely be better if it wasn't a musical. The songs are generally uninspired, with weak melodies and undercooked lyrics, and their accompanying sequences tend to take the steam out of the story due to how blindsiding they often are (their infrequency makes it easy to forget the flick is a musical at all). Plus, Pinocchio is just straight-up irritating for most of the runtime, and I know that's the point but it undeniably makes things less compelling; annoying by design is still annoying, after all. The experience is honestly a lot better before he first springs to life. The plot takes some really strange left turns at times, seemingly to force in a predetermined theme rather than elaborate on the themes already present within the source story (or, at least, the version of it that most people are familiar with), and it leaves things on an affirming yet oddly downbeat note that feels a bit off in retrospect. Despite the narrative issues, though, there are plenty of entertaining segments and the vivid brilliance of the animation ensures that even the least engaging moments are always enjoyable to look at. Plus, Ewan McGregor lights up the screen - or, I suppose, speakers - whenever his cricket character chirps his way into the story, which sadly occurs far less frequently than you'd hope it would, and the other voice performers deliver strong work across the board. Ultimately, this is a disjointed affair that's often jarring thanks to its wild shifts in tone, but is just as often stunning thanks to its meticulous visual design and animation. It doesn't quite live up to the hype, if that matters, and I'm a little unsure as to how much I actually like it overall. Still, it's a solid enough effort that may fail to outdo its Disney forefather (and I'm not talking about the live-action remake), but still stands on its own as something I can see plenty of people getting a lot of enjoyment from.",

But this one might be overthrowing that title.The story is about a toy maker named Geppetto who has been greving over the loss of his son Carlo who was killed during a bombing campaign in WWI. Several years pass as Italy has changed itself as a fascism state under the control of Benito Mussolini. One day, in a fit of drunken rage, Geppetto cuts down a tree so he can make a wooden puppet that he could call his son. When he falls asleep, a blue Wood Sprite, comes out and brings the puppet to life and names it Pinocchio. And from here on out, he will see the what it means to be human, while going on crazy adventures with strange people.Despite being a kids movie and keeping some of the essentials of the Pinocchio story, it still has some dark themes and subjects like life and death, the terrible suffering during WWI and WWII, political policies and even religion. And none of it feels hammy or forced. This is especially the case with the characters. The relationship with Geppetto and Pinocchio is amazing. The latter clearly loves the former so much and wants to be seen as his son. But Geppotto struggles to accept him as his son, given that he is a living wooden puppet and is very naive.The animation is outstanding. This just might be one of the best looking animated films I have seen in years. I kept forgetting that the film was stop-motion, and not computer-generated. Because the character models look out-of-this-world! Particularly with Geppetto and the Wood Sprite.

I personally found the design of the titular character to be 'just' OK, same goes for Sebastian J. Cricket & Co.I did like the casting of Ewan McGregor and David Bradley, particularly the latter. Christoph Waltz, meanwhile, is alright in his role. The more serious vibe of the film is a positive, though I don't think it comes across as deep as it intended (e.g. That last line from Cricket isn't, in my opinion, as effective as the film seems to think it is). As for the music: fine but forgettable, for me.Again, it's passable. I just unfortunately didn't overly care as much as I wanted to for this story and its characters. The 1940 film did it slightly better, fwiw.",

Following the simple through-line of Collodi's original, Del Toro wholeheartedly lends his stamp to the classic fable by grounding it in the all too real world (the rise of the fascists in Italy during the 30's) as Gepetto builds his son from a tree which looms over the grave of his diseased son (who perished during a bombing one fateful night). Once the blue fairy gives life to the little wooden boy, Gepetto (voiced by David Bradley who worked w/Del Toro on FX's The Strain) is a little thrown back (he was built under alcohol'd duress) as his new charge is more than a handful & following the original story's beats, Pinocchio falls in w/a carnival exploited by its owner, voiced by Oscar winner Christoph Waltz, follows Candlewick, Finn Wolfhard, to a fascist youth camp which his dad, Del Toro regular Ron Perlman, runs & has to save Bradley & his conscience the cricket, Ewan McGregor, from the belly of a whale. Sprinkled w/easy going songs (some of which McGregor starts but never finishes due to humorously being cut off) & fashioned in wonderful stop motion animation (very reminiscent of Laika studios output), this is of a piece w/Del Toro's oeuvre, especially The Devil's Backbone, which handles the familiarity of the narrative the way it should be, giving the audience, in this case, much food for thought while being entertained & wondered at the same time. Other voice actors include Oscar winners Cate Blanchett & Tilda Swinton w/Tim Blake Nelson, Burn Gorman, John Turturro & Gregory Mann who voices the wooden miracle.",

Guillermo Del Toro always has the highest quality in his production and typically makes some of my favorite releases. Usually, I wouldn't be this excited about something animated unless it was Disney/Pixar. So when the Tom Hanks live-action Pinocchio flopped, I was disappointed. Pinocchio has also been a favorite of mine since childhood. So I prayed that this beautiful-looking Del Toro adaption would live up to expectations. I'll say my expectations were met many times over.This is Pinocchio like you've never seen him before. But that's a good thing. An adaptation or remake needs to be different from the original. That was the biggest reason Disney's 2022 adaptation flopped. It tried being too much like the original and changed many things that made the original so magical. This also isn't a remake of the classic 1940 Pinocchio. It is a different interpretation of the 1883 novel. I could go on praising so much of what this does perfectly. The fascist Italy setting during the second world war creates an interesting backdrop for why things happen to certain characters. Christoph Waltz should honestly stick with villain characters. Count Volpe is one of my favorite characters Waltz has ever played. This also is not a kid's movie. It could be watched by kids, but many of the themes are things that only adults would understand. Few could take a classic work for kids and turn it into something emotionally complex and beautiful. Del Toro is one of those few.10/10. An imaginative ride from start to finish. Full of heartbreak and triumph, sure to entertain all. A real contender for best-animated film of the year.",

But with all the hype i expected it to be only one simple thing - to not be a clone, a parody of the generally hated Pinocchio.There are some changes, but this is undoubtedly, instantly recognisably based on the Disney's script adaptation of the book. Yes, there's one change, where the writers sat in one room and were going, \"like, ma-a-an, like what if, like, Pinocchio, but with fascists, like, woah, man, like, so deep, amiright?\". Leave them there for a couple more hours and we would see Aladdin and the ISIS Lamp, Hitler Mermaid, and the showstopper Snow White and the Seven putins.Why the characters are thinking that pine cones are seeds? Is this the writers, or are these characters absolute clueless? That's despite working for years with these nut trees. Their cone could've been already entirely eaten out, and putting so much competition in one place is not good either.And this is not just a parody of the 1940's movie, it also in many places is the same as the new version. So the dumb Sebastian Jiminy Cricket that existed only to teach about death in one episode of the serialised book, is again the narrator. And it is appointed to be Pinocchio's conscience in exchange for a reward. And there's a creepy blue fairy who makes a doll alive, instead of the wood being alive beforehand, and the fairy first appearing in the episode 15 of the book to play dead. She even says the same stupid \"pine joke\". There're the scenes with the bug with a clock and with the bug in a jar. In general, the bug does nothing for the runtime, exactly just like in the re-make. Why the carnival tries to show the puppet, to the village where it lives and where everyone has already saw it yesterday? And didn't he sign the contract in another place, not at the bottom? Pinocchio got to the fun island not because it's fun, but due to being kidnapped and peer pressured, exactly just like in the re-make. Just instead of turning into jackasses they turn into fascists there. Yet Pinocchio doesn't participate much, because he is a good boy and doesn't believe this to be fun, exactly just like in the re-make. Why is there paintball in 1940s? Why the circus master teleports to extra secret military base? Pinocchio uses lies to get out of a sticky situation, exactly just like in the re-make. To get out of the monster they use Disney's sneeze. And then there's a motorboating sequence, a fakeout death and him never turning into a real boy, exactly just like in the re-make. Geppetto never met the first fairy, how he did recognize that thing and why he talks to her as if he wasn't passed out drunk?And it's a musical slapstick movie with unfunny comic reliefs, with a doodoo scene and animal abuse. Same as the re-make What is different from the re-make is that all the songs are irredeemably bad. None of them rhyme and it's very painful on the ears and made my brain to stop working for a moment every time there was a line with no rhyming.The stop-motion animation can be called good. But it is nothing more than a gimmick. It achieves nothing and looks exactly like good CGI. Especially with the puppet's super creepy fake magic mouth. And, well, it already is half-CGI anyway, with the horizons and skyboxes. They even implement artificial (practical?) motion blur. Stop-motion alone is not a USP, when there were many movies with great stop-motion and great stories. Or movies that imitate better stop motion with CGI.Super rich people who live to super old age and have millions listening to their words just love to say that only death gives meaning to a human life. Meanwhile, besides those hundred or two rich people with an audience, there are eight milliards who will die young, absolutely unknown, lose genetic lottery, and achieve genetic mortality. The significant percent of breeding is done by the same specimens, while the rest have no offspring, have no artistic body of work, have no diaries or memoirs. And parents not always become grandparents. And art or diaries are lost to time. There's an estimate that about 117 milliards of humans ever lived, what % can you name? What % can you and everyone you ever knew in you life name by working together? What % can you all name, by also using wikipedia, cemeteries, and everything ever written?Death doesn't give you meaning, only insane amount of ill-gotten money. People know more maniacs and thieves by name than doctors and donors. Screw that noise. I want to be immortal and to write these reviews no one reads forever, until the heat-death of the universe. And then some, until i catch up with my backlog and write about every art-thing humanity ever produced, is producing and will produce. Only after that, maybe, just maybe, i will, for sure, just start again from the beginning. From the things i consumed in me childhood, because i will forget about them, and it's like i can experience them again.Immortality, to everyone, for free, and let no one to leave resentful.",

Entirely my interpretation but the use of Fachist propoganda and christian imagery felt like a damnation of both.Pinocchio's Frankenstein's Monster's birth scene was brilliantly used, his immortality was also phenomenal on top of the Governments attempted exploitation of it was well used.The use of claymation will always be a win in my book, here it was exellently used, I have no doubt that it was a labour of love for all involved. Pinocchio's design itself felt a little under developed, perhaps it would've removed from the immortal youth aspect but some moss growth and more wear and tear would've been nice to see.Everyone gave and good performance but none really stole the show for me, Ewan Mcgregor was amusing but honestly just felt lumped in. Plus the constant recycling of gags with him took me out of it.Del Toro's Pinocchio felt deeply personal and I will at somepoint have to do some further research into the man, the only other work I know of his off the top of my head is his contributions to Death Stranding and PT.All in all probably one of the best films I've witnessed this year, it was bleak, unwavering and dark.

There might be enough delightful whimsy for a younger audience, with some decent musical numbers and fun characters. However I think adults will respond best to the heavy subject matter, especially the conversations between Pinocchio and Death on the nature of mortality.

Fittingly enough, using stop-motion for this movie was a great way to be creative as well as align with the whole \"talking wooden puppet\" motif. And while the time jump into World War II Italy obviously doesn't make this a faithful adaptation of the original work, it's at least grittier than the more colorful animated versions have come to represent.I appreciate all the work that goes into stop-motion animated movies. I enjoyed Aardman's Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and Laika's Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), so it's nice to see other animation companies like ShadowMachine enter the feature-length movie realm with their work. That being said, the human characters felt a bit off in this, sometimes looking more like the puppets from Team America: World Police (2004) than characters distinctly different from the titular character who is supposed to be a puppet. Despite this, the animation itself is smooth and has Guillermo del Toro's distinct visual style.Story-wise, this version of Pinocchio has some interesting elements that take the idea of a living, sentient puppet to a few logical conclusions. The consideration of Pinocchio's immortality (or at least tree-like longevity) was a plot point I wasn't expecting, even if it worked quite well. And while I understand del Toro's obsession with including fascists as villains in almost every movie he directs, it feels a bit tiring here (probably because of real-life fascists being in the news all the time). Still, in a year that saw three separate Pinocchio movies, Guillermo del Toro's version definitely elevated itself above the rest.A visually distinct and uniquely told stop-motion take on Pinocchio, I give Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio 4.0 stars out of 5.",

The classic tale of Pinocchio is terrific and I also love the original Disney adaptation of the character. With it being redone so many times, I found myself having trouble getting excited about another one. Even though Guillermo del Toro would be behind it, I still wasn't completely sold, even though I love him as a filmmaker. Well, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is now streaming on Netflix, and not only was I surprised to love it, but I think it's my favourite adaptation yet.Just like most versions of this story, the film starts off with Geppetto (voiced very nicely by David Bradley) after he has lost his son. Fed up with being sad, he chops down a tree next to his son's grave and begins to use that wood to carve a young boy. Brought to life by another lifeform, Geppetto can now try and recreate memories he had with his son. Pinocchio, however, having a mind of his own, decides to make his own decisions, getting himself lost and in a place, he shouldn't be. From guns to straight-up war sequences, this version of Pinocchio is unlike any other.For being a film that's rated PG, this is much more for mature audiences. I can't see many children getting attached to this version, over something like the original Disney animated film. With that said though, I think the nuances in the detail, especially in the incredible stop-motion work, deserve all the awards. The more mature storyline, alongside expert craftsmanship, when it comes to the set design, I was blown away by every aspect of this movie. The dedication to getting this made is on full display from start to finish.Overall, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio isn't just my favourite adaption of this character, but simply one of my favourite films of 2022 in general. The story sucked me in more than I've ever been towards this story and by the end, I was moved by how they handled certain moments. Del Toro's attention to detail and his masterful direction are wonderous here, as always and every frame just felt like it was leaping off the screen. The voice talents are all very enjoyable and more than anything, there are some extremely well-crafted lines of dialogue that nearly had me in tears. Everything that went into this film was done with care and immense effort/talent. I can't wait to watch this one again. I'm all for any nominations this film receives.",

This week Netflix released Academy Award-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro's reinvention of Carlo Collodi's classic tale Pinocchio. As you know, the tale goes by a wooden puppet is magically brought to life in order to mend the heart of a grieving woodcarver named Geppetto. Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson stop-motion musical follows the mischievous and disobedient adventures of Pinocchio in his pursuit of a place in the world. Well let's get to it.This is one of those simple reviews. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is beautiful, heartbreaking, and fun movie. So much so that it actually makes no sense why the movie wasn't exclusively in the theaters. I mean this isn't really a December/Christmas movie but it's definitely one of those movies that just needs to sneak in before Award Season ends for the year. So what to say about Pinocchio. The stop animation is top notch, creative, and realistic at the same time. I mean just the typical for del Toro. This new version of Pinocchio brings the old story . With the storytelling and the voiceover work the movie gives the movie life. The innonnce and naivete of Pinocchio, the desperation and hope of Gepeto, the callous and unforgiving of Podesta and conveiving and cunning of Count Volpe just shoot of the screen. It's easy to say that with the voice work of a great cast of the likes of Christoph Waltz, Ron Perlman, David Bradley, and Gregory Mann in reverse order. Just to name a few because Ewan McGregor's Cricket just sounded a bit too like himself to be believe able. ANy way, you need those type of performances when this is a long told story like Pinocchio. The imaginative artisty along with the voice work make this feature its own.Ultimately, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is a must-see movie. The animation is inventive and beautiful. While the Pinocchio story is basically the same, this movie zones in on the emotional connection between father and son and a desire to be a better human being.

Another, bigger reason it's hard to watch is that the wooden boy's dialog is moronic, sounding like it was actually written by a 5 year-old, and not even an intelligent 5 year-old at that. IMHO, far too many movies aimed at kids treat the audience as if the are brain dead (e.g., most recent Disney animated movies).

Not surprisingly, Del Toro adopts a somber tone that permeates even the lightest moments in the story. Christ and Mussolini serve as unexpected motifs, and recognizable characters are given unusual backstories. Given my affection for the director's earlier works, I wanted to love this film, but it stumbles over its own ambitions, and without giving too much away, the ending felt as hollow as the title character himself. Still, as a work of animation, it is impressive, and there's more to like than dislike. Just not much more.",

Some big emotions for really young ones though.I'm so glad that films like this are still being made. The collaboration between the Jim Henson company and Guillermo del toro had me glued to the screen from the first moments. It felt like some of the brilliant movies made for children and young adults in the 80s and 90s.Songs aren't that memorable but for me this isn't a big deal. I thought they mostly added and never felt they should have been left out. Bearing in mind the target audience here, the songs and humour were well enjoyed in our family.A film about imperfection, naivety, the darkness of the world, love, and friendship.",

The stop motion animation is superb, the voice acting is good and the songs are entertaining, if a bit on the short side. The plot is two stories mixed together, which does drag a bit in the middle and the second story feels rushed and underdeveloped. The ending is a bit too silly but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Lonely carpenter makes a marionette that magically comes to life, seemingly replacing a lost son, but with some complications. You might think you don't need to watch Guillermo del Toro's interpretation, but you're wrong, you do. Partly because like I said, this looks gorgeous, but it's much more than that. It's easy to get swept up in the awe of the spectacle. Wondering how on earth they managed such a fluid looking 2 hour stop frame animation. The detail, the lighting. It's the story though isn't it. When a story endures over 130 years. There's got to be something to it. I'll admit the voice of Ewan McGregor as Sebastian the Cricket our narrator is a touch jarring, but this is a fairy tale and his tone probably fits and I'm maybe just looking for a chink it what's a pretty impervious armour. Geppetto (David Bradley) makes the inquisitive Pinocchio (Gregory Mann) and he quickly gets into hot water in the god fearing Italian village. Particularly with the fascist Podesta (Ron Perlman). The little wooden boy has a lot to learn. I wasn't prepared for the songs, but they're grand and theatrical. Especially as we're introduced to the evil circus master Count Volpe (Christoph Waltz) who looks like a more terrifying Keith Flint. There's a lot of big names in here, Cate Blanchett as a scary looking monkey, Tilda Swinton, Finn Wolfhard, John Turturro. They're not really needed though. Why do we insist that big name actors voice films like this? At least Mann in the lead is a newcomer. Pinocchio's passion for life soon brings his death closer, but \"Death is not the end\". It's at this point that I admit I'm a bit sketchy on the details of this story. It's been a while since I were a child. There's a lot going on here, more than I recall. It's still accessible to children, but it won't talk down to them. It's full of darkness, entertaining darkness. With suicidal sailors and exploding seagulls. My favourite though are the death rabbits Learning as he goes, Pinocchio is the one teaching the lessons as he endures the fantastical tests thrown his way. Every bit the rip roaring adventure. It is quite magical, it's also magnificent. I wouldn't have thought I'd enjoy this really, but del Toro and a team of amazingly skilled artists have created an enduring masterpiece. Watch the making of on Netflix too. Mind boggling!!",

The film in general talks about the war, about the loss of his son Geppetto, and about depression in general. I don't think any child will understand it. The truth is that the film's story is too big to be directed at children, but For adults, it will be very beautiful, because everything will be clear, unlike children, because the drama in the film was too big for a child to see, and the story in general took a big change and became too big for a child to see, but at the end of this film, according to me, it will be more suitable for adults than children.",

The movie is so full of soul which new disney media is missing. Even with multiple movies about the wooden boy, Toro's Pinocchio brings something new to the table talking about life and immortality of Pinocchio. Now in the story we see how Pinocchio's opinion on life changes. Where in the beginning he loves being immortal, as well he will never die. Over the course of time though near the end when geppetto is dying Pinocchio sacrifices himself for his father to live. And you feel the impact, you feel the death of Pinocchio because you feel the connection with the father. When Geppetto accepts who Pinocchio is when he dies DWAGGG. And in a way Pinocchio saved his father from the endless cycle of depression and from drowning, being able to live the life he wanted. Even though they all died at the end :CCC also in the story Pinocchio's opinions and thoughts are always affected by the people around him especially Spazzatura. Which eventually makes him less of a puppet (when he was controlled by EVIL man) and more free, like a free boy? Eh? Anyway. There are multiple other things that are cherished and amazing within the film. But I'm lazy and don't want to talk too much more. AnywayTl;DrI love Mussolini\nvery gud movie 10/10.",

The movie is not just about a puppet whose nose grows when he lies. It is about the delicate and short nature of life and a father trying to cope with the loss of his son. The added depth of Geppetto's relationship with Carlo helped set the tone for the entire film.Allowing Pinocchio to start as a shell of Carlo and a burden to Geppetto is character development at its finest. While it is not the most rewatchable film, it is the best iteration of Pinocchio's tale that I have seen.Best Character: Cricket\nBest Scene: The final afterlife\nBest Quote: \"The one thing that makes life precious, you see, is how brief it is.\" - Death\nBest Song: Ciao Papa\nBest Piece of Score: Carlo's ThemeAdditional Note: How in the world did Netflix release this film and Marmaduke in the same year?

This is also somewhat of a musical and if I have a major complaint, this would be it. The score is good, but the songs themselves are somewhat mediocre. I liked the very last tune the best. I've no idea who Gregory Mann is, but he does a wonderful job voicing Pinocchio as does Ewan McGregor as Cricket who we hear the most.

It had probably become necessary since Robert Zemeckis's \" Pinocchio \" is another movie released in the same year. As a true movie buff I saw both movies. Interestingly while the latter version with Tom Hanks deals with the story in the traditional manner keeping in mind the sensibilities of children and family audiences, the Guillermo version is made on a different perspective ( a reimagination having dark hues, minus the cuteness and innocence of the Hanks version.) I feel that this is basically a family based children's story and it should remain that way with the lovable characters like the cute boy, simple woodcarver father, Jimmy Cricket, blue fairy etc. In the Guillermo version the cute, cuddly, impish boy is replaced with puppet not so cute, the blue fairy is replaced with a \"blue humanoid being with 8 wings\", Pinocchio gets run over by a truck, goes into afterlife, meets death etc etc.The movie is predominantly technology driven and the visual effects are outstanding no doubt but I missed the soul and simplicity of the traditional Hanks version.

The tragedy of war strikes Geppetto's village and cripples his spirit and sets the fantasy in motion. Fast forward twenty years and we are in World War 2 Italy. Geppetto is given a chance to heal his soul and regain his family, courtesy of the very \"Del Torian\" Blue Fairy and thus is born Pinocchio, a version of the little puppet with a demeanor closer to the authors intention for the young lad. The tenets of this film, much like the other cinematic adaptations, and the book, follow key elements: A puppet boy, a despondent carpenter, a talking cricket, magical fairies, and the descent to hell and back with lessons learned. All of this told in the backdrop of World War 2.This traipse through the poignant story and aesthetically pleasing countryside is held solid by the music and songs, both with unique meter and delivery.

Although a parent-child relationship is usually touching to me, here Carlo is presented as solely having mattered within the context of his father's love. A love turned alcoholic obsession.Geppetto becomes genuinely difficult to like from there on out. The only thing he cares about is having an object for his affection, not who that object is at its core. Pinocchio comes along and he wishes over and over that he'd gotten Carlo back instead. He doesn't love his younger son for who he is, he laments who Pinocchio should have been.Although Pinocchio acts soulless and off-putting - fearing consequences nor pain - and inherits Carlo's overly cheery accent; I still felt bad for his situation, because he's an innocent. But I never liked him.The cricket is a bit self-centred but eventually a quite likeable character, but his shtick of being physically crushed over and over and OVER as a way of comedic relief was off-putting to me too.Pinocchio spends a great deal of his time with one unsavoury character after another, trying to be a son his father can be proud of. They eventually end up meeting again inside a disgusting-looking and monstrous fish.Pinocchio sacrifices his life to save his father, and because of that, is finally deemed to be good enough, and worthy of love.His cricket wishes him back to life and he spends years caring for his elderly father, not building any kind of life of his own. His father eventually dies, and the cricket likes to think that Pinocchio was accepted by others, once he travelled out into the world. There's no reason to think this. He's unnatural, cannot age, and can't build a meaningful relationship with another human, unless to care for them until the human dies.There's also heavy war and fascism themes in the story, but I'm not sure why, as they never become fully thematically relevant. They're always in the backdrop, but, any accident could have killed Carlo. Any event could have lead to Candlewick's father dying.The only time the storyline is directly impacted, is when the circus master loses everything thanks to the intervention of a fascist leader, and it allows Candlewick's father to legally draft Pinocchio into a school for fascist youth.There's also a monkey who escapes his abuser by killing him, and only speaks through puppetry. While that might be cathartic to some viewers, I was too distracted by how unappealing I found the monkey.Overall, I think this is a work of art, but not one I enjoyed viewing, and not one whose message I found meaningful or touching. I found it pretty depressing for every character. Which is a very realistic way of looking at life, I'll give the movie that.",

I do enjoy Gepetto and his backstory with his lost son. The cricket had a few laughs, but wasn't given much to do. I prefer the classic 1940 Disney cartoon which works on many levels of film production. This version didn't even have the Pleasure Island sequence or Stromboli.

A commentary on catholicism, fascism in Italy, a story of fathers and sons (oh, but fathers say things they don't mean - we hear this so many times in the movie it becomes bothersome).It starts with a promise of greatness. It follows a story line that necessarily leaves a lot out. Oh yes, if you know the book, this is a screen-written version that must adhere to scriptwriting rules, sometimes too much. The mysterious creatures from beyond are very impressive and bring in the element of transcendence, as in the original written story. The movie starts to fall apart when it needs to bring in a Hollywood-style climax. A sea monster appears out of nowhere, just to suitably provide for a delay in pacing and a roundabout path to a 'glorious meeting of the father and the son' and then even a more glorious escape from the bellows of the beast - oh, well... After about an hour and a half, this felt like a let down.Many, many memorable and just absolutely stunning visuals in this piece. Story-wise, this is limping in the latter parts until it hobbles to its finale. Tries too damn much to be so many things. It can be educational by showing fascist tendencies (I assume this movie is going to do poorly in Italy). It will do well in the category of \"family movies\".

But beyond that, this is a really, really good film.The first impression this film makes is with its animation, and it is spectacular. It is clear that a lot of hard work went into the presentation of this film. Stop motion has come a long way from the days of Rakin Bass. The movement is fluid and the details are intricate, it is something to behold. I would say that this is the most beautiful stop motion animation movie ever, rivaled only by Liaka Studios.The voice acting and music is also top notch, every actor putting in a stellar performance. The movie is a musical and all the songs are pretty good. The first song, \"My Son\" is the best of the bunch.The story takes a lot of clever twists from the original tale. Putting Pinocchio, the string less puppet, in the backdrop of fascist Italy leads to great commentary. Another twist I enjoyed was that the creation of Pinocchio was more of a Frankenstein situation. When Geppetto sees Pinocchio, he is first repulsed at what he had created.The character of Pinocchio is very well done. With his youthful excitement but also naivety. He maintains his optimism without becoming oblivious to reality.There are only a few things that didn't work for me. Some plot points towards the third act, some character decisions that didn't add up. Some decisions feel rushed, or unearned. And there are a few plot holes that can be waved away for fairy tale logic.This very much stands on its own, as its own original telling of the classic fairy tale. But I will compare it to the 1940 classic. With it being like the 2nd animated feature...ever, it will always hold an important place in history, and nothing will take that away from it. I believe the 1940 one has the better moments, stuff like \"Wish upon a Star\" and Pleasure Island. But this film is the more complete package. This film did its best, and that's the very best anyone can do.",

Why does Pinocchio have to have such an obtrusively annoying voice right at the beginning, in the purest British English? Are we not supposed to like him or was there no one else who could have been used here? The question of whether the film is more for children or adults is decided very quickly for me. The music is bad, the songs are worse and come in every conceivable un-moment, nobody can sing either. And the story? Didn't interest me after 15 minutes because I realised I was already playing around on my mobile phone. For me, an overrated work that might even have sunk without the name Del Toro.",

It\u00c2\u00b4s a kids movie but it has so many twisted scenes and ideas to it that it can only be a del Toro movie. It didn't click with me a hundred percent as I see it more as a visual challenge than a good story, but it\u00c2\u00b4s a fun and interesting watch.After losing his son to world war 2, the carpenter Geppetto makes a boy of wood. A wood spirit brings the wooden boy to life and he most now navigate being alive.The animation is absolutely incredible. It took me a few minutes in to really see it was stop motion. The animation is so smooth Nealy all the time and the characters are designed in such a way, it might as well had been an animation style in the traditional ways. The production is incredible here and everything from sets, backgrounds and characters look incredible. This is a technical marvel and so well done.I really love the faded look of this movie. It could have gone for a color popping style and really lean into the kid style but it went for a more laid back color pallet which really helps del Toros style. It looks amazing from start to finish and everything in terms of production is outstanding.The movie is full of incredible voice acting. Nealy every character is voiced believable and fitting for their character. I loved Ron Perlmans performance, David Bradley, Christoph Waltz. I also was surprised how good Finn Wolfhard was as a voice actor and I hope he keeps it up. My favorite performance was Gregory Mann as Pinocchio. It\u00c2\u00b4s a relatively new actor on the scene and he really delivers here. He hit the childhood innocence of Pinocchio perfectly and is a joy to listen to from start to finish. An outstanding performance from an actor that will go far.This is a great twisted version of the classic Disney Pinocchio tale, and it works so well. Del Toro can\u00c2\u00b4t help himself fusing in horror in his media, even when it\u00c2\u00b4s a kids movie like this. The movie has this horror tone and felling to it, while not leaning directly into horror. It\u00c2\u00b4s still a kids movie in my opinion but has thoughts small things. Pinocchio moving creepy in the beginning, the underlying war, the spirits, all has this scary felling to it. But the movie hasn't much story to it. It\u00c2\u00b4s a series of events and a fun take on the original tale. I think it tries too hard to tell you what it\u00c2\u00b4s about in the end and the movie doesn't do a great job of moving to the emotional climax. It\u00c2\u00b4s a bid aimless but still a really fun movie.The musical elements aren't that impressive to me, and I think the movie had been better without. It doesn't add much and only one song doesn't sound like a generic musical song to me \"Ciao papa\".Pinocchio by Guillermo del Toro is a prediction marvel that looks incredible, and it has his style. It\u00c2\u00b4s a different kind of kids movie in an era of safe kids media that dares to go and show dark things. It\u00c2\u00b4s an enjoyable movie and it entertains throughout but doesn't have much substance to it in terms of story. I still enjoyed it though, and can\u00c2\u00b4t wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S PINOCCHIO (C) is another interpretation of the classic story that continues to attract top creators to attempt their own vision. Here we have Guillermo del Toro's take (his name is longer than the title!) and it's a bloated mash of the original story, his own takes on the story, and tones. Look, the stop animation is gorgeous here, but there's no reason this story should take two entire hours. I appreciate del Toro's craft and his love of cinema (yeah, the little nod to James Cagney in Pinocchio's dancing is nice), but he just can't help himself here. The biggest culprit here is del Toro wanting to ground the film in real world history with references to World War 1, Jesus, and the Italian descent into fascism. You just can't throw Christ metaphors into a world where you've made it clear the real spirituality is a pagan mythology of underworlds and wood spirits. I get it, its additional commentary, but how those real world religious and historical elements co-exist in what is (at its heart) a fantasy story about spirits bringing to life a wooden puppet who goes to the afterlife, is an important part of the film. It's a strange juxtaposition and I don't think del Toro pulls it off here. Contrasting father/son relationship between Geppetto/Pinocchio and a Goose-Stepping Fascist and his son who won't shoot Pinocchio (they both won and tied in a game) is certainly a choice - I just don't think it really connects. Del Toro's not alone however, for whatever reason, a lot of creators have crashed their ships on the rocks of Pinocchio. Admittedly, I rarely connect with del Toro projects so perhaps there's just something about our sentimentalities that never match. Still, I think my criticisms here are valid - the core story (which features a fairly unlikeable Pinocchio, despite a chirpy voice performance) is somewhat lost amongst all of the world building, inorganic plotting, and religious/political commentary. The final secular humanist \"whatever happens, happens, then we are gone\" final line is just the nail in the coffin for me in this drab and dreary entry. Like all the other remakes and updates, I'll be surprised if this one is talked about for any more than a few months and everyone goes back to talking about the animated Disney film.",

As one character in his new childrens' film Pinocchio says, \"there are rules, and they must be obeyed\". Decisions have consequences. The characters are in real danger.Del Toro's Pinocchio is inspired by the Disney classic, and there are few plot surprises. When Sebastian J. Cricket is promised a single wish in the first few minutes of the film, we know what it will eventually be used for. It's the world that del Toro builds that makes the film worth watching.Pinocchio's world is brimming with del Toro's distinctive fantasy. Beautifully imagined spirits descended from those in Pan's Labyrinth follow the characters. Scenes in the underworld are, as Pinocchio says at one point, comprised of rabbits, games, stars, and lots of blue sand.The film opens at the foot of a grave, and death and loss haunt the main characters. The setting is Fascist Italy during the second world war. Even with such serious themes, it is not a heavy movie. In Disney style, the characters occasionally break out in song. Young children will probably be oblivious to the way the baddies are not only frustrated, but are doomed to violent ends.Even if it is beautifully rendered, it is, after all, a childrens' film. The characters are thin, and we know who to root for and who to boo from the start. That keeps Pinnochio from real greatness.

The cutesy music and lyrics conflict with the dark themes and some of the images are grotesque--the sea serpent's butt exit? Ending with a quote from Mr. Rogers is sappy to say the least after what we have been shown of the world's cruelty.

            "content": "It's no news that the story of Pinocchio is one of the most adapted stories in the overall cinema oeuvre, it's a pretty compelling story with darker shades that have captivated many throughout the years, that's why it's with great pleasure to see that one of the greatest of cinema, Guillermo del Toro has chosen to adapt this tale into his darker fairytale style. He's already done this with the brilliant Pan's Labyrinth and that movie about D\u00c3\u00ada de los Muertos that I haven't seen yet. However, with the story of Pinocchio I've only ever seen the Disney version (and my only reference on how this story has been done), and despite all the times that I've seen it as a kid it was one of the Disney movies that scared me the most with its elements of body horror and being swallowed alive by a whale monster- how does Guillermo fare in adapting this tale?Pinocchio follows the life of Gepetto, a masterful carpenter in an Italian village with the backdrop of the Italian fascist dictatorship looming over him, after the loss of his son his grief is touched or overheard by a forest spirit that decides to give a puppet that Gepetto did, life to accompany him and be his son.At first glance the story seems to follow the basic story threads and plot of the other Pinocchios however it doesn't, it adds a whole different side to how it is told with a new ending and a different side plot, characters and motive that sheds a whole new light into the story. The most basic element of any Pinocchio story is that of a boy that learns to not lie anymore, however in here Guillermo switches the narrative- rather than a boy learning not to lie it's more about being truthful to oneself and one's own ideals, this is perhaps the most truthful Pinocchio that we've ever got! Don't get me wrong, we do get the whole \"nose grows because of lies\"-thingy but it's used extremely sparingly and only as a plot device for something that happens near the end of the movie. This Pinocchio isn't chastised because of his lies, it's more because he represents the freedom that so many despise, especially in fascist Italy which changes the whole element of this narrative. This was a good choice that Guillermo made but perhaps it's gonna throw off some viewers. I also like that he used the backdrop of fascist era Italy for this story it's almost too perfect!The animation is GORGEOUS, it's made with such care and fluidity- in a cinema landscape where 3D animation is the norm it is a great joy for me to see that directors want to do something in this style- it takes a lot more time but it's worth it! You can see the love that's been given to all of the frames, the character designs, it's truly an artful masterpiece in this manner.The actors are great as well, although there's a bit of a disparity on who gets to have an Italian accent or not, Pinocchio has a very British accent which is alright but it takes away from some of the immersion of the movie (I know this is nitpicky but I think it is worth mentioning). Overall everyone is super good!The music is good, it's fun to see some of the musical numbers, I don't think they take over the movie (sometimes even interrupted by the characters in the movie when it is perceived to be \"annoying\") and they serve the movie well.Despite me loving the movie I think it has a few shortcomings, they don't affect the overall experience but I think they should've been looked into a bit more.The majority of the movie is about Pinocchio rebelling against his surroundings and instilling friendships in those situations, which is a good thing, but the main problem of this is that the relationship between Pinocchio and Gepetto isn't really earned which makes the impact of that ending scene a bit less emotional (in the context of the movie it is super sad and emotional but it's just not earned to be that way due to how Gepetto and Pinocchio act in the majority of the movie). Gepetto starts his relationship with Pinocchio fearing and almost hating him which makes Pinocchio disappear for the rest of the movie into something else, it would've been way more impactful if perhaps Gepetto could've been a part of these escapades that Pinocchio has? That would've made it even more impactful!Considering the ending, I won't spoil it here but it adds some really unnecessary continuity to the story which makes it less impactful (again) it also doesn't tie the plot in some of the aspects of one character that is left in the dust (namely the boy named Candlewick).Another thing that I wish this story would have is perhaps more of Guillermo's signature horror sensibilities, stop motion animation is PERFECT for this type of mashup of genres (see Coraline) and here it does have some unnerving elements but nothing more which is strange considering how amazing Guillermo is at doing this. I honestly think the Disney movie is more scary than this one. I blame this aspect on the marketing and the critics of this film cause they said that this was a bit scary but it isn't really. At least not for me.All in all this is a great movie, it is awesome to see Guillermo expanding his range to other types of filmmaking and it is always amazing to see stop motion animation- despite some plot choices and some lack of edge I think it still stands as one of the greatest adaptations of Pinocchio. Check it out!",

It has much more adult themes than the original (it takes place in Italy during WW2, so there are tons of Nazi's and even Mussolini at one point) and even though it omitted my favorite part of the story (when the bad kids all turn into donkeys) in order to do this, I still think it worked and had a Better message than the original did. Now I will always have a soft spot for the original, Disney Pinocchio movie, but this year's live action remake starring Tom Hanks undid some of that nostalgia for me.

Let's say the director took some creative liberties, but can we still call it that when he basically changed everything about the story, from the beginning to the very end, removing important characters and adding new ones that didn't have anything to do with the original tale as written by Collodi. I'm trying not to give away spoilers but I feel like perhaps it would have been better and less harming if they had just come up with a completely different main character and a completely different name. But then I guess they needed the big name to sell it better?I can't help but think about the recent movie Blonde and the scandal it produced after its premiere, people were outraged, they still are.

This film was directed by Mark Gustafson and Guillermo Del Toro, I am a massive fan of Guillermo Del Toro, the man behind Pacific Rim and The Book of Life, 2 films I adore. The stylistic choice of the actual stop motion animation was brilliant, I thought the use of colors was creative and was impactful on the narrative. The character designs were so very imaginative and detailed, you could see the care that was put into the designs. This film had so many religious, political, and family oriented references, that was so nicely tied together in the ending.I want to start this review by highlighting an aspect of this film, which was the visual aspect, these being the: character design, use of color, and obviously the choice of stop motion, as mentioned before, but something worth mentioning and emphasizing. The stop motion, I believe, was integral to creating that tone, that contrast between the use of animation, being more known to be for kids, and the exploration of religious, political and very intimate themes. A lot of people think that animation is solely for children, which is impossible to think about when franchises such as kung fu panda, how to train your dragon, and maybe even studio Ghibli films like spirited away. However animation is a truly beautiful medium that can replicate the same feelings a live-action film can for all ages, animation can transport the audience to places they couldn't dream of, in ways they couldn't even dream of. The character designs were very refreshing, the most impressive to me being: Pinocchio, Count Volpe, Sebastian J Cricket, as well as Master Geppetto. The use of color was impressive to say the least, especially when I watched an interview where Guillermo Del Toro described that Sebastian J Cricket is blue to represent sadness and grief.The voice acting also was impressive and brought the characters to life, but my favourite performance was the actor who played Count Volpe, the infamous Christoph Waltz.While watching other interviews from Guillermo Del Toro, he said something very interesting, what he wanted to do with this film is instead of making the story about a boy becoming a man, but more about a father with his relationship with his son and Pinocchio. This is something that was so necessary to this film, it was so very touching and it emphasized the errors Master Geppetto made as a father, and something that I think is necessary to films, especially nowadays when visual effects are ever advancing, is that these films are about storytelling, teaching, learning, and experiencing...",

First of all i hate the films where it lacks science or how a cricket can communicate. And from reviews i expected it to be more of a mature and human film. Not against the weird characters but somewhat expecting like moana or that magic story etc. Also one or two weird characters are okay, but the ring master was weird also Pinocchio where the papa has to explain the existence but it was okay maybe. Didn't liked that joker. Also sudden change of events like out of nowhere he went to explore city and started earning, got betrayed, made a monkey friend and escaped. So much in a film that can't be recommended to watch with parents. Suddenly heaven and then his friend and father also dies which was his enemy at first. So many change of scenes.I am only writing this review as it is good to be watched with family or not cuz in turn to you have to explain to them as what is happening in the movie frfr.The events where i cried was when carlo died as well as Pinocchio's mortal death and then the death of father and cricket. The role of cricket didn't seem much of use as it was only for the wish. It would have been better if he would have become his child. Also disobeying son was also a turn off and inspite father searching for him and he roaming. I thought he would take a revenge or something for the war planes which just dropped the bomb. That was their mistake.Also i liked that the writer turned himself into cricket and begged a role in the movie.Also new to this stop motions so felt a lil weird at the animations.So overall it was an emotional and nice film that i cried 2 times, but somewhere it felt childish like no use of cricket's character and kinda sudden change of hearts and plots.",

And considering that pretty much every Pinnochio film is questionable at best (except for the old Disney one) and animated films had been in a bit of a rut, everything seemed to line up for a great experience.But in all honesty, Del Toro's Pinocchio really wasn't anything groundbreaking. It was better than most Pinnochios, but that's not saying much. I appreciate the quality of the stop-motion, but the pacing was questionable, the music was (mostly) awkward, and it was annoyingly juvenile despite its extremely dark themes. By juvenile, I'm not referring to Pinnochio's childishness or lack of understanding; that makes perfect sense for the film. I mean that the writing overall just didn't seem very well thought out. Things just sort of happened, and then someone would start singing a questionably written musical number. It just felt very flat in that regard. Much more thought and effort was clearly put into the aesthetic, and it shows.Guillermo Del Toro's Pinnochio seemed much more interested in being weird and different than actually being a competent story.

            "content": "Probably a good story and great animation but Pinocchio is so annoying that it makes the film unbearable. On top of that, the singing was almost as annoying and gave me a headache. If you removed the singing and toned down the whinging, you would probably have a half decent film. As it was I could only cope with 30 minutes.The best bit was the writer from Moulin Rouge being the narrator using the exact same style, tone and possibly dialogue.The most confusing bit is the number of 10 star reviews and almost zero negative reviews. I had to triple check I was watching the same film.Anyway if you insist on watching it, turn on the subtitles and switch the sound off.",

            "content": "I must preface this review by admitting i am a huge fan of Del Toro. His films exude an otherworldly ambience that leave me wanting more. His darker interpretation of Pinocchio is no different.The stop motion animation is charming and the sets contained within this film are all meticulously prepared. The film is a feast for your senses.The plot is dark without losing its charm, i adored the incorporation of the fairytale into the depths of fascist Italy. There are scenes that genuinely will pull on your heart strings, such as Pinocchio's decision to forego his immortality to save his maker, or the sweet connection he makes with another boy whilst embroiled within the horror of a youth training camp.Pinocchio himself started out as slightly too exuberant but he eventually garnered my empathy as the film waltzed to its finale. Perhaps i wasn't ready for his bold and inquisitive nature after the grounded start the film made when telling Gepetto and Carlo's story. Nevertheless, he won me over.All in all, I've been left with that all too familiar warm feeling after seeing another of Guillhermo's films. I'm sure it wont be too long before i revisit this one again. Any fan or cinema would be making a worthwhile decision to give this one a go.Go see it!",

            "content": "Gepetto is shown early in the movie to be a very skilled wood carver, with a large Christ on the cross for the local church beautifully-done. So why does Pinocchio look as clunky as he does? Well, it all makes sense when you see that Gepetto has been drinking away his sorrow after losing his son, and in a mad fit of drunken desperation, he vows to make a new son -- but of course in his highly inebriated state, the form of this wooden boy is crude and rough.Before stumbling off towards bed, Gepetto mumbles, \"I'll finish you tomorrow.\" But he never gets the chance, as a magical being visits in the night and brings this creation to life.The movie is near perfection in the beginning, as it clearly shows the love and connection that Gepetto had with his \"real\" son, and we feel the tragedy when his young life is suddenly snuffed out.I found Pinocchio's design to be a unique and fascinating choice. But I had issues with his character, and that mostly comes down to the voice acting and direction, which didn't give me any reason to root for him, as he was mostly portrayed as annoying and insensitive. I understand it's a fine line to walk, to make a person who is only a few hours old sound like the are only a few hours old, with the curiosity and joie de vivre that would naturally be a part of that. But Pinocchio the character kept up that annoying personality for too much of the film, I felt.I also had issue with the songs. As musical pieces, they were interesting and complex, and one would expect nothing less, since the music was written by the very talented composer of the score, Alexandre Desplat. But I think this is where a *songwriter* should have stepped in, since songs in a movie like this should be memorable, and have a \"hook\". These were almost too good, too complex, to work as musical numbers. And so I found none of them stuck with me nor struck me in any way.As a film for children, one of course expects a certain level of immaturity here and there, but many times that was taken too far, such as in a command performance for none other than Mussolini, which was filled with fart jokes and assorted bathroom humor. Pinocchio is also a cautionary tale, and I remember the original Disney film being quite scary at times... with a Guillermo del Toro film, I figured we'd get several scary moments, but the scenes which should have been frightening ended up being kiddi-fied and only mildly unnerving.Overall, I applaud what they did here, but there are too many flaws for me to give it a ringing endorsement. Still, there were some very nice moments, and the visuals were quite well done, so I give it 7 out of 10 stars.",

My children are 10 and 11 which I don't know that I'd watch it with children much younger as there are some darker but meaningful scenes. Saying that it is by far our favorite rendition of Pinocchio.

Great choice to use stop motion and bring this unused medium to his own interpretation of this old story, bringing in unique characters and character designs.Pacing is really well done, always keeps the story progressing and the viewer engaged. The highpoints of the film are definitely it's unique inclusion of World War II, which is actually used in the plot and not just shoved in to be \"original\", and the wonderful ending that brings a different change of pace to this story.The only real negative I can name are that it's rating being the only thing holding it back from its maximum potential. Children for sure will be engaged and entertained, and it's understandable that Del Toro stayed in the PG rating in order for it to reach that audience. But the dark themes and unique story leave some viewers wondering what more could have been provided in this wonderful story if only it had a rating of perhaps PG-13.",

Beauty which contrasts dramatically with the weighing matter of the movies setting: Italy in WWII under Mussolini's rule. It goes deep into the war, but still keeps it as one of three major plot lines, which makes it feel less \"about\" the war and keeps the whole plot feel like the setting, and not the plot of the movie somehow. We see pinocchio on both sides of every issue, childhood naivety swaying him every which way. He believes war is fun, then bad, then scary, then not, he delivers propaganda, he denounces it. The way he learns is slow, and almost unnoticeable until the end, when sebastian recounts how it went. You dont realize he learned until HE realizes it yk? When this movie was recommended to me i was told it was a horror. I was excited, but i didnt get what i was hoping for, and im still so pleased.

Not for kids. I wouldn't mind watching it on my own, but this is. It for children. Recommend age I would say is 14 and up.

The beginning of the story caught my attention as it gets emotional but it gets boring at the middle.The character of Pinochio is funny and accurate. Other characters are not bad, but the fact that Geppetto didn't age at all made me more critical. Overall, for kids the movie would be good, for adults it might be a little bit boring.",

His film resists the ideological approach to Pinocchio and penetrates deep into history. Pinocchio comes to life during World War II and is exploited by various tyrannical forces to do whatever they want. To them, being a boy, or a real human in general, means following orders.Del Toro's adaptation breaks down the traditional morality of the story of Pinocchio and pulls out a more complex and beautiful meaning from it. Anyone who says this anime isn't suitable for children doesn't take children seriously as human beings. Del Toro's Pinocchio is a rich, beautiful and thought-provoking animation for all ages and can mean a \"real\", moral, decent and lovable person to everyone.",

            "content": "First the bad things: The film is a semi-musical. As in, while there is a fair amount less of musical numbers than in other movies, there are nonetheless. Also, there is a small amount of toilet humour as well which, while not prevalent throughout the film, is slightly cringe. Also, the voice actor for Pinocchio is annoying at times, and the monkey character is also annoying (plus they both can and cannot speak, it's quite confusing).That's all the bad things; everything else is either good or excellent, and more often outweighs the cons. The story is unique in its own right, and having seen the 1940 film quite a few times, it was an interesting take on the story. The animation was definitely the best part without question, as all stop-motion does seem to amaze me (and I hope you also). The themes, being somewhat mature, are really good as well, showing characters dying, war and other subjects you won't find in a PG film normally. Indeed, at times I wondered wether this was a 12 than a PG, but it is very refreshing to have darker tones, something that the big studios will tend to avoid nowadays. The ending is good, and while could be improved on slightly, was fresh and dark nonetheless.I would say that some in the lower PG category would probably find this a bit scary, and definitely not watchable below, but I can see all ages above enjoying this film to the end. If you're a fan of the original story, or a fan of stop-motion then it is a must watch, but then again you don't need a reason to watch this film, and I strongly recommend watching this film for the experience and the art on your screens.",

So many questionable creative decisions.And that's is just my opinion as a cinema goer, as a teacher of stop motion animation the list of woes goes on. Why were the eyes of the cricket designed without pupils? Has he no soul? What's up with the the timing of the scenes? Most are sluggish and unrhythmical - the scene with the falling axe springs to mind. As I tell my students all the time: use an appropriate pace for the various scenes. An axe will fall fast, but a feather will fall slowly. An angry driver might drive fast, whereas an elderly lady might go more slowly.I am sorry, but I'll rather watch the old Disney movie over this one any day of the week.",

For a film considering itself to be mature, it quickly undermines itself with flat slapstick humour and even a song about farts! - It really begs to question: who is the target audience?!Fundamentally, Pinocchio is an annoying, bratty and selfish character. If the original fairy tale is anything to go by, Pinocchio is a happy, well-to-do child, but his innocence is easily mislead. Pinocchio learns through guidance the difference between right and wrong. However in Guillermo del Toro's version, Pinocchio is immediately stubborn, overbearing and often throws a tantrum when he doesn't get his way. This would have been a unique spin on the character, if not for the fact he is wildly inconsistent. His character switches personality between sweet and naive to stroppy and arrogant instantaneously as if having some sort of bipolar disorder.Cricket is tasked with being Pinocchio's mentor/conscious; much like the original. These characters however spend the whole film apart, thus rendering the task of Cricket giving guidance to Pinocchio pointless - A huge miss-opportunity to develop their relationship! Cricket's character is completely side-lined here and has literally no purpose within this adaptation of the story.The story seems to plod along via a series of convenient circumstances. Set against the backdrop of World War fascist Italy, this is an interesting time period to set the film within, although it feels very tacked on (shoehorn in a joke about Mussolini I'm sure kids will understand). The primary beats of the film, much like the Disney version, is the puppet show and the big climax with the sea creature. The war feels really nothing more than just a side-plot.From a technical standpoint, the animation is excellent and deserves every bit of praise it gets. The look and design of the characters are great... although the overall look is almost too polished, I did question whether or not it was actually stop-motion or CGI to look like stop-motion *shrugs* The films biggest weakness is essentially its clunky story and characters i.e. The most important bits!If I'm going to watch an adaptation of Pinocchio, it might as well be the 1940's Disney animation: A film with more charm, better voice acting, better music (the songs in this version are forgettable!) better moral virtues and a titular character you wouldn't get excited when teased of being set on fire!Ultimately, Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio is an unnecessarily bleak adaptation of the children's story marred by its arrogance of being something both unique and simultaneously derivative. A great film to show your kids if you want them to grow up sad!",
