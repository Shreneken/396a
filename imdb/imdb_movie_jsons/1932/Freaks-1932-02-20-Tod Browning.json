            "content": "Don't let people convince you that \"Freaks\" is a horror movie, because it isn't. It's actually a quite sad and sympathetic look at the way abnormalities were treated in the early part of the 20th century, and has direct parallels to the obsession with physical perfection causing eating disorders today. Tod Browning of course asks us to consider who are the bigger freaks: those with deformed bodies or those with deformed souls? The two \"normal\" people who are out to cheat and steal are monstrous, whereas the freaks are quite likable and charming. The ending is disturbing to be sure, but it's hard to condemn the freaks for acts that seem largely justified.Is it a coincidence that in several shots showing Cleopatra reclining on a sofa, she appears to be deformed herself (in one shot it looks as if she has no legs). Has anybody else noticed this? \"Freaks\" was obviously way ahead of its time. There's a very interesting documentary on the DVD about its reception in 1932; it bombed and pretty much ruined Browning's career. Thank God that the general public is not allowed to be the final arbiter of a film's value. Think how many priceless films we would have lost by now if that were the case.Grade: A",

            "content": "It's interesting to me that this film is viewed as offensive. People say that these people are being made fun of and exploited. I wouldn't like to comment on how they were treat on set or anything but I will say that they all see to enjoying them selfs for the most part and as for being made fun of, I think the total opposite is happening.This movie came out in 1932 so before I watched it I also was nervous that these people would be used to make others laugh at their expense but it was the furthest thing from the truth. This film hands its subject matter with such care and deft that I was astounded that it came out in 1932.It can be like looking at window into the past as sometimes it almost plays like a documentary due to the fact that most of these actors were actually circus performers. There are so many scenes where the performers are just relaxing and chatting to each other. It shows people they are just like us, it doesn't mater if they look different. It shows them doing mundane things like hanging washing, struggling with problems like infidelity. It shows ignorant people that they are human just like you.I think the title \"Freaks\" is interesting. I think there is two ways to look at it. The first way is the obvious and offensive way demeaning the performers but I think by the end of the film the only freaks in this movie are the people who look normal. The movie shows this makeshift family coming together for each other, the only people who are outcasts are the able bodied \"normal people\". I think that is one way to interpret it any way or maybe I am reading into it.That is the interesting thing about this movie. You can read a lot into it and it is never clear what the director was really trying to say as another interesting part is all of the performers are shown to be good people, kind people for the most part friendly and loving. Once again the only truly evil people in this movie are the people who are able bodied people. The reason I lean to the side of the director was showing these people are simply just people is it is framed as shocking and wrong when bad things happen to the performers and I don't think it is ever played for laughs.It also really bothers me that this movie is labelled a horror movie. It is a drama. There isn't really any horror elements to be found.One more thing I just want to point out is that I am astounded how much Ryan Murphy took from this movie for season 4 of American Horror Story. Like I think his only reference point for \"freak shows\" was this movie. Just a stray observation.So I would say definitely watch this movie. It is only short as it was cut down due to the fact people believed it was too outrageous and offensive. It has a lot of heart and is really head of it's time.",

            "content": "`Freaks' is a totally unique and superb film by Tod Browning. He made himself legendary one year before this came out \u0096 in 1931 \u0096 with the all-time horror classic `Dracula'. This film, however, is something completely different and it nearly cost Browning his career. Since Browning had the courage to cast actual deformed actors, the words \u0091distasteful' and \u0091exploitative' were automatically attached to his masterpiece and it remained banned in many countries for too many years. Very unjustified, of course because throughout the whole film, you NEVER feel like a voyeur and neither is the misery of these unfortunate people overly exposed. On the contrary, I'd say\u0085you can't but get deeply affected by these circus freaks. Especially in the 30's, when the people didn't know much about physical anomalies and feared the unknown, I dare to say Tod Browning's `Freaks' could have been an essential social portrait. And keep in mind that Browning's main moral is that the `freaks' show a lot more solidarity and honesty than the `normal' people whose every motivation is driven by greed and power. The plot of this purely gold film is set in a traveling circus in which the freaks and normally formed people work together. The beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover plot a cowardly plan and she uses her beauty to seduce the rich midget named Hans (a brilliant Harry Earless who also starred in Browning's `The Unholy Tree'). When the greedy couple openly insults the group spirit of the freaks and publicly humiliates Hans, an eerie act of vengeance is thought up. This film is over 70 years old and it'll still unquestionably shock and amaze you. To me, it's just perfect. An outstanding mixture of warm-hearted characters, great dialogue and tension. The climax, in which the freaks seal the portentous fate of their enemies, is an immortal piece of pure terror! `Freaks' is one of the most dazzling classics ever made and must be seen by anybody who ever showed any interest in cinema.",

            "content": "A forest glade somewhere in Europe. A warm, sunny day with children playing on the grass. But the camera moves closer and reveals that something is terribly wrong. For these are not children, but tragically misshapen human beings. Pinheads. Dwarfs. A young man with only half a body. A man without arms or legs. These are the Freaks.In 1932, director Tod Browning, fresh from his success with DRACULA, was instructed by Irving Thalberg to top FRANKENSTEIN. He succeeded. The resulting film was considered so ghastly that it was banned in Britain for 30 years. It is the strangest film MGM ever released.Browning wanted to tell a tale of love, greed & revenge set in a circus, most particularly in the sideshow of human anomalies. He scoured Europe & America for the perfect cast. He got them: Violet & Daisy Hilton, the celebrated Siamese twins; dwarf brother & sister Harry & Daisy Earles; Johnny Eck the Half Boy (a good actor, he will remain in your mind a long time); the tragic Josephine Joseph, a hermaphrodite; as well as a human skeleton, armless girls and the female pinheads, among others.While the plot is exploitive & the title tasteless, these people show us glimpses of their hearts, some of the agony of their condition and make us wonder, `What if I'd been born as one of them?'The rest of the cast is made up of MGM stock players Leila Hyams, Wallace Ford, Edward Brophy, Olga Baclanova and the screen's champion stutterer Roscoe Ates.The plot is simple. A beautiful trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money, then plots his murder with her lover, the circus strong man. The subsequent action is both horrifying & strangely satisfying. Various scenes - the Freaks' Banquet, the chase through the storm - are among the most bizarre ever filmed. You won't soon forget the time you spend with the FREAKS.",

            "content": "I really dig 1930s horror movies. There's just something special about them that can never be recreated. A lot of it has to do with the talkies being new territory, many of the directors adapting German Expressionist techniques to Hollywood melodrama, and the freedom allowed before the Hayes Code really kicked in.  Movies like 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride Of Frankenstein', 'Island Of Lost Souls', 'The Invisible Man' and 'White Zombie' are horror classics which still impress today. I wonder whether anyone will be watching the lame horror movies of today in seventy years for any other reason than some cheap laughs? Todd Browning made the transition from silent movies and directed the hugely successful 'Dracula' in 1931. It was a sensation and made Bela Lugosi a horror icon. Browning could pretty much do anything he chose after that. He chose to do 'Freaks'. Great for us as, not so great for him. The movie was universally reviled and even banned in some countries and his career never fully recovered. But 'Freaks' is an extraordinary movie with a lot of heart.  It has faults, sure  - some corny acting at times,  and not so great production values - but it really doesn't matter. I don't know anyone who's seen it who hasn't been deeply affected by it. The reason the movie caused such a negative reaction back in the 1930s was because it used real circus performers including Zip the Pinhead and Radian \"The Living Torso\". Many people found this to be distasteful and exploitative, but the performers seemed to be glad to get the opportunity to work, and the whole crux of the movie is that the \"freaks\" are more decent than the \"normal\" Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) , the trapeze artist who marries little person Hans (Harry Earls) for his money. 'Freaks' is still a very powerful and unique movie. It has inspired many creative people over the years from the Surrealists to The Ramones to Jodorowsky to David Lynch. 'Freaks' comes with my highest recommendation!",

            "review_title": "Very good relatively avant-garde film",
            "content": "Part fictional portrait of a group of circus sideshow performers and part tragic soap opera about their various and complicated relationships, the main story has a midget, Hans (Harry Earles), falling in love with the Amazonian trapeze artist, Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), who feigns affection for him--at first to taunt him and later to use him.Freaks isn't really a horror film, although the horror boom that began in 1931 precipitated Freaks entering production. The script developed out of an earlier one named \"Spurs\" that had been in MGM's possession since the late 1920s. The success of Universal's horror films of 1931 (Dracula and Frankenstein) had studios scrambling to cash in on the trend. Horror films weren't new, of course, but repeated commercial success of horror films released in quick succession was. A number of factors contributed to the phenomenon, including the Great Depression, the lingering cultural impact from World War I, and the advent of sound films. So even though Freaks wasn't exactly horror, and the protagonists weren't exactly monsters, it was close enough. In the early 1930s, the public had not yet been overexposed to media-sensationalized differences in human appearances and behavior. The effect of the film then, in conjunction with memories of real life horrors, including those of war-mangled veterans, offered the emotional reaction that producers and studios are often seeking from horror films.But Freaks is really part tragic drama, part character study, and in many ways it is almost a documentary. The modern attraction to the film comes from a few sources. One, the \"gawking effect\", or the simple fact of watching the freaks in action. Sideshows are an unfortunately dying phenomenon, if they're not already dead (many would say they are), largely because of a combination of medical advances, which often \"cure\" the physical differences that would have made \"victims\" sideshow candidates, and political correctness, which mistakenly sees sideshows as negatively exploitative. It's fascinating watching the different kinds of people in the film and their behavior, including not only their social interactions, but how some of them manage to just get around and perform everyday activities such as eating, lighting a cigarette, and so on. This kind of material takes up at least half of the film's short running time (64 minutes; initially it ran closer to 90 minutes, but 26 minutes of cuts were made (and are now apparently lost) to appease the New York State censor board).Two, this was a lost film, figuratively and almost literally, for quite some time. MGM wanted nothing to do with it. For a while, it had been playing the \"roadshow\" circuit in different cuts, under different titles, such as \"Nature's Mistakes\". The film had been banned in many areas, and at least technically is still banned in some. It eventually appeared on VHS in the 1980s, but until the recent DVD release, it has never been very easy to find in most rental or retail outlets.Three, the most common modern reading of the film--and this was also part of director Tod Browning's intention in making Freaks, even if the average audience member didn't see it this way at first, has it as a Nightbreed (1990)-like turning of the dramatic tables, where the extremely alienated \"monsters\" are the sympathetic protagonists and the ostensibly \"normal\" humans turn out to be the real monsters. For those who like films best where they can identify in some emotional way with the characters, Freaks is particularly attractive to anyone who feels alienated or strongly different, even looked down upon, by \"normal\" society. At various times, and by various people, Freaks has been read as everything from purely exploitative schlock to a socialist parable to a film imbued with odd commentary, metaphors and subtexts about male-female couplings and Oedipal complexes.Freaks isn't a great film in terms of the usual criteria, such as storytelling, exquisite performances, and so on, but it's appropriate that it wouldn't be a masterpiece per the normal criteria--it's not about normal people. The film is certainly valuable as a creative, almost experimental artwork, not to mention as a more or less permanent record of the decayed and almost abandoned artform of sideshows. It's not surprising that not every cast member is an incredible actor--for many roles, there was only one person available who could have fulfilled the character in a particular way, making the stilted delivery of dialogue more excusable. In any event, this is an important film historically, and a joy to watch.",

            "review_title": "definitely not really what I expected; it's actually touching, an ahead-of-its-time fable",
            "content": "Freaks is many things, but boring is not one of them. Tod Browning's film happens to have a certain power to it in that it's actually kind of conventional with its story- a man falls in love with a woman, who wants him (not immediately but soon after finding out) for his money, and when his friends find out they plot revenge against the dastardly woman. It almost reminded me of a fable in a way, like some kind of cautionary tale. But it's definitely not simplistic in the way of what you might expect from 1932 (i.e. 'watch out for these deformed, crazy people who may kill you in the dead of night, etc'). It's the other way around, where the woman, Cleo, and her real lover Hercules, are the 'freaks' of the film, as they lack the real friendship, compassion, understanding and reality of their situation like the other sideshow attractions do. It's Hans who ends up getting duped, but then getting a happy ending, and rightfully so with maybe the most \"normal\" of the bunch, his should-be wife, who also happens to be a dwarf.So in terms of being a 'message' movie, it's actually quite good by sticking very firmly to its one-dimensional guns. It doesn't fool its audience exactly by being something else that it isn't, and Browning's background in silent and horror films is shown in some very memorable scenes. Chiefly of these are the wedding banquet with the milestone of cheerily creepy cinematic moments with the 'ooble-gobble' chant where everything becomes clear. There are also some really horrifying images in the climax when the 'freaks' finally get their payback against Cleo. Now, because of such drama being put alongside such a demented atmosphere, the film lacks a lot of things other conventional films even have. The story, even at only over an hour, takes some time to really get started after some getting-to-know scenes with the bulk of the ensemble. And there are a couple of holes that pop up as well; the end moment where Cleo is revealed in the sideshow, literally having become 'one of them', it's too ridiculous and silly to even think of how it happened.But somehow Browning's film doesn't feel too aged- it's actually one of those superbly shot early talkies, where the images still speak well enough on their own, while the dialog from these (mostly) non-professionals adds more of the emotional impact in the scenes. Once the audience can come to accept what these people are born with or have become (and in this day and age where day time talk show outranks most of what is seen in the film it's not hard to do) it's hard not to dismiss its worth. But if you turn it off after starting to see some of these strange oddities of human nature, you'll be missing the point. This is one hell of a picture that should stand the test of time.",

            "content": "If there ever was a time when film making could get away with producing movies that bordered on blatantly exploitative, the pre-Code 1930s were it. Tod Browning, director of Dracula, went one definitive step further and effectively killed his own career when he took the reigns of directing FREAKS, a project that was turned down by Myrna Loy when offered the lead since she deemed it to be too offensive as it was.She may have been right, but nowadays, FREAKS stands as one of the shortest yet most effective horror movies of all time due to its chilling climactic sequence. The plot's plausibility can be in itself questioned -- where can a circus performer who's a midget have all the money he is said to have in the film is anyone's guess -- but since this is a horror story, and an excellent one, suspension of disbelief allows one to sort of accept what's being explained to us. Hans (Harry Earles), the little performer at the center of this story, rejects equally little person Frieda (Daisy Earles), loves Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), a platinum blonde trapeze artist, herself involved with strongman Hercules (Henry Victor). Eventually, through a series of events, Cleopatra marries Hans for money, but she goes out of her way to humiliate him at the wedding reception, horrified as the other circus \"freaks\" chant \"Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble, we will make you one of us.\" Oh, how dead-serious they are in their eerie chant.When the band of freaks find out she has been poisoning Hans to get his money and that her strongman lover has raped Venus (Leila Hyams), another performer who's always been good to them, they exact a horrific revenge against the both of them, and the last 10 minutes of FREAKS are as gruesome as terrifying.This film was initially received with so much repulsion from audiences that MGM virtually disowned the film. Only until much later has it been re-discovered as a horror classic, and again, while some of the plot elements don't hold water today, the basic story of the abused and disabled taking charge of their own lives and punishing their abusers stands on its own today. That actual disabled people were used as actors only makes it more daring and adds to both the creepiness of the movie's feel and enhances their final moment on screen and only enhances the final ironic reel.",

            "content": "In a side-show circus, where the greatest attractions are malformed people, the gorgeous trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) is the lover of the strong Hercules (Henry Victor). She acts as if she liked the German midget Hans (Harry Earles), who is in love with her, to borrow his money and get expensive gifts he gives to her. When the jealous German midget Frieda (Daisy Earles), who loves Hans, asks Cleopatra to spare Hans from a great deception, she accidentally discloses that he is an heir of a great fortune. Cleo decides to get married with Hans to poison him and get his inheritance. In the wedding feast, Cleopatra openly flirts with Hercules and mocks the side-show performers. When a very ill Hans is saved by a doctor that tells that he has been cruelly poisoned, the other freaks snoops in Hans trailer and they find what Cleopatra is doing with him. In a stormy night, all the freaks join forces and transform Cleopatra in the Feathered Hen. Although not shown in the DVD, which has the commercial alternative conclusion, in the original story Hercules is castrated and becomes a soprano singer.\"Freaks\" is a magnificent movie and characters study of Tod Browning, who uses side-show performers to develop a film originally labeled as \"horror\" genre, but actually a dramatic romance with dark consequences or even a sort of documentary of this type of show with malformed people. What I liked most in this movie, besides the abilities of the \"freaks\", is the fact that two \"normal\" people with beautiful appearances are the real monsters, while most of the \"freaks\" are human beings showing great sentiment. But Tod Browning was careful and did not label all the \"normal\" people as evil, since we see Venus, Phroso and Madame Tetrallini very tender and respectful with the deformed artists. There are many persons that judge people by their clothes, or their external appearance even in the present days, and this movie is a lesson, showing that no matter how these \"freaks\" may look, they are human beings with feelings and able to have a normal productive life. In the extras of the Brazilian DVD, there are many explanations about the origin of this movie, and how MGM decided to produce due to the boom of horror movies originated with the successful \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" and to compete with Universal. However, I would like to highlight that the original ending with Hercules castrated was replaced by a commercial conclusion, and the information that this type of show of exploitation was prohibited in the 40's. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Monstros\" (\"Monsters\")",

            "content": "Those that have seen either 1930's gangster film, \"The Public Enemy\" or \"Little Caesar\" will be familiar with the opening scrawl of the amazing film, \"Freaks.\" In the 1930's it seemed as though the filmmakers had to set up the audience or apologize, in a way, for what they were about to see. The opening, before the title card, explains how \"freaks\" or human oddities have been treated by society. It tells how such deformed people were shunned from society, but, how they have normal thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. This truly is the power of this truly moving, funny, very strange, and ultimately frightening film from the \"Dark Carnival\" mind of director Tod Browning...No reason to do a summary here, that ruins the experience for new audiences to discover on their own and the rest of the reviewers have all ready done a stellar job, I'm sure, of giving plot synopsis. Let's say that the average viewer will be stunned at first by the fact that real deformed dwarfs, midgets,siamese twins, and other \"oddities\" were the actors in this film. And that, in itself, lends the film its mysterious power and casts its spell on the viewer as much now in 2004 as I'm sure it did in the 30's and upon its rediscovery in the 1960's. The tone of this film varies throughout. At it's center really are several relationships: Hans and his fianc\u00e9e; Hans and the \"Big\" Lady, Cleopatra; Frozo the Clown and Venus; Hercules the strong man and Cleopatra, and of course the \"Freaks\" vs. Hercules and Cleopatra and the special code of the Freaks.There are several lame 1930's jokes an example: \"I thinks she likes you, b-b-b-but h-he don't!\" stutters a clown in the circus when the half male/female character walks by Hercules and stops to take a gander. It's a strange, perverse joke and an example of what you're in for with this movie.The power of the film is within the freaks themselves. We are invited to gawk, stare, but, ultimately sympathize with them. We want to see anyone who threatens them get their comeuppance and boy do they ever get that! The freak that will freak you out the most: The Living Torso, Radian.You'll love Frozo and Venus and pull for them throughout.You'll root for Hans and Frida.You'll enjoy Rosco the clown's humorous performance.You'll be truly disturbed by the classic; uber-horror scene of the freaks crawling with knives in the mud in the rain-storm revenge sequence toward the end. Some of the most classic images in all of film not just horror.I love it when Hans calls other \"big\" people in the circus who make him angry : \"Swine!\" He rules. When the title card: THE WEDDING FEAST comes up you too will be truly FREAKED out! I love this movie and it has quickly become one of my favorites of all time right along-side 1930's classics like Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.",

Basically a soap-opera set in a side-show, it is a look into the lives of a group of sideshow performers in a traveling circus.In the beginning of the film, we meet Cleopatra (Baclanova), a beautiful but avaricious trapeze artist who seduces and marries midget circus owner Hans (Earles) to get at his money. At the wedding reception, the close-knit society of freaks welcomes her into the family as \"one of us, one of us.\" Cleopatra is disgusted however by this very thought and tells them she will never be grotesque, while her secret lover, Hercules the strongman, howls with laughter. She humiliates her smitten husband by openly kissing Hercules. After they find out they tried to poison Hans, the group comes up with an idea to take revenge at the beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover.Tod Browning (DRACULA, THE UNHOLY THREE) put his career on the line with the making of this film. MGM, trying to compete with Universal, and cash in on the new appetite for horror films in the early thirties, never knew what hit them with this film. It caused quite a stir and such an amount of negative publicity they decided to virtually disown it and until the '60s it remained practically unseen. The fact that infamous bad film maker Dwain Esper (REEFER MADNESS, MANIAC, see my earlier review), showed the film in road shows and burlesque houses, only enhanced the film's notorious cult reputation. Even today many scour away from seeing this film because of its supposed voyeurism. It might be seen as a very disturbing and ugly film, but at the same time a beautiful and ultimately a moving account of the shortcomings and prejudice of mankind. Most people didn't get it and many thought of it as a new low in Hollywood depravity and were horrified with the film. In truth it's a very warm and humane look at how physically deformed people manage on their own, and a fascinating insight in the world of side-show performers, a milieu Browning (a former \"snake man\" in the circus himself) was very familiar with. Not an outstanding film in terms of cinematic qualities, but because of the completely unique subject matter and the almost documentary like approach to the phenomenon of the side show, whilst using actual freaks, a term that didn't have the same connotation as today. In 1994 the film was selected for the National Film Registry's archive of cinematic treasures. Rightfully so, not only because it's a unique piece of cinema but historically one the very few cinematic accounts left on attitudes towards disabled persons. Even today, the reluctance by most people to even admit this film's very existence, only exemplifies how many misunderstandings about people that are not \"normal\", still exist.The recent DVD-release comes with the excellent documentary \"Freaks: Sideshow Cinema.\"Camera Obscura --- 9/10",

And wouldn't you know it, the \"pinheads\", including \"Schlitze\", the inspiration for The Ramones' mascot who always came out to join the band during their live shows at the end of the Pinhead song, were in FREAKS.The Ramones also slightly modified the \"freak chant\" from the wedding scene, changing \"Gooble-Gobble\" to \"Gabba-Gabba\". I guess Jeffrey Hyman (Joey Ramone) must have viewed himself as somewhat \"freakish\" (he did have an incredible look), and really related to the group of circus curiosities assembled for this film.After being shelved for about three decades, FREAKS started playing again at art-house theaters in the mid-60's, and that's where Joey had to have come across it.As far as my film review, this movie needs to be viewed. Look past the stilted acting, and soak up the message. It will stay with you for a long, long time.",

            "content": "Welcome to FREAKS. Welcome to Tod Browning's world. It is a world populated by pinheads, dwarfs, skeletal men, hermaphrodites, limbless men, and adults trapped in children's bodies. There are no special effects here. No sleight of hand. No camera tricks. No makeup. The actors and actresses portraying the sideshow attractions in this film are all real, amassed from all over the world by an obsessed director who wanted everything to be just perfect for his film. It turned out that he was mistaken: audiences weren't ready for a film this powerful at the time of realise, and it got heavily cut in America and banned in Britain for thirty years.To put it plainly, this is quite simply one of the best horror films ever made. It's essential viewing. A film which humanises the people who were subjected to such cruel deformations, and demonises the cruel, greedy \"normal\" folk who are about as far away from humanity as can be. I loved watching this film. Watching the pinheads dance and play, the torso man light a cigarette using only his mouth, the mirth and glee which these folks manage to express despite their unfortunate conditions. They live, damn it, and they're a role model for the rest of us folks.The plot is a simple one of revenge, which carries the whole film. We know what's coming and yet it still hooks us anyways. The acting is good; although the \"normal\" actors are surpassed in every way by their real-life misshapen scene-stealers. The midgets and malformities come across so flawlessly because they are not acting, merely playing themselves. The pinheads are probably the most endearing of the lot, with their enduring friendliness, I fell in love with them. The subplot involving romance between a good-natured clown and his girlfriend is touching and tender.Everybody remembers the ending of this film, which has the freaks taking revenge on the cruel strongman and his mistress. The act of revenge is only implied, but the build-up is spectacular. The sight of hate-filled victims advancing to enact their revenge is truly unforgettable and a classic moment in horror cinema, one which has been imitated many times but never equalled. The famed \"wedding banquet\" scene is also very good, and imitated almost exactly in THE MUTATIONS. You won't even notice the fact that nothing much really happens, as you'll be so engrossed in a world so different from ours that you'll lose all touch with reality - at least, that's what happened with me. I've said enough. Go and watch this film.",

            "content": "According to this movie, the real freaks of this side show are the normally developed human beings with murder in their heart, and they are to pay for their betrayal of the disfigured and maimed members of this traveling show. As I prepare to re-visit the Broadway musical \"Side Show\" on its opening preview, I went back to see this movie which featured in smaller parts the Hilton Sisters, Daisy and Violet, the Siamese twins who became well known yet lead tragic lives due to their circumstances and the lack of values and compassion of their times. The new production of \"Side Show\" re-enacts the sisters' participation in the making of the movie including the re-creation of the various characters from it, giving it a tie-in to indicate how true the story really was. This story focuses on the dwarf Hans (Harry Earles) who mistakenly believes that the glamorous Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) is in love with him. She's discovered that he has inherited a small fortune and plots with her lover Hercules (Henry Victor) to marry then murder him. When the other \"freaks\" accept Cleopatra as one of their own, she is aghast by their audacity, throwing the celebratory wine in the face of the dwarf dancing on the table in front of her. That dwarf is none other than Angelo Rossitto, who played the side-kick to Bela Lugosi in several Z-grade films of the 1940's and worked well up into the 1980's. Besides the Hilton Sisters, some other real life side show performers allowed themselves to somewhat exploited.Of course, this film really doesn't take off on the horror plane until the conclusion where revenge is bitter and the results are truly a fate worse than death. Shots of the various \"freaks\" throughout the film show them either child-like, content with their situation and basically harmless. Definitely pre-code in nature, this also features a hermaphrodite. \"She likes you\", stutter Roscoe Ates tells one admirer, adding on, \"But he don't.\" When the evil freaks get their come-uppance, the scene turns from light-hearted to stormy with shots of limbless men crawling through the mud with instruments of torture in the mouths and Cleopatra in no position to get away from them, even though she's obviously faster.What is sort of freakish about this movie is the fact that Harry Earles plays the love interest of his real-life sister, Freida. People who see their billing probably assume that in real life, they were married. If you can get past that, you might be able to accept their fictional characters being involved in spite of Cleopatra's interference because the romantic scenes between the two little people is presented very subtly. In its day, the film was considered one of the most grotesque of its time, but today, it comes just off as more disturbing because of the way supposed normal people would get enjoyment out of seeing something outside the realm of what was considered natural. If the film has provided any service, it really makes the viewer wonder what normal really is.",

            "content": "I caught the Hilton Sisters in 1951's \"Chained For Life\" a couple weeks ago, and while researching that film, I was pointed in the direction of Tod Browning's \"Freaks\". I had heard of it before of course, but hadn't realized that the picture dated back to the early 1930's. MGM's Irving Thalberg wished to capitalize on the popularity of horror films of the era, one of which was Browning's year earlier take on the all time classic \"Dracula\". The studio already owned the rights to the short story \"Spurs\" by Tod Robbins on which this movie was based, and had the active interest of Lon Chaney Sr. in bringing the story to film before he died in 1930.It goes beyond saying that this is a picture that won't appeal to everyone, but at the same time I don't think you have to suffer from voyeuristic tendencies to find it gripping. Unless you grew up in the Depression era (and that leaves most of the current population out), you wouldn't ever have seen such a large collection of human anomalies on display in one place at one time. My own experience of growing up in the 1950's allowed me to sample a mere shadow of these holdovers from a prior era at the local county fair, but sadly, they were of the half man/half woman and 'man eating chicken' variety - not 'true freaks' in the sense of the word that the title offers here.Needless to say, the movie became a lightning rod for Hollywood backlash groups when it first came out, who also targeted the sudden popularity of gangster films. Although the picture did well in major cities like New York, MGM didn't want to take it on the financial chin with wide release, and pulled it from their calendar. The picture was actually banned for almost three decades until the counter-culture of the 1960's revived the picture in this country. After all, if you considered yourself a hippie-freak and found all things 'freaky' to your liking, it was inevitable that a picture with the same title would find a new audience.Too many other reviewers on this board have retold the picture's main plot, so instead I'll offer my impressions of the characters. I think I found Johnny Eck the Half Boy to be the most interesting. I couldn't get over how easily he scrambled from place to place, maneuvering stairs and obstacles as easily as you or I can walk on flat ground. I found Prince Randian, the Human Torso to be truly disturbing. I know, I know, I'm trying to be as objective as possible about this, and maybe that's one of the confounding things about being 'normal'. Who's to say that any one of us has the authority to proclaim what's normal? You know, I've seen a wide variety of films in all genres, but I don't think any single one ends as creepily grotesque as the final attack on Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) in one of the picture's final scenes. Under the dark of night and crawling through the mud, the image of a dozen mis-shapen but determined attackers is enough to create a week's worth of nightmares. You have to remind yourself that this isn't modern day CGI or some other kind of trick photography or special effects wizard at work. I'd watch it all over again if I didn't have to get some sleep tonight.",

            "content": "Hans runs a travelling circus, which includes a full array of freaks of nature and, being a midget, he is also part of it. The \"normal\" members of the circus mostly mock their disabled colleagues, apart from one or two of them who are more kindhearted and accepting. The worst of the mockers is trapeze artist Cleo, whom Hans is infatuated with. She plays on his affections to the amusement of others but, when she learns that he has a secret fortune she decides to marry him and get his money for herself.There is no doubt that \"freak shows\" are exploitative and demeaning but I was not sure how to feel about this film at first. The makers must have known that the big draw was going to be the real deformed cast members and in a way to some viewers coming just for this, the film will be just the same as going to see them at the circus. However this is not the fault of the film but rather those that come looking for it because watching the film it is clear which characters we are meant to see as \"monsters\". Although technology and cinema has moved on, I was surprised by how well the film was done and how well it had stood up despite being almost eighty years old.The story sets up the characters and divisions within the circus staff before getting to the meat of the story by the halfway mark whereby Cleo and Hercules decide to extend their mockery of Hans' love into conning him out of his inheritance. In this way the film is very clear that the audience should side with the \"freaks\" of the title and it is easy to do so because, no matter how weird they are, they are shown to be superficially \"ugly\" as opposed to ugly to the core in the way that Cleo is. I wouldn't use the word \"horror\" to describe the story because this implies that the presence of the freaks is \"horrific\" which I do not think is the intension narratively. Whatever genre it is put into though it does have a creepy air due to the actors and this expands upon the tale of exploitation and revenge.The main part of the film for me though is the way we are brought to see past the deformities and care for these people. It happens quickly because of how it is written but also due to the delivery of the cast. Baclanova dominates the film of course as she has a rather hammy character to play up like a true screen villain however there are some smaller turns that are better. I mean this literally because I thought The Earles were excellent: \"Hans\" in his joy and fall from joy but also \"Frieda\" as she convinced me of the pain she was feeling for Hans. Victor is blunt and aggressive as required but I found the presence of Ford and Hyams to be quite dull and unnecessary where really many of the deformed cast could have had expanded roles instead.Freaks is deemed a classic and I suppose it is. The story is not brilliant and if it were not for the hook it may not be as memorable but it the freaks do make it \u0096 not in a sideshow way though. No instead the way the film sides the audience with the \"freaks\" and produces a moral from the dark material. Don't expect to be scary or horrified by it but it is still very much worth seeing.",

            "content": "It is ironic how director Tod Browning followed up \"Dracula\"--a horror film with painterly set design and a distinct atmosphere of unease--with a horror film more grounded in reality. Whereas the sets in \"Dracula\" were as skillfully rendered as the most elaborate of tapestries, the abstraction of \"Freaks\" comes from the title characters, who are at once hideous, wonderful, and all too human. Browning doesn't present these characters--who were actual sideshow performers--in an exploitative manner (though the long disclaimer that precedes the film is a definite reflection of his concern), but instead touches on a humility, modesty, and altruism that makes them as capable of expressing joy, sorrow, and vengeance as any 'normal' human being. And that's the overriding moral of \"Freaks,\" wherein busty trapeze artist Cleopatra marries sensitive midget Hans only so she and her lunkheaded, strongman lover can make off with his inheritance. Granted, this plot has since become clich\u00e9, but to apply it to sideshow performers who are truly in their element 'under the big top' is something of a masterstroke...as it makes the 'normals' seem that much more out-of-place and unwelcome. (A complaint: as some of the dialog is difficult to decipher, it seems that the sound quality was either poorly recorded at the time or when it was transferred to video.)",

The other \"freaks\" find this out, chase her through a forest, and turn her into a avian freak herself, only able to cluck like a chicken.This will raise your hackles because Todd Browning has cast genuine physical anomalies in major parts, including midgets, dwarfs, Siamese twins, microcephalics, and several limbless people -- all demonstrating their freak show skills. The armless lady eats with her toes. The human worm manages to roll and light a cigarette with nothing but his teeth.Our fascination with anomalies probably has a physical basis. I don't want to get into it, but anesthetized chimps arouse horror in their companions. And I've brought home from the vet's office a cat who was still groggy from her total anesthetic and was surprised to find that her litter mates stared wide-eyed at her. One hissed and struck at her. Something is up that we don't know anything about. I wonder if that combination of fear and hostility is in any way related to human attitudes towards those of a different color or set of religious beliefs.Enough of that. Nobody would claim that this movie is expertly performed. The major characters, for the most part, are successfully drawn, but Olga Baclanova overacts outrageously, and many of the freaks can hardly act at all. (Why should they?) In some scenes, they glance at the camera out of the corners of their eyes.The film raises questions of sociology. What, exactly, is solidarity? How is it demonstrated and what effect does it have? We know some of the answers. Group loyalty -- not democracy or Mom's apple pie -- is what keeps soldiers from throwing down their rifles and running like hell. It's an important enough motive that we're willing to give our lives for it. So when the freaks start chanting \"google goggle, we accept you,\" and Olga Baclanova viciously rejects them and refuses to be an honorary member of their minority group, it's like a soldier ripping off his Medal of Honor and throwing it in the general's face.It's all pretty shocking, no matter how you look at it.",

            "content": "Over the years, I've seen \"Freaks\" perhaps four times \u0096 all in theatres and on cinema screens in revivals. I've never seen it on TV, though I imagine it's been shown there.It's fascinating and hypnotically watchable still, not always for the right reasons. Yes, it's exploitive of the \"freaks.\" Yet given their opportunities in 1932, when they were either confined in institutions or exhibited in sideshows all over the world, the film gives them a curious dignity simply by offering them a one-time appearance in a Hollywood film that demanded more of them (some of them) than mere sideshow antics. The script, of course, also gives them \"dignity\" of a kind, at least relative to the prejudices of the times (i.e., \"Don't betray the freaks or they'll turn on you, cut you up, and make you one of them.\").That the film was shocking in its day, and often banned, says far more about audiences of the '30s than the actual film. The only truly powerful sequence is the brilliant \"storm\" sequence that climaxes \"Freaks.\" Emotionally, it is perfectly positioned in the film's structure: audiences inwardly understand and root for the \"freaks\" creeping and slithering through the mud beneath the wagon wheels to exact their revenge . . . while simultaneously being frightened of them and of what's to come. A brilliant and inspired sequence that deserves its legendary status.The remainder of \"Freaks,\" though entirely watchable, is not always watchable for the right reasons, as mentioned.Namely the dialogue and the acting. The structure is fine. But many of the lines are stilted and phony, even for films of that era. None of the \"freaks\" were trained actors. Such careers simply didn't exist in those days. Midget Daisy Earles (as Frieda) does perhaps the best job. Yet even she has no notion (nor experience) of how to sustain a character arc. Her brother, Harry Earles (as Hans), has tremendous vitality in his role, but no idea how to deliver these lines convincingly. Yet he's a good instinctive actor, as witness his silent moments in the film. Olga Baclanova as Cleopatra certainly holds the screen, and is the \"best\" actor in the cast. Hers must have been a difficult task \u0096 playing a completely despicable circus diva with no redeeming value whatsoever. Henry Victor as Hercules? Mediocre.Tod Browning's VISION for this film was / is breathtaking. \"Contrast real physical mutants with 'normal' people, and get the audience to identify with the 'freaks.' Then take them through a murderous, mutilating, emotionally wrenching climax.\" That's a challenge in 2005, much less 73 years ago.Browning's decision to use real \"freaks\" as opposed to made-up actors is noble and brave and true. But so intense were the prejudices of the day that that single decision affected every decision that followed. No \"name\" actor would agree to appear in the cast, citing \"disgust\" and worse. Five writers are credited on IMDb with the script \u0096 always a bad sign. None of the \"freaks\" had any real acting training or careers as actors. Much of the cast were amateurs, in other words, and it shows.Whatever tensions are generated by the story's structure dissipate whenever the lead midgets are on screen. Though Daisy Earles has some intermittent moments of effectiveness, Harry Earles does not. He almost sounds as if he's delivering his lines phonetically.Absent good actors in the lead roles (Baclanova overacts continually, but it works in context with her character), I've often wondered what \"Freaks\" might have been as a silent film.The two great set-pieces (the wedding sequence and the \"storm\" climax) are amazing \u0096 for entirely different reasons.At the wedding, the \"freaks\" are obviously having a grand time \"acting\" for Hollywood's cameras, while Baclanova (convincingly) goes over the top. The sequence is disturbing on more than one level. First, it's impossible to believe that silly \"One of us!\" chant. Yet it's disturbing at the same time it's phony. Possibly it was accepted as \"real\" in 1932, but I doubt it. Second, you have an actress who was reportedly sweet and kind to her co-stars, having to behave abominably with them on camera. How did Browning explain all this to some of his mentally child-like \"freaks?\" Visually, the wedding sequence is nothing out of the ordinary. Emotionally, it is wrenching \u0096 both within the story structure and outside the fiction: this and several other scenes that are blatantly exploitive beg the question, \"How were these people treated? Did they understand what was going on?\"From all reports, the \"freaks\" were treated with respect and appreciation.The \"storm\" climax, on the other hand, is simply stunning cinema. Silent, except for the deafening thunderstorm, it is brilliantly lit, shot and edited. It is also emotionally jolting. Here, finally, the \"freaks\" we have identified and empathized with are reduced to monstrous \"things\" snaking through mud puddles in the dark of night. They're on their way to do God-Knows-What to the \"normals.\" But by now, the audience has realized that the \"normals\" are really the \"freaks,\" and vice versa.That's an amazing level of dual-audience identification and sophistication for 1932 \u0096 or even today.\"Freaks\" is a failed enterprise in many ways. But Tod Browning's VISION of it was so audacious that it continues to stir controversy even now.The ending seems abrupt. Yet what other image could so immediately, efficiently, crystallize the themes of all that's gone before?",

It makes its impact based on the extraordinary camaraderie between the \"freaks\" at a travelling carnival, and the support they show for each other.Director Tod Browning, basing his movie on a story by Tod Robbins, made the bold move of using real sideshow attractions, and it's not surprising that this would bother a movie-going public who only feel comfortable when they can see the zipper on the monsters' costume. Ultimately, this movie is very sympathetic to the plight of freaks, and in the end shows that the so-called \"normal\" people can be the true monsters.A cold hearted, greedy trapeze artist named Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) attaches herself to midget Hans (Harry Earles), letting him shower her with gifts knowing full well that he's got money. Once his comrades realize the true darkness of her personality - especially a wedding party where she expresses disgust at the thought of being like them - they're ripe for revenge, gathering together on a dark and stormy night. (One will never forget the sight of the freaks crawling through the mud towards Cleopatras' lunk headed strongman boy toy Hercules (Henry Victor)).Of course, not all of the \"normal\" characters are evil; Wallace Ford as lively clown Phroso and Leila Hyams as the kind hearted Venus are friends to the freaks. But when Cleopatra and Hercules push the freaks too far, it's all too understandable when the revenge comes. It's a real shame that this film had such a negative effect on Brownings' career. But, fortunately, in the years since its release, loyal audiences have realized its value and have come to regard it as one of the finer horror films of its era.10 out of 10.",

I (and you will, too) read rave after rave reviews of this in review books when I started earnestly collecting movies in the '90s, so I was excited to get a VHS copy of this. Maybe I expected too much. The same will hold true for you, reading websites full of praise for this \"extraordinary\" film.I can guarantee you one thing: it is no \"masterpiece,\" a clich\u00e9 word used in about every film review on the IMDb website. That word is a joke.This isn't a horror movie and it shouldn't be labeled such. It's more like a drama/ commentary on the lives of deformed people almost a hundred years ago. You wouldn't hear the term \"freak\" today but that's how cruel and ignorant people were in \"the old days.\"Perhaps seeing this on DVD would enhance my viewing pleasure. The tape I watched it on was poor and I hard time understanding one of the main characters. The movie still shocks today because how many of us ever see people with tiny heads or no limbs? It's sad to see. It's worse when you have some idiot being nasty to these people, but it was only a film.Still, your heart goes out to these \"freaks\" and the story certainly gets you involved with their plight, although they aren't \"saints,\" either. The attempt at humor in here is weak, too, and very dated.It would be interesting to see someone like David Lynch, who did \"Elephant Man,\" do a re- make of this film. I'll bet he'd make this much better.I only warn those who have never seen it: the film is okay but not as fantastic as you will expect after reading all these glowing reports.",

            "content": "These older gems have to be watched with eyes on two levels.The first concerns the experience within the narrative. Projects that worked well in this regard when new often fade. Those that continue to work as the context changes get called \"classics\" as if that were a special honor. This doesn't work well for me and I presume it didn't for most in its day.In that day, I suppose it to be much like today's \"9 Songs\" with which I saw this. The strangeness of what we see so overwhelms the story that we cannot get engaged in the story itself, quite apart from the wooden acting.But the other level... on that level this is so delicious that I've put this on my list of films that every cineliterate person must experience. That's the level where someone originates some cinematic notion which sticks to the ribbon of what follows and changes it. Watching something like that carries with it everything you have seen that was subsequently made using or adopting or reacting against or decidedly avoiding that notion.Tod Browning was the first I think to take physical outcasts and display their reality as though it were fiction. Before and after, we had lessor adventures in class, race, sex, gayness, colonialists and so on. But this is so profound that even today it stands apart.Lynch's first real feature deliberately quotes this. Many filmmakers have since entered the space of deviated reality imported unchanged as fiction.What makes this particularly sweet is that Browning himself entered film through the circus. He literally ran away and became \"one of them.\" So in this, we have both his personal past folded in and the echo of thousands of films afterward.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",

It's Tod Browning's amazing direction - possibly his greatest effort - that makes the film so frightening. The wedding feast is one of the great set pieces in film history.

            "content": "I recently saw a TV reality program whose purpose was to teach women with physical issues to accept their body by posing naked. I don't know if it worked but I bet many TV viewers watched the show out of pure voyeurism. After all, we're so used of watching beautiful women in bikinis that our eyes would be more interested to catch the ugly, the fat or the hirsute one, not because we're aesthetically attracted but because it comforts our idea of belonging to the norm.This vulgar and patronizing show proved me that TV reality programs are today's equivalent of yesterday's sideshows, if not in the content, at least in the celebration of the difference for pure voyeuristic and narcissistic reasons. Of course, the participants are not physically abnormal; they're just outside the aesthetics norms enough to be labeled so. And last week's episode was about a little woman (shorter than 5'0) who was coached by a sort of queer-like-folk looking expert. At the end, she supposedly overcame her low self-esteem by flashing her naked body on stage. It lasted one second, everybody (including her parents) cheered in the audience, but it was a disturbing sight because she looked like a child, and it felt like she was forced to deny her difference.I'm not saying that being too short, or too fat, or too 'something' is a disgrace, but on the other hand, I can't accept the fallacious idea that we're all physically equal. Diversity exists, and our so-called modern societies are providing blatant cases of patronizing manipulations when they make people believe that they're 'normal' when they're not. I'm sorry but this little woman will never appear in Vogue's cover, no one will cast an ugly woman as a lead unless it serves the plot. As Todd Browning's \"Freaks\" opened with in its scrolling disclaimer: \"The love of beauty is a deep-seated urge which dates back to the beginning of civilization\". And the fact that we like to watch 'freaks' or 'abnormal people', whether on sideshows, or today in TV reality is still for the love of beauty because it does satisfy our natural narcissistic tendencies by reconciling us with our own self-esteem.\"Freaks\" is many steps ahead of today's hypocritical and condescending mentalities. Yes, it's not politically correct, but it's true to the inner nature of human civilization. Even after 80 years, Todd Browning's masterpiece is still intelligent and significant, and RESPECTFUL because even the Freaks are aware of their differences: they don't want to be treated with respect as if they were normal, but with respect even if they are not normal, for being abnormal is not a disgrace, not a doom, it's the builder of their identity, of their awareness of the world, negating it is not just hypocritical but offensive. While today, the major consensus would ask us to look at them as 'normal' people, the true and thought-provoking aspect of Freaks is to invite us to look at them as physically different people BUT people, human beings with true feelings.Still, we're inevitably startled at the first sight of the sideshow circus freaks featured in the film. On that level, the film is almost an all-star cast: Harry and Daisy Earles, brother and sisters playing the two little Hans and Frieda, Schlitze the most scene-stealing of the three pinheads, two armless women, Prince Randian, commonly known as the torso man, a bird-lady, Johnny Eck, the half-man, a bearded lady, a skeleton man, Daisy and Violet Hudson, the cute Siamese twins\u0085 the casting is impressive and displays the widest range of physical abnormalities we'd find, even in a real circus. But the accomplishment of \"Freaks\" is less to create a sideshow within the sideshow but to immerse us in this show business' underworld. One would call it, exploitation, but as said in the DVD extras, isn't show business about exploiting people anyway. At least they could make a decent living without being ashamed of it.Feelings are governed by our vision of the world, vision is commanded by our perceptions, and perceptions are guided by our human condition. So, we can't dissociate feelings from physical conditions. When a beautiful trapeze artist is in love with a chubby doll-like dwarf who inherited a fortune, it doesn't take a genius to understand the manipulation. And \"Freaks\" is less about the stereotypical inner beauty, but more about the inner ugliness of people, conveyed by the two antagonists: Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) and Hercules (Henry Victor) and most of all, the way they'll get their comeuppance. Their punishments are foreshadowed in the pivotal wedding feast when Rossitto fills a huge loving cup of champagne while everybody chants \"Gobble! Gobble! One of us!\" \"We accept her! We accept her!\" Cleo is accepted because she married Hans, and realizes the ugly reality of being among the freaks. Her hostile reaction crystallizes all what the freaks fought for during their whole life.Yes, it's one thing to be mocked at, but only when it's part of a show, and because it's the only decent way to make a living, but to openly display the pride of not being like 'them' is the greater offense. And the only punishment for someone who doesn't want to be \"one of them\" is to become one. On that level, I don't understand why in my DVD, the film didn't end with the sight of the beautiful Cleo turned into a woman-duck but went on with Frieda and Hans embracing. This was out-of-place and let down the shocking value of the last scene, perfect for a 'horror' film. The original ending was perfect and extremely horrifying; Cleo's squawk would haunt me for a long time.And if anyone thinks that it depicts the freaks as true monsters. I want to say that it most highlights the inner horror of humanity, and at least they proved that they could be as cruel and vengeful as 'normal' people.",

The \"freaks\" have accepted their limitations and have adapted to them , the feeling of belonging to a community , minimize suffering for the deformed nature of these people, who come together in solidarity when one of them suffers an attack. A circus' beautiful trapeze artist agrees to marry the leader of side-show performers, but his deformed friends discover she is only marrying him for his inheritance . From the time \"Cleopatra\",(Olga Blacanova ,Myrna Loy, originally slated for the trapeze star role , turned down the part because she felt the script was offensive) a beautiful contortionist, tries to seduce by all means be provided with money, which lays out a plan with the circus strongman, \"Hercules\" (Henry Victor , the original casting had Victor McLaglen ). Later on , there takes place the wedding banquet that will transform the existence of \"Cleopatra\" and \"Hercules \" a torment.Probably the main film of the lover of the grotesque and mutilation , horror maestro Tod Browning . And along with \"Dracula\" , \u00a8The unknown\u00a8 and \u00a8The mark of vampire\u00a8 , were his best-known film . At just 16 years Browning ran away and joined a carnival with human phenomena (freaks) suffering from malformations . From his experience with them, Tod Browning created one of the most disturbing and riveting melodramas of film history . It's largely filmed on documentary style which is particularly accentuated in the sequences that show scenes of everyday life \"freaks\" . Tod Browning master of illusion, delights us with some camera tricks that make us surprising and fascinating . Ahead his time Tod Browning left us a work where monsters do not seem to be the \"freaks\u00a8.\"Freaks\" also titled \u00a8Natural's mistakes\u00a8 is a special film , fascinating and unusually poetic . It's an exceptional and unique masterpiece. At the premiere was voted as one of \"The 25 Most Dangerous Movies\" and severely cut and banned in several countries and England for 30 years. The film was withdrawn and shelved by MGM, but the distribution rights were acquired by notorious exploitation roadshow specialist .During the 1930s, a photographer took a succession of group photographs of members of the Barnum and Bailey freak show ,what is interesting is how many cast members and familiar faces can be spotted in them ,this film is the only movie credit for most of them . The on-screen romance between Hans and Frieda was very subdued because the roles were being played by real life brother and sister Harry Earles and Daisy Earles . Some reissue prints are missing brief epilogue , the film's original ending showed Hercules singing soprano in Madame Tetralini's new sideshow because he has been castrated by the freaks , after intensely negative reaction by preview audiences, this scene was cut.",

However, after the other freaks in the circus discover that Cleopatra only married Hans for his inheritance as well as is having an affair with cruel strongman Hercules (a perfectly hateful performance by Henry Victor), they decide to exact a harsh revenge.The key triumph of Tod Browning's controversial masterpiece is how Browning sees the humanity and fierce loyalty in a group of unique individuals who are commonly perceived as monstrous and grotesque. Indeed, Browning treats the titular malformed characters with great respect and compassion. Moreover, Browning offers a flavorsome evocation of the circus milieu, wisely avoids crude sensationalism in favor of absorbing melodrama (although the conclusion does qualify as truly nightmare inducing horror fodder), and even further spices things up with a wickedly funny sense of perverse humor. The thoughtful script by Willis Goldbeck and Leon Gordon makes a powerful and provocative central point on how physical beauty can't compensate for a gross lack of decency and morality. The fine acting rates as another major asset: Leila Hyams makes an appealing impression as the sweet Venus, Wallace Ford brings lots of charm and energy to his colorful role as jolly smartaleck clown Phroso, Roscoe Ates contributes an amusing turn as the stuttering Roscoe, and Daisy Earles does fine and touching work as Hans's concerned girlfriend Frieda. The brutal climax packs a startling punch, with the ultimate fate of Cleopatra in particular proving to be extremely ironic and disturbing. Kudos are also in order for Merritt B. Gerstad's crisp black and white cinematography. Worthy of its classic status.",

''Freaks '' tells the story of a beautiful trapeze artist named Cleopatra, who starts a relationship with a a sideshow midget named Hans. The problem is that she is only interested in his money, since he is very rich, and when the other Freaks discover that she tried to poison him, they go after revenge.The nicer thing about this movie and that people are forgetting to pay attention, are the concepts of inner and outer beauty, since in this movie all the ones considered ''freaks'', are the only ones who are really good people, while the real 'monsters' are two of the normal members of the Circus, Cleopatra and Hercules.Ps: I am surprised to see that the actor who played Hans and the actress who played Frieda are in fact brother and sister.

When it was originally screened for the studio people were horrified at what Browning had turned in and they cut the film down to just sixty-two minutes. Even worse is that it really put one of the final nails in Browning's career as people just weren't ready for a movie like this. Even when viewed today the film remains a somewhat troubling picture with some very disturbing images.I think Browning was in love with the \"freaks\" on display here and I've always felt that the movie had a very simple message and that's the fact that these circus performers might not look normal but they were in fact humans. The message of FREAKS is certainly meant to tell normal people that they shouldn't make fun or harm people just because they are different. This here really gives the film a fresh view and the ending, which I won't ruin, is quite intense as the freak decide to get their revenge. How everything plays out is quite chilling.It also doesn't hurt that you've actually got an experienced and excellent cast here. Earles had already appeared in several Browning films and he does just fine here. You've got Daisy Earles who manages to show real emotion in the role of Frieda and then there's Roscoe Ates, Wallace Ford, Leila Hyams and Daisy and Violet Hilton who are all good. The supporting cast are all wonderful here as Browning spends a lot of time letting the viewer get to know them while wrapping around the story of Earles and Baclanova.The film works partially as a documentary on the circus life but there's no doubt that the finale turns into a horror movie.

It has been praised and damned, and was so hated by the boss of the studio that produced it that he had his company's trademark removed from the credits and sold it to an independent distributor. It was banned in England for thirty years. \nThe movie's director, Tod Browning, was best known for a series of highly popular macabre melodramas he had made with silent picture star Lon Chaney in the twenties. Just prior to making Freaks he had made Dracula, with Bela Lugosi. As the result of the controversy surrounding Freaks his career was ruined. He was allowed to make a few more films, but none did well; and his career's momentum, which had been strong in the early thirties, was soon lost. For all intents and purposes Browning gambled his reputation on this one movie, and he lost, badly.Freaks concerns life in a circus that features a particularly large side show of freaks: pinheads, a bearded lady, midgets, an armless and legless man, and so forth. The story revolves around the efforts of a beautiful 'normal' woman, known as Cleopatra, to woo and wed a midget she knows to be worth a good deal of money. This woman has a lover, Hercules, the circus strong man, and together they plot against the hapless little fellow, who is quite smitten with her. Cleopatra hates her tiny husband and plans to poison him for her inheritance. The midget becomes quite ill from a lethal drink she gives him; however, by this time the other freaks are onto her. As their little friend ails in bed they extract a terrible vengeance for what was done to their comrade. The bare bones of the story make the film sound better than it is. By no means is Freaks a bad film, but it moves like molasses, and is for the most part badly acted. Its ideas are better than its images. This surely is not the fault of the freaks themselves, who are the best thing about the picture. Despite their appearance they are an engaging lot. In this respect the movie succeeds. We come to like the freaks and care what happens to them. The ideas behind the film are exciting to think about. Normal people are indeed often hateful; and the suffering and crippled souls among us seem far worthier. Beauty has a cruelty about it. But the vehicle that carries these and the other messages that Browning put forth is, sadly, inadequate, and not up to the task.Yet I highly recommend this film. For all its faults it is, at its best, a powerful and original work. That it deals with the entertainment world cannot but raise the issue of the movie being perhaps a criticism of Hollywood and the studio system, which may also be why it was so despised within the industry. It is a guilty pleasure if ever there was one, but it is, in the end, more interesting to talk about and look back on than to actually experience.",

Just the subject matter of it made me intensely uncomfortable, and I didn't want to have that feeling of being party to a crime by being a willing spectator to it, as a lot of horrible exploitation flicks have made me feel.Well, I was wrong to avoid it, it turns out. The movie was disastrous for great director Tod Browning (of the most famous version of \"Dracula\" fame). It might be one of the most widely banned movies of all time, and is indeed still technically banned in some parts of America.All the complainers missed the point. \"Freaks\", unfortunately named as it is, comes down heavily on the side of the side-show people it is believed to exploit. You never get the sense that we are supposed to gawk at them. I was not surprised to find that Browning himself was a circus performer, a contortionist who some might just as well have labelled a \"freak\". The movie puts us in their world. In fact, it feels as though we are invited to marvel at how well those differently abled are allowed to live; observe the scene where the man who is a quadruple amputee lights a cigarette, and the ease with which the \"half boy\" gets around. The \"normal\" people are the outsiders, and the bad guys, whose exploitation of the little people turns psychopathic when they realise how much money might be involved.The final, amazing end sequence, with the performers gathering in a rain storm for revenge, was unfortunately cut in the version I saw, but the final shot of what happens to the villainess is still shocking, as is much of the material, all the more so because you know what you're seeing is real.

            "content": "Freaks (1932) might just be Tod Browning's weirdest and most original film of all. It meant a return to his favorite milieu: the circus, which he had depicted for several times, in The Unknown (1927), starring Lon Chaney, for instance. The story of Freaks is rather simple and, maybe exactly because of that, very powerful: a beautiful aerialist Cleopatra notices that a midget, called Hans, has grown a strong infatuation for her. After hearing of Hans' vast inheritance, Cleopatra together with her boyfriend Hercules decide to fool Hans in order to get the money. Hans' wife and other sideshow performers of the circus dislike this and make a scheme to put an end to Cleopatra's cruelty once and for all.Back in the day, the film was not well received at all and was, in fact, banned in several countries. This era, which approximately lasted from the mid-20's to 1933, is actually known as the golden age of Hollywood genre film but also as the pre-code era. During The Great Depression, film production was marginal but nonetheless great and unique films were made and new genres formed, such as musical, gangster film, screwball comedy and, of course, horror. Obviously people had made horror movies earlier as well but it was now when it found its true form: its essential conventions and structural elements. Browning's Dracula (1931) and Whale's Frankenstein (1931) started it all but, to my mind, it was really Freaks that showed what the genre was capable of: to describe agony, terror and violence in an allegorical manner.On one level, Freaks reflects the American society very well but, what is more, it works best on another level: depicting the gloomy morale of the time. It questions our conception of normality; and even naturalness. It studies the existing ideas of beauty and ugliness in our society; the relation between inner and external features. At its heart, it is all about the abnormality of morality: we are frightened, just as we usually are in horror movies, but in a different way. Just as the audience of the prologue, we are afraid of what we see. However, we don't fear the deformed, but ourselves because, well, couldn't we all be Cleopatra or Hercules? We are frightened by the morale of the people; not by the outward appearance of them, but by their inner; moral monstrousness.Browning's approach to the 'freaks' is purely empathetic and never demeaning. He lands down to their height and observes them, not as greater human beings, but as a greater society: Browning truly relays a vision of a collective community where, just like the Siamese twins, people share everything; grief and joy; love and pain. The film doesn't only question our conception of normality and abnormality, but our morality. It asks us who are the real freaks. For, in the midst of the \"freaks\", there is one \"normal\" animal tamer. In the result of that one comes to the conclusion that it is truly the moral of man which defines his normality or abnormality.",

            "content": "saw this 25 years ago very late at night/very early one morning on Channel 4 which felt the need to warn the audience that \"Some viewers may find this film disturbing\" . Hmmm a film made in 1932 by Tod Browning who made the 1931 version of Dracula which gave the impression I was watching a slow paced theater play had made a film that was supposedly disturbing in the last decade of the 20th Century ? I had the distinct feeling that FREAKS would instantly send someone to sleep and it was the nightmares they were having during this catnap that disturbed them rather than the film's content . I decided to watch it anyway and after the ending I was actually quite shocked as to what I'd been watching . Its reputation had been well earned and wasn't in the least bit surprised that this movie had been banned in Britain until the 1950s and Channel 4 felt the need to broadcast it with a warning . This is genuinely , creepy and a disturbing film and the fact it was made so many decades ago adds to its impact rather than lessens it The film opens with a quick potted written history of how humanity has treated the afflicted through the millennia . They are constant outsiders of humanity down to humanity's conditioning but to be honest - and I hope no one picks me up here - there's probably biological reasons why human beings have an instinctive dislike for the physically unlike and it's all down to a species contributing to the gene pool . There's also an unfortunate turn of phrase used in the caption and it refers to the afflicted as \"Blunders of nature\" and if you think that's slightly offensive I'm pretty sure the term used in the original Channel 4 broadcast was \"Atrocities of nature\" . If you think that term is stomach churning just remember that the Nazis hadn't even come to power for another years and when they did their first victims were the handicapped . Before long they were kicking out of Germany people with non Aryan names and when the war was in full swing they were murdering millions of inhabitants of Poland and the Soviet Union on the grounds of \"racial hygiene\" , Nonsense of course and murderous nonsense at that but you have to look at history with an amoral eye and despite its politically incorrect stance in many ways FREAKS is a rather liberal film compared to what came immediately later and who have to meet it on its own terms The story itself is no great shakes and has a premise along the lines of a crime thriller with some gold digger and her fancy man hatch a plan to seduce a man for his money and once the money is in the gold digger's bank it's time to get rid of the man permanently . If nothing else the tagline sums up the film with \" Can a full grown woman truly love a MIDGET ?\" . The whole is elevated to an entirely different level due to it being set in a circus and how the afflicted are portrayed , Again you have to meet FREAKS on its terms as to when it was made but it's a film that shows the able bodied good , looking people as the real monsters and it's a unique horror film that will stay in your memory forever",

            "content": "\"Freaks\" is a 1932 film from director Tod Browning that focuses on the physically deformed/ disabled performers of a circus sideshow, ranging from limbless men to bearded ladies, and armless women to Siamese twins. All the performers of the sideshow are both mentally and physically abused by the ringleaders of the show - a man and his glamorous trapeze-artist lover, Olga, who toys with the \"freaks\" and treats them as second-class citizens (the central event here is the madame's deception toward a midget man named Hans)... that is until she pulls her last prank and the \"freaks\" decide to take revenge.Now hailed as a cult classic, \"Freaks\" plays on the scenario of the minority versus the majority, and the goods and evils of each side (in this film, the \"normal\" people are the evildoers, whereas the physically different yet good-hearted \"freaks\" are the morals). It's a fairly common theme, but never has it been used in this sort of way, and not to mention this film came about in the early stages of cinema, so it was one of the first to do this. \"Freaks\" is a strange little film, running only slightly over an hour long, that I'm not even sure I'd technically refer to as a horror film. The revenge theme and the final ten minutes, however, do have traces of horror in them and I believe that's why this has been classified in this genre. Generally speaking, though, this is a hard movie to place under any particular category.Most famed for its use of actual sideshow \"freaks\" as actors, the performances here are actually pretty impressive when taking this into account. The acting is believable enough and I was consistently intrigued by the movie. The audience sympathizes easily with the tormented sideshow performers, despite their physical deformities. There is a warm heartedness to them and the message behind it is important, and this will be in your head even as they maliciously crawl toward Olga and Hercules in the final act of the film. There is little to no shock value in this movie by today's standards, although this was cutting-edge stuff back in 1932. The physical appearances of the \"freaks\" aren't disturbing particularly, although their presence at the end of the movie is pretty creepy, I'll admit. The conclusion is still mildly disturbing today, so I can only imagine people's reactions to this movie in the 1930s.Overall, \"Freaks\" is a very different movie, and a very atypical \"horror film\" in the sense that it doesn't really contain the general elements of the genre, besides in the final stages of the movie. Nonetheless, the characters and story are fascinating and quite engaging. I can see why this has evolved into a cult classic over the years - it was groundbreaking for its time (also disturbing), but also very different in its subject matter. Worth seeing, because there's really no other film out there like it. It may not scare you, but you have to admit, the final act is a little spooky, and the characters and their development leading up to it are fascinating. 9/10.",

Besides FREAKS (1932), I've also changed my opinion on THE UNKNOWN (1927) - and, actually, this happened first with MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (1935), by which I was sorely disappointed on first viewing! However, and this may come as a shock to you, I've always loved Dracula (1931); maybe it was Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\", heard during the opening titles, which set me off in a receptive mood...As for FREAKS, I think that the film is more interesting for what it tries to do than for what it actually accomplishes: to begin with, one cannot expect much 'acting' from the 'freaks', so their presence in the film could never conceivably rise above mere 'exploitation'; frankly, I'm more intrigued by the 'normal' actors' reaction to the 'freaks': the blatant contempt displayed by Olga Baclanova and Henry Victor's characters towards them, for instance, is powerful stuff even today - and I'm surprised Browning got away with it; Wallace Ford and Leila Hyams' characters, of course, prove to be their perfect antithesis but, curiously enough, we don't really root for them because of their compassion for the 'freaks' but because they can now be seen to be typical 'heroes' of the Depression era - independent souls who are at once strong-willed and naively optimistic.Regarding the by-now legendary missing footage, I guess we're better off without it (although, naturally, I would still love to watch it someday) as it probably would have been an even greater intrusion on the main plot but would, doubtless, not have improved the film in any significant way.",

When she and her secret lover, strongman Hercules (Henry Victor), learn that Hans has inherited a fortune, they devise a plot to get their greedy mitts on all of the money: Cleopatra marries Hans and proceeds to poison him. The little fellow's sideshow friends discover what is happening and seek revenge.With a troupe of genuine physically and mentally disabled circus performers playing the 'freaks', Browning's film feels like something of a sideshow exhibit itself, curiosity definitely being one of the film's major attractions. Fortunately, the director makes his sideshow characters extremely likable, and his antagonists so despicable, that one doesn't find it hard to choose sides. By the time that Cleopatra has started to spoon poison into Hans on a regular basis, and Hercules attempts to silence suspicious circus beauty Venus (Leila Hyams), you'll be urging the freaks on to even the score.The final nightmarish scene in which the freaks crawl through the rain and mud to reach their prey is a particularly masterful piece of horror cinema, still able to send a chill up the spine even after all of these years.",

These are real side-show \"freaks\" and no matter how disturbing, using anything less would have produced a real travesty. Of course, watching this array of human deformity takes some getting used to-- the pin-heads, the human torso, the truncated man, the human toothpick, the dwarfs, and all the others. But once you get past the revulsion, there's fascination, then compassion, and finally (I think) normal acceptance. They are, after all, as human as the rest of us, and it's to Browning's everlasting credit that he leads us through such stages without pity or condescension. The real monsters, of course, are the two pretty people who show their inner deformity by abusing these human unfortunates.Not everything, however, is praiseworthy. Trapeze artist Baclanova and her strongman overact shamelessly. Their hammed up gestures almost bring down the entire proceedings, and I can't help wondering why Browning let them get so out of hand. Also, chronic stutterer Roscoe Ates, whose speech problem is not really so funny when you think about it, is put to dubious effect as comic relief. But these are small potatoes when contrasted with the unique overall effect.What really surprises me is that this movie curiosity comes from the unlikeliest of sources, Louis B. Mayer's MGM. This so-called Tiffany of studios always prided itself on pretty people, big rooms, and wholesome entertainment. No wonder they pulled the film and stripped off their logo after seeing the on-screen result. This is a long, long way from Andy Hardy and Carverville, USA. I gather it was Irving Thallberg, head of production, who pushed the project over Mayer's objections. Perhaps it was the precarious state of his own health that gave him the compassionate drive necessary to complete such a dubious oddity.

When it came out in its original 90 minute form (which has unfortunately been lost forever) the movie was considered so disgusting and distasteful that it was banned. With a title like \"Freaks\", it seemed to be a unanimous opinion that it was trying to degrade and dehumanize those born with disabilities. One newspaper even wrote that \"it took a weak mind to create it and it takes a strong stomach to look at it.\" Luckily, decades after its release, public opinion has mostly shifted, and this movie is now considered one of the greatest, for a few different reasons. The film's plot concerns itself with a bunch of sideshow performers called freaks who were all actual deformed people that just happened to be born that way, such as two sisters stuck together (who share the same blood circulation), a man with no legs, and even one with no arms or legs. The one that is typically considered the main character is Hans, played by Harry Earles. One day, a girl named Cleopatra attempts to seduce him, but what he doesn't realize is that she is a conniving scoundrel who only wants him for his large inheritance. Later, when the two are actually married, the other freaks sing a disturbing chant which Cleopatra misinterprets as them wanting to turn her into one of them. She becomes disgusted and no longer wants to be bothered with any of them. The film's climax is without a doubt one of the most haunting and disturbing things ever put to a motion picture, and even 90 years later it still holds up; the lack of music just enhancing the eerie falling sound of the rain as the freaks prepare to punish Cleopatra for her deeds. It's a movie that wants the viewer to contemplate a certain question in their mind: Which is worse? The person with a deformed body, or a deformed soul? It never got the recognition it deserved when it came out, but that has now changed. It's an amazing movie, but only has one flaw. It was ahead of its time.",

As legend has it, Tod Browning, fresh off the massive success of \"Dracula\", was asked by Irving Thalberg to top it. Well, he achieved that goal, though it practically killed his career.Based on Tod Robbins's short story \"Spurs\", the movie uses actual circus performers for the bulk of its cast. The story concerns a beautiful trapeze artist who uses her charms to trick a midget into marrying her. He doesn't realize that she's only after his money, though his fellow performers are suspicious and loath to let one of their own be taken advantage of.Since most of the cast is comprised of non-actors it's no surprise that acting is not the film's strong suit. That being said, some of the so-called 'freaks' acquit themselves well, especially Daisy Earles as Frieda. The amazing thing is that these actual circus performers were cast in the first place. As for the rest of the actors, they're competent but unremarkable.Tod Browning's direction is pretty decent but the film shows some of the effects of being butchered in the editing room. That being said, the story is rather slight, so those excised scenes may have been a blessing in disguise. I have to admit that the movie seemed a bit overlong even at just 64 minutes.I'm a bit torn about rating this film as high as I did. On one hand, the acting, editing & script leave much to be desired but on the other hand the movie undeniably contains some memorable material while treating its subject matter with a surprising degree of respect.

If a similar scenario (say, a group of non-freakish circus performers who gang up on a newly arrived gold-digger who upsets the camaraderie of their tribe) had been cast with \"normal\" human beings it would have come and gone with minor praise for some interesting cinematography.The imagery harks back to the silent era. When an inter-title (\"The Wedding Feast\") appears one can't help wondering if this film might have worked better a few years earlier as a late-period silent with elaborate musical scoring and sound effects. The feast itself has been accurately described as \"bizarre\" by many viewers. A dwarf dances awkwardly on a banquet table to an audience of fellow freaks chanting \"one of us, one of us!\" as Cleopatra, the beautiful but heartless trapeze artist (Olga Baclanova) gulps champagne and repeatedly bursts into explosive guffaws. The dialog is so crude and ridiculous one wonders if it wasn't improvised on the spot. Baclanova overacts shamelessly throughout this sequence.Harry and Daisy Earles alternately move and embarrass us as a midget couple torn apart by Cleopatra's intrigues. Daisy manages to be heartbreakingly sincere but simultaneously wooden. The scene of Madame Tetrallini supervising the micro-cephalics (\"pinheads\") at a picnic in the forest is deeply touching. The \"human torso\" (Rardion) is perhaps the most mind-boggling to behold, like a plump, stocking-sheathed caterpillar with a human head stuck on.Ultimately it's a story about humanity, bonding, comradeship. The fear comes from the uncomfortable empathy we experience at the sight of those born without legs or arms or fully developed brains or common gender characteristics. We imagine how we would feel if we too had been born that way. Through most of the film it is painful for us to gaze upon these individuals whose mere appearance is drama in itself. The melodramatic scenario that is imposed on them seems unnecessary. But the climax works, even if the coda with the Earles is stilted. I think this film encourages us to love or at least respect one another as humans. A very simple message which, appearing at the dawn of the Holocaust when people like the ones depicted here were routinely exterminated by the Nazis, takes on new meaning for the contemporary viewer.",

This can be seen in two ways: a real freak show (which is very, very disturbing) or an investigation into human character. I like to think that Tod Browning was striving for the bigger picture, but sometimes its not so obvious. The real-life freak show actors were definitely fascinating, but not much was done to create sympathy at the individual level. Rather, the freaks are represented as a varied group that works together to get things done. While this is effective in some ways, it didn't let the viewer surpass the barrier between seeing it on screen and understanding how it feels.The subject matter is successful in bringing some deep messages about human character. The film is unique in that it does not try to hide anything. The freaks are not meant to be liked right away; although possibly pitied. But as the film progresses, the contrast between the \"normal\" people (Hercules and Cleopatra) with the collection of freaks builds up. When the marriage between Cleopatra and the midget occurs, the freaks are aware that its a plot. The is meant to define the freaks as the good guys, but the conclusion returns to a dark theme.Freaks is one of those films that was fascinating but disturbing at the same time. It is unlikely that there will ever be a movie similar to Freaks. Tod Browning took a risk that impacted the rest of his career with this film.

            "content": "Although, it was chosen for inclusion in the National Film Registry in 1994 and is considered by many to be a classic by many; 1931's Freaks still can makes some people feel uncomfortable, watching it. After all, a horror film about killer sideshow performers will indeed, raise some eyebrows even in today's extreme world. Some people still feel, that it is a horrific exploitation film. It can be certainly be argued that, since the film does somewhat invites audiences to gawk at, and eventually fear, the so-called \"freaks\" of the title. However, others audience members see it, as a mostly sympathetic portrayal. After all, the one-dimensional villains, strong-man Hercules (Henry Victor) & Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) was indeed conspiring to murder one of the freaks, in order to steal his large inheritance. In my opinion, the sideshows revenge plot was somewhat justified, because of that. Although, I agree with the sympathetic people; I still have to say, there are somethings about the film that still can be criticize. Not everything in this film was perfect. One is the notorious bad-acting from both the real-life sideshow performers, and the actors chosen to play the villains. The dialogue was really hard to heard, due to the thin German & Russian accents, some of the actors, had. Other times, the dialogue was some badly written, that it just doesn't sound natural, coming out of a performer's mouth. Although, director Todd Browning and his uncredited screenwriters offer frequent reminders of the sideshow performers' humanity, there were tons of parts in the film, where, the sideshow performers were looked down, upon, as children, rather than real-life adults. Other times, the camera somewhat linger, for a little too long. While, the 'slice of life' sequences, were somewhat entertaining, and does help expose, who these supporting characters, are. Plus, I understand, that director Tod Browning had previously worked as a contortionist in a traveling circus, but what does showing a long sequence in which a performer use her feet to do everyday activities, in an almost ballerina style grace, have to do with the main plot? Nothing. It really doesn't help, force the main story, along, at all. It felt like padding. Despite that, I still would had love to see the original now-lost 90 minute version, rather than the 64 minutes movie, we got, instead. Much of the violent sequences of the freaks attacking the villains was removed. Not only that, but a number of comedy sequences and most of the film's original epilogue was also cut from the film, due to executive meddling. Instead, a new prologue featuring a carnival barker was added, as well, as the new epilogue featuring the reconciliation of the tiny lovers, despite the fact, that the happy ending, doesn't work; as it come across as jarring and out of place. After all, how does a circus performer at that time, honestly, makes that much money? I never heard of millionaire midgets, before. Plus, it's disturbing to think, that they got back together, seeing how both of the actors, playing Hans (Harry Earles) & Frieda (Daisy Earles) were indeed brother and sister in real-life. Despite that, I do like, the fact, that they did cast real people with deformities as the eponymous sideshow \"freaks\", rather than using costumes and makeup on conventional actors. However, it's a bit disheartening to hear, that the sideshow actors, were banned from the MGM commissary due to complaints from other actors. Not only that, but were getting underpaid, compare to the normal actors for the same amount of time. Despite that, I like how 'Freaks' does seeks to unseat its audience's expectations and challenge their biases in a way. At the time, that was pretty daring for any major Hollywood released to a movie like this. Even today, some studios wouldn't even dare, go the lengths that this film does. For that, I have to give MGM, some props for that. It's just sad that this movie bomb at the box office for being too offensive. It even supposedly, cause an audience member to have a miscarriage. It got even worst, as the film was then sold off to exploitative, second-rate distributors in 1947 who truncated it, toured it and renamed with altered names like 'Nature's Mistakes', 'Forbidden Love' & 'The Monster Show'. Only to have it, then banned in the UK & parts of the US for the next thirty years after those releases. It's also sad, that this film, pretty much, ruin Tod Browning's film career. Yes, he did directed a few more films through 1939; however, he never had the success, as he had, before, making 'Freaks'. Was it, worth it for Browning? Yes, indeed, in my opinion. One gets an even stronger sense of Browning's likely motivations and intentions with this movie, when one read the source material, in which, this film was based on. Author Tod Robbins' strange and brutal short story \"Spurs.\", presents all of the characters, more monstrous and selfish than Browning's version. Another thing, while Robbins' story goes for broad comedy and more making fun of the disability, Browning's more sensitive adaptation finds something pointed and tragic instead. It's shows that Browning honestly care about, making this film, and it shows Overall: Browning's film powerfully grapples with the cruelty that people are capable of inflicting, when they fail to recognize someone else's humanity. That, rather than sensational exploitation, is why this movie continues to endure. It's a good movie to watch, but not a perfect film like some modern viewers think it is. Still, it's worth watching.",

            "content": "FREAKS is one of those historical rarities that merits attention on several levels. Yes, its subject matter is sensational, but I think it stands fairly well as an example of early talkies, too.While I was aware of the notoriety of this film for some time, I was not aware of its pedigree. One might think the film might have been thrown together as some kind of exploitative quickie, but its production involved Hollywood legends like Lon Cheney Sr (it was originally conceived as a vehicle for him) and Irving Thalberg.The film was mired in controversy from the beginning, and this adds to the fascination. Many, many edits were demanded from the studio, particularly after test screenings (the DVD shows a few different edits of the ending in its nice little documentary). Apparently, about 30 minutes wound up being cut, and I can't help but think that if an original cut could somehow be found it would uncover a significant piece of cinematic history.While the story is pure melodrama, and not terribly important, the \"freaks\" themselves (they did not see the word as a pejorative term, by the way) are fascinating in their complete normalcy. The film treats them quite affectionately, with only a few scenes that could be considered gratuitous.Another fascinating element of FREAKS is as an artifact of its time. The sound is awkward, because director Tod Browning still hadn't mastered talkies (a Hollywood veteran of dozens of films, Browning would only make three more films after FREAKS). Sideshows no longer exist, so the film gives a glimpse into a world that could never be duplicated.I regard FREAKS quite fondly, which might seem an odd emotion, but it's a neat little gem of a film.",

They decide to exact some revenge for turning on one of them.Unforgettable comes straight to mind when describing this misunderstood talkie horror piece by director Todd Browning. He went out on a limb and took a chance, that didn't pay off for him. It simply pushed the boundaries and truly did horrify for its audience. But further along the track the film has found its place in history and has become a well-deserving cult classic amongst fans. Emotions run high and the unsettling nature of this dark Gothic melodrama is achieved by it authenticity and frankness on what you could have called a taboo topic when released.The story is simple, but fascinating. Thanks to the way Browning decided to go about his material, there's a nice mixture between the ripe bunch of personalities and it's hard not to be infatuated by these abnormal people (who are one close knit group) going about their everyday tasks. Browning shapes it, that no one is given a squeaky clean sheet to work off. The normal folks might be more ugly and monstrous in their intentions compared to their looks, but that doesn't stop the little tale showing that we are all the same when it comes to letting your emotions take hold. The first half of the film builds the amusing interplay, but it's the significant second half when powerful images struck a nightmarish and compassionate chord.The direction is ambitiously bold and a rather tasteful depiction and restraint by Browning. The performances aren't too bad, with some notable stilted turns, but this raw aspect only enhanced the genuine style and beautiful touch that has weaved its way into the feature.A vividly told story that's touchingly engaging because of respectable direction.",

            "content": "Freaks (1932)Tod Browning moved to MGM for this heartwrenching and bizarre movie, a completely one-of-a-kind drama using a range of real circus sideshow \"freaks.\" Watching it with 1930s eyes you can see several things: an echo of the real freakish injuries a lot of WWI veterans carried with them causing them to be outcasts on their return, a grotesquerie like visiting an actual sideshow, and an extension of the blockbuster Dracula and Frankenstein successes at Universal the year before. Even so, this is a brave movie. Some would say it is insensitive, and it does use people simply because of their very real deformities. I'm sure some people will have trouble, even today, watching it sympathetically. But make no doubt, this is a movie whose sympathies, along with the audience's, are for those with all the unusual deformities. The real freaks are the handful of people who have no deformity. They are the outcasts, and the wild ending to the movie proves a kind of animal justice that you go along with.The ending is not the one shot by Browning, and it makes guilt and intentions clear to the viewer in a way even the pre-1934 code demanded. Even so, many states objected to portions of the movie, and about thirty minutes was removed, all of it lost, making the feature just an hour long. And even though I cringe at censors chopping up movies, this one seems long enough as is, a compact narrative.As you might expect, with so many amateur actors, there is a stiffness throughout, partly compensated for by sincerity, and by vivid camera-work. But it's strangely affecting, too, especially the main midget couple, who fight for a normalcy we take for granted. Or do we? Ultimately this is about being accepted by whoever is around you, and you realize how much of that depends on perception.",

            "content": "Right after making the highly successful \"Dracula\" (inaugurating the golden age of Universal Studio's horror films) in 1931, director Tod Browning found himself able to do whatever project he wanted to do. So after finishing the melodrama \"Iron Man\", Browning chose to do a risky but very personal project that his long time friend, Harry Earles (popular sideshow performer Harry Doll) brought to him: \"Freaks\". Based on a story by Tod Robbins (who also wrote Browning's silent classic \"The Unholy Three\"), the movie would become one of the most controversial films ever and unfairly cost Browning his career, showcasing that the audience of its time was not ready to answer the question of the tag-line: \"Can a full grown woman truly love a MIDGET?\"\"Freaks\" tells the story of Hans (Harry Earles), a dwarf performer at a sideshow who is hopelessly in love with the Circus' beautiful trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). At first she just plays with his feelings, but after discovering Hans' secret fortune, she and her lover Hercules the Strong Man (Henry Victor) plan to get the money by having Cleopatra marry Hans and then get rid of him by poisoning. Frieda (Daisy Earles), Hans former fiance\u00e9 discovers this, and it may not be too late for them to be judged by the \"Code of the Freaks\".The film's most notorious asset is without a doubt its use of real sideshow performers playing basically themselves instead of hiring actors with make-up to play the characters. The image of real \"freaks\" on screen proved to be too shocking for the audience and thus was labeled as \"exploitative\" and \"disturbing\", concepts far from true as Browning's intentions were to portray them with the dignity and respect they deserved as Browning himself (as well as Earles) had been previously a circus performer too. His knowledge of the trade as well as his casting choices enhanced the film's realistic portrait, moving away from his stagy style and the expressionist visuals of his horror films.At its core, the plot is quite simple but it was revolutionary in its time. Sadly, the movie suffered 30 minutes of cuts that left only the basic plot outline and some of the \"less-horrific\" sequences. While this drastic change doesn't hurt severely the film, this tragedy leaves us with a mutilated masterpiece that showed Browning at his peak finally growing out of his silent stage. Unlike his previous talkies (that seemed to be crafted in the manner of silent films), here Browning was completely free and wild, at a level superior even to his silent films with Lon Chaney. A shame that the poor results of this misunderstood masterpiece had truncated the career of a very promising filmmaker.The acting is for the most part good considering that half of the cast were people with no real training. Harry Earles is excellent as Hans, although his heavy German accent can be hard to understand at times. Daisy Earles is less fortunate, as she was very uncomfortable at playing his own brother's love interest. Olga Baclalova is great as the femme fatal Cleopatra although Henry Victor is quite bad as Hercules, giving a poor performance even when compared to cast members with no acting education. Wallace Ford and Leila Hyams are Phroso and Venus, the only \"normal\" people who love the \"freaks\" and is comfortable with them. Both actors are very effective, with Ford remarkably stealing most of his scenes in the film.The film has an uneven pace, at times with a nice slow rhythm broken by the awful cuts done by the studio taking out many scenes from the middle part (and one scene of the ending). Despite this mutilation, Browning's message remains the same and while probably preachy, time has sadly proved that it's still an important affair that needs to be seen and understood in this days where morbid curiosity has mutated into equally morbid \"political correctness\".\"Freaks\" is a favorite film of mine, not only because it shows a simple yet classic story of forbidden love and betrayal, but also because it is a testament of the tragedy of a misunderstood artist whose promising career was unfairly crippled. We'll never know if Browning's talent really could grew out of the silent era, but even with 30 minutes of its runtime cut, this film shows that odds are that he could. 9/10",

We see the armless, legless, and completely limbless. We see conjoined twins, a 'human skeleton', and microcephalics (so-called 'pinheads'). We see a 'bird girl' and a 'stork woman' (who we find out later had Virchow-Seckel syndrome). And we see some of the more conventional carnival acts: a bearded lady, a half-man/half-woman, a fire-eater, and a sword-swallower. We never see them performing in front of an audience; instead all of the action in the film is behind the scenes, and the effect is humanizing. We see life from their perspective, and that they face the same relationship issues that the rest of society face. We watch the film perhaps voyeuristically because of the deformities and differences, but it's to Browning's credit that they are shown sympathetically. A caretaker for a group which includes the three microcephalics chides a couple of guys who react in horror, pointing out they're just children who are playing in the sun. A little person (Harry Earles) points out that most 'big people' laugh at him, because \"they don't realize that I'm a man with the same feelings they have.\" It's telling that the real 'freaks' in the story are two \"normal people\", a trapeze artist (Olga Baclanova) and her strong-man boyfriend (Henry Victor), who play on Earles' emotions, and then plot to kill him for his money. There are several truly memorable scenes, starting with Prince Randian, \"The Human Torso\", an armless and legless performer in a tight one-piece garment making him appear like a caterpillar, manipulating a cigarette and a matchbox with ease, and fluidly giving himself a light. Another is when the performers are all drinking at a wedding and chanting \"One of us, one of us, Gooble gobble, Gooble gobble, We accept her, we accept her, One of us, one of us\" riotously, until Baclanova erupts in disgust and calls them all freaks. The look of hurt in their eyes, and shame in Earles' face is heart-rending. However, nothing can top the circus performers crawling through the mud, with revenge in their eyes. The extended sequence that this led to was so disturbing that the film's 90 minute run-time had to get cut down to just 64, and it's a real shame that the original is lost.

Yet it is a brave effort for the following reasons:1. An imaginative soundtrack with hardly any music. 2. Usage of real deformed persons as actors. 3. A storyline that often comes very close to a documentary. 4. Sympathy and empathy evoked at different levels from (a) viewers (b) characters that are not deformed for those deformed and (c) characters that are deformed for those who are whole.Evidently the film had been made to end at different points for different versions. Each ending can evoke a dramatically different feeling in the viewer. In the version I saw the dramatic end (voices of two deformed characters in love) without the lovers appearing in front of the camera was an astute one. The ambiguity of that shot can make you wonder if the film's ending is the antithesis of the typical Hollywood love-story ending of two lovers riding out into the setting sun...

No wonder studio bosses L.B Mayer and Irving Thalberg inserted a moralizing extended prologue into the film and basically disowned it on release. Todd Browning's Pre-Code 'Freaks' could NEVER be re-made in our modern PC-fixated society. It is a bold, shocking, repulsive, tragic horror film that commands attention and close study.The most shocking thing is that the principle cast members, the 'Freaks' tainted with deformities, are all REAL. They aren't simply actors playing the parts. Yes, we are viewing real-life Siamese twins, midgets, a human torso and a skeleton man. Yes, they are people with real emotion and souls. 'Freaks' was banned on first release in the U.K and many North American countries due to the graphically repulsive impact it had on audiences. Viewing it today, one still feels squeamish at the sadness and horror of these botched people's plight. We are let into the everyday lives and challenges of these 'sideshow freaks', and it is a painful experience.The acting and many of the scenes are stilted (it probably would have worked better as a silent- it is an early talkie with primitive dialogue and use of sound), yet 'Freaks' is still startling. Only Browning could have dared to make this one. He takes a fairly conventional 'rich-infatuated-man-ditches-nice-girl-fiance-for- beautiful-temptress-who-wants-to-cheat-him-out-of-his-money-with-her- slimy-lover' situation and dares to subvert it by placing the story into a circus 'freakshow' setting. Baclanova, as Cleopatra, is a beautiful femme fatale trapeze artist who is captivating yet absolutely repulsive. Henry Victor as her lover Hercules is a horrible, sexual brute. Hans and Frieda are sympathetic engaged midgets (they were brother and sister in real life), and Phroso and Venus are two genuinely good people. A fascinating scenario, indeed.This film questions our treatment of people who do not fit the beauty 'ideal' and examines the bonds that physically-distorted humans are compelled to make with each other against an unaccepting society. The chanting scene 'One of us, One Of Us' at Hans and Cleopatra's sham wedding is the most chilling in the entire movie. Cleopatra feels the wrath of the 'freaks' she has so openly ridiculed when she is transformed into 'One of them' at the film's finale. The final ten minutes is shockingly brilliant as the freaks await their attack on Cleo on a dark, stormy night. The message seems to say to be careful of your treatment/judgment of minority groups- the wheel may just be turned against you one day with horrifying results.'Freaks' is frightening, disturbing, imperfect and fascinating.8/10.",

What possesses a man to make such a film, or people to star in it, or a studio to finance it... this is a great question. How does one get an audience to see such a film? Surely the more curious among us will want to see what tortured bodies look like, and how Mother Nature can deal a cruel hand to some. But beyond that, where is the appeal? The sad truth of this film is that it's not particularly great. It has an enjoyable camp feeling, and will always remain notorious for its casting. But the acting is simply not good, with only the most narrow of exceptions. And the story is thin, focusing mostly on a midget who falls in love with a \"big\" woman, much to the dismay of his midget betrothed.This film may be a must-see for its unusualness, and certainly it will appeal to horror fans, though not really a horror film itself. Certain horror historians and ambassadors (notably the great Aaron Christensen) include it as one of the hundred horror films you must see. I'm inclined to agree.

The tall trapeze woman takes a shine on him after discovering he stands to inherit some money. She hopes to marry and then eventually poison him. When the other little people find out, they plot revenge. While the fate of the tall woman lends this film some horror elements, this seems mainly to be a melodrama about a gold digger trying to get away with murder only with a little person as the victim. Fascinating to watch so many \"freaks\" getting along and having fun with some regular-looking people in a spirit of community. While not a masterpiece, Freaks is certainly worth a look for its non-judgmental attitude toward people who look different from \"conventional\" folks.",

            "content": "\"Freaks\" is so shockingly grotesque that the 1932 film was shelved for some 30 years until its genius was discovered by critics and film lovers. -- Many of the characters are actual circus side-show performers. The story centers around a young dwarf couple (Hans and Gretchen) whose happiness is disturbed when a beautiful \"normal\" member of the troupe sets her eyes on Hans' fortune. She schemes to steal him away from Gretchen, then do away with him to keep the money for herself. When the plan is discovered, the \"freaks\" deal with the situation in their own way (not revealed until the final scene!)This film is a powerful commentary on our society. The countless \"outcasts\" who seem invisible in the light of our lives of plenty need not be in the isolation our society forces them into. In 1932 audiences were not ready for such a message. Today (and for some time) \"Freaks\" has gained cult status. This is a very unusual film, nonetheless a classic! Recommended to film enthusiasts!",

I never saw it again --very seldom I'll see a movie twice-- but its characters are branded in my mind. I always wandered if nowadays a movie like this one could be made and cause the same impression on the viewers. Or if a movie like this will be allowed to be made...The \"Freaks\" of this story could be translated into today social panorama when looking at social minorities (\"Freaks\" to some) trying to get their legitimate place under the sun. We haven't advanced too much in that respect... have we?Is it possible that we'll never learn? no matter how much suffering, humiliation, pain, inflicted on minorities, people in general continue to rejoice in putting down \"Freaks\" of our present (so called) civilized times. Could that be the way these frustrated individuals compensate for the lack of enjoyment and truthfulness they have within their misguided (and oppressed by religion) personal lives?Somebody very well informed said in his comment that 26 minutes were cut from the film in order to appease the censorship at the time and that may be the reason why this film looks a bit jolting and abrupt.

I think it the first time when i heard about it. But, when you really watch it, you understand it, and you change that opinion that you have before of witness it, and, at the same time, you find one of the most necessary films ever, for a world full of vanity, intolerance and materialism.Tod Browing (\"Dracula\" with Bela Lugosi and \"The Devil Dolls\" with Lionel Barrymore\") direct one of the most polemic movies of the 30s ever. M-G-M don't expect something that the movie was to shock so hard in its audience. Was banned in certain number of countries, and then, its become in one of the most important movies ever. Although I don't believe that it has a lot to do with the horror genre. \"Freaks\" told us the story of a circus, where is the beautiful Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova, who acts in Paul Leni's \"The Man Who Laughs\" and is excellent as the villain in this two famous and lovely movies) who has two pretenders. One of them, is the big, muscular and arrogant Hercules, the other is Hans, a midget. She is decide with Hans, but only because he has inherited a great fortune. She with Hercules are decided o kill him and take away all the money. But the friends of Hans has fall in counts of the evil plan. This won't to stay this way. \"Freaks\" is spectacular in every way. Its message is beautiful and clear, the performances and its characters are definitely unforgettable (Harry Earles, Daisy Earles, Olga Baclanova, Henry Victor and Wallace Ford with Leila Hayms who was magnificent in its roles too. But certainly all the cast is excellent).\"Freaks\" its just lovely and thrilling. Every second makes it a real masterpiece and its will never age. I hope that people of this time watch movies like this, that make us understand who are the real freaks in this world. How we must be tolerant. How you cannot form a rule of a perfect human being. How we must accept the differences. But no, the human been of yesterday, today and (regrettably) tomorrow don't accept to a person with a different skin color, different race, different origin. People don't accept to a different religion or an homosexual person. And we discriminate against them in a tremendous way.So... who are the freaks now?*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",

When Cleopatra starts poisoning Hans to get at his inheritance, his friends dish out their own brand of justice.Tod's Browning classic horror film is actually more of a drama until the final ten minutes or so. I would imagine it was considered horrifying back at the time due to the use of people with real deformities, which was probably pretty shocking. That's a sticking point for some today, as you'll see when you read some reviews that are full of self-righteous indignation. The characters are interesting and the actors are good. The use of real sideshow freaks was ingenious. Obviously you aren't likely to see that today in anything mainstream. Little people Harry and Daisy Earles give the best performances.

Shot in 1932 it was one of the prime examples that triggered the strict enforcement of the U.S. Motion Picture Production Code, a moral censorship authority, which would put an end to abhorrence and sexual innuendo shown on screen, or at least intended to. Tod Browning's \"Freaks\" still revelled in unvarnished exploitation and used deformed sideshow attractions as heroes in his film - a kind of exploitation that is for one so real and raw and at the same time bizarre, that it constitutes a far cry from fantasy horror \u00e0 la \"Frankenstein\" or Browning's own \"Dracula\" and resulted in a veritable shock and awe reaction at the audience of its time.\"Freaks\" is famous for its unique cast consisting of a living torso, Siamese twins, a bearded lady, childlike pinheads, midgets and various others born with handicaps. All of these are shown however with compassion, as people among people, who are just abnormal because they were born that way. The monsters of this horror film are those that try to exploit them for what they are. This fact of course is a trap into which Browning unintentionally stumbled himself by making this controversial film and by letting the freaks have their monstrous revenge in its climax. \"Freaks\" isn't perfect, but it is a commendable effort. It has actors who play themselves and what they are, brought on the set by Browning himself. As a man with a circus history, he knew these lives and that they are human beings as well. Often misunderstood, \"Freaks\" is something else than distasteful exploitation, it's a compassionate picture about those that feel like we do, and innovatively real at that.",

Cleopatra becomes involved with circus strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), when they learn that Hans has inherited a fortune Cleopatra & Hercules devise a plan where she will marry Hans & slowly poison him to death whereby they will be left with his money. Sounds simple, right? Well, the other freaks discover their plans & take a horrific revenge...Produced & directed by one of the pioneers of horror Tod Browning this film has a pretty big reputation which when watched today it probably doesn't live up to. The script by Al Boasberg, Willis Goldbeck, Leon Gordon & Edgar Allen Woolf all of whom were uncredited was based on the short story 'Spurs' by Tod Robbins & one has to say what ended up on screen isn't what the makers intended, after a disastrous test screening MGM cut the film from 90 minutes to a mere 64 including totally altering the ending & you can't tell me cutting 25 minutes out didn't affect it. Anyway, what's done is done & what we are left with is a reasonable crime thriller, I'd struggle to call it an out-and-out horror except from the final few minutes & is basically a simple plot about killing someone off for a large inheritance & that's all there is to the film really. The big talking point is obviously the use of real freaks although I personally wasn't bothered by the notion, sure they look weird but that's not their fault is it? At a meagre 64 minutes in length I actually still found it a little slow & dull, not that much happens to be honest. The film preaches that the freaks featured are good people who just want to live normal lives but then turns this moral message on it's head & contradict itself by have them turn incredibly evil & vindictive at the end. Speaking of the ending it is also different depending on the version you watch, I saw the print TCM (Turner Classic Movies cable TV channel) play which has a happy ending tacked onto the end so that in itself may change the entire feel of the film compared to the version you might see which doesn't have that ending.Director Browning does OK but Freaks sure does look dated, there's no music & the sound is very tinny & sometimes hard to make out what character's are saying particularly the high pitched Hans. There's nothing scary until the end & even then were talking a few minutes. The freaks themselves aren't disturbing at all, there's one guy without arms or legs though who has the amazing party trick ability to light a cigarette on his own & he resembles a fat Caterpillar with a human head! During the opening credits there's a long piece of text which makes several points some of which I don't necessarily agree with. Apparently Premier magazine voted Freaks as one of 'The 25 Most Dangerous Movies' whatever the hell that's supposed to mean.According to the IMDb Freaks had an 'estimated' budget of $310,607 which seems a very specific number to just be an 'estimate'. The film is as well made as one can expect from a film of such vintage, it's OK but nothing special. The acting isn't great either, once again it's OK but most of the cast are very stiff. The two midgets Hans & Frieda were actually brother & sister in real life.Freaks is regarded as an absolute classic by some, fine I have no problem with that because quite frankly I'm not the one who has to see it again. Didn't do much for me at all I'm afraid. Loosely & unofficially remade as She Freak (1967).",

The story in this film is pretty dark, happening mostly inside a circus where there are two factions: the freaks and the normals. \"Strong man\" and \"beautiful woman\" hatch a weird plan to embarrass and then destroy a small dwarf who is unfortunately infatuated with beautiful woman. The way it is all presented makes it clear that as the freaks are deformed on the outside, the evil pair is deformed on the inside. In the end, they get what \"was coming to them\" although in itself it is a horrid and creepy finale.What makes this film remarkable is that the freaks that acted in the film were actually freaks - in 1932 there were no special effects to talk about - so you get to see dwarfs, people with shrunken heads, a man that is only a torso and another who has no legs or arms and does everything with his mouth. There was a fantastic scene where \"worm-man\" lights himself a cigarette, using a matchbox, all with his mouth.But what really terrifies me in almost all films in that era is the way the normal people act. Not the evil pair in the circus, but the narrator and the people in the short scene where they stumble upon a group of freaks playing. It is truly not a cultural gap between us, the 21st century people, and the 19-somethings, it's an evolutionary one. And that, for me, made this one hour movie worth watching: while I was intrigued by the poor deformed bastards that played in the flesh as circus freaks, to me they were all freaks, especially the \"normals\". I don't know if that's bad or not, I just felt it in my bones and I think that says something about human nature (or at least mine).My conclusion? I doubt you will get the same kind of poison from any modern movie. Whatever you feel when watching it, I guarantee it will be something new to you. So I think you should watch it.",

            "content": "This really is a remarkable film in so many ways. It boasts more robust diversity than a lot of movies can claim even 90 years later, and to some degree comes across as an active refutation of conventional norms and values that place utmost importance on ideals of physical beauty. Very notably, there's not one real trace of judgment cast on the sideshow performers featured here, a far cry from other titles - contemporary or modern - that consciously or not exhibit ugly biases and glorify harmful behavior. Of course this is a sharp contrast even to how the cast were apparently treated during production, and how the world greeted the feature upon release, but this again only goes to show how gratifyingly forward-thinking Tod Browning was, as a filmmaker and as a person. Even without especially looking to the narrative content, one can only lament that 'Freaks' as it exists is literally a fraction of the picture Browning made, because one must imagine the original vision would be even more rich.That the movie was thusly chopped up does rather seem to come across. For, in these 64 minutes, a majority of the length mostly feels like a fictionalized \"day in the life\" portraiture of the performers, with all the drama of their comings, goings, and interpersonal relationships. There is definite plot, of course, centered around Cleopatra, but it's relegated to a rather small fragment of the already abbreviated runtime, and develops slowly right up until the last 15 minutes or so, feeling increasingly rushed as the climax rolls around. True, this isn't terribly abnormal for features of the 30s - I've seen more than a few that struggled with the same approach to storytelling - and at least this one has the benefit of additional social and cultural themes and worth to pick up the slack, but the issue is notable all the same. And to that point, while the narrative is familiar but written well such as it is, if not for the unique setting and cast then this probably never would have registered on anyone's radar in the first place. It's a very odd set of circumstances 'Freaks' finds itself in.This is otherwise very well made, with excellent production values that still hold up, and terrific contributions from everyone in the cast that let the whole affair look real and believable. Finely executed as everything is, the climax is most immediately grabbing as it serves up genuine thrills and minor chills. It's significant to note that conversation surroundings the film in no small part revolves around its long-standing label as \"horror\" - and for anyone watching 'Freaks' on that basis, the superb climax is where you'll get recognizable genre content. On the other hand, the question of what constitutes \"horror,\" and how it applies to this title, is just as substantial a topic as any of the other musings previously noted, and the only difference is that this one does specifically speak to the content. It's worth reflecting that the real \"horror\" about 'Freaks' may be in the very realist, meta, and tragic sense of how the sideshow performers are treated by the other carnival folk; the disapproving stare the film gives audiences as it knows many viewers will react poorly to visualization of extraordinary individuals; and the unspoken truth that people like the performers (and many others who have less readily distinguished disabilities, or who buck any sensibility of conformity or \"normalcy\") have been and will continue to be persecuted, harmed, and killed just for existing.All this is to say: 'Freaks' is indisputably a good, special movie. Whether or not it's a \"great\" and very smart movie may depend on how much of the subsequent analysis (particularly in regards to the inquiry of \"horror\") was built into it by Browning. And whatever the case may be, there's also this: why 'Freaks' is enjoyable, and all other points of very worthy discussion, overshadow the actual narrative content. That's no fault of the filmmaker or anyone else involved (except perhaps the studio who reduced the feature to its extant length), but regardless, that the movie itself can be thusly overshadowed by anything is revealing of the problems it faces, and the peculiar situation it's in as a piece of cinema.Ultimately 'Freaks' is an iconic picture, and one very well worth watching. But why?",

It's not a great story but it is somehow interesting - I would say due to the actors. If this movie was made with average actors then the film would not be nearly as interesting to watch (if I'm explaining it right).Horror? I think the real horror lies in living the way the actors in the film had to live.

Perhaps this message was an aching punch in a good many people\u00b4s face, so that\u00b4s why many people couldn\u00b4t bear this movie, because the message is to judge a person because of his character and not of his look. But also in an other way \"Freaks\" is a great film: it\u00b4s dramatic, suspense-packed and surrounded with a bizarre atmosphere. The wedding ceremony is one of the most remarkable scenes ever featured in a horror film. Tod Browning\u00b4s movie is partly casted with real handicapped persons, but without causing a sentimental pity and telling a pseudo-moral. The only directors who could make such a thing nowadays possible are David Lynch or Tim Burton, because this movie is like nothing else before and after. \"Freaks\" is one of the most unique films ever made, which deserves much more attention and praise than it gets!!!

Browning was a circus performer himself, and so manages not to exploit or exoticize his \"sideshow freaks\". He adopts a dispassionate tone, content to simply watch as they cope with their various deformities. And unlike \"Elephant Man\" or, say, \"Edward Scissorhands\", Browning sidesteps your conventional narrative (in which the freak is bludgeoned by normal folk for being different, thereby winning our sympathies) and instead asks his audience to recognise that we all struggle, yearn, love, toil, play and ache. We're thus called to witness the handicaps in everyone and are challenged to reconsider the way we define beauty and abnormality.The film has wooden acting and the plot is a bit predictable (why must these films constantly demonize normalcy in order to highlight the humanity within the outcast?), but it mostly all still works, thanks largely to several tangential sequences which seem to hang freely from the main narrative.8/10 \u2013 A hugely influential film which, though it was initially shunned by critics and audiences, opened the floodgates for many other Big Issues (homosexuality, race, slavery, anti-Semitism etc) to be tackled on screen.",

            "content": "It's as though Tod Browning's career had been working up to the culmination of \"Freaks.\" He literally ran off to join the circus, and that background is reflected in some of his films, including \"The Unholy Three\" (1925), \"The Show\" and \"The Unknown\" (both 1927), as well as \"Freaks.\" At least a few of his others are also about showmanship, although not necessarily of the sideshow variety, and include characters either with or faking--usually by the versatile Lon Chaney--physical deformities. Along with this, the prior year, Browning helmed one of the most influential films of all time, \"Dracula\" (1931), which working off another of the director's favorite subjects, of spooky-house mysteries (e.g. \"London After Midnight\" (1927), \"The Thirteenth Chair\" (1929), \"Mark of the Vampire\" (1935)), largely established the modern Hollywood horror genre. Still, MGM and movie-goers didn't seem to know what they were in for. \"Freaks\" doesn't so much revel in the grotesque or uncanny, but rather holds up the mirror to freakish prejudices of othering people with physical deformities.There's barely any circus performing shown. Most of the picture focuses on the troupe's daily lives and romantic foibles in an almost docudrama style. Except that much of it involves dwarfs, conjoined twins, a supposed hermaphrodite, a bearded lady, those born without arms, or without any limbs, the lower half of their torso, or with dysmorphism, Seckel syndrome, or microcephaly--the so-called \"pinheads,\" it's otherwise largely a typical melodrama. That's the point. Browning and company remove the performers from the spectacle of being side-show \"freaks,\" humanizing them while dehumanizing an able-bodied couple. It's the opposite of what was usually done, including in some of Browning's own films, such as his later \"The Devil-Doll\" (1936). Even the acting is rather unremarkable. For one, I prefer Harry Earles as a psychopath smoking a cigar while pretending to be a baby as a front for jewel heists in \"The Unholy Three\" films (1925 and 1930) to him being the patsy in a love triangle, but such would defeat the purpose here. That their doing normal things--eating, drinking, smoking, sex, romantic relationships, starting families--drew the ire of censors and revulsion, as well as cries of exploitation (albeit, some of MGM's promotion had the ring of a carnival barker), from critics says more about them than it does about the performers or film. Yes, these characters inevitably turn to avengers, but so do the leads in about every other Browning production. What's the difference between Chaney doing it, often with a fake disability, and the same actions committed by the so-called \"freaks\" here.While the clowns and other able-bodied circus people treat the side-show performers with respect, the trapeze artist Cleopatra and her strongman boyfriend consider them as comical or frightening \"others,\" as something exotic, laughable, or threatening, eventually plotting to murder Hans (Earles, who also reportedly recommended to Browning Tod Robbins's short story from which the film is loosely based) for his inheritance. It's this ableism, including support for the eugenics movement at the time that would only begin to lose favor after the Nazis adopted the ideology for the Holocaust and that before that resulted in tens of thousands of forced sterilizations in the United States--heck, tens of thousands in California alone--that turns out to be the foundation for the film's true \"freaks.\"Chants of \"we accept her\" and \"one of us\" during the famous wedding banquet scene are declarations of inclusion. It's this subversion of the dominant societal order of bigotry that makes \"Freaks\" truly carnivalesque. It's only after Cleopatra's recoiling from this association with her rebuke of \"freaks\" and poisoning of Hans that the picture turns to a typical revenge plot of the era's shockers and in line with the rest of Browning's oeuvre, turning Cleopatra and the strongman's bodily abhorrence against them. Full of figures lurking in the shadows on a stormy night, it's an impressively filmed finale. It's striking how much better this is staged and photographed than Browning's \"Dracula\" of only the year afore.I also like the framing story of the barker seemingly tearing the film's title credit off the screen as if it were a poster and establishing the main narrative as a horror story inside the as-yet-unseen box. It offers the possibility that what we see, especially the climax, is more Barnum-like bunk from an unreliable narrator. I'm less fond of the, reportedly, added epilogue reuniting Hans and Frieda (Daisy Earles). (By the way, those looking for improbable lovers shouldn't be looking at that between a little man and big woman, but instead at Hans and Frieda, who are played by real-life siblings.) As it is, \"Freaks\" is a complete feature preserved from its release print at little over an hour in length, but I'm still going to include this one on my \"lost films\" list for the original 90-minutes cut that Irving Thalberg had severely edited after poor test screenings. Much of this lost footage is said to be from the revenge finale: Cleopatra being attacked and transformed and, entirely absent from the release version, the castration of the strongman.In the end, \"Freaks\" is one of the classics of 1930s horror, but more than that, the rest of the picture challenges the role of the spectator in and outside the side-show atmosphere and is a strong indictment against the discriminatory pseudoscience of eugenics and of the treatment of \"othering\" people. There wasn't and hasn't been since anything quite like it.",

Physical disability of some helpless people is termed as ' Slimy Freaky' thing by normal people and this highly important concept is still a taboo subject for Cinema World. However, this taboo breaking attempt was made by MGM in 1932, that's 88 years ago, holy freak. It's unbelievable. It's incredible. It's Stunning and Groundbreaking. Just think it this way, something which seems taboo in 2020 was breached in 1932 and that too with full conviction.. Hands down just for thinking to make it and on my knees bowing down for daring to put it on Silver Screen. Freaks is a disgusting film but not by the actual meaning of the word, but it's other way around. Disgusting sounds like a terrible word but we got to accept the fact that it exists in our world, not somewhere out of our cosmos. Freaks shows us how disgusting some normal people can be, how they can be totally inhuman and forget humanity. The word FREAKS has became so powerful for me after watching this film that i can never dare to use it in my life for disable people. It's terrible to see how this film deals with such an important subject and that too without losing heart of it. I was literally crying, not like my heart out but somewhere inside i could feel the burn, it was squeezing my heart. It is a heartbreaking film and very emotional film too but only if you are a person with the heart. I was shocked to know that Freaks was a flop when released in 1932 and people couldn't handle the exploited visuals then. But why? Somehow it existed then, it exists now and will exist forever then we must accept it. It is certainly one of those Classics which were misunderstood by the audience and critics just because it was way ahead if its time. It is ahead of time even today, only god knows how long this feat will be continued because no one gonna dare to make something like this which will look ahead of the time even after 10 decades. With 40% of it's original footage trimmed which does not exist since then and forever, Freaks still got so much to tell and so much to teach. The actors looked cute, screenplay flows like a wind, cinematography is fantastic, dialogues are organic and direction is Brilliant. Overall, Freaks is just not an ordinary film, it is peculiar, it is extraordinary, it is weird, scrupulously disturbing yet emotionally powerful and last but not the least One of the Most Important and though provoking Film ever made for our Society with all kind of humans.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

The downside of using these circus performers in the film is that they are not actors. A lot of the dialogue, especially from the central midget character, Hans, comes off sounding very forced. Olga Baclanova also hams it up a little too much as the villainess. In fact, the only good actor in the bunch seems to be Wallace Ford, playing one of the few friends to the circus freaks. Still, the movie succeeds in making an emotional connection, not so much because of the weight of the performances, but because of the realism of their situation. We get the sense that what these characters are going through on screen is not far from what they go through in life. Then, of course, we get to see them do what they would never get a chance to do in real life: take their revenge!",

They may be exploited in some sense and made to be fools. But, they are never treated with malice. And in the end, they come across as the good guys. A film like this doesn't try to cop out and give us a Snow White ending or plot. Almost everyone comes out at least a little dirty.

Many scenes seem terribly rushed and the plot seems to zoom by. This film would have developed at a more comfortable pace if it were 105 minutes. The film finishes with an amazing climax.

Artistically, there's not too much to be said about the strangely flat acting of \"the little people\" nor is there anything particularly innovative about the big twist that the plot is aiming for at the finale.In fact, it's hinted at throughout every bit of dialog in which we hear resentment building up against Cleopatra and her \"love affair\" with one of the little men (HARRY EARLES), much to the consternation of his German-accented wife (DAISY EARLES), both of whom sound like they're reciting their lines for the first time. Most of the other circus performers are aware of the perverse cruelty of the situation which has come about only because Cleopatra is interested in Hans' inheritance money.There's an awful heavy-handed approach to the circus humor--some of which is extremely overacted, particularly by the actress playing Cleopatra, OLGA BACLANOVA. But the build-up to the rain sequence where the revenge motif comes into play, is worth waiting for--as both Hercules (HENRY VICTOR) and Cleo get their comeuppance.Not a hit on first release, it was withdrawn from circulation for several years by MGM until a re-discovery of Tod Browning's films made the public acceptance of FREAKS more possible upon re-release.

But I do not believe that by putting sideshow freaks as the avengers of their betrayal and abuse that Tod Browning was exploiting them or making them look hideous and evil. Yes, that may be the interpretation. But I think that Browning was presenting the actors as surpassing others and establishing some dignity and respect for people who are usually dismissed as worthless and incompetent. Freaks has been generally called a horror film but I would rather think of it as a drama with elements of infidelity, revenge, and murder. Does Freaks have to be a horror film just because it stars sideshow freaks? Definitely not! There has always been a fascination with the unusual. Several magazine and websites feature people with deformities and people who do bizarre acts. But lately these mediums have been blending violence and sex with deformities; therefore, warping the original intention of these magazines and sites. This intermixing is historically not a recent idea. People have always made the Unusual synonymous with the Macabre. In one way this idea is similar with blending rock music with sex, as in the 1950's. By judging the unusual with the macabre from this standpoint is how people judged the film Freaks: as a horror movie. \tFreaks was banned for several years and was highly edited by distributors. In the 60's William Burroughs and Antony Balch were on of the first people to reshow Freaks in theaters. Freaks was shown in Europe alongside two of Burroughs/Balch pictures. However, it took a while for America to catch on but now here it is finally on DVD. \nIt is interesting why films get banned for certain reasons and why people want to suppress them from viewers. Freaks was looked at in this way but now is considered tame by most moviegoers. For those who are interested in sideshow freaks (if you would call them that) and their history check out Being Different and Freaks Uncensored. Both films bring up my same argument and go in-depth about their abuse and finally their acceptance by the majority.",

This was a personal film for him because he worked in the circus and had experience working with freak-shows. He aimed to show that 'freaks' were well rounded, developed characters who want to live their lives. They don't want to be laughed at, but they have no choice. They suffer discrimination even within the circus. They have to struggle but still find love and friendship and have a code to protect each other. Freaks is classified as a Horror film, but it's really a character drama and social commentary; who are the real freaks in society? It's only need the end of the film where they is a horror moment, but its better then most modern horror films. Browning casted real circus performances which was a smart move, saw how they lived. Harry and Daisy Earles were engaging as the leading characters (even though their high-pitched voices were a bit difficult to understand at times). Most of them were good actors and did well in there roles. The film is on an hour long, which makes Freaks a tout experience. It's good for a quick watch and it does have a lot of plot, sub-plots and characters to get to know in its short running time.The only real problem of the film is some of the over-acting which was a problem in a lot of films in 30s. The main offenders were Olga Baclanova and Henry Victor.But Freaks is a cult classic worthy of your time.",

            "content": "FREAKS (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1932), directed by Tod Browning, is a unique production by any means released during the craze of the horror cycle boom. Unlike previous releases as 1931s DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN (Universal), or Paramount's DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (Paramount), whether its characters be living dead or developed into a human monster, FREAKS doesn't go overboard with heavy make-up to present scary figures. In fact, the deformed characters presented for this production are actually and surprisingly what would be actual freaks, or better known as children as described by one of the characters. Under Browning's direction, FREAKS is more macabre than thriller, yet there's enough thrills to go around for a slight story set at an European carnival.The story begins with a tour guide (Murray Kinnell) walking his spectators over to an attraction where they get to see a once beautiful woman, a trapeze artist better known as the \"peacock of the air,\" to what she has become. The tour guide then tells her story, told via flashback: Set mostly in a carnival, Hans (Harry Earles), a dwarf, is seen watching and admiring Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), performing her trapeze act. Hans happens to be engaged to Freida (Daisy Earles), another drawf, who is jealous of Hans' affections towards her. In the meantime, Venus (Leila Hyams), leaves her partner, Hercules (Henry Victor), a strongman, due to being too free with his hands. Though Venus eventually finds more comfort with Phroso (Wallace Ford), the clown, Victor becomes attracted towards Cleopatra, in spite the fact that Hans wants to marry her instead. As much as everyone at the carnival knows Cleopatra is making a fool out of Hans, she breaks the code of the freaks by being a normal woman who marries the midget only to obtain his inherited fortune. Realizing what is happening, Hans has other plans for his mischievous wife.Others in the cast include: Roscoe Ates (Roscoe); Edward Brophy and Matt McHugh (The Rollo Brothers), along with actual freaks played by Daisy and Violet Hinton (The Siamese Twins); Olga Roderick (The Bearded Lady); Radian (The Living Torso); Koo-Coo (The Bird Lady); Angelo Rossito (The Midget); Martha Morris (The Armless Wonder); Johnny Eck (Half a Torso); and Schkutzie, Elvira and Jennie Lee Snow (The Pin Heads). Of the supporting players, only Roscoe Ates, is most annoying with his stuttering used for comic effect.Initially completed at 90 minutes, FREAKS was reportedly severely reduced to 63 minutes to tone down certain scenes considered too grotesque for 1932 audiences. Though FREAKS has more blackouts than jump-cuts, it's editing process is well done enough to have viewers convinced this is what the director intended. There is very little plot development for other members of the cast as to who they are, their backgrounds, and where the setting actually takes place, scenes that might have been told in its unedited edition. Regardless of the names of Wallace Ford and Leila Hyams heading the cast, FREAKS mostly belongs to Harry Earles and Olga Baclanova. Unfortunately, the speaking voices of both Harry and Daisy Earles doesn't come off as clearly in the audio as the other actors in the story. Had Lon Chaney (1883-1930)been alive during the making of FREAKS, naturally he'd would have appeared in this production as he did in other Browning macabre melodramas during the silent era of the 1920s, particularly the now sort-after circus-related theme classic of THE UNKNOWN (1927).As much as MGM attempted to out-do and out-shock itself, FREAKS was a notable flop. Somewhat ahead of its time through its elements as well as title opening presentation immediately followed by the story, leaving the cast credits solely for its finish, FREAKS had been unavailable for viewing for decades until it was reborn to a new generation of movie audiences by the 1960s. Distributed on video cassette in the mid 1980s, accompanied by a very long forward introduction to what is to be presented, FREAKS finally saw the light on cable television around 1989 on Turner Network television (TNT) and more commonly after 1994 on Turner Classic Movies where in later years of its frequent showings and DVD distribution, has eliminated the forward introduction. For first time viewers, FREAKS should be a real curiosity and shocker as well. (***)",

            "content": "Is Tod Browning's 1932 film \"Freaks\" really a horror film? Well, somewhat. Some scenes towards the ending are really chilling, and the entire film has a haunting and unsettling atmosphere. Actually, the movie would be even better if it was a bit longer, which it originally was. There's thirty minutes that were cut out of this film and no ones been able to see it since a test screening in 1932. It was cut because the audience seemed to be disturbed and shocked by the footage. A woman even threatened to sue MGM because of how disturbing it was for her.And even without this so called shocking missing footage, \"Freaks\" is still genuinely haunting and even disturbing at times. \"Freaks\" is certainly a film that is far ahead of it's time, and that explains why it was very under-appreciated back in its day. It destroyed director Browning's career, and was a box office bomb! But, luckily, its gotten a second chance with film goers and is one of the ultimate cult classics.The film really does deserve the cult status, it truly is one of the best films of the 30s and definitely deserved some recognition! The freaks, themselves add quite a bit to the film, as well. Real circus performers were cast, including a man with no arms or legs and a half man/half woman, among plenty of others.Although some of the acting is pretty bad, it was the 30s, most films had some pretty bad acting, and a lot of the people in this film were, as I said, not actors, but actual circus performers.Browning's film is a masterpiece of the creepy and absurd, with touches of humour and heart.",

            "content": "The acting is not great, but it's not that bad either. Actually, the \"freaks\" are better actors than the professional actors, in my opinion!I'll try not to spoil this, so pardon me if I become cryptic. This story takes place behind-the-scenes of a circus, where there are lots of \"normal\" people (flying trapeze lady, strong man, clown, animal trainer) and lots of \"freaks\" (midgets, bearded lady, people missing various limbs, Siamese twins, \"pinheads\" (sorry I don't know the correct medical terminology), etc.).The movie is very respectful of the \"freaks\", and never exploits them. There are several scenes which are \"gratuitous\" merely in the fact that they don't move the plot along, but serve only to show off the particular \"freak\"'s talent. The scene with Prince Randian (aka \"the human torso\", a man with no arms and no legs) lighting his cigarette is particularly amazing. There are also some very amusing, humorous scenes involving the \"freaks\" but the humor is not really mean-spirited or at their expense. For example, one of the Siamese twins, who are both female, is engaged to be married. The fianc\u00e9 loves the one twin, but hates the other. It's hysterical but not demeaning.The bad guys in this movie are a couple of the \"normal\" people who try to exploit one of the \"freaks\". I'll say no more. The movie has a sensationalist yet satisfying ending -- the strongman and the flying trapeze lady meet a most gruesome and bizarre ending that you've got to see to believe.This is a really great film, and presents the \"freaks\" in a very loving manner. I've only seen this once (rented), but I'm 100% certain that I am going to buy it so I can watch it whenever I want.

            "content": "This was and ever shall be, something completely different. I really can't imagine what its impact must have been at the time to a 1930's audience, because now we have such different views about people with physical and mental abnormalities, and back then by-and-large most people had probably never even seen a freak much less a whole community of them on the screen. I can see how they were unable to handle it at the time, I mean it's a movie without makeup effects or costumes, these are real deformed people with real missing limbs - no way in hell would it ever get made today. It's still so startling and amazing to me how they used actual sideshow performers for the story. They're the real stars and what's naturally most interesting about the film, and while they may look strange and even frightening they're definitely not monsters, just people trapped in differently-abled bodies. They're the protagonists, and I love that. The picture spells out where its sympathies lie right from the beginning with the real monstrous villains of the story being the so-called normal people who are mostly portrayed as being cold and unfeeling to the plight of the freaks, who are victimised and scorned through no fault of their own. And to me the best element about this classic is that we never feel uncomfortable among the freaks, we almost immediately see them as simply being the human beings of a different sort that they are, and get a sense of their protective community as well as a glimpse into their everyday lives, and that's something that Tod Browning to managed to accomplish so magnificently, he both captured a little piece of long-gone American sideshow history, as well as a very different way of life. They were allowed to speak for themselves by simply being themselves, and that in itself gives them a kind of dignity. I'm captivated by the simple but hugely fascinating scenes where people are casually doing something that seems weird to us but is completely normal to them. There's stern-faced Hans and Frieda who I really loved cos she was so sweet, my heart just melts every time it did a closeup of her little face! Particularly when she's crying during the wedding feast scene. I just love it when they have the most adorable argument ever together! And there was also Johnny Eck running around on his hands like nobodies business. He was quite a good-looking man, his life must not have been an easy one. But you'd never know that by looking at his face, he didn't look like the miserable type at all. The actress that played \"Venus\" god bless her, she looks visibly uncomfortable in his presence in one scene. Quite possibly the most famous moment is when the man without arms or legs lights a cigarette, and had the film not been so drastically cut we would've seen him roll it as well! I love the look he gives the camera as he does it. Oh yeah, Randian was the Prince, no wonder he fathered four children.(that we know of..)Try doing that Samual L. Jackson! And there's another scene that I really like that I find poignant and engrossing where a pretty girl without any arms is eating her dinner with her feet, she's using them as her hands, and she's being so elegant with them! Those of us who are privileged to have both our hands find this odd and fascinating and wonder wow, how can she do that? But it's completely second-nature to her because she's been that way all her life. And that's kind of the film's thing, because who's to say what's normal, right? The whole movie is a clever visual way of getting across the point that normal and beauty is relative and is something different for everyone. And it almost demands that you do take a good hard look at the freaks. And maybe if you can look without snickering then you'll understand, and if you can understand maybe you'll be a little grateful for what you have, or perhaps proud of whatever makes you different or maybe even that old chestnut of not judging a book by its cover. I'd personally say that it's not a true horror movie - except for the creeping horror of the climactic scene as the film suddenly turns into a stark primordial nightmare as the freaks slog through the mud towards Hercules and chase Cleopatra through the thunderstorm to extract their infamous revenge on her, by making her one of them, which was what she feared the most... It goes to such an intense dark place in that sequence, and with no musical score to complement it, it only comes off as all the more haunting. I think they were well within their rights to make a duck out of her, the greedy bitch screwed around with their kinship and threatened one of their own! That was so funny.. The freaks were very nice people, but in the world of this movie if you crossed them they'd cut off your legs and stick feathers on ya!!! \"How she got that way will never be known...\" We do. It simply transcends time does this movie. 82 years after it was made I think it still stands as the film it was in 1932. It still tells a very enjoyable and compelling story, with some performances that are still strong to this day. I find it to be a charming, rich, strange and unique cult classic with a grim ending that feels like icing on the cake. And one thing you can say to any unwary young newbies to it is that it is so distinctly uncanny that the odds of them enjoying it are really good...but the goods are still really kind of odd! Fare thee well.",

            "content": "Even though the movie is directed by horror-master Tod Browning, this movie isn't really an horror movie in terms of having scares. It's more a dramatic and sympathetic movie than it is an horror movie. Still the movie remains kind of freaky to watch, since the movie uses real 'freaks' that all have highly unusual abnormalities. It makes you at times feel uncomfortable but it also makes you sympathetic towards those special people at the same time. It's obvious that director Browning made this movie with all the best intentions in the world.To be honest I didn't liked the movie in the first few minutes. There wasn't really a story that was heading anywhere and the movie just seemed to consist out of one 'freak' introduction after the other. However as the movie progressed, the story and its heart become more and more obvious and the movie was perfectly build up towards the unforgettable and quite tense ending. The story itself is quite simple but still is filled with lots of heart and sympathy, therefor the movie becomes interesting and in a way also at the same time important to watch.It's a bit of a shame that the 'freaks' are obviously no professional actors. Especially Harry and Daisy Earles (In real life brother and sister, in this movie husband and wife.). Still all of the characters are strong and compelling, which is I think, mainly due to Browning's professional directing.This movie is already worth watching due to the interesting unusual characters but also due to the story that has a lot of heart in it and is also thought provoking. Some people might find this movie too 'disturbing' to watch but everybody should give this movie a chance because it's worth to be seen and deserves to be better known all over the world.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"Freaks\" is not only one of the greatest and most bizarre horror films in history, but also a call for tolerance in a time when people with physical \"abnormalities\" were still commonly considered to be \"freaks\". The movie tells the story of people working in a traveling circus. Some of them are performers like trapeze artists, the others are so-called 'freaks' - among them are midgets, people with deformities, Siamese twins, a hermaphrodite and a bearded lady. Cleopatra, a coveted but heartless trapeze artist in love with a muscle-man, despises those 'freaks'. Nevertheless, she starts flirting with Hans, a midget, after finding out about his wealth. Whenever Hans is not there she makes fun of him and his fellow freaks. She underestimates the solidarity amongst the freaks, who build a strong unity as outcasts of society, and who will not let others treat them as subhuman beings any longer...Tod Browning, who had worked in a circus himself before, casted 'real freaks' - people actually appearing in freak-shows in circuses or fairs. Characters like a 'living torso', a man who has neither legs nor arms, but enough skill to light his cigarettes with his mouth, or Siamese twins, one of whom has a boyfriend that her Siamese twin sister can't stand, are unforgettable. What makes this movie so unique, especially for its time, is the fact that it displays those who despise the 'freaks' and make fun of them as the true freaks. The freaks themselves are generally friendly people, who welcome everybody in their midst, no matter if they're so-called 'freaks' or so-called 'normal' people, as long until one of them gets maltreated, threatened or abused. A brilliant film, both for its value as a tantalizing horror film and a moving drama at the same time, and its early call for tolerance and against discrimination, Tod Browning's \"Freaks\" is a fascinating milestone that no lover of cinema could possibly afford to miss.

I first read about \"Freaks\" as a young teenager in the early 70's in the book \"Very Special People\" by Frederick Drimmer.  This extraordinary book, which is now out of print but available in limited used copies here and there, contains sympathetic biographic accounts of the most famous deformity-afflicted people in history, most of whom wound up in the circus, and many of whom were featured in \"Freaks\".  Even though \"Freaks\" was no longer banned at the time, there were still no VCRs or video tapes, and the movie was not appropriate for television broadcasting.  So as much as I had wanted to see this film to see what all the hubbub was about, I thought the opportunity would never come. Then about 5 years ago I was browsing through a Blockbuster store and, low and behold, there it was.  I picked it up immediately and took it home to watch.  \"Freaks\" had me spellbound for its extremely short 64 minutes. Tod Browning's message is absolutely clear...who are we who do not suffer to hold those of us who do in contempt?  I would dare say that this film is probably the boldest and most daring picture ever produced, and the fact that is was made in 1932 says a lot, because in the 70 years since then, nothing comes close to its in-your-face condemnation of \"normal\" society. Yes, the plot is simple, but executed powerfully within the social microcosm of a sideshow circus.  I find it hard to believe that the footage that has been cut from this wonderful film has been lost forever.  I hope someday that it will be rediscovered and the film rereleased once form in its entirety.",

            "content": "********Eight Out of Ten Stars******** Just about everything positive and necessary has already been written about this film on IMDb. Hopefully my comments will at least come close to giving some relatively new insights into this strange film. No matter how you feel about this film, you must admit that it's at least to be considered an important entry into the world of film making.\"Freaks\" is about a clan of physically deformed traveling performers whom have formed a tightly formed family that watches out for, and cares for one another. Essentially, if you hurt one freak, you hurt all the freaks. This concept of socially rejected freaks banding together to protect and care for one another is the cornerstone of this film. This idea touched me and made me feel sorry for the freaks, I pitied them and empathized with them.The formed unity amongst outcasts is highlighted by a a midget named Hans, who is manipulated by a beautiful trapeze artist planning on marrying him to steal his money. When the freaks learn of the trapeze artists plan to poison Hans and take his money, the freaks exact revenge; culminating in the film's very bizarre closing scene.The scenes utilizing the most deformed of the freaks are disturbing and uncomfortable. All of the freaks are real life people with physical abnormalities, that willingly volunteered to act in the film. The use of these real life deformities evokes emotional response from the audience: including fear, pity, disgust, sadness, and empathy. It's a truly effective method on the part of director Browning, one he should be applauded for.Overall, this film is pretty much a masterpiece: At the risk of sounding ordinary and mundane, I'll point to the superb acting, directing, and writing. My only two complaints are that the film is too short and that at times it drags because of incessant talking. I mean the film is essentially one dialogue scene after another; there is very little action until the very end of the film. I wasn't expecting an action adventure here, but Browning should have relied heavily upon his deformed actors throughout the film to provide scares, not just in the last five minutes.On a closing note, I did want to mention my true desire to see these freak-show carnival spectacles to become part of the American landscape once again. Not long after the release of the films, socially conscious activists starting putting pressure on carnivals and circuses to end these traveling freak shows. Over the past 70 or so years, it's gotten more and more socially unacceptable to display these willing physically deformed persons. My problem is, is that these the freaks in these traveling carnivals are and were willingly participants in these freak shows. But because some rich conservative Christian wives with too much time on their hands thought it to be immoral and indecent, freak shows have become social taboos. Modern day society greatly disapproves of freak shows; some states have even gone so far as to make them illegal. People should get over this overly sensitive pompous nonsense and allow these freak shows to once again become a part of the American landscape. Listen, if the physically deformed are willing and accepting of their roles as traveling freaks, allow it to happen. Bring the freak shows back, please.",

As marketing strategies go it's no work of genius, though its proud claim \u0096 \"Banned in the U.K. for 30 years\" \u0096 does better to increase its appeal.However, all the notoriety and controversy heaped on this one seems to be based on the fact that it's such a bland, mainstream affair.

The fact that Freaks turns out to be a rather vapid, crowd-pleasing piece makes its subject matter all the more disturbing.In particular, Rosco Ates \u0096 a man with a \"comedy\" stutter \u0096 is both dubious material in itself, but also raises questions about how the people with real ailments are used. Most of the abnormality-related dialogue is overwhelmingly unsubtle \u0096 \"they don't realise I'm a man with the same feelings they have\" \u0096 and, like the opening 400+ word essay, the \"sympathy or spectacle?\" debate is constantly thrown up over the makers' intentions. The whole work condemns the exploitation of such people but by its very nature exploits them in turn.The \"freaks\" of the circus, while fundamentally treated the same by the majority of \"normal\" co-workers, are nevertheless patronised by them. Violet and Daisy, the Siamese twins, in particular are subjected to rat lab treatment, men pinching one's arm so the other can sense it. Later, when one is kissed, the other sighs in pleasure. \"It's gonna have a beard!\" yelps Wallace Ford as the bearded lady gives birth to a girl. While voyeuristic tendencies are indulged when nearly a minute of screentime is given over to an armless woman drinking with her feet, and \"Rardion the Living Torso\" lighting a cigarette.Tod Browning is no great artist \u0096 heresy, perhaps, but true all the same \u0096 and while you have to admire the performers, using real-life people with deformities mean that the acting credentials are highly ropy. Daisy Earles, especially, says her lines like she's reading them from the script. The constant staccato delivery of all concerned can also be grating, as can the piercing mid-western accents and would-be funny comic setpieces. Rather than the product of gothic expressionism, this film is pure Vaudeville, and all the more irritating for it.Among its plus points Freaks can count its own uniqueness, as well as two genuinely well mounted scenes. One is the attack on Cleo under the cover of darkness, the other the poignant wedding feast. In fact, the break in continuous film that occurs with The Wedding Feast caption is an apt marker, for what follows is vastly superior to that what comes before. Indeed, the last twenty minutes take on a sinister turn, perhaps heightened by following such a moronic beginning.However, for a supposed horror Cleo's final emergence as a half-human chicken is more comic than frightening, and throws up an objectionable moral of the tale. What is the picture saying? That if you upset people with deformities watch out or they might cut your face and sew feathers on your body? The final score then: exploitation 1, freaks 0.",

Freaks is not stupendous but the simple boldness of it makes it perpetually timeless in ways a lot of its contemporaries could only dream of being.

And I will never forget the gleam of hatred in the eyes of the knife wielding freaks as they crawled through the mud toward the end of the film.  This was one of the scariest parts.I would go so far as to say that this is an all time horror classic, right up there with F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu, and James Whale's Frankenstein.

            "content": "Upon Universal's Dracula becoming a huge hit, director Tod Browning was given an opportunity to make whatever he wanted afterwards, which was to adapt the short story Spurs into a feature film, later entitled Freaks. By doing unconventional methods such as casting actual deformed circus performers amongst a cast of \"regular\" actors, the film was seen as too shocking to be released and was even cut from its original hour and a half long cut to just 64 minutes. Even at that, the film was not well received and became an infamously controversial film throughout the world. That being said, time has shown to be more kind to this film, as it has gotten more critical praise and attraction over the years, which I agree on.Set in a traveling circus, trapeze performer Cleopatra tricks the lovesick circus midget Hans into marrying her upon hearing about his inheritance so she can steal the fortune and run off with her lover, strong man Hercules. Upon hearing of this, Hans' friends and fellow performers, all of whom are deemed as freaks, decide to seek vengeance on both Hercules and Cleopatra to show them what it truly means to be a \"freak.\" While the main story itself is pretty simple, it is intriguing enough to sit through, as it does detail how deformed people were treated back in the day (makes one wonder how the actors were treated on set). It's made clear that the so called \"freaks\" are not inherently horrid beings, it's really those who are prejudice towards them that are. As such, it makes the eventual ending obvious albeit disturbing once Cleo and Hercules finally get what's coming to them (although we'll never get to see the original ending where Hercules gets castrated).As for the characters, it's great that Browning was able to cast circus and sideshow performers to play the deformed beings, and they really do play off one another through their own distinct traits and personalities. Hans and his former fiance Frieda are probably the most endearing characters in the film, since while many of the other deformed beings get their fare share of taunts, we really get to see the pain and anguish shown in their faces and what happens to them really makes one feel sorry for the two. Cleopatra and Hercules are just appropriately despicable, for whether they lie to or openly insult the \"freaks\" themselves, their evil cunning nature is not too different to how greedy and downright malicious people were to deformities back then, or even like some people are now in general. The only \"normal\" characters in the film, Phroso and Venus, are much more relatable to a modern audience (or even Browning himself) as they understand the deformed being's pain and do wish they would just be happy.In addition to the main storyline, there are a few subplots revolving around other \"freaks\", such as Phroso and Venus' relationship, one part of Siamese twins marrying a stuttering circus clown, and even a bearded lady giving birth to the daughter of the human skeleton. Although they're charming and humorous in their own right, they mainly serve as superfluous to the main plot and come off as nothing more than filler. Phroso and Venus's arch is an exception since they do play a vital role in having a healthy relationship with the performers outside of Cleopatra and Hercules, and they do have rather witty banter with each other which makes for an entertaining couple. Considering the movie had roughly 26 minutes cut, it's possible that these subplots added up a little more in the original version, but as nonessential as many of them are, they do build up to the eventual climax, and boy do things get rough from there on out.Needless to say, Freaks holds up as an unorthodox shocking albeit insightful horror flick of Hollywood's pre-Code era for its share of warm-hearted and horrid characters, well timed tension and moral that says \"freaks\" may show much more honesty than a 'normal' people driven by greed, power and prejudice. If you're looking for a classic horror film that as much light to deformed beings as much as The Elephant Man and Mask, then give Freaks a watch. Similar to deformed beings of then and today, the film may have been reviled then, but its praises and even defenses are being sung now.",

The Freaks accept her into their \"family\" and she humiliates them and Hanz by refusing their welcome and revealing her affair with Hercules. The Freaks, on the other hand, are kind to each other and since they have little physical beauty, they judge each other by their character. They band together and support each other, like when they attacked Hercules. They also captured Cleopatra and vengefully spliced her with a chicken making her the strangest monster in the show.

Yet it still remains a unique and nightmarish piece of film making, the sort of picture that if someone like David Lynch had made it in the modern era it would be heralded as a masterpiece of daring and genius like artistry.Browning pulls us the viewers into this bizarre carnival society of oddities who are genuinely portrayed by real people. Their codes and ethics are laid bare, but not in some sort of yearning for sympathy, but in a factual way of life. Browning toys with his audience, planting suggestive images of sexual dalliances and role reversals, then he completely pulls the rug from under us to deliver his flip-flop finale. The messages aren't deep, but they need to be thought about. For even as the freaks of Browning's play terrifyingly pursue their quarry through the rain and mud, as the blood freezes and the macabre imagery strikes the senses, it would be a shame if themes such as love and loyalty be forgotten. 9/10",

            "content": "Eager to muscle in on the box office action of Dracula and Frankenstein, MGM engaged Tod Browning to top Universal's moneymakers in horror content and revenue. Browning, who had run away to a side-show carnival at the age of 13, delivered a film that repulsed everyone who saw it on its brief original showing. Today it can be seen as a semi-classic, and a film that is almost unique in movie history.Browning, of course, did not turn to the make up man, but engaged real-life side-show performers. His writers created a film set amidst the freaks of such a carnival, basing it upon a Weird Tales story, Spurs. The central thrust of the plot focuses on Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova, a trapeze artist, and Hercules the Strongman (Henry Victor) and their attempts to swindle a rich dwarf out of his fortune by first marrying Cleopatra off to him, and then disposing of him via ptomaine poisoning.Along the way Browning gives us a lot of insight into the lives of the carnival attractions - acts such as \"Randian The Living Torso\", the Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, various \"Pinheads\" and Johnny Eck, \"The Boy With Half a Body\". Those early preview audiences must have been staggered to find that nothing is faked; these acts are real.Browning encourages the viewer to develop a moving sympathy for the freaks, but then, in an horrific climax, they seek their revenge upon Cleopatra and Hercules when their murderous intent is discovered. Crawling and sliding through the mud during a rainstorm, they extract a terrible price for being crossed...This famous ending throws away much of the sympathy Browning has engendered,and uses his troupe as exploitation pieces. Yet there's no denying the fascination the film continues to arouse. Wallace Ford is also present as Phrozo the Clown, who, er, seems to have had a certain operation. Rumour has it that Browning was also forced to undergo such a procedure after a serious car accident, though this has never been confirmed. Who knows? Browning's camera is a lot more mobile after the stage-style presentation of his earlier Dracula and the film never loses interest. Unfortunately, after the disastrous previews during which members of the audience were reportedly physically sick, MGM trimmed 30 minutes from the film, and the gaps do show. Nonetheless, Freaks remains a unique viewing experience.",

That's just ridiculous!) The very clumsy black transitions between scenes were also, presumably, the result of heavy-handed cutting.But really, with hindsight I feel that the film largely works as a freak-show. A lot of the interest in the surviving footage lies in watching the freaks cope with their day-to-day tasks; fascinating, but it's putting the audience in the position of the voyeurs whom it purportedly condemns. The actual acting isn't that wonderful, and the plot seems to fizzle out into a standard 'runaway caravan'/hero-villain fistfight scenario just when it ought to be getting creatively sinister. And unfortunately, given the combination of German accents, randomly mixed German/English dialogue, an ancient soundtrack, and high-pitched voices, the dialogue from the central pair of midgets is pretty hard work to follow.The assembled cast and material are fascinating, and I feel this could perhaps have been a great film -- but alas, it isn't.",

Still potent pre-Code film features real-life freaks in the cast.

The acting varies wildly  Baclanova, Wallace Ford and Leila Hyams (as a nice \"normal\" couple) are very good.  Victor is OK.  As for the \"freaks\"--well, they're no actors. Earles is pretty bad--his high-pitched voice makes most of his dialogue incomprehensible and his attempts at emoting are painful to watch.  The others are just so-so, but then, they weren't hired for their acting.The film is short (64 minutes) and, in its day, was considered shocking and a huge bomb.  The original cut ran 90 minutes but MGM recut it after a disasterous sneak preview.  Unfortunately, no prints of the original exist. It was even banned in Britain for 31 years!  Now it's considered a horror classic.  It isn't really scary until the last 20 minutes and then it turns into real nightmare material.

The acting is OK. Nothing amazing, but they do get the job done to convey the story. Watching this film made me look in to the backgrounds of the actors who portrayed the \"freaks\" and some of their stories are quite interesting. The films look is dark and creepy, mainly because it is set around a carnival/circus which one normally associates with being fun and cheerful. Because of the nature of events that takes place in the film, especially the ending when Cleopatra is revealed after being physically altered by the freaks into a \"chicken lady\", there is a very grotesque evil that surrounds the film and it's characters.

Then, one of the midget discovers the trapeze artist, Cleopatra which he falls in love with. As a joke, Cleopatra \"Says\" she feels the same. As she discovers he has a hidden wealth she then starts to get more serious about this joke and actually marries him. At the wedding the freaks chant \"One of us... One of us... We accept her we accept her... gooble goble... gooble goble... one of us...\" which provokes her to mocking the freaks. She poisons the drink of the midget for his money and then the freaks take revenge by turning her into a freak (A duck like creature).Now, originally, the film said to be lost reveals her leg to brake by a tree and the shadows of the freaks turning her to one. And you see her partner in crime Hercules is a deformed midget singing Oprah (Which was taken out) but still remains her as a duckish creature.Some say this film doesn't fall in horror but there is no doubt it does. The film has an eerie texture unseen in films today or back then. The idea of life, the under plot so to say \"Theme\" is revealed more and is in the film more. Earlier I read great commons of people who said that the freaks are the normal ones in the films and the normal ones are the freaks. Maybe some some normal people are good (Like Venus and her husband) but overall that statement is true. He or she mentions that in a few shots it seems Cleopatra (The bad women) looks deformed like she has no legs, which I shall see because if thats true then this puts this film on an even higher level.

In the wake of HBO's uncanny \"Carnivale\" I decided to revisit this film I hadn't seen since I was a child and was shocked by how well it has held up. For the most of its running time it delivers the goods as a pseudo-documentary/soap opera episode showing the daily lives of circus performers (played by real people with handicaps, deformed bodies, abnormalities, etc...) with a noirish revenge plot thrown in for good measure concerning a conniving acrobat scheming to marry the midget who adores her and then murder him for his money.Browning doesn't get enough credit for setting a mood that tricks the viewer into thinking nothing too \"freakish\" is going to happen. We are simply seeing how these people live and that they are more normal than many normal people. But then he turns things on their heads with one of the greatest scenes in all of cinema, \"The Wedding Feast.\" There we see a drunk and belligerent acrobat who's reveling in her scheme unfolding just as she desired is welcomed wholeheartedly into the circus family by a ritual chant and toast, \"Gooble Gobble, Gooble Gobble. One of Us. One of Us. We accept her. One of Us.\" She becomes horrified and belittles the \"family\" with the most abhorrent of slurs, \"Freaks!\" It is only when this disgusting and a-moral normal person proclaims them to be \"freaks\" that these very moral abnormal people actually begin to act like \"freaks.\" The secret code that they follow as the acrobat's plot becomes clear and the subsequent revenge they deploy is one of the creepiest and most nightmarish set of scenes ever put to film peaking with the \"freaks\" crawling through the mud in the rain at night underneath the caravan coaches wielding knives in their hands and hatred in their hearts. There was additional more graphic footage filmed that has been lost, though film fans hope to see some of it restored in the long delayed DVD version. The only downfall of this film is the atrocious acting (MGM wouldn't deliver any big stars to Browning because this was just too weird and the \"freaks\" are all amateurs with no real acting experience) and the studio enforced happy ending where two midgets find true love. Still, it's pretty amazing this film got made at all, and it could probably never be remade in today's studio system that panders to the lowest common denominator (though I would love to see some independent like David Lynch give it a shot).",

Remember, no CGI graphics, no computers, no special effects to anything of that likeness. The stars of this film are ACTUAL FREAKS! A man with no arms and legs that lights a match and his cigarette using only his mouth. Siamesse twins. A torso that runs around on it's arms. A half man, half bird. Midgets. All real! This classic cult horror film was banned in England for 30 years. Tod Browning's masterpiece is quite possibly one of the scariest movies ever. Anyone who doesn't think so should lie awke at night with voices of the freaks in their head. ( One of us. One of us. We accept her. We accept her. One of us. One of us. We accept her. We accept her.) A theme and plot that were way ahead of their times and good 30's writing still stand up to even the best horror of today. Plus an end so shocking and cruel it'll leave you stunned for hours. Watch this movie. I dare you. I double dare you.",

            "content": "\"Dracula\" director Tod Browning's horror movie \"Freaks\" might freak you out unless you're a connoisseur of either Browning or the genre. Based in title only on Tod Robbins' short story \"Spurs,\" this memorable revenge melodrama takes place in a circus touring in Europe. When MGM made this creepy little chiller, they wanted to reap the whirlwind of wealth that Universal Studios had with \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein.\" This horror movie doesn't concern supernatural creatures or people, but there are three genuinely deformed individuals. Browning didn't rely on prosthetics or camera tricks. The two most impressive of the 'freaks' is Prince Randian and Johnny Eck. Randian is designed as The Living Torso, while Eck is The Half-Boy. The Living Torso has neither arms nor legs, but he does have a normal size head. The Half-Boy uses his hands to walk around with because he has no legs or even a set of buttocks. The other 'Freaks' are three pinheads and a couple of armless women. The main one of the bunch is a German fellow named Hans (Harry Earles of \"The Unholy Three\") who is basically a pint-sized little guy who dresses himself in formal apparel. He has had a relationship with another circus performer, Frieda (Daisy Earles of \"The Wizard of Oz\"), but he breaks it off after he becomes infatuated with high-wire trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova of \"A Dangerous Woman\") who preys on him for his wealth. Eventually, Cleopatra makes a fool out of Hans when she marries him, but prefers to kill him so she can get her inheritance. Once they are man and wife, Cleopatra wages a campaign to poison Hans. Happily, Hans discovers her skulduggery before she can kill him. The sideshow circus carve her up and they go after her muscle-headed accomplice, Hercules, who wrestles bulls in the circus. Clocking in at a learn 63 minutes, this classic horror movie will live on in your conscious mind withhold holding up Zorro. When the film was released after extensive editing, \"Freaks\" flopped at the box office, but it qualifies as a surefire, gross-out classic that you won't forget.",

When Hans' fianc\u00e9e, Frieda, learns of Cleopatra's mal-intent she tries desperately to warn her better half. Unsuccessful in her attempt, Hans leaves her to marry Cleopatra but the other freaks have different opinions of the new wife.The 1930's was considered the beginning of the 'Golden Age' of Cinema. It was a time when talkies took to the screens and horror films got a good run. It was during this run that Tod Browning was \"asked for something horrifying\" by MGM's Head of Production. \"And I got it\" responded MGM's Head upon viewing the final film.'Freaks' is so much more than just another horror. Some would argue it's a character piece about acceptance and greed while others would simply state its sole purpose was to be controversial. Whatever your view, it certainly has a firm place in cinema history.Direction: 9/10 (Tod Browning creates some unforgettable images) Cinematography: 8/10 (Half the budget of the Oscar-winning 'Grand Hotel', but Gerstad delivers) Editing: 8/10 (A good effort by Basil Wrangell, especially in the climax) Acting: 7/10 (Not its strongest point, but certainly doesn't take away from the films purpose) Dialogue: 7/10 (Again, not one of the films strong points. Not all the cast were trained actors) Sound: 7/10 (Although voices were a new thing at the time, the engineer made the film work) Effects: 9/10 (Seeing as there really weren't any, I'll give this rating to the second unit) Art Direction: 9/10 (The sets were a joy to look at and connect the audience to the characters) Costumes: 7/10 (The small team put together some memorable outfits) Music and/or Score: 6/10 (The music, or lack of, missed some essential dramatic queues)Total Score: 77/100The film went into obscurity for almost 30 years until, in the 60's, it was revived.

It stands up well against classics such as Frankenstein, and even surpasses director Tod Browning's far more well known film, Dracula. Even though it does not have any iconic performances to rival that of Bela Lugosi, it makes far more effective use of atmosphere, producing scares that hold up even today.The film centers around the love triangle between a midget sideshow performer, his equally diminutive true love, and a scheming trapeze artist. When the sideshow artist marries the midget for his inheritance, the stage is set for a horrifying climax. This somewhat predictable plot does not give a sense of the film's true greatness.What sets Freaks apart from so many other films of its time is its excellent use of atmosphere. Whereas Dracula relied solely on Bela Lugosi's performance, Freaks takes advantage of its carnival freak show setting, which is creepy in and of itself, to generate genuine chills. The carny atmosphere goes a long way, so that the film itself was banned in many jurisdictions even though it features no explicit violence.",

            "content": "Tod Browning was a big name after 1931's \"Dracula\" so MGM hired him to direct what would become one of the most controversial films ever made, and an absolute disaster for the company and everyone involved at the time, due to the backlash the film would receive. It was banned for decades, and only released at the time with a large portion of it cut. This makes the film just over an hour-long, and gives it a very stagey and slow-burn feeling to it as much of the horror scenes would have been edited and subsequently lost forever. Be that as it may, you can not deny the power of this film, or the sheer horror it conjures. The actors are all phenomenal here, and Browning did a superb job putting this together and helping to create a very realistic film that has a very strong sense of community, as we delve into the human dramas of a travelling 'freakshow'. A nasty trapeze artist named Cleopatra and her boyfriend Hercules spend their free time sneering and winding up their 'freaks' colleagues, and when Cleopatra notices that she has been attracting the attention of Hans - the ringmaster and a dwarf - her and Hercules set out to have their fun leading him on. But when they learn that Hans has a large inheritance, they take it further and Cleo marries him, with the sinister plot at hand to murder Hans and take his money. But when the rest of the outcast performers and 'freaks' learn about this plot, they set about orchestrating their revenge, and this is what leads the film to what has and always will be one of the most terrifying conclusions in horror film history.The actors are all fantastic here and the film made a great and daring decision in casting people with real disabilities for the roles. It lends such an authenticity to the film that it almost looks documentary like. The relationships and community are very well portrayed and come across so natural. As a horror film \"Freaks\" succeeds in its final few moments where the 'freaks' take their revenge and are literally reduced to the very slithering and crawling terrors that society has regulated and portrayed them to be. They become the curious nightmare and unleash an awful fate upon Cleopatra (and originally on Hercules, but his castration was cut from the film).",

However, rather than accept him for his sincerity and devotion, she instead plots to marry and murder him for his money. After ridiculing him at their wedding, Hans and his fellow circus freaks discover her scheme to slowly poison him. One stormy night, they execute their revenge...'Freaks' was made one year after Browning's legendary 'Dracula' (1931), but after unsuccessful premieres (and being banned in Britain until 1960) it was withdrawn by its producers, MGM, and was snapped up for distribution by early exploitation pioneer Dwain Esper ('Maniac', 1934; 'Marihuana, Weed With Roots in Hell', 1936; and 'How to Undress in Front of Your Husband', 1937). Unfortunate production history notwithstanding, with the benedfit of hindsight 'Freaks' is infinitely more effective than it's more successful predecessor starring Bela Lugosi. Like the same director's 'The Unknown' (1927), 'Freaks' utilises the circus sideshow milieu (here set in France, as opposed to Spain, but obviously filmed in America), yet here focusses almost entirely on the small world of real life freaks that dwell within it. This gives the film a fantastic self-contained world within which to tell it's story, and it is this poetic invocation of the bizarre that gives 'Freaks' its unique power. It stands alone in its humanitarian and decidedly non-sensationalistic portrayal and use of real life deformities. All the 'normal' characters are portrayed as scheming and unsympathetic, save for Frozo he clown (Wallace Ford) and his girl Venus (Leila Hyams) who take the freaks as they are and thus provide the necessary emotional bridge for the audience. Though Ford gets top billing, it is the individual freaks themselves that get all the memorable scenes, whether it be the Human Torso, Prince Raoul lighting a cigarette with no arms nor legs; the marital arrangements of the Siamese Twins; or the unfeasible, grafity-defying scuttlings of Johnny Eck, missing from the waist down.The story is far more simplistic and straightforward than 'The Unknown', and for the initial parts consists of various vignettes which characterise the freaks as they lead as normal a life as they can. The mood shifts dramatically in the final quarter as the freaks exact their revenge in a chiaroscuro-lit storm, but at the end of the day, it is these human abberrations that the audience will side with. 'Freaks' is absolutely unique; a bona fide classic from the early days of sound cinema which fits into Tod Brownings's fantastically macabre oeuvre far more comfortably than the stagey 'Dracula'. It is undoubtedly amongst the most powerful and stunningly original pieces of cinema of its era.Tod Browning went onto direct Devil Doll (1936) and 'Miracles for Sale' (1939), his final film before his death in 1962. German born man-child Harry Earles (born Kurt Schneider, 1902; died in 1985) had appeared in a number of films before this, his baby-faced looks and miniscule stature making him ideal for such films as 'That's My Baby' (1926). He had already appeared in Tod Browing's earlier silent 'The Unholy Three' (1925) and its talkie remake (Jack Conway, 1930), though his performance suffers here due to difficulties in overcoming his native German accent and the poor quality of sound-recording at this early stage in film history. Real-life sister Daisie Earles (Hilda E. Schneider) is a real revelation however, and the scenes involving her are genuinely quite touching. She later appeared as a Munchkin in 'The Wizard of Oz' (Victor Fleming, 1939).",

Absolutely, it is a plea for understanding and compassion, although since Browning tries to encourage this understanding by picturing the freaks dancing in a circle singing \"La la la\", you can see how the actors didn't feel particularly empowered by the experience. I'm sure they weren't thrilled at being depicted as menacing knife-wielding monsters at the end either, but it's powerful stuff, and on its own terms it makes perfect sense; at least Harry Earles doesn't hang himself in futility a la The Children's Hour. While this thing has obviously been hacked to ribbons in any surviving version, there are still two very strong through lines: the first is embodied in the line \"Are you a man or a baby?\" - the climax does settle that question decisively in spite of the outward childishness of Schlitze and the pinheads and the la-la-las. The second theme is SEX SEX SEX, and the pervasive sexual innuendo and subtext can't have gone unnoticed by the upstanding citizens who ran screaming from the theatre; you can picture Will Hays stamping and snorting as this movie waved in his face like a red hankie.

Not after considering how 'being misfit' is now wholly mainstream in celebrity, in popular music, body art/mutilation, etc., or all of these at once.So you have to look at this with your mental telescopic lens in order to focus on what counts. What does resonate today is the plain manner in which this is conceived as a visual story, and what amounts to a noir construction. This begins with the 'special message' that scrolls on the screen as a prologue. Very clearly, what we're seeing is about an arbitrary and cruel fate -- that's noir right there, long before this notion had coalesced into established film convention.The soap opera story is a trifle, so what matters is the layering of 'watchers'.

This movie brings you behind the scenes of a carnival show and into the real lives of the \"freaks\" and their tight knit community. It shows you some of the trials and tribulations that they face (which often are not so different from most), the inequalities and injustices that others inflict upon them, and the lengths to which they will go to protect and defend one another.

            "content": "It's an astronomical stereotype to label Freaks a horror movie for it is only a horror movie to those who are afraid of such subject matter. I've learned to embrace so much that little shocks me, yet many films on obscurities enlighten me and show me a side left unseen by many. This is not a shock picture, but rather a formal wake up call, not asking for sympathy, but your attention as it shows you the life of physically different people who are inhabiting a life they are clearly uncomfortable with.The film is not a documentary, but probably not far from one. The treatment of the \"freaks\" shown by the \"normal people\" was probably close to actual circumstances. We are taken behind the scenes of a circus show, where trapeze artist Cleopatra (Baclanova) is married to the famous sideshow midget Hans (real life dwarf Henry Earles). She is a gold-digger, marrying him for his wealth, while seducing strongman Hercules (Victor) on the side. The freaks learn to accept Hans' wife Cleopatra, despite her normality and agree that she is \"one of them\" in a rather eerie ritual.The rest of the film focuses on giving each of the circus members their own deserved time. One scene involves \"The Living Torso,\" a man with no arms or legs, lighting a cigarette using only his tongue. The man is played by Prince Randian, who apparently lived to be 63, despite his horrible setbacks. We're also shown microcephalics, dubbed \"pinheads,\" those with very small, abnormally shaped skulls. They are Jenny and Elvira Snow. Not to mention the conjoined sisters, \"The Bearded Lady,\" \"The Skeleton Man,\" and a plethora of other characters who live their life to provide odd amusement to others.There can be two arguments to exploiting these people. One could say that it is wrong to exploit anyone, period. One could also bring up that it was extremely unlikely that these people could've amounted to anything in the boundaries of \"normal\" (what job could you give to a person with no arms or legs?), and that many of the people involved wound up living comfortably and dying content with their lives. I'm torn, as usual. I see both sides as true, but side more comfortably with my idea that no human being should be exploited.A year prior to this, director Tod Browning made the iconic Dracula, and to commit to a project of this controversial magnitude afterwards was simply unprecedented. Browning had been exposed to a circus act quite like this, and developed this project for years before its 1932 release. It was originally slated to be a ninety minute picture, but sadly, because of censorship and controversy, a third of the film was cut and the only existing version is the sixty-two minute version. The other twenty-eight minutes have been declared \"lost.\" Back on the subject of exploitation, that is the true reason why the film succeeds. It lacks it. For a picture exploring the absurd and virtually unknown, it has a surprising amount of respect, care, and warmth to firmly assure the audience this is not tongue and cheek. This was not made for the sole purpose to shock, but to inform people about what these men and women had to endure. People often ask me what I think of shock pictures. I am intrigued by their concept, but very few of them resonate with the human aspect I hunger for. If they are done in satire or in the form of informative criticism or exploration, then I have no problem with them. If they are done for the sole purpose of shocking and are consistently trying to one-up their last instance (The Human Centipede and its sequel, respectively), then it becomes monotonous and a competition where there is no opponent. The only shock-filmmaker I can think of that has done a wonderful job of incorporating criticism, commentary, and a satirical critique on society is the transgressive director John Waters, one of my many directorial influences.Browning's Freaks could later be dubbed \"Required Viewing\" by me because of its natural look, its harmless depiction of the unknown, and the poor treatment and mockery of the unfortunate. It very much reminds me of the Frederick Wiseman documentary, Titicut Follies, going behind closed doors focusing on the sickening treatment of helpless patients at a local mental hospital. Both make a very clear message without directly stating it, and both show that shocking the viewer with content should come natural rather than forced. Both were recommended to me by my uncle. How synonymous.Starring: Wallace Ford, Leila Hyams, Olga Baclanova, Henry Victor, Harry Earles, Jenny Lee Snow, Elvira Snow, Olga Roderick, Peter Robinson, and Prince Randian. Directed by: Tod Browning.",

The writer was telling a story (the people in 1932 apparently didn't get it!) that side-show \"freaks\" are very human, too.  In society, they would likely have been ostracized and been very lonely, but in the side-show environment, they had the companionship and comfort of each other.  Together, they were like one big family--a family who looked out for and fiercely defended one another.  It also taught that evil and horrible deeds can result in evil and horrible payback.

Regardless of whether or not this tops your list, I claim that one does have to see Freaks (1932). Any discussion of \"the most disturbing movie of all time\" would have to include a mention of this film.The film concerns people with birth defects and other deformities and was made, not with makeup, but with actors and actresses that had these conditions in real life (i.e., the siamese twins are real conjoined siblings; and the \"pinheads\" are actual microcephalics).If one has a shred of humanity within oneself, then you'll be able to sit through this and try to see the movie through the eyes of the freaks. The chills come as one thinks about what really -would- happen if sideshow exhibit people decided to take their revenge on those that humiliate and exploit them. And you will understand that the \"monster\" in this film is not the very weird looking people, but perhaps one of the \"beautiful\" \"normal\" persons.Good reasons to see it include its impact since its release (the IMDb \"movie connections\" page for it is extensive). Lots of other people have seen it and can't forget it and they talk about it. Cultural references are out there; every time you hear \"one of us, one of us\" you will revisit that special feeling and horror. It was banned because it came on the scene just as the censors were given control, so it wasn't shown for decades. See \"trivia\"; there are still parts of the USA in which it is technically illegal to show this film.And that you possibly will be like me, and think about it, and reflect on it, for the rest of your life.It might not be your particular \"most disturbing movie of all time\", but as part of one's education, one sit-through is required, if you can stomach it.",

The horror to me was not so much in how the deformed people looked but more in the way they were treated by some of the people not having a physical handicap. There were certainly a few handicaps I had never seen or heard of such as the \"pinheads\" and people with bird like faces. And they didn't need masks or other special attributes to look deformed, that's how they really were. Except for the half-man, half-woman who was probably a faker. It was also interesting to read upon the biographies of all of the \"freaks\" and see that most of them could live a relative normal life despite their handicap or that their handicap actually earned them a living. The story is simple and straightforward. I liked how the freaks all pulled together when one of them was hurt or disadvantaged. Despite the lost footage (I have read it was actually some 30 minutes longer) the movie doesn't feel incomplete. I feel it's more of a documentary than an actual movie but certainly an important and impressive piece of cinema giving the viewer an insight in the private and social lives of these people ( mostly when they were not performing for the circus). On a personal note I thought the armless girl and the dwarf girl Frieda were really beautiful. I also read Johnny Eck (the man with no legs therefore walking on his hands) had with his brother a very special spooky act with his legs running away. I hope there are records made of that, would love to see it! Anyway Freaks scores high points for me for the big impression it made on me alone.",

            "content": "\"Freaks\" is actually a very well made movie with a truly interesting story - and yet, at the same time, it's a very difficult and uncomfortable movie to watch. It's set mostly among the so-called \"sideshow freaks\" of an early 20th century circus, and it focuses primarily on the relationship between Hans (a \"little person\" - who would have been called a midget at the time this movie was made) and Cleopatra - a physically \"normal\" and beautiful trapeze artist. The movie opens effectively with an unrevealed mystery about Cleopatra and then becomes a flashback to expain what happened. Hans becomes enamoured with Cleopatra and essentially ditches his diminutive girfriend to marry her - except that Cleopatra has no interest in Hans at all - but does have an interest in the rather large inheritance that's his. She has comtempt for the other sideshow \"performers\" and she tries to poison Hans to get at his money. But once she's found out, the \"freaks\" take their revenge on her for her attitude and actions.So it is a decent story. It's a completely voyeuristic movie, letting viewers into a world they would rarely if ever see. There are a lot of uncomfortable questions that get raised. What happens when the \"Siamese twins\" get married? How do they ... well ... with their own husbands, but still together, with it being obviously portrayed that each could feel what the other was feeling at any given time? What about the half man-half woman? The face was half man and half woman, but what about ... well ... everything else? I didn't really like thinking about these things, but at the same time I couldn't help it. This made it into the theatres because it was pre-code, although I understand that it was still very heavily edited to make it acceptable for viewing - making me wonder what was cut out? So, yes, watching this is a really uncomfortable experience, and the ending was a bit of a mystery. We see the beautiful Cleopatra's fate (but there's no real explanation of how she became what she became - from what I understand much of the explanation was among the scenes that were cut.) The actual ending of the movie was a later addition to lighten it up a bit with a happier ending.There is a lot to like about this movie. I could appreciate the sense of close-knit community (and even family) that the \"freaks\" felt for one another, which led to them taking their revenge on Cleopatra for her outrages against not only Hans but all of them. I could appreciate the decent performances that were given by people who really did work in carnival sideshows (and it does provoke the thought - which many have argued - that as distasteful as the whole environment is to modern sensibilities, in the context of that day these sideshows actually gave people with disabilities an opportunity to at least make a living and have a degree of independence rather than being shut away in institutions.)The movie was considered a failure in 1932 and pretty much destroyed the career of director Tod Browning (who just the year before had directed Bela Lugosi in \"Dracula.\") It was also the last signficant role for Olga Baclanova (who played Cleopatra) although that had more to do with her difficulty adjusting to talkies after a busy silent film career than with her involvement with \"Freaks.\" Like \"Dracula\" this movie is usually categorized as a horror movie, but it really isn't. To be honest I'm not quite sure how to categorize it, but \"horror\" it isn't. The reviews of that day that I've come across are troubling because they reject the movie not because of its exploitive nature but because they seem to feel that such \"human oddities\" simply shouldn't be seen on screen. It's a very different kind of movie from a very different time. I can't bring myself to say that it's enjoyable - but it is worth watching. (6/10)",

This film also builds great suspense and tension near the end when the \"freaks\" are putting their plan into action for Hans. The acting is very good in this film of course Harry Earles, a great performance by Olga Baclanova and Henry Victor, and another great acting performance from Daisy Earles too.

            "content": "Tod Browning's 'Freaks' truly is one of those films whose reputation precedes it. In its depiction of a group of carnival performers, the film notoriously cast real life \"freaks\" (including dwarfs, Siamese twins, microcephalics (people with undersized heads), and people born without limbs etc.) amongst professional actors and which, upon its release, disgusted critics and audiences alike (there is a famous story that novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald saw the Siamese twins at MGM studio's canteen whilst having his lunch and had to leave to be sick). The film was then quickly removed from cinemas, banned in many countries, and destroyed Browning's career. However, since its rediscovery in the 1960s, consensus on the film has shifted away (albeit not completely) from seeing it as a grotesque exploitation of those involved and more towards that of a modern day morality fable.In the film Hans the dwarf (Harry Earles) falls in love and subsequently marries a glamorous and un-malformed trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), in the process breaking the heart of fellow dwarf Frieda (Daisy Earles), who loves Hans dearly. However, Cleopatra is only using Hans for his independent wealth and is double-timing him with fellow \"normal\" Hercules the Strong-man (Henry Victor). However, this being unknown to the freaks, they accept Cleopatra as one of their own at the infamous wedding party scene with their eerie chant of \"Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble\u0085one of us, one of us!\", a line which has since entered the pop-culture lexicon. Cleopatra is horrified, spurns the freaks' acceptance, and attempts to poison Hans in order to claim his wealth. Upto this point the \"freaks\" have been portrayed as, below their disfigurements, normal after all. They are seen to frolic, peg out washing, banter with the more sympathetic normals among the troupe, and you will be left agog as you watch Radian rolling a cigarette without the aid of limbs. Such a treatment is to be expected from a modern audience, and is fully appreciated when you learn that Browning himself had run away at the age of 16 to join such a carnival. However, this domestication of beings that at first sight have the power to genuinely invoke fear is revealed to be a form of psychological misdirection when we see the gruesome revenge they enact on Cleopatra and Hercules with the force of a primal nightmare.People often claim that Browning's intention had been to show the \"freaks\", beyond their physical malformations, to be the keepers of accepted, \"normal\" morality, while those who conform to physical normality are shown to be the spiritually malformed \"freaks\". In and of itself this is a powerful enough idea but I feel another (all the more darker) level of interpretation can added in that, given the monstrous nature of the revenge sequence, the audience can reflect on just how virtuous the \"physical freaks\" are after all: are their actions the result of a lifetime of alienation and humiliation which is suffered afresh every time someone pays to peer at them, or are human souls inherently ugly regardless of the physical form they inhabit? The ambiguity is no doubt part of what has kept the film a challenging and controversial work over 80 years(!) since it was released, and while it could also be debated if the film belongs in the category of horror, what can be said for sure is that it is certainly a film with the power to horrify, with images and themes that disconcert the viewer, linger in the mind, writhing and squirming like the protagonists in the famous climax.

            "content": "This is simply one of the most incredable films of the 1930's. It is definately the creative climax of Tod Browning's carreer, dispite being overshadowed by Dracula, not to mention the film's own infamy. It's sad, really. This is regarded as a disturbing, disgusting THING, much like the deformed individuals it was desperately trying not to portray in such a manner. And, like those individuals, this film really has a lot more heart than it is often given credit for. The problem is, many people simply can't look past what they see. Yes, it is regarded as a great piece of exploitation horror, but the film, save for the climax, is really much more of an observational drama with undercurrents of suspense. If Browning's intention was, indeed, shock value, i think he went deeper than he intended to. However, I think we see a side of Browning's personal fears, as well as his being humbled by a lot of other things in his earlier life, comming into play. Notice how Browning's movies tend to deal with deformity. He worked with a circus early in life, and did a lot of wierd stunts dealing with death. In one of his activities, someone actually got killed. The things he had seen, as well as his own demons with alcohol, really come up a lot, particularily once the murder plot against Hans the midgit is set into motion and we begin to see how the \"freaks\" are really viewed by the beautiful trapeeze girl and her strongman lover, as well as some of the lesser members of the circus. (PLOT SPOILER AHEAD:) That incredible wedding scene (\"One of Us!\") where the drunken beautiful bride finally comes right out and screams \"Filthy, Slimy FREAKS! FREAKS! FREAKS!\" To almost complete silence after the chant from the sideshow crowd, reveals a deep sort of pain that transcends a lot of the other off-color ribbing and sniggering at the \"freaks\" through the earlier parts of the film. It is truly an incredable work. A Much better picture of human interaction and perception of differences than \"I am Sam\". Freaks is a movie everyone should see--just don't expect a mindless gory look at deformed monsters trying to kill people, and don't expect not to be moved. This is MUCH, so much more than a simple exploitation film.",

Seriously, it is just seems so f*cked up and that does go to show how back then, the way they treated people with disabilities rotten. I have to say, although the ending was brutal, it was a good revenge plan at the same time. I mean, she was cruel and deceitful to Hans especially trying to kill him with poison. I suppose maybe that scene considered this as a dangerous movie or the fact, it had disabled people on it. This is my first time ever watching a 1930s film that showed people with different needs.

After all, Universal's monsters were created with makeup.Anyway, I just wanted to point out something I caught on TCM's most recent showing of this movie. Apparently, more than one version of this movie exists.The version that aired last week on TCM starts with a single title card. It stays on-screen long enough to read. Then someone rips it across the middle, and we see that it's a carnival poster. In the next shot we see the crumpled poster in the hands of a carnival barker, and he begins escorting an audience through the freak show. No doubt this is the way the movie was intended to begin.Well, the funny thing is that this isn't the only version of this movie. I have a VHS copy that I taped from TNT in '89 or '90, back when TNT was still showing black-and-white movies.The TNT version starts with the same single title card. Then there's a cut to one of the longest crawling text frames ever seen in the history of motion pictures. I swear to god, this crawling text must last two full minutes. The text basically apologizes for the movie and reminds the audience that people born with birth defects are human, too, and says they deserve our sympathy and support. Tinny classical music plays in the background.And then, finally, the movie cuts to the carnival barker.My guess is that this TNT version was an early re-release. The movie created a storm of protest on the original release and no doubt was a bit of an embarrassment, hence the apology.Years later, \"Freaks\" was still an embarrassment. Back in the '70s and '80s, when I was growing up, it was one of those movies you read about in horror-movie fan magazines but never saw on broadcast TV. It really wasn't until the Turner stations went on the air that anyone had a chance to see it. For all I know, that TNT showing I caught in '89 or '90 might have been its first airing in years.Guess I'll have to find that TNT version and compare it to the version shown on TCM. I'll betcha that the crawling-text apology isn't the only change that was made for the re-release.Erik Smith Olympia, Wash.",

We are so overwhelmed with the all important and all truthful dogmatic manifesto of the Totalitarian Political Correctness Tyrants and the great hordes of self-appointed Arbiters of all that they consider to be proper to be discussed, displayed and hence, installed as what they deem should be our universal belief system. There would be no need for any debate or questioning. If one found objection or even area for discussion, they would be shouted down, branded as being bigoted and otherwise unfit to make themselves heard.#Fortunately, that is now and this was then. In 1932 a Master Film Director like Tod Browning was given the freedom and opportunity to take a story about a stuck-up, nasty space-pants bitch of a stuck-up female Star Circus Performer and her trivializing and totally cold-hearted treatment of a na\u00efve Dwarf Performer; as well as her ridding rough-shod over all of the members of the Side Show Troupe, who already occupy a marginal and dubious position in society and the Circus Social stratification.#Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer honchos like Mr. Irving Thalberg were well aware that the loss of \"the Man of a Thousand Faces\" in the masterfully shocking and deeply moving, Lon Chaney to Cancer in 1930, left a huge void in the MGM output; as well as a gaping hole in the entire Hollywood scene. The master of the macabre and the offbeat had done only one Talkie, a remake of 1925's THE UNHOLY THREE. (Coincidentally the original being also a Todd Browning film.*) #The loss of Mr. Chaney meant that new talent and new ideas would have to be found. Lon was the one considered by Mr. Carl Laemmle of Universal Pictures as the lead in both his projects of filming both FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula. Fortunately a couple of guys by name of Karloff and Lugosi came along to fill the bill.#Yet the MGM 'suits' realized that some outstanding work was needed to put MGM back up there in contention for the Fright Film Championship; which Universal seemed to have comfortably tucked under its arm ever since the advent of sound. The result was an unshackled and free-hand approach by Mr. Browning. He had the experience and deserved reputation about handling Horror Films from his track record with titles such as London AFTER MIDNIGHT (MGM, 1927) and Dracula (Universal, 1931).#Mr. Browning knew that atmosphere and a dark, disturbing look of the sets were important to setting the stage; but he would go the extra mile in casting the right people in the roles to give believability to the viewer-ship. But it would have to be some extra, extra angle to employ in order to leave a permanent shock in the old psyche! #Director Browning enlisted the members of the Side Show world of \"Human Oddities\" both to act as a great attention grabber and to set the mood even further down the line toward the bizarre and the horrific. The various performers did a fine job in playing for the camera and plying their trade for the celluloid cinematic permanent historical record.** #The story pulls no punches. A lousy tramp of a Circus \"Star\", Venus (Leila Hymas) thinks nothing of playing dirty with the affections of the Midget Hans (Harry Earles); even leading him into a hopeless and loveless relationship. Love being truly blind, Hans walks into a trap and eventual heartbreak with eyes wide open. The Side Show \"Freaks\" take it upon themselves and put Venus on Trial and exact a punishment on her for her #But alas, at this juncture the Studio's heretofore effective \"hands-off\" policy toward the Film was rescinded in order to tack on an unnecessary, useless and completely anti-climactic scene and sort of disclaimer. It doth appear that FREAKS presented the moviegoers of 1932 with would most certainly be the most unforgettable, disturbing and horrifying of an ending in any Film, ever.#This anti-artistic action by MGM's Front Office was a sort of trite slice of malarkey which only put a sort of cinematic appendix (an obsolete organ with no known present function) onto the end of a masterpiece.#Yet even then they couldn't ruin it! If you haven't seen it, please do so; then tell me if you don't agree.NOTE * No, Schultz, we're not trying to say that Tod Browning did not direct the 1930 Talkie version of THE UNHOLY THREE; but rather it was one Jack Conway.NOTE ** The scenes with the \"freaks\" are at once fascinating, shocking, highly energetic and yet tearfully sad; as one's heart must go out to those so afflicted in life. Oddly enough, although most States now have legislation on the books prohibiting such public displays; the main opposition to such laws came from the Side Show Performers themselves. After all, it might have been a strange and distasteful bit of \"showbiz\"; yet it was their livelihood. In some cases we're told it was not so very bad a living at that! POODLE SCHNITZ!!",

            "content": "This under-appreciated masterpiece, expertly crafted by Tod Browning, was banned and locked away for many years after its 1932 release because of its eerie and unsettling realness brought by the real-life cast of human oddities.  The story concerns a cruel trapeze artist who, along with the strong man, deceivingly entices the sideshow dwarf in hopes of getting hold of his wealth.  When she attempts to kill him, she riles the other freaks and they take gruesome vengeance upon her.  Along the way, we are given a glimpse of the everyday lives and tribulations of the freaks and thusly we see that they are unique human (moreso) despite their appearances.  In contrast, the beautiful (and normal) trapeze artist and her paramour are shown to be the dark beasts with black hearts.  While not outright scary, it does show some disturbing moments along with the dramatic storyline. Prime examples:  \"The Wedding Feast\"...in which (after she and Hans, the dwarf, are married) the freaks pound the table chanting \"Gooble-gobble! Gooble-gobble! We accept her! We Accept her!  One of us!  One of Us!\" while passing a ritualistic chalise.  The other occurs near the ending, where the strongman is pursued in a rainstorm by the freaks.  Truly unsettling is the sight of the freaks slithering and crawling through the mud with knives...hate and anger in their eyes.  This is a classic not to be missed by the film buff  or the dyed-in-the-wool horror fans of the Old School of Fear.  In today's age of CGI's and animatronics, this film could not be remade without the taint of technology.  What made the film so compassionate were the portrayals of the freaks.  The viewer can feel and sympathsize for the characters because, unlike CGI characters, they are REAL.  By the end, one is left with a more profound respect for things called \"unnatural\" or ugly.",

He apparently was being altered with a knife when lightning hits a tree near Cleopatra. All that remains of the sequence is Cleopatra screaming and another quick cut: \"Some said it was the storm, some said it was the freaks, there she is!\" Cleopatra is quacking and one of her eyes is half shut, and in the second exhibit Hercules was also shown as a duck, emasculated and singing to Cleopatra in a soprano voice that he still loved her. I read that in some review about the confusing endings to some surviving prints. I doubted it was trued until I found evidence of this missing scene at the following web site and I hope IMDb will allow it to be posted:http://www.classichorror.free-online.co.uk/tod.htmThis is VERY IMPORTANT information for fans of this strange movie.

He was a GENIUS at portraying the supernatural, and his slow, deliberate pacing adds MUCH to the atmosphereof horror in ALL his films.

So I won't go into the synopsis & spoilers of the film because I feel the legend of this film is too well known, and also as well to keep the element of suspense for those new to watching the film. This is a film that you just keep expecting the long dead P.T. Barnum to make a cameo appearance in. This is a film he would have been proud of. As with all of Tod Browning's MGM pictures, Freaks is drastically cut in the modern form that we are able to see it today. A whole section concerning the goings on in a Dime Museum were filmed by Browning and crew. As with the murder of a baby girl by the midget in Browning's silent \"The Unholy Three\", the Dime Museum was completely excised most probably by Irving Thalberg himself to keep Freaks down to a 60-65 minute running time for the theatres. Thalberg was the final(and uncredited) editor on most of Browning's pictures. We can only hope that if there's a serious restoration of Freaks someday, these sequences in the Dime Museum can be found and put back in the way Tod finished and wanted the film. Hopefully the footage is not irretrievably lost and is just misplaced.",

            "content": "Director Tod Browning might be more well-known for Dracula, which was released in 1931, but he was also behind this gem of a movie \u2014 based on the short story \"Spurs\" by Tod Robbins \u2014 that highlights the need for strong community in the face of oppression and emphasizes how the real \"freaks\" in our world may not be who you would guess at first glance.It didn't entirely receive the greatest reviews upon its release. One, written in Harrison's Reports, stated: \"Any one who considers this entertainment should be placed in the pathological ward in some hospital.\" (I think there are people who would say that about most horror movies these days.) Beyond simple dislike, many expressed revulsion and disgust\u0085 it was a commercial failure and wound up banned in the UK for 30 years. Browning's career never fully recovered.Synopsis: sideshow midget Hans (Harry Earles) may be engaged to Frieda (Daisy Earles, the real-life sister of Harry), but he is smitten with Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). When she agrees to marry him, he is over the moon. But he soon comes to find out that she has conspired with Hercules (Henry Victor) to poison him and inherit his wealth, which is when the freaks get their revenge\u0085** SPOILERS! **I really ended up enjoying this movie more than I expected. The snippets of the carnival workers' every day lives \u2014 from siblings telling jokes to each other to the Bearded Woman giving birth to her baby \u2014 is a great touch, doing wonders to make us empathize with them and their unique existence and highlighting the community they have created.I'd like to think we, as a society, are more accepting of those we deem different now in 2017 than we may have been in the early 30s (though I know we haven't improved a whole lot\u0085), but some of the initial negative reactions in response to this movie was due to the \"freaks\" themselves and their physical deformities. Many real life circus workers were cast and I think the gut reaction to them and their appearance goes a long way in making us analyze why we associate capacity for evil with outward physical traits. The real evil in this movie lies in those circus performers who appear \"normal\" to the outside world.The dinner scene \u2014 possibly the most well-known of the entire film \u2014 manages to be uncomfortable throughout its entirety, even before the explosive ending. Cleopatra is infuriated by the mere idea of being accepted as \"one of us\" with the freaks, despite them being perfectly kind and gracious to her. The idea of being known as part of their group \u2014 associated in any way beyond the circus itself \u2014 is repulsive.The entire chase scene is terrifying, honestly. It looks gorgeous in black and white, and the heavy rain only adds to the chaos. Rumbling thunder, flashes of lightning, and various freaks crawling (or rolling) their way towards Hercules to exact their revenge\u0085 honestly gave me chills. So good.Ultimately a great film, well worth the watch (and it's only about an hour long!).",

            "content": "Part of what makes \"Freaks\" so intriguing is how much it manages to humanize the \"freaks\", and in a span of one hour and four minutes, too. This isn't one of those movies where the physically or mentally disabled characters serve as angelic martyrs, with pure souls their more normal counterparts can only hope to emulate someday. The \"freaks\" are very distinctive personalities, from the sadly pining Frieda to the opinionated Violet to the shy \"pinheads\" to Hans, a hotblooded man with a man's longing for a beautiful woman, a fact belied by his tiny stature and high voice.Romantic/sexual relationships abound among the freaks: Hans and Frieda are engaged, the bearded lady gives birth to a daughter fathered by the \"human skeleton\", one Siamese twin is married by the end and the other is engaged (and to a man very distinct from her sister's husband). To the best of their abilities, the freaks live like everyone else. They want new hats, they smoke cigarettes, they sit around the dinner table eating, and if they do the latter two without arms, we overcome the morbid amazement early on. We have to. There are so many \"freaks\", with so many different disabilities, with so much time on screen that the shock factor fades fast and we become intrigued by who they are, as well as what they look like. (Speaking of what they look like, Johnny Eck, the man with no arms who walks on his hands, is absolutely gorgeous. His eyes are reminiscent of a young Sal Mineo.) Among the \"big people\", Leila Hyams stands out as Venus and provides a contrast to the scheming Cleopatra. She's kind but not patronizing; when Frieda is hanging the laundry on the line, Venus asks her about Hans in the same way that she might ask any woman about her boyfriend. Wallace Ford is also good as Phroso, a clown and Venus's eventual love interest. (There's a funny scene where we see him sitting in a bathtub, not wearing any clothes that we can see, when Venus walks by and begins talking to him. Our eyes widen. Is she seeing him naked? Then after a minute or so he climbs out the bottom of the tub, and we see that he's been adding wheels to the legs, while wearing pants.) If \"Freaks\" has a major flaw, it's that Cleopatra and Hercules never come across as quite real. They're so selfish, so conniving, so horrible that they're squarely in the dark side of humanity without a single ray of light to be seen. Still, the freaks are interesting enough that we don't care much. We want to root for them, and Cleopatra and Hercules's treatment of them gives us a good reason to.The opening introduction claims that there will never be another film like \"Freaks\", and there never will be. Film will never return to the point in its history that it was at in 1932, and even if another film is made in which most of the cast has physical deformities or abnormalities, modern attitudes will pervade it. \"Freaks\" is decidedly unmodern, but with universal themes of being an outsider and longing for what you can never have.",

Two that stand out are Prince Randian (The Living Torso) who can roll his own cigarettes and smoke them without any arms (!!!) and Frances O'Connor (Armless Girl) who is super skilful at using her feet.

            "content": "***VERY MINOR SPOILERS***There are already tons of reviews posted, but I thought I would throw in my two cents. I had wanted to see this movie ever since I saw it listed as the #3 cult film of all time in a magazine in 2003. Two years later I finally got around to purchasing the DVD. I had already read so much about the movie and its cast that I felt like I already knew so much about it without even seeing it yet. But in a way, I was actually scared to watch it, just from what I'd heard about it and how disturbing it was etc. I put the DVD in as soon as it arrived in my mail and sat down to watch it, feeling rather nervous. What I saw though, was not something to be scared of or disturbed by. Maybe it's because I already had seen photos of the \"freaks\" and knew the plot, but I didn't find this movie scary in the least. Actually I found myself feeling quite the opposite. I became very drawn to each of the characters and feeling fondly and sympathetic to them. While the \"freaks\" are all fascinating in their own way, one in particular intrigued me, which was Johnny Eck the Half Boy. This guy is so normal-looking from the waist up that you would never even know anything was wrong with him if he was sitting behind a desk or something. To me, there was just nothing whatsoever disturbing about this incredibly handsome young man. And after doing some more research on his life, I found out what an incredible person he was. He was a very gifted artist, story-teller, race car enthusiast, musician, and even started a business with his twin brother (who was born completely normal by the way) of running a child-sized train which children would pay money to take rides on. He actually lived a pretty happy life until a few years before his death when he was robbed in his own house. He spent his remaining years angry at the world, a recluse in his home. My point of going off on this tangent about Johnny is that the so-called \"freaks\" in this movie are not really all that different than the rest of us, save for the \"pinheads\" who suffered from mental disabilities as well as physical. The rest of them however, learned to adapt and perform every day tasks, as we see with Randian lighting his cigarette, Frances eating her dinner by holding her utensils with her feet, and the Hilton sisters making their bed. The \"freaks\" are obviously what makes this movie unique, but the story isn't bad either. But if you're looking for a film that showcases great acting talents, this may not be the one for you. Being one of the first \"talkies,\" it comes across as a bit stage-y and over-dramatic with corny lines. And since some of the actors have heavy accents, it's sometimes difficult to make out what they are saying. But that minor complaint aside, this is a wonderful movie that I think every film aficionado should see. No film like this will ever be made again because of the political correctiveness of \"exploiting\" people with physical differences, not to mention the fact that many of these deformities are nowadays curable and preventable. Also, circus sideshow attractions have pretty much gone by the wayside and aren't around as much as they were back then. These reasons make this film a definite one-of-a-kind. Whether you love it or hate it, you can't say it didn't at least leave you thinking",

I realize he was making a 'horror' film. Perhaps his choice in using real freaks was a bad one.At any rate, Browning seems as cruel as those who scoffed at the freaks by painting them as true monsters at the end of the film. Did the princess deserve her mutilation at the film's end?She certainly was an unsympathetic character, but her butchery at the hands of the 'freaks' leaves the viewer with nothing redeeming in the end.I thought the movie was going to take a more interesting turn.Then again, I must profess my enjoyment of the wedding dinner scene. Truly one of the oddest spectacles ever filmed on screen.But I watch this film feeling that Browning himself may have been confused about the subject matter. It might have been better had he made some sort of sympathetic documentary on these curious circus folk.I give this film a seven, only because it was a daring film to make in its time (and had been banned for some forty years).

Two of the leads are dwarfs and much of the supporting characters are disabled or disfigured, some in major ways. The plot is simple. An attractive trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money, then plots to murder him with her lover, the circus strong man. The film was directed by Tod Browning who directed the popular \"Dracula\" starring Bela Lugosi. Although the acting is just decent most of the time (as in most 30's movies), you really feel for the characters. However, as short as the movie is, I found a small part of it to drag slightly. There really has not been a movie quite like it. What I like best about this film is how most of the so-called normal folks are the ones who are the real freaks and the \"freaks\" are the ones found to be most emotionally accessible. I like the \"freaky\" ending as well! Good stuff!",

            "content": "FREAKS was, for a long time, one of my favorite 1930's movie. But now, I have a different point of view about it, because I just finished reading an extraordinairy book, by Robert Bogdan (a sociologist): Freak show : Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit (1988). It's very interesting to note that Tod Browning had, back in 1932, the same vision of the freak show that the author will have, through his historical and sociological analyse more than 50 years later. It simply - well, perhaps not so simply! - tells that the freak show was showing plain folks that these creatures had their normal lifes, can do the same things that just plain folks. Here, Browning presents Randion smoking a cigarette, even if he had no arms and legs. He shows one of the Hilton sisters married and the other one that will be (In real life, the twins had big problems with that...) Browing shows that the freaks are good and normals, and that the normal people (of the circus) are bad. But freaks are so normal that they can think of a revenge...  Bogdan tells us also that the freaks were accepted by the circus and carnivals as entertainers. Browning shows us that too, except in the case of the strong man and the trapezist. I'm sure Tod Browning had a very low budget for this film. Henry Victor (strong man) and Olga Baclanova (trapezist) were really bad, so are Daisy and Harry Earles (the midgets). But did Louis B. Mayer, of MGM, wants one of his stars plays in that?  Browning also sets most of the prototype of people working in the sideshows. Some of them(Randion & the Hilton sisters) were alreay famous in the circus / carnival / amusement park circuit. Note the two finales: the real one, where miss Olga becomes ONE OF US, and the MGM finale, where true love finds it's way. Very very interesting film, and very unique. No one ever done something like thatafter.",

            "content": "In the first place, this movie was originally made to compete with the Universal Horror films, as though these human beings who are the titular \"freaks\" are not human. Director Tod Browning was still reeling from the loss of his big star, Lon Chaney, to cancer, and thought this would be a good follow up to his previous horror films without Chaney. And after all, he had just finished directing Dracula.Actually, it paints a very sympathetic picture of the disabled and deformed circus performers, who, at this time of limited medical knowledge and abounding prejudice, were very limited in what they could do in life. They have a very deep camaraderie that is shown through such events as the birth of a child to the bearded lady and the engagement of one of the conjoined twins. Since the other twin is already married, there is much arguing over what the logistics are going to be in these two marriages.The actual \"monsters\" in this film are the acrobat \"Cleopatra\" (Olga Baclanova), and strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), who are having an affair. Two physical specimens with monstrous morality. When the dwarf Hans is captivated by Cleopatra's beauty, she at first teases him by leading him on. But then he starts giving her expensive jewelry and she decides to keep up the ruse. When Freida, Hans' dwarf girlfriend, comes to Cleopatra and asks her to stop teasing him, she accidentally tips off Cleo to the fact that Hans has inherited a great fortune. Hercules and Cleo then plan to get Hans to marry Cleo and then poison him so she can inherit his money. But the two don't realize the close strong bond that the circus performers have with one another and that they are literally each others eyes and ears. Complications ensue.The film was originally set to run at 90 minutes, but test audiences were so revolted that 30 minutes were cut out so that the remaining film only runs at an hour. Then a scene was tacked on at the end to show Hans' grief over what has ultimately happened. MGM would often add an end scene that really didn't fit the mood of the rest the film during Irving Thalberg's reign there to wrap things up.This film pretty much finished the career of director Browning as afterwards he only directed a farcical sound remake of a silent film he had made at MGM and one other film and then retired. This was a good late role for Olga Baclanova. She had a very thick Russian accent and had some great late silent roles at Paramount, but talking film had not been kind to her career. This really gave her one last great role where her accent really fit into the plot, plus this was not a film where lots of dialogue was called for, and she was very good at using gestures and expressions to convey emotion.In the 1960s this film got a fresh look, and today is widely celebrated as having been ahead of its time. The horror is implied and left up to your imagination as to just HOW it happened, and the empathy shown the circus performers is profound. It even got a separate DVD release with commentary.",

People reaching a breaking point, where after a life of injustice have finally had enough and take matters into their own hands. The vast majority of this film and I dare say the entire film is entirely sympathetic to the \"Freaks\". If anything, the horror element stems entirely from watching the incredible mistreatment of the so-called \"Freaks\" by the so-called \"Normals\" for all but the last 5 or 10 minutes or so. Sadly the advertising campaign played upon the fears of the people of the era and I guess these fears still linger even today.

Knowing a lot about the production (thanks to Skaal and Co.) doesn't really help me too much, it just excuses some absurd elements (like the totally out of hand comic \"relief\", which was inserted over and above the director's control).  This film marked Tod Browning's return to MGM, where he had changed cinema forever with his series of films which basically made the transition from \"Perils of Pauline\" type sensational adventure in an underworld setting to films which were more genuinely modern \"thrillers\".  However, the thriller element in Freaks is downplayed in favor of human interest, a bizarre choice given that Browning is barely capable of humanizing ANYONE.  His forte is in the larger than life and the gothic (one and the same, really), so trying to have it both ways with the freaks themselves (make them more \"human\" and at the same time the object of fear and horror) doesn't really work; it would take MUCH more subtlety of someone like, say, David Lynch.That said, there is much to recommend that everyone seriously interested in film should see this film.  It breaks with the traditional schism in film between spectacle and narrative, placing far more emphasis than usual in the former.  This made it a perfect candidate for roadshow exploitation in the decades following its failure, during which time it was exhibited with an added \"educational\" introduction (still found on many video prints of the film, despite the fact that neither the producer nor director approved it) as a roadshow exploitation specialty under the title \"Forbidden Love\" by Kroger Babb's midwest organization.This film also has a lot of interest for anyone interested in the carnival/roadshow roots of film.  This is related to the issue of spectacle.... the early films emphasized spectacle, often to the point that if there was enough nudity, violence, or exotic scenery, the film could sell without any plot at all (Edison and Co. produced a short film entitled \"Electrocution of an Elephant\" which featured nothing but said spectacle). This had been largely wiped out by the 1930s, when \"Freaks\" was made, by the emphasis on narrative cohesion.  In fact, narrative was usually a ploy Hollywood used to excuse the often very naked exploitation value of the films themselves (ask any writer).  \"Freaks\" makes very little bones about being what it is, shirking 15 years of Hollywood's increased identification with \"theater\" for its earlier, and more honest, association with vauldeville and carnival.",

The 'hook' here is the unusual cast, and I don't mean Roscoe Ates or Wallace Ford; the reason to watch the picture is the collection of unfortunates that have little to do with the plot and everything to do with commercialism.Pushing aside some of the high-minded crap put forth by some reviewers, I gave this movie a rating of six.

It is perfectly directed, perfectly acted, perfectly done.It is the story of a circus troupe. It begins with a \"come on\" which gives us an idea of what it is about, and it goes into what looks like a slice of life in the circus, with various circus folk coming and going through their lives.We quickly get a look at how these characters feel. And many are true circus characters, because this was before special effects. Most of these people are true to life.It is called \"Freaks\", because the family life of those in the \"freak\" show is a true society. It lives with its rules and inspirations. These people are shown as people, human and caring, full of all the hopes and desires that humans have, and the need for acceptance.Acceptance is a main theme here. There are some in the circus who aren't in the freak show. Most of them are quite civil and a part of the family. The clown, the sword swallower, the fire eater, and others gladly laugh with the \"freaks\" and not at them. They are a family. Some of the circus folk are just regular people with other problems: overweight, gangly, or whatever, they all recognize that they are not perfect.Two of the people set themselves above the family, and reject the \"freaks\". They, too, have needs and desires, but don't want to be a part of a \"freak show\" they want to laugh at, and not with.These two, Hercules and Cleopatra, have their own insecurities, and lead the more uncouth circus members who laugh at the freaks. What sets them apart from the other circus folk who laugh at the freaks is that they have no stopping point. They have a sadistic abusive desire which is part of their sexual attraction to each other, to be superior. They believe themselves to be the king and queen of a romance story, and the freaks to be subhuman. They rejoice in their abuse much more than others. While others will simply follow, they lead the charge.A deadly game ensues. And Cleopatra leads on the midget Hans, whom she takes money from and then laughs at with her following, and discovers he is an heir to a fortune. In a horrible plot, she and Hercules not only cross the line of humanity, but over the line of complete Horror.Yet even though the freaks realize she is abusing Hans, when she agrees to a marriage in her plot, they relent, and are ready to accept her. Here, we get the classic climactic \"Gooble Gobble\" scene. Here, we see the humanity in all of us, as we witness all her insecurities along with her horror. We see her experience a total dread. We run the gamut of emotions.This film expresses emotions far greater than any film you would see today. The reason is because the director didn't overlook the forest for the trees. Sure, we get the little details of set, character, and story, but the grand scheme is never neglected. We get the full force on camera of the characters. They are always forefront. When the freaks chant their acceptance song for her, we see her expression of Horror. We see them in glee, but to her it is something of dread. We get the full impact. We get the story telling.And this is perfect story telling. We get the story. We get everything. This is an amazing experience, and a lost classic.",

This is not only limited to the freaks; I could barely understand leading circus lady Olga Baclanova's mutterings either. This detracts from the ability to get more involved in the \"story\", as little of that as there is. The first half of the movie is mere exposition... \"look at this,\" \"look at that,\" \"isn't this weird\". There really isn't any meat to the proceedings until later on, and by then it's too late. The shining moment of the film is the climax, but it still can't help FREAKS from ultimately coming off as just a decent movie-going experience for me.

I must admit that I was heavily triggered when I read the reviews and saw many people describing this as a great \"HORROR\" movie!? My god did you even watch this movie? Did you even understand what the message was all about? It has been some years that I've watched this movie. And the best movie you can compare this movie with is \"The Elephant Man\". David Lynch was obviously very influenced by this picture. Both of the directors made a movie with meaning behind it, that was way more important than the movie itself.In my recollection the movie starts with a long message from the director about why he's making this movie. Back in the 30's it was still common' to go the circus and laugh at people who had it way worse then you. Ahead of his time Tod Browning was one of the first ever to make people question their views on what should be acceptable. Is it okay to dehumanize somebody just for the way he looks? He took his greatest gift and made a movie to honor this people. But not only honor them... No he made them back human. He did no effort what so ever in making them look better than they were. He portrayed them just the way they are, and made a story about friendship, love and sacrifice. And he succeeded. Nowadays nobody would even think about banning this movie. But because of the horrific images of the people (actors) who were in it, this movie was banned for 30 years in Great-Britain.This review is a homage to the man who dared to question society's accepted standards. And nowadays it's impossible to even believe that something that was so widespread would still exist today.

All the deformities are real, and in many ways, beautiful. These people, born with afflictions they cannot help, make the most of it, absolutely commandeering life and leading as normal lives as they can. That is beautiful to me. If you don't have arms and hands, use your legs and feet! Are you a woman with manly facial hair? Accept it and LIVE! I suppose the circus life would be the natural choice for many of these people, even though the whole concept of the show is for them to be jeered at or made fun of; this I feel is wrong and exploitive. But, without these 'freakshows' a lot of these people would have had worse lives, I'm sure,so it is one of those things where the feelings are half and half. I am particularly fond of the 'pinheads' the microcephiles, Schlitze being my favorite. He along with the two girls (sometimes referred to as Zip and Pip, or Pip and Flip)... are the absolute definition of meek; full of laughter, joy. Their faces are more beautiful than what 'normal' people call beauty, and even though they are considered 'retarded', they have volumes to teach us about humility, often without saying a thing.It is neither horror or grotesque. I have researched this movie because it is so interesting to me; unfortunately, since it is so old and was taken out of circulation for years and has in recent years resurfaced, it is hard to find anything out about it. It has been noted that people were sickened to the point of literally getting sick, running away from the threatres, and even a miscarriage from watching these 'freaks'. (I do not like to use such terminology, but I will here because it is the title of the picture.) This is a bit over the top, isn't it? I saw nothing that was that sickening. Bizarre, yes, but nothing disgusting. We are all taught (hopefully) not to tease these types of people;yet this movie seems to bring out the worst in some people. And they call these actors retarded?

The movie portrays how abnormalities were treated in the early 20th century and has the obsession with physical form causes eating disorders today. In a quote from Tod Browning, he asks us to consider who are the bigger freaks: people with deformed bodies or those with deformed souls? The two \"normal\" people who are out to cheat and steal are have no remorse and will do what it takes, whereas the freaks are quite likable and charming. Even though they are of the other kind, there is no reason to treat them like dirt. The ending is disturbing to be sure, but it's hard to blame the side show freaks for acts that seem necessary!",

I would not consider this movie to be a horror or a thriller movie at all. I would classify this movie as a romance/drama movie in which the actors and actresses were having affairs with other people, using and hurting people for their money, people that were breaking up with people and reuniting with other people for a better chance to start a romantic relationship with other people that they care about and accept them for who they are.True friends are always going to accept their friends and help them out in times of crisis. The plot flowed smoothly throughout the cinematography. Sharp close ups of the characters and the use of lighting on the actor's faces was used well in every scene.

            "content": "Tod Browning's 1932 cult classic film Freaks is not what most people seem to think it is. It is neither a blatantly exploitative film nor a film of profound compassion. Of all of his films, silent or not, it is in many ways both his most artlessly produced yet also his most indelible- even more so than Dracula, which came out a year before. Most of all, though, it is not a horror film. Yes, it is horrifying to look at the poor freaks that are on screen, and the film has the exterior trappings of a horror film, in terms of mood and sets, but the film is really about the human desire for love, and the often impotent pursuit of it. Even the normal sized people in the film are not able to achieve real love.The tale of the film is almost as well known as the tale within the film. The exterior story is how the film was critically lambasted, after MGM studio decisions led to its demotion from a film with A List MGM stars (Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow) to a B List film Irving Thalberg couldn't stand (reputedly exclaiming, 'Well, I asked for a horror film, and this film is horrible!'). This drubbing by critics and lack of care by the studio led to the film's poor box office, and its being pulled from circulation for nearly thirty years, after being banned in many cities. However, it did enjoy more success in Europe, which fed its reputation, and a desire to be seen in its natal country by a newer, hipper generation. Then, in the early 1960s, it was pulled out of mothballs stateside and became a hit on the college and late night film circuit under many different titles, including Nature's Mistakes. In the 1980s, when videotapes of films became popular, rentals and sales cemented its niche as one of the greatest comeback films in Hollywood history. Not even the much documented travails of It's A Wonderful Life could compare with what Freaks had to endure to attain its status as a classic.But, classic does not always equal great, nor masterpiece- two terms that are now often associated with the film. That's because the interior story of the film, and its execution, simply do not hold up well. The basic tale is about a carnival full of human oddities, and how the strongman (Henry Victor) and female acrobat (Olga Baclanova) plot to steal the fortune of the star attraction- a midget named Hans (Harry Earles), by having her marry him, then killing him\u0085. In short (no pun intended), Freaks is neither bad nor brilliant, nor does it carry any deep nor important message, but it is fascinating to watch, albeit in the way a festering sore, or one insect eating another, can be. Is its depiction of thwarted love, vengeance, and bigotry exploitative? Of course. Is it sympathetic? Yes. The two are not mutually exclusive, and with that knowledge imparted, perhaps Freaks serves its highest, best, and only purpose.",

It uses decent acting for the time and good cinematography to bring focus to the circus performers being freaks as they are called while showing how much benevolence they have. You get a good sense of a family bond between the performers. As things become more clear in terms of plot, it gets very interesting. It feels a little boring during the first third, but isn't bad for the time and picks up when the plot becomes more involved. One scene in particular is very chilling where you see many of the deformed characters looking at the mean female protagonist underneath stairs and all around her in nooks among the darkness. It gives a sense of fear that I was waiting for because the \"normal\" people seemed like they could lose easily if they were attacked by the majority of circus freaks and that narrative is expressed mostly during the scarier and more intense scenes. The end feels like a bit of an anticlimax because it doesn't show all of what happened, but after seeing it I can't imagine them doing the scene any better. I just would've wanted more closure, but sometimes movies are better when you don't see everything and you are able to just assume it.

The story is classical, but hardly suffices to fill the film's full hour length, although it starts with all the details on one evening: Baclanova tempting Earles, Hyams leaving Victor, Victor being seduced by Baclanova, antics between Ford and Hyams, jealousy of Earles' small fianc\u00e9e (Daisy Earles). Simple so far.But there are more characters in this movie and they are the real stars: so-called \"freaks\", a circus number. The first time the \"freaks\" enter, remarkably, it's within an idyllic scenery, disturbed only by the appearance of a squire and a man is his pay (Albert Conti and Michael Visaroff). The squire's decision of letting the disabled frolic on his land expresses the film's general attitude: they are no freaks. This is again contrasted with the behaviour of their fellow performers, the Rollo Brothers (Matt McHugh and Ed Brophy) who spit at the child-like people when they return to the circus.Strictly seen, only the last eight minutes of the film are horror. The disabled therefore are not at all the scare in this film and that's what makes it so unique, while most horror pics just vary the same story. Only the \"normal\" have frightening features and they deviously turn against those who are supposed to supply atrocious terror. Instead, they lead normal lives. Only when the freaks' code is broken by Baclanova in the masterly banquet scene with familiar face Angelo Rossitto (a fine performance), and Rossitto witnesses her bad deeds, the \"dirty, slimy freaks\" become what Baclanova accused them to be in the first place.The (intentional?) stage-like overacting by villains Baclanova and Victor doesn't damage the excellent overall impression, nor do the comic relief scenes between the Siamese sisters and a stutterer (Roscoe Ates, as usual) who is married to one of them.\"Freaks\" has very intensive acting from Harry and Daisy Earles, as from all circus performers (who play themselves, if you will). Although there's very little music and quite a lot dialogue in the film, the atmosphere is always gripping. Whatever MGM took away from Browning's film or induced him to change (the ending is obviously a concession), there's still a perfect, uncopyable thrill left. The rainstorm night (5:26 mins.) certainly has its unforgettable share in horror film history.One of my all-time favorites, a clear 10 out of 10.(Been looking for him all over the film, but can somebody please tell me where Tom London is?)",

But that is quite beside the point. This beautiful film portrays so many hardships that we as human beings face each and every day, not just freaks. Much like I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), Freaks gives a powerful social commentary. Browning shows us what it is like to live in this world as a \"freak\", to be out casted and deemed crazy by other humans. Browning also shows the watcher that there are freaks all around us, not only those who are physically deformed. For instance, Henry Victor, known as Hercules in the movie, presents some very 'freakish' ideas and actions throughout. Browning uses his direction power very wisely in this film, he creates a world that does not stray far from the circus and there is a constant dark, foreboding undertone in every scene. Many people from our generation would not consider this film a 'horror' film because there are very few scary or thrilling scenes, but perhaps it is a horror film because the ideas and actions portrayed in the film, mostly by Cleopatra, are quite horrific. In short, Freaks is a beautiful film that deals with many untapped issues that were very prevalent during the times in which the film was made. Browning creates a world on film that grips the viewer with powerful visuals, great lighting and most importantly a powerful story line.",

            "content": "Tod Browning did the world a favor when he made this film. The vast majority of the commentaries here on IMDb attest to the brilliance of this work. When I was around ten years old, over fifty years ago living in Washington, DC, the biggest attraction, other than the Redskins, was when the circus train would come to town. The train would snake thru town past Union Station to settle in the old fair grounds on the banks of the Anacostia river. Elephants, lions, monkeys, midgets and bears - oh my. Children and adults would watch for days as the 'Big Top' rose mightily above the dusty ground,,and then the big day came, the opening of the grand circus.The Big Top, the sideshows, a feast of sights and sound,,and smells. The Big Top brightened with fantastic acts, beautifully costumed women, men and animals. But to me, the real treat were the sideshows with sword swallowers, bearded ladies and human contorsionists. But to experience the circus and sideshows after dark, well lets just say that surreal was an understatement....Now to the subject at hand, Tod Browing's 1932 movie,'Freaks'. The characters in this film were not actors but persons who through twists of fate or misfortune were born 'unnormal'. What makes this presentation even more interesting is to read the biographies of so many of these people, the human torso, the bird lady, the pin heads and more. The film so faithfully depicts the strife of old time circus life, or more accurately sideshow life, that one marvels, often with fretted brow, at the sights presented so boldly on the screen. One cannot help but imagine the lives led by these individuals beyond what is depicted, the sadness, the self pity, the depression yet reveling in their comradery. The thought of 'living a life' as a sideshow freak. This is not a horror only because of the strife of the misfortunates but more by the behavior of the cast who were whole bodied and healthful. True, Browning exploited these individuals but no more so than the exploitation present in scores of sideshows so common in that time in history, when mentally ill and handicapped persons were subject to horrors more terrible than were ever splashed upon the silver screen. See this classic and reflect upon our own fortune. Today this film would be considered to be outrageously politically incorrect but politics has nothing to do with it. The 'unnaturals' presented here are honest and lovable.",

But the other freaks will discover it, and her evil plans will be changed.  Yes, this plot appears limited, but the circus was a good argument for Tod Browning to show all the freaks he had gathered. He wanted here to make a more shocking movie than his previous (\"Dracula\"). He managed, but maybe a little too much, because \"Freaks\" was a burden for his future in Hollywood.The other idea behind this movie is that freaks are people like everybody else (at least in their heads) and therefore should be treated as everybody else. In fact, we should try to forget these differences. Obviously true, but everyone knows that. So  why make a movie like this (and watch it)? As sad as it sounds, it's because we 'like' to see freaks, to see these people different. J. Eck declared about the movie shot: \"It was wonderful, for the first time of my life, I felt normal\". The other freaks were not looking at his handicap (what people do ), but at him, the individual. This quote highlights 'our real nature'.To be honest, the non-freaks actors are really playing badly. In fact, worst than the freaks, whose this was for most of them their only movie of their life(!). The dialogues are sometimes hard to understand, because the sound was badly recorded (remember it was in the early '30s), and it's in black&white, but don't miss it!!! There are truelly scenes you will remember all your life (the wedding banquet, Randion lighting his cigarette with his mouth ...). This movie is as its casting: unique! And I think Tod Browning has found the right tone to treat this unusual subject. My only regret is that \"Freaks\" is a bit too short (1 hour).10/10PS: In the imdb, is mentioned an other version, a recent one, \"Freaks uncensored\".

Wallace ford(mummy's hand) and beautiful Leila Hyams(island of lost souls)are the two well known actors and harry Earle's(Hans)also starred in the unholy three with Lon Chaney Sr in both versions,the silent and remake.in fact rumor has it Lon Chaney Sr was to star in this but he died in 1930 before its release.there is a very long intro in the beginning that was added to assure audiences of its subject matter,but it did'nt work MGM pulled it anyway,now with the wonders of video and DVD you can see freaks in all its glory and wonder what the fuss was about in 1932.10 out of 10.a true classic.",

Freaks for most part is not a horror movie, but the stunning finale is superbly dark and horrific, so well done that it lingers on in the memory long after the closing credits have rolled.Obviously it is perhaps best known for using real life deformed performers (I don't like to call them freaks). This means that the acting can be a little wooden at times, but that's just a minor quibble. It is also known for the outcry and controversy when it was released, being derided as horrific or monstrous, those words not describing the film itself but many members of the cast, In Britain it was ridiculously banned for three decades. Thankfully we live in more enlightened times and Freaks can be seen as the superb movie that it is. The 1930's in my opinion was one of the best decades for horror films and this is certainly one of the best.",

            "content": "This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the early sound era, yet paradoxically, one of the worst. Best because its haunting, unnerving, frightening images of society's unspeakable class of unfortunates still shocks; expectant parents need not view this motion picture; there are scenes of such power that it can literally still clear a room; yet worst because the over-rated Browning still directs, for the most part, the \"normal\" actors in his customary leaden style (if you don't believe me, just compare \"his\" Dracula\" with its contemporary, the very fluid and horrific Spanish version). Browning coaxes the best out of his acting troup, but the freaks, although for the most part unintelligible, come off better, probably quite by accident. The movie borders on the Povery Row style for much of its running time, but has moments of great brilliance during the loving cup scenes, and the famous chase through the storm. Could a better director have made a better picture? Or would the MGM \"gloss\" have gotten in the way?  Quite unsettling, although never mentioned, is the affliction that the so-called \"normal\" Phroso the Clown seems to suffer from...if you read between the lines, his love for Venus is all-to-freakish, as he seems to be \"under-endowed\" or un-endowed, thus making his love for her just as distorted as that of dwarf Hans for a zoftig like Baclonova (think of that union!). For the most part, the freaks' roles are tender and straightforward...it is their introduction to the plot, along with the matter-of-fact displays of their \"talents\" which live in my mind, not the much-discussed climax (does anyone else note the similarity between Cleopatra's demise and that of Professor Unrath's in \"The Blue Angel?) Yet this movie endures as a classic, in spite its direction, due to its immediate documentary style. As if captured in amber, it depicts in time - capsule form a view of Americana that will never be seen again. And therein lies its power: The Nightmare exists because it is all too real, because its world existed. And exists today... behind closed doors in institutions. It's just not on film.",

I guess the best message of the film is that even though Cleopatra and Hercules were \"Normal\" humans, they were evil, the \"Freaks\" were presented in the good light. Up until the end when they realized that these normal humans were looking to kill one of their own. That's when they jumped into action.

The plot of the movie wasn't anything special and how everything panned out for Han's wasn't much surprise. The overall theme of equality was shown threw the movie. People should be less judgmental and people need to be aware of others feeling. I feel like Disney took this movie and took this theme and inserted it into Toy Story.

            "content": "In 1932 Tod Browning asked the question \"Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?\" and it nearly finished his career. Browning never fully recovered from the controversy and critical backlash he received for Freaks. After the success of Universal's Dracula (also directed by Browning)and James Whale's Frankenstein MGM wanted to cash in on the public's new appetite for horror so asked Browning to deliver a horror film to overshadow Universal's output. However MGM got more than they bargained for. Based on a story called Spurs by Tod Robbins,Freaks was originally intended as a vehicle for Lon Chaney, who was to be reunited with his Unholy Three co-stars Harry Earles and Victor McLaglen. However after Chaneys death from lung cancer in 1930 it was shelved for a couple of years,until MGM approached Browning about a new horror film. Freaks is the story of trapeze artist Cleopatra(Olga Baclanova)who marries, then tries to poison sideshow midget Hans(Harry Earles)to get her hands on his inheritance. She is assisted in this odious task by her lover, strongman Hercules(Henry Victor,who had replaced original choice Victor McLaglen). But when the rest of the 'freaks' find out what they are planning they take their terrible revenge. The story starts with a fairground barker proclaiming.....\"We didn't lie to you,folks. We told you we had living,breathing monstrosities. You laughed at them,shuddered at them....and yet,but for the accident of birth,you might be even as they are. Their code is a law unto themselves. Offend one and you offend them all\". He walks over to an open pit and continues speaking to the audience. \"You are about to witness the most amazing,most astounding living monstrosity of all time\". A woman from the audience screams,he continues...\"Friends,she was once a beautiful woman. . She was known as the peacock of the air.....\" We then cut to Hans watching Cleopatra performing her trapeze act. After her act is over she drops her cape so Hans can pick it up, then tease him because he is unable to place it back around her shoulders. Freida (Daisy Earles,Harry's real life sister)is in love with Hans,but he only has eyes for Cleopatra. We then see the brutish strongman(Victor)breaking up with the lovely Venus(Lelia Hyams,replacing original choice Jean Harlow). Hercules and Cleopatra become lovers but all the while Cleopatra is flirting and toying with the besotted Hans. Freida warns Hans that everyone is laughing at him, but he tells her that he is in love with Cleopatra and doesn't care what anyone thinks. Freida then goes to see Cleopatra to plead with her not to hurt Hans but inadvertently reveals that he has received a substantial inheritance. Cleopatra and Hercules then decide that she will marry Hans then slowly poison him to death. At their wedding feast all the freaks gather to congratulate the newly weds when Cleopatra thinks no one is looking she slips some poison into Han's drink. To welcome Cleopatra the freaks pour champagne into a 'loving cup', which is then passed among them to drink as they chant \"Gooble gobble, we accept her, we accept, her one of us\". In the original script the freaks were supposed to be seen dribbling into the cup as it was passed along. The drunken Cleopatra is disgusted and screams \"You dirty,rotten freaks!\" then throws her drink over them. Hercules chases all the freaks away then humiliates Hans by placing him on Cleopatras shoulders, then she carries him around as he covers his face. With Hans getting weaker from the poison the freaks decide to take their revenge,encouraged by Hans who now realises what Cleopatra is doing. That night they take their revenge,after killing Hercules, crawling through the mud,knives between their teeth,they advance on the screaming Cleopatra. We then cut back to the fairground barker,who continues...\"How she got that way will never be known. Believe it or not,there she is\" The camera pans down into the pit revealing a squawking,legless Cleopatra looking like an over-sized chicken.... The original ending had a scene of a tree falling on Cleopatra, crushing her legs and trapping her as the freaks advanced. Another scene cut had Hercules singing soprano back at the fairground after the freaks had apparently castrated him. However after the critical backlash Freaks was pulled from release after a few weeks and about 1/2 hour cut,unfortunately this 1/2 hour has been lost forever. A re-edited version was released with a happy ending showing Hans and Frieda reunited but the public still stayed away. Apparently the general public were not ready for the real 'horror' of the freaks. Freaks is a film very much of it's time,the acting is very theatrical and primitive with Henry Victor as Hercules being the worst culprit. This is obviously due to the fact that 'talkies 'were in their infancy and most of the actors were from the silent era. Brother and sister Harry and Daisy Earles are given plenty of screen time and do their best with a disjointed script. The best acting, in my opinion, comes from leading man Wallace Ford as Phroso the clown, Leila Hyams as the beautiful Venus and Roscoe Ates as stuttering comic relief Roscoe, who is engaged to one half of the Siamese twins. The story is simple yet very effective and the message seems to be that Hercules and Cleopatra (the so called normal people) are the real monsters and we should not judge people by their appearance, but by their character and personality. There is no question that Hercules and Cleopatra deserved their horrible fate.",

            "review_title": "Not a horror show -- oddly emotionally involving",
            "content": "I'm not actually going to go into the plot that much, because there's no need to; but I put the \"spoiler\" warning there just to be safe.Maybe it helped that I read quite a bit about this movie before actually watching it, but I really wouldn't classify it as a \"horror\" movie. No cheap gross-out stuff here. But it's definitely unique, especially for its time. And I found it oddly emotionally involving.Unexpectedly, I did not find the \"freaks\" scary, and I don't really think we're supposed to. Much of the movie as a whole is spent letting us get to know the \"freaks\" simply as people, seeing how they cope with every day life and interact with other circus workers (normal and otherwise). While the story is rather heavy-handed about demonizing a couple of \"normal\" people (and even some of the ones who are good guys are rather dysfunctional!), it is wonderfully sincere and effective at humanizing the \"abnormal\" ones. I saw them not as \"nature's mistakes\" but as people who, though messed up by the fallenness of this world, were nonetheless created in God's image. I saw this especially strongly in the part where Mme. Tetrallini stands in the park with her \"children\" gathered around her. Is her affection for these oddities (which seems quite unfeigned on the part of the actress) supposed to strike the viewer as weird and disturbing? It doesn't strike me that way, nor do I think it should. The worst part, as many have said, is the acting, particularly the readings of many lines. Some accents/voices make lines very hard to understand. Hans & Frieda aren't too convincing much of the time (and those \"munchkin\" voices don't help), though each has their best moment when imitating/mocking Cleo! Then there are some '30s expressions that don't make sense all these years later, and non-PC '30s humor like the one guy's stuttering. It's not entirely true, by the way, that none of the \"freaks\" were actors. Angelo Rossitto, the dwarf, was an actor with a decades-long career; you can tell he's a real actor, even when he's just standing there saying nothing. Some \"freaks\", of course, didn't do well even with a single line, while others, such as the living skeleton and the Siamese twins, actually handled small speaking parts well.A couple of minor quibbles: (1) Although \"Schlitzie\" is cast as a girl, it's pretty obvious that he's a \"he\". Note that he joins the rest of the \"boys\" in the attack on the villains. (2) Although Josephine/Joseph has a good \"half & half\" walk (anticipating Steve Martin in \"All Of Me\"), \"he/she\" doesn't really have much that's \"male\" about \"him/her\". In particular, watch \"his/her\" supposed \"male\" side from the back during the \"she likes you, but he don't\" scene and tell me if that isn't a female body all the way! (I'd be less picky if this person hadn't been an actual circus \"freak\".)As for the ending, I didn't even really find the \"attack\" scenes all that scary, although I'll never forget the sight of Johnny rapidly handwalking under trailers in the rain. The part about Cleo's fate is unsatisfying because it really doesn't ring true; maybe it would have worked better if there was more explanation of how she actually got where she ended up. (I guess some of that was edited out.) There has been some criticism about the final, \"happy\" ending, but I think it's unjustified. On the contrary, I find it works as an effective, cathartic release of everything the story builds up.Some descriptions of the plot say that the rebellion of the \"freaks\" is brought on not just by the treatment of Hans, but also by Hercules' attempted rape of Venus. The movie actually had nothing about a \"rape\", though, so I don't know where that comes from.",

Oh, the story was sordid, but not much more sordid than a lot of other movies made during that time. What I think prompted the banning was the disgust people had for the real-life \"freaks\" in the film, who were only human beings, although physically and mentally handicapped. A lot of the film was cut; sadly the footage doesn't exist anymore. As it is, the film feels rather incomplete; something is definitely \"missing\". I saw this movie recently on TCM and the film still holds up. I'm especially charmed by Schlitze, one of the \"pinheads\". Schlitze, \"the man's woman\" was really a he! He wore dresses supposedly because it made it easier for him to go to the bathroom or made it easier to change his diapers (it's unclear how toilet-trained he was). Schlitze lights up the screen when he's on; he's like a funny, lovable, affectionate child. His smile could light up a room! And in the scene where Madame Tetrallini is telling her charges that God loves them Schlitze is hugging and patting her like he's trying to comfort HER. It's amazing that people would consider the cast of \"Freaks\" repulsive and unworthy. They were all exceptional human beings who made the best of what life had dealt them.",

            "content": "The mack-daddy of all cult movies, especially if we define \"cult movies\" as hard-to-find (or such was the case of *Freaks* until recently), requiring the devoted film fan to strenuously seek them out. This movie was banned in several countries or simply never shown for decades. Its reputation after the original -- and disastrous -- release rested primarily on revivals engineered by daring art-house theater managers. Was (is) *Freaks* worth the effort? Yes . . . however, those expecting a masterpiece may find themselves disappointed.The reasons for the diminution of this movie's power are the passage of time and the social mores that have changed during that period of time -- 72 years. The original audience, in 1932, was clearly not ready to countenance the idea that people coping with birth defects, particularly performers at a sideshow carnival, could share the same concerns, desires, and ambitions as themselves. It turns out that \"freaks\" want to earn a living, fall in love, and enjoy a sense of community just like anyone else. We accept this in 2004 as rather obvious (or at least most of us do), and hence the movie just simply isn't as shocking as it once was. Many \"Little People\" are popular celebrities today; those missing arms or legs are often featured on inspirational pieces for prime-time \"magazine\" shows on TV. Thus, with the impetus for shock long gone, this movie has to rely on its own structure, dialog, acting performances, and direction to carry it over. The results are uneven.Director Tod Browning was never consistently brilliant, and *Freaks* proves to be no exception. In order to get to the sublime moments, we have to trudge through a lot of chaff. His direction is primitive, in the style of the period. For the most part, Browning's compositional style consists of one proscenium set-up after another. The actors stand (or at least SOME of them do, ha ha) unnaturally in these square frames, acting quite badly, while we're on the subject. Only the midget pair of Hans and Freida give notable performances. The \"normal\" people tend to be worse actors than the freaks, but most of the cast was nonprofessional, anyway. At 62 minutes, the film feels truncated, and one isn't surprised to learn that there's footage that is either lost, or more likely, destroyed. The primitive sound equipment renders a disappointingly large portion of the dialog inaudible.The surprising virtue of *Freaks* continues to be the greasy plot, which, by the way, probably added insult to injury for the original 1932 audience. The amoral trapeze artist (an incomprehensible Olga Baclanova), in league with the boorish strongman of the circus, marries the love-sick midget Hans for his considerable fortune, and then attempts to kill him by poisoning. And this is where *Freaks* gives us its most enduring moments, like the \"wedding feast\" scene, where the \"freaks\" chant \"gobble-gobble, we accept her, one of us\", to Baclanova's increasing disgust. (Expect some irony engendered by this scene, later on.) And of course the scenes where the baddies get their comeuppance are quite simply the stuff of nightmares: legless, vengeful \"freaks\" crawling after their prey with knives clenched between their teeth, slithering through the mud in a downpour. They're like primordial little golems arising from the muck, full of hate, and they're a hell of a lot scarier than Bela Lugosi.Hell, the scene where the \"Human Torso\" (no arms or legs attached to this chap) manages to light a home-rolled cigarette using just his mouth, chin, and a matchbox almost justifies the movie all by itself. And Browning, who was a contortionist for carnivals before becoming a director, understands this milieu more intimately than his many imitators. *Freaks* is worth viewing and even worth owning. 6 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "This is a movie that I feel like I heard about before getting into podcasts. I know I read about it in the Fangoria Top 300 Horror Movies issue as well as it appears in The Horror Show Guide encyclopedia, both of which is what I compiled my first list of horror movies to see to expand my horizons. I'm now getting around to this as part of my Trek through the Twos. The synopsis is a circus' beautiful trapeze artist agrees to marry the leader of side-show performers, but his deformed friends discover she is only marrying him for his inheritance.For this movie, we start with a text from director Tod Browning to prepare the audience for what they're going to see. A brief recap of that is people who are born different have been treated poorly their whole lives and throughout history. This movie is not here to exploit them, but to honor them. I also didn't realize this was suggested by the story Spurs by Clarence Aaron 'Tod' Robbins.We then shift to a freakshow barker, which was an uncredited role played by Murry Kinnell. He is setting the stage and telling the story of one of the attractions. The movie then shifts into the past at a different circus. We have Hans (Harry Earles) and Frieda (Daisy Earles). Both are little people and from my brief research, they're brother and sister. They are playing a couple here that is engaged to be married. Hans has eyes for the beautiful trapeze artist who goes by Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). She flirts with Hans and I think part of this to make Frieda jealous. She also knows she can control men with her beauty.From here we get to meet other members of this circus which involves a clown, Phroso (Wallace Ford). There is Venus (Leila Hyams) who helps with the animals and she is dating Hercules (Henry Victor), who is the strong man. The two of them get into a fight and she leaves Hercules. She ends up giving Phroso a piece of her mind, mostly because he is there while she is fuming. The two of them start to date. I do like that Phroso seems like a good guy from his interactions with others in this circus.Cleopatra sees Hercules and invites him into her wagon. They hit it off as they're both horrible people. Cleopatra also invited Hans back to her wagon. She sends him away, but he starts to send her gifts. She takes advantage of this, breaking off his engagement with Frieda. She along with others in this circus try to warn him, but Hans is smitten with this woman that he didn't think he could date. Cleopatra sees a bigger opportunity when she learns of how he is paying for these gifts. It could mean her retiring from the circus for good.That is where I'm going to leave my recap. I don't want to go into spoilers even though this movie is now 90+ years old. There isn't a lot to the story and I do think most horror fans know about this movie. If they haven't seen it, they at least know the iconic line and chanting of 'One of Us'.Where I want to start is with a bit of backstory about this movie. From what I read, Browning worked in a circus growing up as a contortionist and a clown. He was familiar with these people due to being around similar ones that worked in the freakshow. It is wild to me that we had people who were different and this was some of the only work they could do. This is something that makes me ashamed to be a human being. I'm glad that we've come away from this. I do know many of these people were proud and they should be. It is sad that this movie ruined the career of Browning as I think it is good what he is portraying here. These people just have different genetics and it is sad that we treated them less than human for it.What I mean there is that this movie has interesting social commentary here. It is done in a subtle enough way that I can appreciate as well. The common idea that many thought when this was being made or they considered taking was having all the 'normal' people being the horrible with all the 'freaks' being good. I'm glad they didn't do that. Instead, we have Phroso who treats everyone with respect and he's well liked. Venus is also nice to all she meets. Cleopatra, Hercules and most of the other staff with the circus laugh at the less fortunate. There are more doing this, but I think this is in line with humanity. I understand this is a bleak outlook and I could be wrong. From what I've seen in my life, this is on par.The last bit for the story that I wanted to delve into is going back to this movie being considered by audiences of the days it was released thinking that Browning was exploiting the people of the freakshow. I don't get that. It feels more to be that he is highlighting them and giving them screentime. I guess in a way this is no better than the freakshow itself though. We get to see the Living Torso, Prince Randian, lighting up a cigarette. There is meeting our conjoined twins of Daisy and Violet Hilton. There seems to almost be a psychic connection between them. There are also others like Schlitze, Elvira Snow and Jenny Lee Snow who have microcephalism. There are also people like the Half Woman-Half Man, which I'm assuming is someone who was transgendered or a similar concept. There is also the half boy, armless girl, human skeleton and a bearded lady to name a few.Where I will then go would be the acting. First, I will give credit to all the members of the freakshow. I thought they did a solid job. They are mostly playing themselves, but I give them credit regardless. I love Ford in this movie. He is great as this clown that has big ideas, but he just seems like a great all-around guy. Hyams is someone else I'd put right there with him. I think that Baclanova and Victor were both solid as our villains. I'd say the rest of the 'normal' people in the circus are also good to symbolize the audience or how people seem to judge those that are different. I think it fits.Then the last things to go into would be the cinematography, effects and the soundtrack. For the former, I think that is fine. We are early in cinema so we aren't getting a lot that is different. I do think that the shots are framed well. It does feel like we are following people who are part of a circus. I like the sets being inside of their wagons which double as apartments. That all worked for me. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, especially since most everything we see are real people with these afflictions. I did like the reveal of what happened to Cleopatra. I can't fully get behind it, but it is as Browning warns in the beginning, if you hurt one of the members of the freakshow, you hurt them all. The last bit would be the soundtrack which fit this movie for what was needed.In conclusion here, this is one that I'm glad I can finally say I've seen. I think that the story is basic, but it is interesting. I like that we get to know these characters and almost giving many of them screen time to showcase their talents. The acting was good across the board. There is an interesting commentary here that I think is done subtle and is still relevant. The cinematography, effects and soundtrack are all fine as well. I can also see why this is regarded as a classic. It is horrific in a traditional movie sense, but there is a feeling of dread that grows for sure. I'd say that my rating of this movie is it being a good one. I would be curious where my rating falls with a second viewing.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",

And the hardest question of all, to misquote Mama Gump: \"What's 'different' mean, anyway?\" Speaking from the point of view of one who has been called \"freaky\" on more than one occasion, I can say I would probably have felt much more comfortable around the genuine Freaks of Tod Browning's movie than the \"normal\" characters portrayed. The normal woman is evil enough, but to have her go ballistic when the Freaks decide to reach out in love and acceptance - allowing her to be known as \"one of us\" - shows the absolute horror of non-conformity. I can't be like them \u0085 if I were, I'd be \"different.\"\nAre the freaks so different from us? Are people of other races different? People of other religions? People who live in housing projects or mansions? Are they so different? If we cut them, do they not bleed?To be wanted, loved, needed, accepted, is a human desire that runs deep to the soul. Yet what if you are accepted by freaks? One of them? One of us? What does that make you? \"Freaks\" has lost none of its punch. It hits in the gut, hard. When I viewed it, I could understand why it had been banned. It was too, pardon the word, freaky. These weren't actors in makeup. They were living, breathing humans (yes, humans!) who lived life as the only way they knew how: normally.\nThe only movie I saw more disturbing than \"Freaks\" was \"Silence of the Lambs,\" but it merely made me want to check my basement before I went to bed that night. \"Freaks\" has haunted me for many years. Maybe because I, like them, live in my own version of normality, have been gawked at and talked about and have even caused anger because of my \"freakiness.\"\nBut that's okay. I accept you.

            "content": "There is a profound moment in Tod Browning's \"Freaks\" which occurs when two female Siamese twins are sitting in their trailer side-by-side, one is reading a book, the other is conversing with her lover. It is revealed earlier in the film that both of them can feel each and every emotion and sense that the other is experiancing. When the lover and his twin kiss, the other twin puts her book down and we see the unusual, blissful pleasure in her face as she is experiancing the sensation of the kiss her sister is receiving. It's such an oddly charming moment.The film is set entirely in a traveling European circus. Cleopatra is a beautiful trapezist, Hercules her strongman lover. Amidst talented and attractive performers are the members of the circus sideshow, the freaks. There is Hans and Frieda, two midgets married to one another, but Hans has a crush on Cleopatra; there is the half-boy, with no lower half who moves with frightening ease on his hands, and a group of pinhead people, with acutely pointed heads. While the film may come off as disturbing (and some of it is very odd to watch), Tod Browning is ultimately showing the audience that the human characters are the true freaks, and the freaks are the compassionate and understanding characters in the story (though there are two compassionate human characters, a clown and his girlfriend, who are friends with the freaks). Director Tod Browning is best known for directing the 1931 \"Dracula,\" with Bela Lugosi. When he completed \"Freaks,\" it was 90 minutes long, but the censors cut it down to 64 minutes, and eliminated most of the ending. Because of the editing, there are many fade-ins and fade-outs, and seemingly many jump-cuts. Even at 64 minutes, the film was banned shortly after it's release in 1932 and by the late 30's it was out of circulation. It unfortunately ruined Browning's career, who retired soon after \"Freaks.\" In the late 1950's, it was re-released, and many people discovered it. \"Freaks\" then grew into the cult classic that it is today. There is obviously a healthy amount that is missing, but what is there is left is rather disturbing, very interesting, and often oddly charming.There is no score, but the film relies heavily on carnival-source music, which is great music for a film like this. All in all, a great and interesting curiousity...but it's not for everybody!",

I must add that I didn't watch all of the film. I couldn't. Please don't get me wrong. It's not because these people are disabled that I switched off. It's simply that the story and the premise suck. Of course, no one can expect Oscar winning performances from these people. But the point is they serve no purpose other than to stand there so the viewer can gawp at them.This isn't necessarily so in 2012, but it sure was in 1932. Shame the makers of this movie couldn't have given these people more dignity. A couple of them sport shaven heads with a little bit of hair sticking up at the top. And one guy is playing a 'girl' when he is clearly a man with a five o'clock shadow.Looking at it for what it is, it is undeniably a film that exploits these folk. It is patronising and vacant. I have more respect for the disabled people in this film than I do for the producer and director. The movie is also so boring, I am surprised I made it past 40 minutes before turning off.Many people 'big' this film up to be a classic. It isn't.

            "content": "The geek character in \"Nightmare alley\" (2021, Guillermo del Toro) made me rewatch \"Freaks\".\"Freaks\" was the film that ruined the career of Tod Browning. In the previous year he has made \"Dracula\" for MGM and in the same year Universal released \"Frankenstein\" (1931, James Whale). The assignment that Browning got from MGM was simple, make a move that will out-horror \"Frankenstein\". The audience interpreted \"Freaks\" however as a tasteless exploitation movie and Browings career never recovered.Only decades later the movie became a cult movie. It became clear that exploitation of deformed people was not what Browning intended. On the controray his sympathy is with the freaks and \"Freaks\" is just as little an exploitation movie as for example \"The elephant man\" (1980, David Lynch).The story of \"Freaks\" is very simple. The film is situated in a circus where disformed so called freaks and \"normal\" circus artists work together. In general the \"normal\" artists disdain the freaks and make fun of them. On top of that trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) plans to make (ab)use of the dwarf Hans (Harry Earles) who is in love with her. When at a party she is a little typsy and shows her disdain a little too explicit, she unites the freaks against her. Offending one is offending them all!. This is a very powerfull scene, as is the revenge of the freaks during a stormy night.The moral of the story is obvious. It is not the outward appearance that counts but the beauty of the character. Viewed in this way it is the \"normal\" Olga that is the (morally) disformed one. It is not \"Beauty and the Beast\" but \"Beauty is the Beast\".In an added scene (probably added as a result of the disastrous reactions to the test marketing) a second moral is added. Lynching remains lynching, however guilty the victims are.\"Freaks\" has a simple, rather predictable story. On top of that the acting is not first class. The freaks are playing themselves and are not proffessional actors. For the other characters it was hard to find famous actors, anxious as these were to put their image at stake. The film has however a few very powerfull scenes (some of which I have described above) that fully account for its status as a cult movie.",

            "content": "This is one of those old films that modern audiences have \"issues\" with. Thing is, contemporary audiences did as well! Period trade magazine reviews stated in no uncertain terms the use of actual circus freaks was an abomination to decency. Some had issue with the plot alone, regardless of cast (cheating a dwarf of his money by marrying him, then humiliating him and trying to kill him off).Now, I understand all of this. I understand why people thought it was awful to exploit people who now would today be considered either severely handicapped, or at least visually \"different\". But, in my humble opinion, I smell a hint of hypocrisy from the critics of this film.Would the period film critics have taken these \"freaks\" into their homes? I think not, hence some of the hypocrisy. As far as today's critics, they are shocked at this film but ultra-violence, rape, hardcore sex, and the rest... all of that is a-ok in a modern film. Hypocrisy.Many of the \"freaks\" in this film were of the top of the heap, well known.\nThey weren't exactly living in squalor, whipped and abused like so many others stuck in fly-by-night carnivals (the Elephant Man comes to mind). None of them look like they didn't want to be in the film. In fact, other than in a couple of short scenes, the freaks actually are made to be \"of better stuff\" than the \"normals\". It is easy as a viewer to side with the freaks.If these freaks were not working for big name circuses like Barnum & Bailey or the Ringling's, they would most likely be either dead, in a mental institution, or living in absolute squalor, abused and neglected. While still not ideal, working for a large outfit gave them a purpose and income. Did people ogle and scream and laugh at them? Sure... but they had a place to live and people to help care for them. They had a home.No doubt some of the original anger at the film was due to scenes which were cut and now missing. They appear to have shown the freaks in a pretty bad way, inflicting violence on the \"normals\" in revenge of their treatment of Hans (Harry Earles). The existing cut implies violence at their hands more than shows it. If those original scenes were still in the film, I'd understand more the issues the original reviewers had.But as we see the film now, YES it is strange... YES it could be seen as low class... but it is decently acted, decently shot, and isn't nearly as bad as today's PC world thinks. Of course, that is just one person's opinion, and I can be way off base on this one.",

            "content": "Freaks is a not to miss film directed by the legendary Todd Browning. The film was very controversial around its 1932 release and continues to stir argument to this day. The cast was highly made up of real life side show performers. The characters depicted in this film all have various physical abnormalities. 1932 audiences were not used to such people being displayed on the silver screen, nor are they today. Freaks gives the audience a chance to see what life was like for a typical side show oddity. The story is a rather unique one and should not be taken likely. Freaks is not a film for the faint of heart. There are many suggestive and rather gruesome moments that may offend some viewers. Many scenes shot for the film were cut do to censorship laws, Thus Freaks feels somewhat incomplete. The ending is somewhat sudden and in result one does not truly receive a full understanding of the film. However, this film is worth viewing many times. The story has romance and forbidden passion. You feel for most of the characters and want to see them win in the end. The film allows each of us to reflect on what is considered to be normal and weather or not being normal is something we wish to be. The story sends a moral message, a message that states that all humans should be treated equally. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good and well rounded peace of cinema history. Freaks is certainly not a horror film. It is a human film that expresses the various pains of man kind. Freaks reveals just how close minded most people are. The story is captivating and should not be missed.",

            "content": "After a lengthy rolling preface that claims an enlightened view of freaks\u0097they are people, not monsters\u0097and maintains they have created a code of honour to protect themselves,the narrative begins with a side-show barker telling the rubes to step right up. We don't see what he has inside the little box, and he tells a story of how a once-beautiful woman got this way, whatever way it is. The story is rather loosely told, with three intertwined plot lines, one of which is nothing more than exhibiting the various oddnesses. The second is a little romance between a smart clown, Phroso, and a pretty lady, Venus; this subplot offers a norm that matches physical ordinariness and romance. The third is a darker story, in which a small person, Heinz, becomes infatuated with Cleopatra, a big person trapeze artist, who is in cahoots with the boorish strongman. It turns out Heinz has inherited a fortune, and was planning to leave the circus with his betrothed, Frieda, but Cleopatra learns of the inheritance and marries Heinz, laughing and poisoning him. However, he recovers his health and dignity, and the group of freaks cluster round and halt the strongman's murderous plans and chase Cleopatra into the woods, where something happens that transforms her into a hen-woman, shown in the next-to-the-last scene.Sometimes the movie is categorized as a horror film, but it really isn't. It's a typical romance-clashing-with-bad-people story, with unusual looking people. Other than the way they look, there's nothing of horror here\u0097excepting the great scene in which the small people assemble under the circus caravans and look balefully through the steps and wheels at the villains, as the thunder and lightning roar and flash and the small people are up to their wrists in mud\u0097and they advance on the bad strongman solemnly, silently, murderously angry.The acting is pretty bad throughout, and the writing not much better. The movie epitomizes the way variations from the norm were deemed monstrous and separated into a closed, ghettoized community. Here we have several small people, a man with no legs and very little below the waist but who moves very quickly on gloved hands, a bearded lady, an incredibly thin man, a man with no hands or legs who lights his own cigarettes, an armless woman who drinks wine with the stem of the wineglass between her twos, a stuttering man married to one of two female conjoined twins, pinheads with Zippy haircuts, and so forth. Heinz and Frieda are small but almost \"normal\" looking, and so their romance is the centre and conclusion of the story. All these variously disabled or different people are thrown together into a single category, though some of them have more in common with \"normal\" people than with their fellow freaks. The movie isn't very long, but I wouldn't want it any longer.",

True, not every sideshow freak was a knife-wielding avenger, (which the climax of this movie MIGHT suggest to a very naive person), but Browning was merely trying to show, i think, the necessary comraderie between the freaks and their need to protect themselves against those that would hurt them. The movie, (especially the scene in which the freaks take their revenge, depiciting the freaks crawling through mud, in the driving rain), is truly frightening in a nightmarish way that was Browning's specialty and genius, but not without his sympathetic way of making the most unusual characters the ones we care for, and identify with,  the most.",

Many things were different in the 1930s and this certainly feels like an awkward time capsule from a long gone era. It's not slick cinema by any means, jump cuts are not hidden, cameras aren't steady, but this is very much about the spectacle. The story is functional, following the characters of a travelling circus, but it is genuinely unusual and although it feels exploitative rather than entertaining, there's something very watchable about this unnerving slice of cinema history.

The acting is impossibly hammy, the jokes are outdated, and, if you can understand Hans and Frieda's shrill dialogue without the help of subtitles, more power to you\u0085 This is not the greatest movie ever made---not even close.But it's the imperfections in the film (not to mention in its cast members) that make FREAKS such a brooding classic. Like some of its memorable sideshow characters, this movie is missing a limb or two in its overall execution (e.g. the sound and projection are terrible). Despite this, Tod Browning manages to deliver a true chunk of cinematic gold.I'm not going to bore you with details about the plot and history of FREAKS. Circus midget Hans falls for a beautiful, normal-sized trapeze artist named Cleopatra, who only marries him in order to inherit his enormous fortune (\u0085where a circus midget gets such riches is anyone's guess). That's all you need to know. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the hair-raising hysterics.The \"normal\" actors in the film do a sufficient enough job. Cleopatra and Hercules overact mercilessly, but it works well in the context of their characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how relatable Venus and Phroso were. I expected them to be the \"Barbie and Ken\" fake-sympathy couple. But the compassion for their \"freak\" costars seems sweetly genuine. (On a sour note: Roscoe, the stuttering clown, annoyed the living hell out of me!) And then there are the \"freaks\" themselves: obviously the most distinctive part about the movie. By now you must know, through cultural osmosis perhaps, that Browning selected real sideshow performers for his cast members---and, let me tell you, this strange decision is hugely effective! A few standouts: the Siamese twins are hilariously good, the woman who eats with her feet is pretty bad-ass---and, of course, there's lovable Schlitze. But the \"freak\" with the strongest presence (in my eyes) is Johnny Eck, the \"Half Boy\". Even during the banquet scene, with a table swarmed by mesmerizing sideshow stars, my eyes always wandered in his direction. Extremely handsome with an unforgettable smile, Eck handles his physical deformity so naturally, it feels normal. After a while, you don't really notice he's walking on his hands. The same can be said for the other \"living, breathing monstrosities\" in the film. You learn to look past their \"defects\" to see the subtle heartache behind each pair of eyes.Decades before its time, FREAKS was an incredibly advanced movie for the early 1930's. The storyline is rich and complex, which was a rarity in \"horror\" films of that day and age. Critics credit Hitchcock's PSYCHO with being a fascinating character study in addition to a taut and tense terror show. In many ways, so is FREAKS. It will haunt your dreams---but not for the reasons you'd think. Exploitative? Yes. Campy? Absolutely. But those are the elements that make FREAKS such a lingering masterpiece.",

He breaks up with his girlfriend Frieda and tries to win Cleopatra's heart. Cleopatra doesn't love him (she is in love with the strongman Hercules), but since he is rich she and Hercules fools Hans into to marrying her. During the marriage-ceremony Cleopatra finds out that if you marry a freak, you'll have to live with freaks(be one of them). She doesn't want to do that.\nDuring the ceremony they start chanting. Cleopatra get's very upset and yells at them, ruining the wedding and embarrassing Hans in front of his \"family\". She soon realises that she shouldn't have done that. The freaks are one big family and doesn't like when \"normal\" people exploit and humiliate them and their friends.Everything gets much worse when she tries to kill Hans with poison to inherit his treasure. All of the freaks are on to her and eventually Hans finds out about it. A rainy and dark night they confront her and chase her through the forrest. They end up turning her into a freak. A legless, scarred, voiceless, chickenlady that sits in a cage in the sideshow. Bad thing seems to happen to bad people. The strongman Hercules is also chased by the freaks for trying to rape or kill Venus, one of the \"normal\" girls on the show.

He has left the sideshow and all of his friends. Frieda visits him and tries to comfort him. The end!*SPOILERS*\nThis is and was a very special movie and has been so since it was made. It was the end of Todd Browning's career, since it was too much for the critics. All the freak-actors in the movie where  handicapped and disfigured for real!

Freak's was just that, a fresh idea with a huge message. Are normal people the freak's with greedy souls or are the deformed people. What drew me in was the base of the movie and the message it told. A beautiful but cold woman wins the heart of a short guy and uses him for her own greed.Though this movie was edited down to soften the movie it still was powerful. I felt for the deformed people because they were the ones who suffers the most from the nasty remarks during each show. Olga Baclanova (Cleopatra) steals the movie as the cold hearted vamp. Harry and Daisy Earles as the little people were just as powerful as Hans and Freda.I would love to see the full movie if it ever happens or if the lost footage is ever found. Tod Browning was hired to make a movie more scarier than \"Frankenstein\" but what he created was far more interesting than a horror movie. What he created was a movie about revenge being a dish served cold and was I thought careful not to exploit the wrong people. Even after 90 years this movie still packs that punch. I'm glad I watched it as I was glued to the screen. The end was a bit unexpected but proved that greed gets nobody nowhere.I highly recommend this movie as it will not disappoint you or anyone.",

Nothing like this could be done today except maybe to be viewed on the dark net.I think you could be either enthralled or revolted by Freaks. It's such a stand alone production that first-time viewers are usually going to be caught off-guard. In any case, it's hard not to have a visceral reaction one way or the other.Without going into plot details, a portion of the cast is made up of people with severe disabilities or physical defects. Some clearly have very limited mental capacities but others seem to know exactly what they're doing. I suspect that much of this line-up would have been what you'd see in a 19th century traveling carnival side-show.I'm not easily offended or shocked but I'm a little uncomfortable with what's going on here. Politically correct doesn't really apply, it's beyond that. As to whether it represents inspired, courageous, avant-garde filmmaking or is an example of vomitous bad taste and ignorance is, I suppose, up to the viewer. But if anyone responds with just a 'meh' I suspect their own tastes and social skills are a bit outside the normal.I suppose Freaks speaks to our human ambivalence in dealing with things that are bizarre, abnormal or revolting. Most of us can't resist at least taking a glance at a book filled with pictures of those with congenital anomalies. Many feel the same way about photos of victims savaged and mutilated by violence or injury. You're glad it's not you, but then turn to the next page to see the next repellent example.I can't recommend this film but I wouldn't say no one should watch it.

The first half most of the movie was hard to follow, dye to getting so many new characters too quickly, and the first half at least to me was pretty difficult to follow, it's like the first half was the introduction to all of the characters that live in this circus. We meet our midgets and the male one is in love with a beautiful lady, that is just evil, and ready to manipulate him. It was first a joke, she was messing around with him, while she had her true macho boyfriend in the background that she hid from him. The second half is when the female midget goes out of her way to tell the lady to stop, and somehow goes out of her way to say that he is rich. The lady then decides to marry the male midget, in order to kill him and get all of his richness. Also, throughout of the movie, we can see the macho constantly making fun of the different people, and the whole movie is just a message, to who the real freaks are? See, from one angle we see these different people to be different, and we classify them differently and downgrade them. While the \"regular\" people, look regular, but there are actually the freaks, because they are the ones that are capable of breaking a midget's heart, and to the point of killing him, just for personal gain. This movie is in the same boat as Cannibal Holocaust, as in who is really in the wrong here? I am not going to spoiler the ending, but it's awesome and depressing at the same time. Also ill be completely honest, i think this movie is away of it's time. Because to this day i am positive that different people keep being treated bad by the rest of society, i am sure that that did not change a lot. Since people will judge just because over your skin tone, religion and such, i am positive that being different is in the same boat.

It isn't really \"scary\" in the same way that Tod Browning's Dracula (1931) or other conventional horror films are. Instead we are subjected to the horrors of ridicule and oppression faced by people who were born different from what we think of as conventionally normal.The wedding table scene is of course famous as I recognized the chant instantly but had no idea where I had heard it before. Cleopatra being terrified of becoming one of them is an apt metaphor for how the privileged feel toward the less fortunate.However, this film is very dated technically. I could barely understand the dialogue and I am a guy that refuses to use subtitles for English language films if I can help it. Where I was more forgiving of Dracula for the sound, I cannot do the same here. It doesn't sound like Tod Browning tried to improve this aspect of the film and this was made a year later and after other films were made that sounded a lot better. My knowledge of 1930's films is pretty lacking but there's no way they had this much trouble with sound recording in all the works from 1932.

I saw the film as a 16 year old in 1983, and recently pounced on the long awaited DVD release.This film was so powerful, even back then, that I felt what Ellen Burstyn described as 'old fear' when I loaded the DVD. For over twenty years these images, and the famous picture of Browning with the cast, have made my blood run cold. The deft handling of the final sequence alone, qualifies this film as the celluloid equivalent of a nightmare.Some of you will not want to have this feeling evoked, and watching the vast majority of today's so called 'horror' films, where everything is displayed, subtlety is eschewed, and no thought is given to any lasting effects on the viewer, you will avoid it.Essentially, the essence of 'fear' could be described as any distortion of what we know as humanity, or humanness. Horror films that do their job best are the ones that take the human form and modify it in such a way as to make it different, but immediately recognisable. We would not be scared of Frankenstein's monster, if he didn't look essentially 'human' but with a twist. The thing that comes out of John Hurt in 'Alien' unsettles because a human is involved. This film is unique not only because it is bereft of studio trickery and comes from a bygone age when there was far more opportunity to push the envelope than there is today, with formulaic nonsense everywhere and the over riding desire for commercialism and cinematic capitalism. No folks, it works because it takes our preconceived and deep seated views of the human body and turns them on their head. Some time ago advertisers caught on to this deep seated fear we all have. There was an advertisement on British TV of a teenage girls's face talking to camera. You saw it and felt unsettled, simply because her eyes were marginally too far apart, her ears were too far back and her mouth was too wide. I can't recall what was being marketed but it had a profoundly unsettling effect on the viewer. Of course, that was a computer simulated attempt to sell a product, which made it 'OK'. This of course, is real. These people are real and live lives just as we do. We feel uneasy looking at them simply because they are outside the realms of physiological aestheticism. If I could have met anyone from the movies, I'd pick Browning every time.

            "content": "I love this movie. One of my favorite things about it how ready the \"freaks\" are to ride for each other (I don't say \"circus folks\" because some of the circus folks, namely the ones that weren't \"freaks,\" were rude). I'd be friends with the \"freaks\" long before being friends with people like Cleopatra and Hercules! The \"freaks\" know how to enjoy life and have a good time. They have their own drama but take it in stride. They were accepting of Cleo who, in their world, was the real freak, but she couldn't accept them. To me, the freaks were the ones who had things figured out.Some of the acting is dated (which I never mind because I love old films), and some of it is inconsistent in quality, namely from Harry and Daisy (as Hans and Frieda), but even they two had some truly great moments in which their acting was really good. One major thing that hurt Harry and Daisy's acting was them trying to clearly enunciate English. Still, Frieda was really easy to root for, and among the \"regular\" people, I really liked Venus. She was a real one. Phroso was funny. Also, he could have used some work on his romance skills, but one particular moment with him and Venus (when he was working on his bathtub gag) was really cute. I really like them as a couple.Finally, I really loved the costuming for Frieda in particular. They had her looking very classy throughout, and I really liked how she carried herself. Also, Cleopatra's wedding dress was beautiful, and the styling with the hair and jewelry was on point. The hairstyling for Frieda, Venus, and Cleopatra was tight and consistent throughout the movie. And I really liked Hans' suits.It's a great movie if you go into it with an open mind. I bumped off one star for the inconsistent acting quality and the poorly stitched together parts, especially the end that was added later (and looked very degraded), but overall it's a great, quick watch. Frankly, I wouldn't have minded a longer story. But after watching Midsommar earlier today (and not being able to finish it because of the pacing), this was like a balm.",

The famous scene with dinner and party for the inclusion of the new member in the freak group, than, works as an initiation: freak creatures trust her. But during the story it is revealed her lie, and with a grotesque and efficacious scene of Freaks upcoming under the rain as mysterious strengths, the mean woman is transformed in a real freak.

            "content": "Tod Browning's Freaks is a very effective movie, even almost seventy years after its original release. At the time of its release it was taken out of the theaters and even banned for thirty years in England. Freaks was met with revulsion. Freaks brings the audience into the world of the circus freak, attempting to provide a glimpse into their lives. It tells the story of a \"freak\" named Hans, who falls in love with Cleopatra, a \"normal\" woman. Cleopatra learns of a fortune Hans has, and marries him with that in mind. She conspires with the \"strong man\" to poison Hans and get his money. But when one freak finds out, the code of the freaks kicks in, resulting in ten minutes which have been described as \"the most harrowing in all of cinema.\" With an average plot, below average acting, and a run time of just over an hour, as far as film goes this movie is nothing special. But all of the freaks are played by real side-show freaks, which gives the film its controversial status. Freaks attempts to sympathize with their lot in society, but at the same time exploits their abnormalities for the entertainment of the audience. For instance, there's a scene with a man who has no arms and no legs lighting and smoking a cigarette. Now, this had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and is merely something for the audience to gape at. Some of the depictions are less than empathetic; the conjoined twins are each getting married to different men, who remark to each other that they must come over and visit sometime. Final Verdict The movie tends to neglect some of the day to day struggles of the freaks, but concentrates more on the code of the freaks, which is, essentially, if you mess with one of them you mess with all of them. The movie is about how people treat each other. Freaks is, although at times slow moving and very difficult to find, worth seeing. I wouldn't necessarily encourage you to run out and find a copy, but if the chance pops up you might not want to turn it down.",

Legend has it a screening of the film that they all went to see changed their lives, they even adopted the freak theme, changing it slightly from \"goubble gobble... we accept her... one of us\" to \"gabba gabba... we accept you... one of us\", recording it and displaying it on a massive placard that Joey would hold up on stage, it became the anthem of a misplaced generation.I was not disappointed. This film is beautiful. It's not really a horror film at all except for the last 10 minutes, but really a drama about the lives of the freaks in the circus and the abuse they could receive. I had apprehension going into it, I thought it was going to be hugely offensive by today's politically correct standards but it's not, it's a sweet and endearing, ever so slightly haunting, fable, that shows the corrupt human mind to be the real 'freaks' of the title.What else can one say about a film that already has 185 comments... I don't know... I was talking to my friend Jack, told him I'd just watched the film and asked him if he had seen it, which he had. I asked him what he thought and he said \"I don't like CGI\". I have to admit neither do I, but the computer-generated imagery wasn't heavy in this film and if anything could have used with a bit more on that last shot of the Chicken Lady. I am eagerly anticipating the remake with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. Thanks",

            "content": "When talking about exploitation films,we have to go back to the year 1932. The director Tod Browning had just finished filming his success movie Dracula and wanted his next film to be about sideshow. He knew about that subject very much because he himself had ran away to circus at the age of 16 where he worked before his movie career. He contacted many circuses around the country and got himself a group of special, unique people from the world of sideshow and circus.The filming of Freaks started in December 1931 and the premiere was already on the next year's February. The critics absolutely hated it and the movie was cut about 30 minutes. It was too much for the \"normal\" people to be described as the monsters for once.Freaks tells the story of Hans, a dwarf working in circus, who falls in love with the beautiful trapeze artist Cleopatra who starts using him for his large inheritance. Hans seems to be the only one not noticing this and the two get married. When the plot of Cleopatra and Hercules, the circus strongman she has a secret relationship with, is revealed, the freaks get their revenge.That summary is only a soft touch of what this movie has to offer. The audience is introduced to many of these so-called freaks, who are treated as second-class citizens by almost everybody, even fellow circus workers. Though they are oppressed, the freaks still keep being cheerful and enjoying life. Until now it sounds pretty clichey, but the difference to other movies comes when they are not saved by a normal-bodied person nor getting acceptance from the society.It's sad to know that there are people watching Freaks only as an exploitative freakshow movie when there's so much more to it. The names this film was marketed with in the 40's were just horrible. \"Nature's Mistakes\" and \"The Monster Show\". I'm pretty sure that's not what Tod Browning would've wanted.Freaks is one of the best pre-code horror movies that was so much ahead of its time that it destroyed the director's career. The film will keep shocking, frightening and even touching people in a way the people of that time missed. It's a movie classic that every fan of the genre should see at least once.",

I really struggled coming up with a fair assessment on this film, so here's my best shot. I do not believe Freaks exploits the actors, since each of them demonstrates compassion among each other and from the viewer. At times I think the filmmakers devolve the characters into stereotypical movie monsters, but the aforementioned empathy they encourage makes it hard not to cheer for them.I think the biggest problem with the film involves the relationship between Hans and Frieda, played by Harry and Daisy Earles, which comes off as a bit unconvinced, or at least off-kilter, but maybe that's the point.In the end, the film is way ahead of its time in depicting the mentally handicapped in a positive and innocent light in contrast with the greed and corruption of their counterparts. The dancing scene at the pond also creeped me out, but maybe that says more about my own prejudices against innocence than anything, and I think that is one of the goals of this films.3 out of 4 stars for Freaks.",

This is where the film enters a flashback and you see what had happened and where you are introduced to the Freaks. From there on you are exploited to these characters and you are left with that mystery on what had happened to this person.This movie is categorized as a horror and I have to say that this feels more like a drama with a small amount of horror sprinkled throughout the story; mostly at the end of the film. The film centers around a few characters and you see their interactions among one another that involves deceit or romance. The most interesting part was following the tragedy that will ensue this character. With just the reaction from the people observing this person, you imagine what this person looks like and you start to imagine what had happened until the ending, in which does not disappoint. I don't know if that was a real person or was done in makeup, but that ending was very effective, especially for its time. However, I can't say that the rest of the film was interesting.I understand that parts of the film are forever gone, so there may have been some footage that dealt with some issues that I've had. Although I liked how memorable they are, the Freaks actually don't do anything particularly special. They were used as exploits and it wasn't enough to hold up well. You see them and after you react a certain way, they never appear again until the dinner scene with the chant that cinephiles will know. The movie did focus on the human characters well enough to where you despise or like some of them. Focusing on the woman who deceits Hans was well done and I wanted to focus more on what was going on there. However, when it came to the circus leader, I felt that his presence, especially with the female character who falls in love with him was a little bit pointless and caused the film to drag a bit. I understand that this is part of its time, but this subplot did not hold up well. During the climax, they served a purpose, but overall, they weren't really memorable characters.Despite all of this, based on TV shows and movies, I can tell that this is still such an inspiration that I feel that fans of horror should watch this to see how famous directors were inspired by this film.",

This being the case, it probably would have been better to have done a documentary on the sideshow, as opposed to attempting to write a bad story around frighteningly bad acting.Harry Earles was not an actor. I couldn't tell if he didn't speak English or if he merely had no understanding of inflection. His sister (who played his wife. CREEPY) was slightly better, but only very slightly. So what do you do when you have a group of circus performers who can't act? You surround them by actors who also can't act. Yeah, that makes sense.The story claims to show the freaks as the truly \"normal\" ones and the other performers as the \"freaks\", which I suppose was an unusual concept in 1932. However, they also essentially portray the freaks as a cult in various points of the movie, and when the main antagonist is paid back, they disfigure her and then apparently use some sort of bizarre unexplained magic to turn her into the human chicken, making her \"one of us\" (hence the mantra). I realize, of course, that it was the 30s and they couldn't show anything, so they were trying to do the \"what you don't see is more disturbing than what you do see\" deal- something I generally miss in horror films. However, this wasn't so much disturbing as it leaves the viewer confused. I somehow doubt this really helped the argument that they were trying to show them in a \"positive\" light.Despite all of its flaws, there is something incredibly intriguing about the movie.

            "content": "I thought that the idea was creative for the time and I am sure that it made a lot of people uncomfortable back then. I can say that it didn't draw that reaction from me. I am more accepting of people who don't conform to the norm. I actually found the movie boring because the story was right in front of me and I didn't have to guess at anything. I found it sad that the world can be so cruel, but I can get that when I walk out my door. I don't have to watch a movie about it. I did like the fact that the story was actually going on in the past because I think that is the first time I have seen that in the films that we have watched thus far. If I had to say one scene that I found the most eerie, it would be the one where the \"little people\" are coming after the lady in the rain underneath the carriages (or whatever you call them). I didn't like that scene because it made me feel like I was supposed to find the \"little people\" frightening.",

I wouldn't say the movie was terrible because it was different it just wasn't my kind of movie by any means. I thought the acting was mediocre at best and the sound wasn't great either so there's two huge flaws already. There was no exceptional filming technique everything was pretty standard with such a crazy movie I thought they could of at least applied some filming tricks. I will say that the makeup, special effects (especially the lightning and thunder scenes at the end) and casting was great. I was shocked when I heard those were all real people. My favorite scene of the movie in a completely non-cruel way was the limbless man lighting up a cigarette, I was fascinated. The way that guy moved was the craziest thing I've seen since the \"spider crawl\" in the Exorcist. I think one of the oddest scenes I've ever scene was that dinner scene with everyone passing that drink around it was just creepy. In the end though I guess the movie had a good message about how we should not judge other people, accept others for what they are and in the end everything comes back to us.",

I was always impressed that the people depicted in the film actually lived some sort of 'normal' life despite their physical oddities, many of which can be repaired now.  Think of it as horror/revenge movie with an unsubtle sociological message and a bit of history all wrapped in one very strange package.",

With all the people in this world that are \"different\", it's nice to see when one of the \"beautiful people\" gets what they deserve! It was also nice to see how these characters stuck together like a family. At first, I started watching this movie because there was nothing else on TV. Then, after about 5 minutes, I was hooked. Why can't we have movies that have such interesting characters anymore? I guess the old carnival/circus acts where the misfits of the world? This sure beats the heck out of a lot of clowns popping out of a VW Bug.",

            "content": "Browning's cult classic is a plunge into the ultimate macabre, using actual sideshow individuals to tell its story. Much of the movie is weighed down by a moral broadcast of \"I accept you, you accept me;\" a message that, while noble at heart, would have been much more convincingly conveyed, had it not been siphoned down the viewers' throats with the subtlety of a Sesame Street episode. However, the movie is still worth watching simply for the climactic ending sequence, in which the \"freaks\" rise up to exact revenge on those who have wronged them, and in the process take creepiness to a whole new level.",

It seems that Angelo Rositto was in films for a looooong time, starting in 1927, and ending his career in the 80s with his role as Master in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, for 59 films in his career. Just the other day TCM was screening the 1929 cut of The Mysterious Island, in which he plays an uncredited underwater-creature-thingie. What a special little guy, what things he must have seen in his life. It amazes me, his hard work over a life spanning 83 years, and he never made enough money from his films to live comfortably, so he owned a newspaper stand in Hollywood. Angelo, rest in peace.",

            "content": "Directed and produced by Tod Browning, \"Freaks\" is an interesting take into the lives of sideshow performers. I found the story to be particularly compelling. The true horror was not the way the disfigured freaks looked, but it was how the normal looking acts treated and conspired against the disfigured. The disfigured were the truly honorable people, while the others were the real monsters. That being said, the verisimilitude is relatively great in substance. Disfigured \"freaks\" in real life are usually treated that way, especially in that time. However, midgets are hilarious. The acting was well-done. Ogla Baclanova stands out, in my opinion. I will recommend this film to anybody who is trying to see a different kind of horror film. I'm sure they will gawk when I mention the year 1932 but they will surely come around as I did.",

            "content": "Tod browning's Freaks is arguably the most eccentric film of it's time staring a cast of almost-unknown actors and circus performers. What makes this film memorable is the odd traits of each character, the main story with Hans and Cleopatra and the side stories which include memorable lines such as\n\"I think she likes ya!... but he don't.\"What makes Freaks a great film is the fact that nobody has ever, and probably will ever, make a film this unique. Freaks wouldn't be accepted in a modern society and it is a demonstration of deviance from the social norm. Freaks is the epitome of a \"weird movie.\"What these circus performers do is absolutely incredible, such as the famous prince lighting a match and his cigarette with his teeth, as well as the woman eating with her feet. As an audience we feel sympathetic for the characters, as well as a bit of memorization for their lifestyle.The film has an essence of camaraderie for the main characters with the circus folk repeatedly saying \"Hurt one, hurt them all\" or something to that effect. Freaks can be seen as a symbol of friendship between a group of human beings.The film is so incredibly unique, with extraordinary characters who virtually played themselves. We get to see the life of a circus performer in the 1930's. Not to mention that the film has an artsy air about it, with the second scene involving Cleopatra on the trapeze in the circus. Browning never really made a good recovery for a film that was quite shocking for its time. Still, Freaks remains as one of the most intriguing films of the 1930's. It even holds up to today's standards for those who are not inclined for older pictures. We accept this film!",
