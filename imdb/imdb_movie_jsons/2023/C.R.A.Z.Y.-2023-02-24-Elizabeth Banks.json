I saw the poster and title and thought, \"I'm definitely watching that.\" After seeing it, I can say with confidence that it's exactly what a movie named Cocaine Bear should be.Aside from being an extremely fun and outrageous thriller, this movie is hysterical. I was full-volume laughing frequently. So many parts are the perfect combination of memorable and hilarious. It knows exactly what it's doing.The other thing that made me happy is seeing a studio have the courage to allow the filmmakers to go all out. I compare it to M3gan which was going for a similar tone. But M3gan was toned down to PG-13 so teens could watch. Cocaine Bear is rated R as it absolutely should be. It's not gratuitous but it never feels like it's holding back.I had a blast with this movie. If the title or premise intrigue you, you will most likely be pleased.

If there was more of a focus on just a couple of characters as the protagonists it would have been better.The humour didn't always work for me. Sometimes it was good but it fell flat a little too often.The central premise is great but it doesn't go far enough in my opinion. I feel like there was a lot more fun to have with the concept. Although saying that there are some wildly fun and gruesome body horror moments, and the effects on the bear and the injury detail are top notch.Overall a bit of a let down. This film is mostly fun as expected, but the premise wears a little thin come the third act. Not quite the riotous spectacle I was hoping for.",

I Googled the name to look for the trailer, and stumbled on the Wikipedia page where I learned this movie is loosely based on actual events, and that's what sold me to give it a watch. If the fact a bear actually found and did cocaine for months isn't funny enough alone to give this film a watch, I don't know what is.I'm just glad the filmmakers and producers took the already hilarious true concept, and made a film just as ridiculously funny. It's been a while I've heard an entire theatre burst out in laughter so many times. The entire film was simply put, comedy gold. The story could've been a little tighter in a few of the subplots, but the casting of the various colorful characters and all their performances made up for any of the writing issues.The 95 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing, and the soundtrack was awesome and spot-on for that era. This truly is one of those rare ridiculous films that actually worked. It's a fun ride start to finish. Final fun fact; the actual taxidermied bear can be found at the Kentucky Fun Mall in Kentucky USA.",

Its like they had a good idea here, and went out of their way to avoid doing it.There are jokes, but they're cringey. There is action. But the CGI is mixed. What there isn't is anything to get invested in. There's all these characters you won't care about. Mostly walking around the woods talking. Then there's the bear. Who gets a couple of good kills in before it passes out.Boring is the worst thing the movie could of been. But some stuff early on in the movie is also done in extremely bad taste.

When it tends to drag a little bit the bear always pops out for more fun and kills so it's always entertaining and goofy. Great directing, special effects and acting. Most of the easy jokes landed, the whole theatre was laughing out loud the entire movie. A good comedy horror entry. Nothing revolutionary but ultimately a really fun popcorn movie.",

The film is incredibly strange as it is not exactly funny, heartwarming, or scary...yet is delves into all three of these and sort of keeps you smiling and kind of bizarrely focused and enjoying yourself.

Movie was completely spineless, afraid of it's own rating.Instead of watching a fun horror comedy, you are stuck with about an hour of dumb character development, a mother and daughter bonding, friends becoming friends, and some incredibly lame sub plot about overcoming grief.This movie took a creative premise and somehow managed to make the most streamlined hollywood cash grab I have seen in years.",

I think I might have chuckled once, which perhaps garners half a star, but other than that, I didn't find any comedy in this at all. You'll laugh harder watching 'Goodfellas', one of Liotta's decent works (among many).I didn't realize there was going to be some focus on kid actors, and as hard as they tried, they simply weren't funny, but they probably weren't given anything funny to work with. Certainly 'Sandlot' proves you can make a kid-centric comedy, so it's not the kids' fault. As for the adults, couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. The movie would have been far more interesting if they all had met their demise at the paws of the bear.So basically, there wasn't enough comedy for the comedy fans, enough gore for the gore fans, and no discernible drama for the drama fans. Essentially, this was a bunch of you've-seen-this-before scenes with an occasional bear attack. I will say the bear looked good. Huge disappointment.",

            "content": "'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama.",

I was hoping for a 'so bad it's good' type of movie, where I laugh at the absurdity of it all, as giant bear that has done cocaine rips everybody apart!! You know a nice bit of gore/comedy. It even failed on that level. I didn't laugh once, it's just plain bad. I had more fun with the three Sharknado movies, let that sink in!!It's not funny, it's not intense and it's not scary. I spent most of my time trying to figure out where I knew the mother from (It's the Bon Jovi music video for Always) likewise her daughter (She was the young girl in The Turning)At one point I checked my watch to see how long was left, as nothing seemed to be happening, and it was only half an hour in. I thought it was at least double that.We spend time with a bunch of human characters, that I just didn't care about, so there was no stakes at all. Ray Liotta is there The guy who played Han Solo in Solo has a bigger role as his son. Jesse Tyler Fergurson (from Modern Family) has a small role, but the standout for me was Margo Metindale as the ranger. But it is a low bar, as the acting is not great.There was one Sly Stallone related thing, that I waited to see if there was a pay off to, but there wasn't!! I was more bothered about that, than any of the human characters.It's dialogue is cringe, the violence is tame and nothing to wrote home about, at all and it's not funny. The trailer suggested a dark horror comedy. This movie did not live up to the trailer .As for Elizabeth Banks.... I preferred Charlies AngelsAn unfunny (I'm not sure of it was trying to be, but the actors seemed to think they were in a comedy, based on the performances) badly edited, dull, waste of talent and time. This goes on my worst of the year list.",

            "content": "Cocaine Bear is very self aware which is exactly what should be expected from a movie with that title but the problem is that it doesn't make it funny. Pretty much none of the jokes landed for me and the movie looked very plain and uninteresting. For a movie set in the 80s I would expect more flair and a better energy from it. I think that problem comes down mainly to the director, Elizabeth Banks. I think she has no sense of comedic timing and her movies look very bland. Additionally, the cast is underwhelming as they weren't the right people to bring the necessary charisma and energy into the movie. A film like Cocaine Bear needs character actors that can liven up the movie whilst chewing the scenery. We get some of that but this movie needed guys like Nicolas Cage or Gary Busey to go make it live up to its title.Furthermore, the character dynamics and their plots are not what I was looking for. Instead of a family story this should have just followed a few groups of cops and gangsters, maybe some junkies looking for the lost cocaine and getting mauled by the bear. Now, it does sort of happen but the movie tried to have too much of a feel-good story with nice characters that just didn't fit. What it needed was that 70s/80s sleaze that some schlock movies from that era used to have where the majority of the characters are corrupt and we just want the bear to murder them all. That's not to say Cocaine Bear is all bad. I did appreciate some of the gore and despite me complaining about the cast, some of them did a good job like Ray Liotta who fit the movie well but wasn't allowed to do much in it. Also it's nice to get an R-rated movie in the cinema instead of the usual watered down family entertainment that gets released constantly. On top of that, it's nice and short although it does drag a bit. However, I just think the movie could've been more if the director and cast were more suited to the project and if the movie went all out but as it stands it's just bearable.",

But what the trailers doesn't show is you instead get introduced to endless characters and most of the movie becomes about random people.From drug dealers, to a ranger to others. You \"bearly\" get to see the bear at all. Which ends up making the movie beyond boring. Unless you want to see the stories of all these people.Admittedly I had no expectation for this movie. I knew I was lose brain cells watching it. If you want a horror movie, go watch something else. If you want to save yourself time, just read the actual story of the cocaine bear.

I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice?

Unfortunately, if they don't get creative, then you're stuck with a movie that is hard to watch.Cocaine Bear has it's bright spots. It's a great premise for a movie. There are a few good scenes that grab your attention or make you laugh. But there's too much dead space. It feels like they had a few good key scenes in mind, like the ambulance scene, and then just wrote the rest of the movie around them. So you have a few cool scenes and the rest is just filler.That's really sad because making a movie called Cocaine Bear a fun entertaining movie should have been a slam dunk. Hollywood had made cheesy, low budget Nature Goes Haywire type movies for decades. Some of them are drek. But some are entertaining. The creators had plenty of moves to choose from to give them an idea of how this type of film works.I do want to give a shout out to Jesse Tyler Ferguson He got into the spirit of the thing and his character was fun.

What I did expect was some satisfying creature violence and some darkly humorous comedy to pad the time between the carnage. And the film 100% delivered on these fronts.I truly appreciated that the script wasted no time. We get to see our titular monster bear in action from the opening scene, then we get the bear minimum (pun intended) of character exposition for all the people who may or may not get mauled, and we're off to the races for more bloody fun.And oh, it's pretty fun. The CGI for the bear is shockingly good at times, and the gore is always impressive. It's not shown all the time, which was smart of them. It's only really shown at brief moments for maximum shock. Elizabeth Banks actually does have a knack for this, as it turns out. Color me pleasantly surprised.Of course, not all the characters get to shine. Would you expect them to? Most of them are pretty disposable. But even the inconsequential ones get fun personalities and all the actors give it their all and are clearly having fun, no matter how small their roles.What did surprise me most was that the film actually does give the true lead characters some heartfelt beats and emotional lessons that they take away from their horrific day in the woods.One man learns to appreciate his friends amidst his grief, another learns to stand up for what's right, a mother and daughter learn to prioritise each other, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking or powerful by any means, but it did make me feel something.And I truly did not expect a movie called Cocaine Bear to make me feel anything. The film won't be a timeless classic, but it's a really good time at the movies.And Y'know what? If it's not trying to be anything other than that, I'm perfectly happy with it.",

The titular bear is therefore its best attribute. Beyond a great design and convincing CGI, the picture's utilization of the creature is often very entertaining in its comedic and more intense moments. Of the other roles, Whitlock Jr and Martindale particularly stand out. Both have great timing, while also enjoying the best dialogue of the entire ensemble. Unfortunately, the screenplay fails each remaining cast member. There are simply too many characters and subplots, leading to shallow, paint-by-numbers character development. A great deal of dialogue holds no weight, either, between an overall mixed humor and emotional plays that fall completely flat. The abundance of storylines affects the editing, as well, although that itself suffers from misplaced jump scares and likely showing just a bit too much unnecessary gore. Nevertheless, Cocaine Bear is a recommendable comedy for fans to the genre. Rest in Peace Ray Liotta.",

And this film did not do that.I love comedy-horror when it's done right. I've found the key to getting these films right though is the humour. The horror elements will always be hit and miss, but if the audience is laughing along the way then they will forgive the imperfections in the horror. I didn't laugh once during 'Cocaine Bear'. The editing was very strange. It kept stepping on all the jokes. Every time a line that could've potentially been funny came up it would quickly cut to the next scene before it had time to breathe, almost as if the film was embarrassed by the standard of the joke.So when its not funny you only really have the bear scenes to look forward to. There are some decent kills I will give the movie credit for that. It wasn't afraid to be quite brutal at times. But the CGI of the bear looked awful and really took me out of a lot of scenes.I didn't go into 'Cocaine Bear' expecting a masterpiece, but I also didn't go in expecting to be checking my watch multiple times during a 95 minute film.

Which is precisely what this film provides.The kills are gruesome and pretty funny at times, the bear itself is surprisingly very well done. By that I mean the cgi, it was I must admit really good. From a budget of $35 million that is very impressive. They must've spent $1 mill on cast, crew, and marketing, then $34 mill on the bears cgi as my friend and I joked.Anyway this film provides exactly as advertised and nothing more. But to me this was just boring, stupid, and uninteresting. I don't understand how this passes for entertainment these days but whatever, simply put it's not for me.IMDb: 4/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.",

Plenty of shock value, hilarious behavior, brutal, solid dialogue, the bear madness was insane and the cinematography was incredibly done. A bold fun movie by Elizabeth Banks that should be considered a hit! An interesting final role for Ray Liotta being a villain and looked rough I'm sure the entire crew was happy to work with him regardless. I absolutely loved Cocaine Bear I'll want to own it when available. O' Shea Jackson, Isaiah Whitlock JR, Keri Russel, Aldren Ehrenreich and The Bear were all fantastic!Come on my review isn't that bad and the movie is great fun.

            "content": "Inspired by the 1985 true story of a drug runner's plane crash, missing cocaine, and the black bear that ate it, this wild dark comedy finds an oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converging in a Georgia forest where a 500- pound apex predator has ingested a staggering amount of cocaine and gone on a coke-fueled rampage for more blow... and blood.Starring Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, and Ray Liotta in one of his final roles, Cocaine Bear manages to do a disservice to every single one of them. Russell, known for her talents on television in The Americans, a gripping thriller that displays the actress' immense talents, manages to convey little of that skill or charm here. While not fully her fault (she's served with a script that's dead on arrival), this movie may prove to be one of her worst performances to date. Playing Sari (there isn't a character in this film that has a full first and last name), the mother of a child who's gone missing in the same woods the eponymous coked out bear is rampaging in, Russell has little to do other than fret and cast about the forest in search of her daughter.Likewise with O'Shea Jackson Jr. As Daveed, a member of the local drug ring tasked with retrieving the lost product. Jackson's rapport with Alden Ehrenreich may be the best thing about the movie; the two have decent chemistry together, and in a world where the actors were given substantial roles and parts with actual depth, some magic could've been made. The real shame comes with this being one of the final on screen performances of Ray Liotta. Known best for his work on Scorsese's Goodfellas, Liotta's career was always one of hits and misses, but the movie makes for a sad note to begin a career ending run on.Directed by Elizabeth Banks, Cocaine Bear makes for her third directorial feature. There's signs of promise with Banks, but sadly due to being restricted with such lackluster material it doesn't provide her with the ability to fully spread her wings. Still, the film's pacing keeps things moving at a quick clip, throwing the audience right into the thick of it early and doing what it can to keep the energy up. The script, written by Jimmy Warden, is far and away the weakest point of the entire production. Paper-thin characters, undercooked plot lines, and terrible dialogue make this movie borderline unbearable.Overall, Cocaine Bear, while fun in concept, is an unsalvageable film. From subpar acting to lackluster directing, the end result is a funny short story stretched out over 95 agonizing minutes. Neither plot line has enough meat to last the entire film and somehow both combined still can't stretch to create a compelling enough narrative when the bear is off screen. While the bear itself warrants laughs during its blow-fueled quest for more cocaine, the human element is what holds the story back from being anything worthwhile. At best, this is a Friday night movie with friends after multiple drinks.",

            "content": "Director Elizabeth Banks undoubtedly thought the premise of the movie then, perhaps, laughed and most likely told her cast to just remember that they are making a bear on cocaine flick and have fun. But what did it have to be so...bland.The story is of a real life drug smuggling incident where a ton of cocaine was dropped from the sky and then a bear ingests the bulk of it only to die within minute. This is the germination of the story of weirdos attempting to recover it. Though it takes place in the mid-1980s, the way this is shot and constructed is too modern for the tone it was attempting to set. It buries the flick in a lot of needle drop familiar tunes, which should placate a lot of Gen Xers. But it does so more as a distraction that the idea became anemic somewhere in the middle. It becomes a drawn out skit that is painfully uneven. I found myself sighing how wonderfully funny this could've been. Wasted are the chops of Margo Matindale, Ehren Ehrenreich and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who seem to have lines spoonfed to them in an awkward attempt to make them more human. People don't act this way. And if they do in this universe, perhaps have it boil down to one adventure and not four. You have -- Father/Son/Friend drug dealers, Woman Looking for her kid in the woods, Punks harassing campers as Park Ranger thwarts them, Local cop leaving to investigate where the cocaine disappeared. There is just too much movie here. And EVERYONE cracks wise.All to the truly wasted talent of Keri Russell. She plays a mother who is desperate to find her daughter in this madcapped mess.I'm not sure what Banks's motivation was to make this. Perhaps it was just to make something dumb and fun. It is neither of those. It seems, midway through, to truly take itself too seriously. The cocaine jokes are tiring. We get it, people on cocaine are funny (I guess). That trope is so drained of nuance it was ballsy to attempt to resuscitate it. Instead, this is a bland comedy. Worst that we feel nothing when these despicable people do dumb things and are done away with by the bear.Though only under 100 minutes this felt VERY long. Prologuing it with a joke about Europeans first encountering the bear. Ugh.Make it stop.",

            "content": "Oh, \"Cocaine Bear,\" how I wanted to love you. In between martinis at a steak dinner with a friend, I offhandedly mentioned to him that I was planning an excursion to the theatre to watch this movie; \"Do you really want to go see that?\" he replied, a look of worry streaking across his face. I know it looks bad, I said, but I don't think I can resist. \"It looks beyond bad,\" he exclaimed. \"It looks terrible.\" Alas, I should've heeded my friend's warning because, indeed, \"Cocaine Bear\" was pretty terrible.With a ludicrous premise that would make even the most jaded person chuckle at its concept, \"Cocaine Bear\" seemed like it had all the ingredients for a fantastic time at the cinema. I mean, how can a movie about a killer bear high on cocaine possibly be boring? What on God's green earth would the filmmakers have to do to ruin such an idea? Oh, I know! All they'd have to do is focus not on the bear but instead on some of the most annoying human characters I've ever seen on film.Wow. I never talk during movies, but during \"Cocaine Bear\" I had to force myself not to scream \"Shut the *expletive* up\" at the characters inhabiting this movie due to how unbelievably frustrating they were to listen to - which brings us to this movie's first downfall: it's script. The dialogue in this movie is beyond grating; characters engage in rapid-fire conversations a la Quentin Tarantino, except where Tarantino actually writes engaging dialogue, \"Cocaine Bear\" contains just the most irritating and unfunny lines I've ever heard anyone speak. Granted, this may have been a purposeful choice on behalf of the filmmakers; after all, what better way to get your audience excited for a bear to wreak havoc than to fill your film with characters they can't wait to see get eaten alive? I regret to inform you that \"Cocaine Bear\" doesn't even deliver on this front, as the movie is surprisingly bloodless and neutered for an R-rated film.I can only imagine that the budget for this movie was quite low because \"Cocaine Bear\" won't even let its audience revel in its promised bloodshed. There is one uber-gory kill here (perhaps two, though the second one takes place at night and is hard to see, so I don't really count it); besides that, this movie moreso shows you the aftermath of its bear attacks instead of actually showing you the bear attacks in all their glorious carnage. I can't count how many times a kill takes place off screen, or how many times the movie will cut, randomly, to another scene in the middle of a kill, only coming back to it when the killing is said and done. And sure, maybe some audience members found this technique effective, but when I'm watching a movie called \"Cocaine Bear,\" I want to see said cocaine bear chowing down on unsuspecting people; the fact that the movie teases more often than it shows is unforgivable and my biggest complaint.And finally, \"Cocaine Bear's\" title character - the cocaine bear - is barely even in the film. Taking up time with a boring story and even more boring human characters, for some reason the film decides to overcomplicate things, trying to weave an elaborate narrative that all comes together in the end. I only have one question: Why? Why not just make a movie about a killer bear on cocaine on a rampage - that's what I wanted to see!I'm sick of writing about this movie, as every sentence is making me detest it more and more. As much as I wanted to love this film, I just didn't, as I don't think that it lived up to the premise that it promised me. However, audiences are seemingly enjoying it, so if you're at all interested I would recommend you giving this a go, because you may enjoy it. Just lower your expectations, and perhaps indulge in a certain controlled substance to enhance your moviegoing experience.",

In addition to the plot - loosely based on a real incident - we get some references to '80s pop culture (as well as the era's drug scare).And of course there's the cast. In addition to the CGI ursine star, we have Keri Russell, Brooklynn Prince (of \"The Florida Project\"), Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son), and Ray Liotta in his final role.

            "content": "Unfortunately, after the initial excitement of \"I'm watching this movie about a bear who does cocaine\" wears off, you realize that this movie is actually pretty awful, even for a dumb-fun movie. The acting, especially from the little girl, is atrocious. You know they're trying to be tongue-in-cheek, but they don't sell it the schlock, so it comes off more like they're unintentionally awful actors. It's kind of sad to watch, actually. Most of the main cast are seasoned actors, though, so I'm placing the blame on the script and direction for that. Speaking of the script, it's pathetic. It's like they got an AI to analyze a few comedies made in the last 10 years and write a script based on what it learned. Every single joke - and I mean EVERY single joke - is recycled, clich\u00e9d material. There's not a single original joke in the entire movie, and this is supposed to be a comedy. The editing is also a hack job. People who are supposed to be standing still jump around the room between cuts, the comedic timing is way off, and shot-reverse-shot scenes have about five different angles for absolutely no reason. It will literally go from an eye-level close up to a medium shot, then to a high-angle shot, then back to eye-level, then a low-angle, which two people are talking. I guess you could make the stupid argument that it's \"supposed\" to be bad, but this is nowhere near \"so bad it's funny\" bad - it's just straight garbage. Finally (and I guess this goes back to the script), the story is nonexistent and makes not a lick of sense whatsoever. Even for stupid movies like this, you need some kind of rules to establish a reality for your film. Instead, this movie just does whatever the hell it wants. There's no structure, no real climax, and no payoff. I would even venture to say that there's no ending. The main characters are within feet of Cocaine Bear when they're suddenly just \"safe\" - the bear eats the bad guy (Ray Liota) and then I guess just decides he's done chasing people. There's absolutely no reason why he doesn't continue going after the protagonists. The plot literally just stops. Anyway, I'm rambling. This movie sucked.",

In an attempt to lighten his load, he drops multiple duffel bags full of cocaine out of the plane. The pilot, Andrew C. Thornton II, then decides to chase after his fallen goods but fails and plummets to his death below. The duffel bags of cocaine, worth almost fifteen million US dollars, falls into the hands of a 175-pound American black bear who decides to consume it. The bear who, under this incredible influence, goes on a drug-fueled killing spree......I don't know wether my expectations were too high, or I wasn't in the mood, but Cocaine Bear just didn't resonate with me. I was sold on the title alone, and I wanted it to be a slice of exploitative B-movie mayhem. And while it does deliver that in very minute doses. It's a case of not delivering enough of the titular character. Call me spoilt, but I wanted more bear and less exposition.So we spend the majority of the film with two separate story arcs, in search of something or someone, and you can feel every lethargic step the groups are taking.When the Bear is on screen, it's fun, and the ambulance scene is a really good set piece, but one set piece does not make a good movie.The cast are fine, but they spend the majority of the film doing the last thing you want to do when there is a crazed, drug fuelled Bear lurking in the woods, shouting, and walking aimlessly about looking for the same thing the bear is.For a film with a title that sells you the instant you read it, it's a cracking bear, sorry bore and the ninety plus minutes it's on feels almost double that. It's major disappointment, because in the right hands, such as Neveldine and Taylor, is could have been something special.But it's from Elizabeth Banks, and she directed that abhorrent reboot of Charlie's Angels back in 2019, and that about says it all.Liotta, God rest his soul is fine, but he could have done this role in his sleep, and he looks bored.So all in all, it's not terrible, it does have its moments, but at times it can be close to un-Bear-able.",

And it was a glorious and somewhat bloody result having a black bear high on cocaine. It was such a ludicrous idea, but it made for a wonderful movie experience.The movie has a good cast ensemble, and with the likes of Keri Russell and Ray Liotta on the cast list, you're in good company. The movie also has some good performances from the likes of Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Isiah Whitlock Jr., O'Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich and Margo Martindale.Visually then \"Cocaine Bear\" was good. The CGI animated bear in the movie looked realistic, and it was, hands down, a blast to watch a cocaine-high bear rampaging on the screen.I was genuinely entertained by director Elizabeth Banks's 2023 movie, and it is a movie that I warmly can recommend if you want to be entertained by a movie that require you to just lean back, munch on the snack and watch the madness on the screen.\"Cocaine Bear\" is cinematic entertainment in its simplest, purest form, pardon the pun.My rating of \"Cocaine Bear\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

The first 30 minutes was actually pretty good, almost too good. The rest of the movie was fine, but probably should have been better.It went from dark to funny to downright gory. The amount of kills and type of kills were so shockingly great though, because of how the movie was set up. The dialogue, especially from the younger actors, was quite remarkable. I think the later scenarios could've been better written as it got kinda cheesy for all the prior madness. I'll have to rewatch it at home to decide if I like it as much, but it was absolutely one to love with an audience full of friends and strangers.",

            "content": "This was a movie that when I heard about it, I laughed. That wasn't a bad a thing though. It just is an absurd idea that if it wasn't handled properly could fall flat. I did go to see this on the big screen at the Gateway Film Center during its opening weekend.Synopsis: an oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converge on a Georgia forest where a huge black bear goes on a murderous rampage after unintentionally ingesting cocaine.We start this in an airplane. There is a guy who is tossing out bags of cocaine. His plan is to jump out with a parachute. There is a hiccup though. He is knocked out and falls out of the plane to his death. This alerts the police to what he was doing as they find one of the bags strapped to him.The rest of the bags fall in a national park in Georgia. Living in this town is a nurse, Sari (Keri Russell). She has a daughter, Dee Dee (Brooklynn Prince). They have an odd relationship that works. Sari is seeing a doctor and she wants Dee Dee to go away with them for the weekend. This upsets her as they already had plans. Dee Dee then skips school and goes off to the park with Henry (Christian Convery). Their plan is to paint the walls of a waterfall.From the Tennessee city where the drug mule is found is a detective by the name of Bob (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). He is assigned the case and he's going to Georgia to see if he can find the rest. He leaves his dog with Officer Reba (Ayoola Smart).There is the then the guy who is importing the drugs. Syd (Ray Liotta) sends Daveed (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to collect his son, Eddie (Alden Ehrenreich). He is depressed due to his girlfriend passing away from cancer. He can't even take care of his child who is living with Syd now, even though he doesn't care about the boy. We see that Daveed and Eddie used to be friends, but have grown apart due to Syd.Shifting then back to the national park, there is Ranger Liz (Margo Martindale). She is getting herself pretty for Peter (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) who is coming to check out the park and the animals. There is also a group of hoodlums that are attacking visitors there that Liz deals with. It annoys her since it is interfering with her life.I haven't even brought up the titular character. There is a black bear, who are normally harmless, living in the national park. That is until it gets into packages of cocaine. It makes this one amped up and angry. It attacks these characters I've laid out as they get trapped in its habitat. Sari won't stop until she finds her daughter, where Syd demands his guys bring back all the drugs that they can find.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is bringing back up that this movie is wild. It also knows that and leans into it. This movie is fun. It plays a lot of things for laughs and that works for me. What I think works well here is that the comedy comes from the absurdity. The characters are playing things straight, but there is also good comedic timing. I'm not normally a comedy/horror fan, but I think this gets it right.Now that I'm played my hand, let me break down a bit more why this works. I've heard that this is based on a true story. What I've gathered is that there was a cocaine dump in a national park and a bear got into it. I don't think it got as amped up like this shows. From the bit I read, the bear died of an overdose. The characters in the movie aren't sure what will happen. There is a funny scene where Bob says that. This knows that this is an outrageous idea that has facts behind it.Where I then want to go would be the comedy. It can be hit or miss with me in horror movies. There is a tough blend where sometimes it can go too much in either way. This one had me cracking up with things that happened on the screen and then a character would say something that worked as well. I liked that it came from multiple directions. There is also good horror though. I'll shift over to the effects here. This goes brutal with the deaths. The blood and gore is CGI, but they do well in hiding it. The cinematography helps to hide it too. That is strategic. I should also say that the bear is all CGI, but to be honest, they had to. I don't have issues with how it looked either.I did want to go back to the story for one last thing. How we get all these characters into the park felt natural. We have the Liz and Peter there for work. Dee Dee is upset so she gets her friend to come with her. Sari is going after her. Eddie and Daveed are forced by Syd and then you have Bob also looking for the drugs. I believed it without question.Next will be the acting. Russell is good as our lead. I like her as a single mother doing what she can to provide for her daughter while also trying to live her life. Ehrenreich is good. I like that he's sad in the beginning and this ordeal changes him. Him and Jackson play well of each other. It is sad to see one of the last roles for Liotta. He's good as this drug kingpin. Whitlock and Convery bring comedy to their roles that I liked. Prince, Martindale, Ferguson, Kristofer Hivju, Smart and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed. All the performances know what they need to do and it works.In conclusion, this is another movie to come out this year that is a lot of fun. It knows what it is doing and has fun with it. We get an absurd concept that is oddly grounded. There is a good blend of comedy and horror. The effects are solid, including the CGI. This is just a well-made movie overall from the cinematography to the soundtrack. Don't take this too seriously, just shut off your brain and go with this animal attack film.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",

The film, directed by Elizabeth Banks and starring Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Margo Martindale and Ray Liotta (in his last role), follows the bear's rampage as it terrorizes a small town in Georgia.The film is a fun and absurd B-movie that does not take itself too seriously. It balances horror and humor with some gory scenes and witty dialogue. The cast is great, especially Martindale as the sheriff who tries to stop the bear and Liotta as the drug lord who wants his stash back. The bear itself is impressive, thanks to motion capture and CGI effects.The film is not perfect though. It has some pacing issues and some jokes fall flat. It also does not explore much of the social commentary or satire that could have been derived from its premise. It could have been more daring and outrageous in its tone and style.Overall though, Cocaine Bear is an entertaining and ridiculous film that delivers what it promises: a cocaine-fueled bear on a killing spree.

I need to microwave my head to burn away the memory of ever having watched this. I was REALLY disappointed. 90% of the acting/writing was terrible. The \"violence\" was there, but even though people had their arms torn off or their legs, or their guts, or fingers, or heads, there was very little actual blood just a gash or a stump which made all those scenes seem not only unrealistic, but also rendered them devoid of any shock or gross factor as well. Honestly, I've seen better Troma films. And the two main kids were also crappy actors, especially the \"boy\". I guess having kids swear automatically makes for a hilarious cinematic experience. NOTE TO CASTING DIRECTORS: THERE ARE REALLY GOOD CHILD ACTORS OUT THERE! The scenes of the bear were the only decent scenes in the entire film.

            "content": "\"Don't worry. Bears can't climb trees.\" Henry (Christian Convery)\n\"Of course they can!\" Peter (Jessie Tyler Ferguson)Each year at this time, I am furiously trying to predict the Oscar winners for 2022 at the 2023 ceremony. Although this year the top contenders are so close in quality, I'm having difficulty guessing the winners. Not hard at all is my conclusion that Cocaine Bear is the worst movie since the last Oscars. Based on a mid-80's real tale from Tennessee, the splatter comedy is almost as incoherent as it is absurd.Some will defend it as a satire of the'80's drug-scare scene, and to an extent they're right. Based on the true event of a pilot's throwing out of his plane cakes of cocaine, Cocaine Bear should have jettisoned its script as well.The quote above exemplifies the wittiest moments of an otherwise sophomoric exchange, whose humor relies on the unhumorous universal knowledge that bears do climb, and fast. Even Tom Brokaw's newscast about the duffel full of coke-cakes seems irrelevant. Ray Liotta's final turn as a Missouri drug dealer is a shame of meaningless banter.As various semi-colorful characters like mothers, cops, and wardens try to capture a mama bear berserk from ingesting that abandoned blow, various episodes with the bear are macabre aggressions like dragging someone by the face from the back of an ambulance to dragging hikers into the bushes to have bear's appetite for cocaine satisfied by licking the dust from the bodies. Fingers get blown off and intestines eaten, all in the name of comedy.The bear cubs, liberally caked in \"booger sugar,\" are just a little less outrageous than the two kids (Brooklynn Prince and Christian Convery) ingesting heaps of Erythroxylon Coca while dropping f-bombs like the cakes from the sky. All this absurdity is from director Elizabeth Banks, whose previous Pitch Perfect 2 and Charlies Angels didn't bode well either for comedy.Looking beyond the silliness, we can guess at the allegorical underpinnings of '80's cocaine warnings and the importance of family, be it human or, as in the case of the bear, animal. As the film emphasizes the vacuity of the players and allows underage kids to drop f-bombs, the comedy/horror provides for hard-core horror fans some gruesome shots of mutilated bodies and not-so-scary setups, none of which should qualify this film for even a measure of the genre's respect.Cocaine Bear is a cautionary tale about excessive drug use and encouragement for loyalty and devotion to friends and relatives. Other than that, even 80 for Brady looks good.",

But that's another rant for another time, anyway, this film wasn't bad after viewing, but the trailers weren't being shy when it came to showing a lot of the film off.As you'd expect from the title, it's more or less self explanatory. A 500-pound black bear wolfs down a staggering amount of Cocaine & embarks on a drug-fueled rampage killing anyone in its path. With a gathering of Police Officers, Criminals, Tourists, & Teenagers the bear finds itself running into these people in the Georgia Forest.I found the film to be ok. It wasn't amazing by any means & isn't worth a Home Media purchase never mind a re-watch, but it's alright enough. There's some gruesome deaths here, along with some humourous parts which I myself did laugh at.There isn't a plot or a story to follow & I did feel that the film dragged a bit & was long given it's slightly plotless yet simple premise. It's 1 hour & 30 minutes (90 minutes) without credits, so, you can see what I mean. A good 10 minutes could've been shaved away.The actors aren't anything special & are pretty much there to either be killed off, or to just pass the film by. There's also too many talking scenes & little of the action. I mean, there's some deaths to be had & some gruesomeness, but not enough & I felt they shied away too much could've shown more in terms of the graphic nature.The film I feel did have a bit of a hard time in deciding what it wanted to be, it was comedy like in some areas & serious in others, so it was hard to know what type of a film this was. Also, there were some slight little modern day nudges here & there which sort of showed this was Elizabeth's film... I suppose I couldn't have expected complete perfect, but still... I was expecting it to be a bit more full on so I guess it's borderline forgivable... The ending itself was anticlimactic to say the least.Overall, it's not anything special. It's gory, funny in areas as well as graphic in areas & action pact to be certain point, but, it simply doesn't cut it. While this is better than Elizabeth's last effort, it still wasn't quite as good as it could've been & with the little obscure, but obvious snipes. The film drags with very little of a plot & seems to get pretty much nowhere to a disappointing yet anticlimactic ending.4/10.",

            "content": "From the film's title, you can probably guess that this is a one-joke movie, a premise borne out in the trailer and in the picture itself. But, frankly, who cares? This delightfully campy dark comedy arguably has a few pacing and editing issues, as well as some bits that fall a little flat, but it's generally a filling smorgasbord of over-the-top, goofy, gory fun. Director Elizabeth Banks's third feature outing definitely won't appeal to everyone because of its rampant silliness and its gratuitous shock value that's more than a fitting homage to the cheesy, tacky 1980s slasher movies reminiscent of the time frame in which this fact-based true story is based. In essence, the premise is a simple one: a plane carrying an enormous stash of the powdery white substance crashes in the Chattahoochee National Forest, depositing its cargo within reach of a CGI-generated black bear who immediately becomes hooked on this find and embarks on an out-of-control murderous rampage, taking down an array of characters who have varying connections to the locale, the payload or other related considerations. And, yes, for what it's worth, this soon becomes a one-note narrative, but the note is played differently every time it's struck, with funny little twists and ever-more grisly (but creatively hilarious) imagery thrown in for good measure, the kind of laughs typical of cult classics and the fare of midnight shows. This offering also features fine performances by the likes of Margot Martindale, Christian Convery and the late Ray Liotta in his final screen portrayal, all of whom were good sports in recognizing the high-camp factor of this material. Look, let's face it, drugs are often an inherently funny source of gut-busting humor (more so here literally than in many other cinematic vehicles), so just go with it on that level rather than trying to assess it otherwise - and running the risk of succumbing to the logic contained in the screeds of tiresome, droll, stick-in-the-mud naysayers (as many allegedly esteemed critics have already written about in their dour, dull, joyless, overly somber evaluations).

Dorothy Gale from Kansas may have been worried about 'Lions and Tigers and Bears\", but even with a wicked witch and flying monkeys chasing her, she never faced anything as fierce Cocaine Bear! The story is inspired by true events in 1985 when a plane load of cocaine was inadvertently dropped over a national forest in Georgia. Screenwriter Jimmy Warden takes that premise and imagines what would happen if a ferocious bear had ingested mass quantities of the drug and then rampaged while on the ensuing high. Elizabeth Banks, known mostly for her acting (THE HUNGER GAMES), adds this to her growing list of directorial outings (CHARLIE'S ANGELS, PITCH PERFECT 2), and her latest is sure to find a place a cinematic lore.The film opens with a reenactment of the plane and parachute mishap that caused the drugs to dump into the forest. A crazed Matthew Rhys (\"The Americans\") bonks his head on the skydiving exit, setting the stage for our bear to discover the scattered drug bricks. Of course, as we know from so many movies, TV shows, and national news reports, when a drug delivery goes sideways, bears aren't the only ones on the hunt. A local drug dealer played by Ray Liotta sends his son (Alden Ehrenreich, SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY, 2018) and henchman (O'Shea Jackson, son of Ice Cube) to retrieve the misplaced shipment ... all while a detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr) is on their trail.Looking-for-love Park Ranger Liz (the always great Margot Martindale) envisions a romantic hike with the Park inspector she fancies (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), but her plans are spoiled when a frantic mom (Keri Russell, \"The Americans\") shows up looking for her missing daughter Dee Dee (Brooklynn Prince, THE FLORIDA PROJECT, 2017) and her child's friend Henry (Christian Convery, \"Sweet Tooth\"), who skipped school to explore the park. While all this is occurring, there is also a band of thugs wreaking havoc on park visitors, one of which (Aaron Holliday) gets looped in with the drug dealers. Once EMS workers (Scott Seiss and Kahyun Kim) show up, peak bear intensity is reached.Now all of this may sound somewhat normal for a movie set up, but nothing prepares you for a rampaging bear desperately seeking that next hit of cocaine. I don't have the words to express just how 'off the rails' this thing goes (in a riotous and fun way). What I can tell you is that it's the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and certainly the most effective movie I've ever watched featuring a drug-fueled apex predator. I saw this in a crowded theater and the shared laughter and audience-reactions definitely added to the entertainment experience. Key elements have been omitted here because this is one of the wildest rides I've ever had in a movie theater ... and my hope is that many other fun-seekers will agree. Not only is there humor, adventure, action, and violence, but there are also some brilliant 'little touches' that elevate the story (a cute dog, a double-cross, a broken heart, etc).For almost fifty years, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (1975) has ruled the Midnight Movie circuit. There have been a few contenders along the way (THE ROOM, THE WARRIORS, EVIL DEAD), but this Elizabeth Banks movie may finally be the one that reignites the late night movie crowd with this raucous, thrilling trip as a coked-up bear (a bear that looks fantastic) runs amok through a national forest, desperate for the next hit. On a side note, this was the final film for Ray Liotta before he passed away in 2022. With a legacy of memorable characters in SOMETHING WILD, GOODFELLAS, and FIELD OF DREAMS, Liotta's final scene is quite a gut punch. COCAINE BEAR is a \"hard R-rating\" and not advisable for the 7- and 8-year-old kids brought along by their parents at the screening I attended.Opens in theaters on February 23, 2023.",

            "content": "The film generated a lot of interest on social media due to the crazy nature of the concept which gives flashbacks to Snakes On A Plane released in 2006 for those who remember it. Unlike Snakes On a Plane, Cocaine Bear manages to deliver the goods on its bonkers concept.Right from the opening sequence we are introduced to the sharp and cruel sense of humor of the filmmakers as a pilot unloads a shipment of cocaine which leads to a farcical misadventure. Cocaine Bear knows exactly what type of movie it is: an hilarious and gory slasher where the main star is a coked up bear. Just like its titular drug, it starts very high and runs out a bit of steam by the end but it was utterly glorious and satisfying to witness the carnage of the lead star. One of the film's strongest qualities is its ability not to take itself seriously.Director Elizabeth Banks knows how to introduce a cast of entertaining, cartoonish characters that will serve as a main course for Cocaine Bear who's completely out of control. Everyone adds their two cents and contributes to the success of the many gags.Cocaine Bear finds many ways to surpass expectations and entertain even if the movie can't hide all of its flaws. In terms of editing, the challenge was to follow different separate characters in several places while keeping a certain momentum and this is not always mission accomplished for Elizabeth Banks. That being said, the strength of the film is when you see the same character in several places at the same time because he was dismembered by Cocaine Bear and the good news is that the gore does not disappoint even if the horror elements are slightly neglected.The music by Mark Mothersbaugh also add to the 1980s vibe with energetic synthesizers, no surprise coming from Devo's keyboard player who's a wise choice as the composer for the film. All in all, it's an experience one can enjoy with a cheering midnight crowd and director Elizabeth Banks understands what people want from a movie called Cocaine Bear, something Snakes On A Plane didn't have. Including in 2006. Victory goes to the bear with the help of a little cocaine.7.5/10.",

Not even close.If you watched the trailer, that is 100% the most fun this movie will ever be. Top marks to whomever put that trailer together, because you managed to do what director Elizabeth Banks couldn't do... make this movie funny.As for the rest of it... dull characters with no personality but somehow dialled up to eleven on the overacting meter. No great sense of anything like pacing. Questionable editing. No real laughs. Some gore. Somewhat over the top CGI bear.It tries to be an 80's movie and to some extent it succeeds... but only in being one of those awful straight-to-video movies that you some times came across in video stores back then. You know the sort. The kind that the previous viewer hadn't bothered to rewind because they got thirty minutes in and someone said \"This is crap!

While jumping out of the plane, he smacks his head and immediately crash lands into somebody's driveway. What happened to all the bags of cocaine? Well, a bear got them.And this is where the fun starts.The ultra violent and hilarious look at what could have happen (we know that the bear in real life died in a few hours, and likely didn't kill anyone), makes this movie a great date night, or if you just want to get away from life for a few hours.The jokes are all deadpan, very reminiscent of the \"Knocked Up\" and \"Superbad\" era from the mid 2000's, and they work oh so well.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie with a crowded theater, or, with your friends.

Pitch Perfect in its attack on American war heroes, black bears, park rangers, law enforcement, paramedics, backpackers and virtually all the other things that make America great. In COCAINE BEAR, the title critter ingests what film critics state is 18 pounds of a white powdery drug, emerging none the worse for its descent into dope addiction. Its collateral damage includes at least ten people ripped to shreds, with two others shot dead as a result of the bear's bad trip. In Reality, the bear ate three grams (or a quarter snort) of coke, died before being observed by anyone and got stuffed for display at a Kentucky strip mall. U. S. Army 82nd Airborne Division war hero Andy Thornton, Jr., is depicted here as a bumbling loser, rather than a tragic figure who perished on September 11--one of 18 parachutists doomed in their efforts to get to the bottom of the plot. Seldom has a crank sang so off-key in suggesting that park rangers cannot shoot straight, paramedics are more likely to kill patients than not, backpackers are accidents waiting to happen and cops are either in cahoots with criminals, or totally brainless.",

The title itself had me thinking back to Snakes on a Plane for some reason. This movie is based on a true story about a drug dealer dumping millions of dollars of cocaine over a forest in Georgia in 1985-he accidentally fell to his death in the front yard of a neighborhood-and a bear ingested some of the cocaine, but in real life, the bear died from the drugs with only one fatality being the pilot who dumped the drugs. The movie veers off from the facts and has the bear going on a coke fueled rampage, eating more drugs and killing people-which is mostly gory but very funny at times. Ray plays the drug lord wanting his drugs back and sending Alden-his son-and O'Shea to find them. Keri plays a mother looking for her daughter and her friend that go missing in the forest. Everyone is looking for something or someone-drugs, kids, etc.-while people are dying all around, some by the bear and some by other hilarious situations. After the end credits start, there are 2 scenes showing what happened to some of the survivors.It's rated R for bloody violence and gore, drug content and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.I really liked this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",

            "content": "Cocaine Bear (2023) is a movie that I caught in theatres this evening. The storyline follows cocaine that was thrown out of a plane and into a park in the 80s in Knoxville, Tennesse. The man who jumps out of the plane dies during his fall. The next day the park is filled with children skipping school, parents looking for them, park rangers, drug lord stooges looking for the drugs and a bear high on cocaine looking for blood.This movie is directed by Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2) and stars Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Straight Outta Compton), Keri Russell (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) and Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story).This movie does a perfect job of not taking itself seriously and mixing in a nice blend of comedy and gore. It actually reminded me of Slither that way. The CGI in this worked, the soundtrack is outstanding, and the random body parts, corpses and gore is horror gold. Every scene with a gun is a 10/10 and the ambulance sequence alone is worth the price of admission. There's also some worthwhile jump scares and the final kill was a perfect way to conclude the movie.Overall, this is an original and fun addition to the horror genre.

It wanted to make me feel like something grandiose or well deserved was happening but without the proper setup, I just felt annoyed that the music was too loud. The CGI was gawd awful. I guess maybe it was supposed to be part of the camp but it was basically a cartoon bear making unbelievable wounds. They really missed an opportunity. The movie is set in 1985. Make the movie with practical effects that were available in 1985.

            "content": "Cocaine bear was the greatest movie of all time. From the exhilarating start with the death of the hippie couple, the movie never slowed down. It kicks off with the introduction of the characters, which each of them is deeply woven into this conflict in the most ironic and comedic way possible. Each side of the plot, the cocaine bear, by which this glorious piece of film is named after, the children, the mother, the park ranger, the drug dealers, and the police, have their own unique goals by which dictates their characterization. The plot slowly rises until the beautiful scene at the gazebo, where all the plot-lines crash together, the dramatic irony is relieved, and the characters are forced to reconcile their differences and revel in their common goal, avoiding the cocaine bear. However, this scene is only the second best of all time. The best scene of all time comes at the cave, where the mother and the children resolve their problems, however, with the resolution of problems comes the introduction of new ones. The people with the drug cartel come to retrieve their cocaine, and are stopped when the baby cocaine bears leave them felted. Soon, they realize their blunder. Mama bear is there for her children. The younger people within the group of drug dealers say to leave, yet the stalwart old man tries to hold onto the system. The way things are done. Caring only about the cocaine (representing the material things within this world) and not the children and her mother (representing love and care of others), the young, the mother, and the children jump out of an opening in the cave, and leave the old man in his pursuit of material things. Yet the old man persists, and the cocaine bear, representing the wrath of God, destroys him for his materialism and selfishness. And those who are righteous escape and all live. So overall, this movie juxtaposes between the idea that people are predisposed to the goals of their own group, and the idea that men can ascend beyond their dispositions and become righteous. Eventually, the righteousness win, and those responsible for the perpetuation of evil are destroyed. This beautiful resolution of the film cements it as the greatest movie of all time, woven with tragedy, comedy, and drama. Cocaine bear is the greatest movie of all time. Better than Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and any silly and futile film you might name. As ultimately, man's escape from his own foreordained state of mind will result in ascension, and all that watch this film will have their jaws dropping in awe as they come to this earth shattering and glorious conclusion.",

The multiple storylines are jumbled (not that it really matters), and there are too many characters to flesh out within such an unstructured narrative, but Banks knows exactly what type of movie she's trying to make and walks an effective tightrope between the hideous and the humorous without going into full-on camp. It's also nice to see the late Ray Liotta (doing kind of a dark twist on Henry Hill) in one of his final film roles before his untimely passing.

Flourishes, even.I'm not sure if it's an allegory on overcoming juvenile excesses in the wilderness of the American Dream or just a movie that has a coked-out bear rampaging through a rapidly-moving ambulance... but of all the movies I've seen, it is definitely the most recent.",

It's not as funny as it should be, not as crazy as it should be, and even gets boring, seeming too long when even though it's short.Good gory scenes and nice creature design. That's it.",

            "content": "She takes light and breezily entertaining properties, like Pitch Perfect and Charlies Angels and somehow makes the whole thing unbearably hacky. I figured how could you ruin this concept about a bear rampaging on cocaine? Well, I found out. You hire Elizabeth Banks to direct it. She does inject some of the goofy self awareness present in the Wet Hot American Summer properties however, it's a partial lift and not exactly appropriate for this material overall. The writer churned out a quality script for this genre trying to make it as consistently entertaining page to page as possible.The movie feels rote from the beggining music cue and the dancing idiot who dies accidentally hitting his head on a bar then falling to his death setting up the events of the story. The whole sequence is mismanaged and cheap. Pretty much what most of the movie feels like. It made me wonder why they couldn't get David Wain or Jake Kasdan to make this so much better. If you're looking for a female director to add to that list I imagine just about any female director who isn't primarily an actress could servicably direct this movie much better than it is.Hannah Hoekstra is a able comedienne? Who knew? I certainly didn't after her sexually gritty navel gazing coming of age performance in Hemel. She is delightfully dumb in the short amount of film she performs in this movie. That is the apex and the rest is traces of inspiration. Everyone else feels wasted by being in this movie. The bear effects are good and provide the other star for my review.I hope Banks never gets another directing gig. If she does I would never intentionally watch it knowing she directed it. What I'm saying may seem harsh however, this is her third feature and if anything it's the easiest to do well because of the script being so good and able to be accomplished on a small budget, etc. I was aware every moment of this movie how she was dropping the ball and how it could've been much better, a classic even. Maybe she has a future as a non-creative producer. Who knows.",

            "content": "Remember that movie with Nicolas Cage about Nicolas Cage being Nicolas Cage that was released a year ago? Remember how that movie was supposed to indulge us in the zanier side of his personality and sold us on a movie that seemed to be balls to wall insanity like Deadpool was a few years ago? Well, Cocaine Bear IS the movie that Nicolas Cage movie should've beeen AND more!Just by the title alone, you're already thinking about flat out outrageous the whole concept is going to be and you'd be right! Yes, this is actually BASED on an actual event that happened where some drug runners discarded several pounds of cocaine out of a small prop plane as it was crashing and a bear did find the cocaine and got high as a kite.... But that seems to be about where the similarities end, at least I believe that to be the case!This movie takes off from that premise and just goes for the gusto and tells the most outlandish and craziest story you could tell, given that premise and boy am I glad that they did! It was very smart of the filmmakers to go all out and then some because that is really what anybody would expect with the words Cocaine & Bear in the title. Does that not make you imagine the craziest crap out there? When I found out that Lord & Miller of 21/22 Jump Street fame were producers, I knew this would be a good time. They know how to take an already crazy premise and dial it up 2-3 more notches but make it entertaining.So basically the various story threads involve a couple of kids ditching school to hike up to a waterfall in a forest reserve, a drug dealer/runner in search of drugs he has promised to deliver, some idiot delinquents, law enforcement & a park ranger in desperate need of love.... Is that enough craziness for ya? If it sounds like a lot of story threads that is because it is, but they help move things along and give a reason for all of the events to occur.The movie is definitely a dark comedy but with a light-ish tone to it, nothing gets too dark or deep and depressing which is good and prevents the movie from getting bogged down. There is quite a bit of gore and light horror elements to it but things lean more in the lighthearted direction more than anything else. The bear is obviously CGI but is done in a way that comes off believable and looks realistic enough without being too uncanny valley. And of course it's most likely due to the VFX masters: Weta FX!Props must also go to Elizabeth Banks who turned things around after the disastrous Charlie's Angels reboot which she also dug her own grave when promoting it. It seems like she has learned to not toot her own horn too much & tell the audience how much they should appreciate what she is putting out there. There is no doubt that she has talent as witnessed here and a few of her other past efforts in directing but for sure this is a standout as many of the cast are not big names aside from the late Ray Liotta, Kerry Russell & O'shea Jackson Jr. Who is on the come up! It helps that the material sells itself but even then, I believe that it takes the right director to ensure that things don't go sideways as it can sometimes be easy to botch what should be a slam dunk.All that being said, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie if you want several good belly laughs and have a sense of humor that isn't easily offended. It's not the most offensive thing out there but it's definitely not for anyone that thinks things need to be a certain way or certain subjects should be avoided, so if you're easily offended or don't like tasteless humor this isn't for you. Lastly, there are a few mid credits stingers so don't forget to stay for those as they make for a fun way to wrap up the various storylines presented!",

            "content": "LIKES:The Pace\n-It's not slow at ll, a movie meant to be like an extended web episode and keep your attention throughout the run time.-Cocaine bear hits the throttle pretty fast and carries that high octane comedy/horror rush that should easily appeal more attention spans.-Surprisingly some balanced down time to help add some depth to the movie, but not enough to get lost in plot development other movies do.-All of this was practically expected.The Acting For This Movie\n-It's a movie that is set to not take itself seriously, so the acting and characters are going to match this tone.-And again, they work very well to essentially do just that and make these figures who are follies of the human nature, especially modern human nature.-Russell is the elegant one in this, feisty, blunt, and straight up honest, her humor is dryer, but yet works given the aggressive nature of the rest of the group.-Ehrenreich is probably my favorite, part aggressive comedy and part serious level, he's a great medium for characters. You get the most out of him compared to the rest and an attempt at something to root for in the movie without a one liner needed\n-And Jackson, is pretty good in this role with his aggressive style of acting and often same demeanor, but it works well in the movie. He's got one liners, extreme characteristics, well timed jokes, and a little style that works super well in this crazy film.-Everyone else outside of maybe two characters are a farce though, and though stupid, fit the theme, add those quirky moments, and show how stupid can be fun and enjoyable when somehow balanced.The Comedy\n-Probably the meat of the movie, Cocaine Bear is all about laughs and just being in your face with the humor.-Slapstick is much darker in this one and it works when you have a drug addicted bear slapping things around with force.-The language is strong, but sometimes, it hits that perfect punch that made me laugh, as the word was quite perfect, or some other phrase that summed things up.-And then comes the dark humor that sometimes nails it and adds to the comedy mentioned above. It's smart writing and planning, but yet simplistic in how it works and I had fun with this part of the comedy if I'm being honest. Perfect job when it comes to this type of movie.-And yes, seeing a bear act like a human and getting addicted to drugs is stupid, but again, balanced, fun, and used as an accessory vs. Just being a TikTok video of a bear acting stupid and babbling. This was very much appreciated.The Ending Wraps Things Up Nicely\n-You would think a story like this would have little well, story, and you would be right.-However, the movie did surprise by having some engaging elements in it, with characters, compassion, and some relatable tales that help expand the idioits to something more.-When the story finishes, just about everything is wrapped up with a great wrap up that somehow is a bright light despite the chaos of this movie. How Banks and her crew pulled this together? I don't know, but despite how stupid this whole thing is... the story just works so well and doesn't go too far.-Very nice.Some Character Development\n-I just said above, but there are characters, including the bear, that sort of evolve past the typical plot points they are.-Some of them are superficial as hell and that's it, but others have a bit more finesse to them, that works its way out by the end of this adventure.-Even the bear I felt a lot for and found the great emotional attachment as more was revealed, plus I really like animals so.-But when adding these hints of something deeper, it helps weather and anchor you into the craziness and enjoy the hell out of the story.The Bear Animation Is Great And Entertaining\n-How do you bring an animal to life on drugs and not make them part of the Shrek Universe?-This studio knew how to do it and it's again this balance of silly and realism that again helps really work for the tale they were telling.-There is a lot of bear movements that go for the \"realism\" and horror aspect, adding that thriller element that reminds us they want an animal.-But the curve balls get thrown and the human element comes in that is like a stoner comedy's dream and that part is so fun in this drug like high.-As those two things work together, it keeps these odd parts working well and elevate it to a better level. Fantastic work.Overall A Fun Movie That Delivers\n-And this is the name of the game... it's fun.-If you go in with that level and can push past the already doofus like concept, then you can appreciate this movie better and see this surprisingly autonomous humor that people are going to enjoy.DISLIKES:Predictable\n-It's a movie with a plot that doesn't have the most potential to be awesome and with a twist.'I felt very Syfy network story, simple, to the point, and all about these thrills of dark survival movies that you either love or hate.-As such, it gives you what you might want, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily the most original or mind blowing story.The Language Writing Lazy At Times\n-Sometimes that cursing is gold and a cherry on top for the word.-And other times it's a filler that does little but bore me by the time we get to the end of the scene.-Cocaine Bear has a lot of both, but there are too many instances of these characters going ham on just cursing that the writing does anything to impress me.-There are those stupid and well-timed lines I love to help this though, and had they just mitigated this a little more, it would have been negligible to me.Violent and Menacing As Hell\n-There is violent and then there is violent and this movie is not going to be as kind.-There are some graphic finishes and though cheesy to help truncate the edge, it's still graphic and so please exercise caution when taking younger audiences to it.-It's going to immerse you in some disgusting stuff, and if you have the dark enjoyment, you will enjoy it and love it, but for me, this viscousness does little at times without feeling that dark side.The CGI Has Fake Looking Moments\n-Technology makes things that are looking incredible, so I can't say that I'm not going to be a tad picky.-This thing is looking good on many levels, but there is still that artificial look that can be ironed out and could have looked very good if they invested the time.-And fortunately the antics help make this animation work, but you have to point that out in my line of work.TikTok Like Antics Don't Work For Me\n-I'm not the biggest fan of TikTok and this movie had a lot of TikTok in it for various reasons.-The in your face banter, the forced silliness, and the overacting just aren't my cup of tea and this movie sometimes rolls in it like a dog enjoying rolling in something.-And a few times it does work, but others... well again it's not my cup of tea and goes a tad too much that it just takes away from the other amazing things this movie was doing.-But this won't be a problem if you are again a fan of this humor.THE VERDICTI guess this will not be a surprise, but Cocaine Bear is just as ridiculous as the title of the movie suggests. It's a very extravagant set of events, that really matches the vibe of the SciFi networks original movies with a stone comedy and somehow, makes it really work. It's very aggressive in comedic styles, and it doesn't pull many punches, but the variety, the subtle nods and adjustments, and this odd balancing act help take this concept and make it entertaining. Don't expect many layers, but there is a little dollop of development that helps even things and that might be the brilliance of this film. Now, this movie is certainly not a ten for me though. It is ridiculously dumb, and takes that in your face approach a little too far for me alongside the writing that is both brilliant and yet limited. The violence does work, but the gore with it only goes far and I would encourage that you use caution. But outside of that, the movie is what you thought it would be and that actually I quite enjoyable when I got the surprises I did. Thus, looking for that talked about movie in theaters that you can quote for hours, then this movie should do it for you and is worth a shot in the theater. My scores are:Comedy/Thriller: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",

You go into this expecting a fun, standard B-film; You figure most of the film will be \"acceptable\" with at least a few scenes that are really funny or thrilling or entertaining etc. Instead, most of the film totally sucks with just a few \"acceptable\" scenes. A plot this simple relies on characterization and style, both of which are completely lacking from this movie. You don't care if any of the characters live or die; you don't even care that they are on the screen. Keri Russell and O'Shea Jackson Jr do a decent job because they actually have screen presence but they're stuck working with subpar material. None of the characters in the film have any development or real identities. No fun stereotypes, no complex characters, no growth, nothing. The death scenes are lackluster, bordering on boring. The film is not edited like an 80s movie nor is it edited like the theme is cocaine or a wild animal on cocaine. The film is sluggish and the music and score stink. Yes, the CGI is well-done but completely underused. A decent writer could've improved this tenfold within an hour; a good writer could've made this unforgettable within a day. It seems like absolutely no work ethic went into any part of this film; Like every bigwig figured this would write itself (which it should have) but no one checked the progress before it hit theaters. End result: A VERY disappointed audience. Seeing it in theaters, I noticed almost no one laughed the whole time, some people fell asleep and others couldn't wait for the movie to end before leaving. No one had a problem \"missing\" any scenes to leave the room for snacks or bathroom breaks.My recommendation: Do not pay to see this. You will want your money back.",

From a pathetic CGI bear to the over-the-top scenarios that miss the mark because the story feels like it was made by committee of effects artists wanting to showcase their skill rather than fulfil key tenants of a good film, namely memorable and likeable protagonists and a story that made you at least have an interest in the welfare of those characters.

            "content": "Every once and awhile a movie comes out that you just have to see as the previews and the title is catchy. As with this one \"Cocaine Bear\" actually based on a true story I just had to see it and it was a hard to believe yet fun journey. Set in the south in the mid 80's(the clothing, music, and cars really reflected the times well) after a drug drop goes wrong from the air, we see that drug packages have fallen in Tennessee, only the white powder has a connection to a Georgia national forest. Soon the journey begins and the movie wraps around characters of criminals, cops, tourists, teens, and yet however the main wild card is a bear! And this bear has become the best friend of cocaine now that's a bear on drugs for you! The scene where the bear jumps and chases the ambulance thru the air is a wild joy to watch. Directed by Elizabeth Banks the movie has an all star cast that makes it work with Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, Isiah Whitlock, and finally the great late Ray Liotta(in what would be his last picture). Overall the movie is nothing great still it's an entertaining watch of seeing a bear be the big bad guy much harsher than \"Little Red Riding Hood\" or \"The Three Little Pigs\".",

            "content": "It knows exactly what it is and it relishes every second of it. And you know it too.If you are looking for a horror/comedy R-rated bonkers movie of, well, what would happen if an apex predator did a lot, and I mean, a lot of cocaine? This movie is for you. Imagine if you will, a monster disaster movie. But instead of being dragged down by human subplots or \"protect nature\" messages, it went full on crazy bear mauling hijinks with it. The gore is amped to the max, next with horror build ups and decently set up jump scares.In a more critical perspective, the film was very competently made for what could very well be a B-movie monster madness creatuee attack on the likes of Sharknado or Anaconda. And the biggest surprise for me was the humor. Great comedic timing and dark humor that makes perfect use of its R-rating. After seeing the premise and thesis of this movie when it was announced, it was bound to the limitations and expectations these set. Yet it exceeded mine in simply one aspect: how freaking bonkers it went. I mean. I'm talking not tamed at all. I thought it would be somehow tamed or be pandering given todays era of delicate comedic sensibilities, but it doesn't preach any messages nor has an agenda. With now that I realise, it's a very sad thing to be so concerned about.... for a horror comedy... about a bear... who did cocaine. Just saying it out loud it just sounds like an 80s or 90s spoof movie. And the premise enhanced by the mere fact that it is actually based on true events to some extent. It's the perfect example of how to satirize a concept and amp it to its full potential. All improved by the backdrop, the 80s, with the techonological limitations, the synthesized music and the over the top outfits, it becomes a sight to behold. I have no issues what so ever with anything in this movie. Granted it isn't cinema really, like, it's not a contender for any Academy Awards but it doesn't try to be anything it isn't.I really hope this becomes a franchise because it could very well be. Between its insane premise and great editing and humor, the only thing left is a new round of funny characters and a new wacky premise.",

            "content": "I was instantly fascinated when I saw the poster for this film, I read more into it and found out it was loosely based on a true story, having seen the trailer I was looking forward to it, directed by Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2, Charlie's Angels). Basically, set in 1985, drug smuggler Andrew C. Thornton II (Matthew Rhys) drops a shipment of cocaine from his plane. He is about to parachute out with a drug-filled duffel bag, but he knocks himself unconscious on the doorframe, and he falls to his death. His body is found in Knoxville, Tennessee, he is identified by local detective Bob (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). Bob leaves to head for Georgia to retrieve the lost drugs and asks his Officer Reba (Ayoola Smart) to look after his beloved dog. Meanwhile, in the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, an American black bear has found and eaten bags of the cocaine, becoming highly aggressive, and attacking two hikers, Elsa (Hannah Hoekstra) and Olaf (Kristofer Hivju). In northeast Georgia, young girl Dee Dee (Brooklynn Prince) skips school with her best friend Henry (Christian Convery) to go and paint a picture of the falls in the forest. On the trail to the falls, the pair finds a lost brick of cocaine, and ingest some. Shortly after, the bear appears and attacks them. Dee Dee's mother, Sari (Keri Russell), a nurse, realises her daughter has skipped school and ventures into the forest to search for the kids. She goes to the forest station, asking park ranger Liz (Margo Martindale) and her wildlife activist partner Peter (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) for help. Meanwhile, in St. Louis, drug kingpin Syd White (Ray Liotta, his posthumous last role) sends his fixer Daveed (O'Shea Jackson Jr., son of Ice Cube) to recover the remaining cocaine. Daveed travels to Georgia with Syd's son Eddie (Alden Ehrenreich), who is depressed following the death of his wife and has abandoned his own son. In the woods, Sari, Liz and Peter find Henry up a tree, hiding from the bear. While Peter finds a pile of cocaine, the bear attacks Liz; Peter climbs the opposite tree to hide, while Liz is slashed. While Sari hides behind the tree, the bear starts climbing it to reach Henry. Soon though, is attracted to Peter covered in cocaine, it ignores Henry, rushes down, and climbs up the next tree and kills Peter. After the bear leaves, Henry climbs down, he and Sari flee deeper into the forest, while Liz sends for help. Daveed and Eddie arrive in Georgia, as does Bob. At the forest station, Daveed gets into a fight with the Duchamps gang, three troublemaking delinquents: Stache (Aaron Holliday), Vest (J. B. Moore) and Ponytail (Leo Hanna). After Daveed overcomes the gang, he questions member Stache who admits that he found a stash of drugs and has hidden it on top of a gazebo. Liz arrives back at the station, pursued by the bear. After calling for an ambulance, Liz is panicked and accidentally kills Ponytail, before the bear slaughters Vest. Paramedics Beth (Kahyun Kim) and Tom (Scott Seiss) arrive and collect Liz after a brief skirmish with the bear. They leave in the ambulance, but the bear pursues and jumps into the vehicle. In the ensuing chaos, Tom is killed by the bear, while Liz falls out of the ambulance and is crushed on the road. Beth loses control of the vehicle and crashes into a tree, causing her to fly through the windshield to her death. Sari and Henry discover that Dee Dee left them a trail of paint and use it to track her. Daveed and Eddie are taken to the gazebo but find Bob there on the roof with the stashed drugs. Bob forces Daveed and Eddie to drop their guns, there is an argument as Bob tries to get them to cooperate. When Daveed tries to pick up his gun from the ground, Bob shoots two fingers off his left hand, which Eddie asks to pick up. The bear appears and momentarily collapses on Eddie. When it eventually wakes, the bear consumes a bag of cocaine. The bear starts attacking Daveed and Eddie, but Bob distracts it with the bag of coke. While Stache runs away, Bob is suddenly fatally shot by Syd, and Daveed and Eddie flee. Syd reveals himself to them, he is under pressure by his superiors to retrieve the cocaine. In the woods, Sari and Henry find a mourning Olaf, who leads them to Dee Dee's hiding place: the bear's cave. It is revealed the bear is a mother, when its two cubs appear. Olaf leaves and is killed by the bear. Syd, Eddie, and Daveed find the cave, and follow Sari, Henry, and Dee Dee onto a a ledge behind the falls. The bear returns to the cave, Sari, Henry, and Dee Dee jump into the water below to safety, followed by Eddie and Daveed. But Syd refuses to leave a bag cocaine hanging above, he shoots and wounds the bear, but it survives, and he is disembowelled by the bear and her cubs. All the remaining survivors go their separate ways, with Stache hitchhiking to New York with a duffel bag of cocaine, while Eddie, accompanied by Daveed, reunites with his son, but Bob's dog, brought by Reba, eats Daveed's severed fingers. The bits of the story that are true are: the person throwing out the bags of cocaine, him dying after his parachute failed to open, and the bear found was dead after eating loads of cocaine in northern Georgia; the bear was stuffed and mounted, it disappeared for a little while, but is now displayed at a mall in Kentucky. All the events after the beginning of the movie are fictional, in real life the bear never encountered or killed anybody, it is essentially an invention of what would have happened if people had interacted with the bear whilst it was high on cocaine. Russell, Jackson Jr., Ehrenreich, Martindale, and Liotta are all well-cast, and the special effects to bring the bear to life are cool; I'm a little surprised it is only an 18 certificate because of the amount of cocaine and violence, but all the limbs and blood spill adds to the dark humour, it is a just a fun comedy horror.

There was plenty of kills that the bear murdered to go along with. There were a few jokes as well that I had a good time. There is also character development with each of the characters so you can remember each one. For example, the main antagonist (Ray Liotta, R. I.

I haven't laughed or clapped that hard during a movie in years. Unfortunately, shortly after this scene, the movie's pace begins to seize up a little bit and lost its footing at the halfway point. I also wish Ray Liotta had a bit more screen time to chew up the scenery for his final role.Overall, the movie is pretty average, but there are some truly spectacular moments sprinkled throughout that you can't help but laugh and clap hysterically at.

            "content": "In 1985, a North American black bear had overdosed on smuggled cocaine in the Tennessee wilderness, nicknaming it Cocaine Bear. Fast forward to 2023, actor / filmmaker Elizabeth Banks and Universal Pictures have taken it upon themselves to create a comedy horror feature film loosely inspired by the infamous events. Even before this film came out last month, it had already become a huge hit on social media just from the mere concept alone, regardless of the current polarizing critical reception. So judging the film on its own merits rather than the real life story, how did it work out in the end?Set in 1985, the plot follows multiple individuals who end up lost in the southern forest of America during the infamous cocaine bear incident. One known as police detective Bob is on the trail of alleged cocaine kingpin Syd White and his cronies Daveed and Eddie, and another is a nurse Sari whose daughter Dee Dee decides to go into the forest with her friend Henry to paint a picture of the falls. With so many different people coming in the picture, the film does admittedly suffer from some fairly uneven pacing and a bit too many people to care about in the long run. While the tension of what the bear could do can become intense from a general human point of view, it's hard to keep track of all the characters when some don't even make it out alive before the halfway point. Also, while Ray Liotta rests in peace, Syd isn't exactly as fleshed out as he could have been to make for what could have been a more fascinating look in the mind of a drug smuggling criminal who is detached from his own son Eddie, and let's just say his demise is a bit too forced for its own good.That being said, as the title suggests a big focus on Cocaine Bear, the entertainment value comes mainly from that alone. Thanks in part to the creative hardworking people at Weta FX, the amount of free range on the computer generated bear allows for a fairly expressive yet unexpectedly dangerous animal. Although a bit tamed compared to other gore fests out there, the blood and guts are played up for serious danger and laughs depending on the scene. Part of that comes from how over the top a lot of the acting is, with some being more grounded and grave compared to others not holding back in their unhinged terror of what the bear can do high on an incredibly powerful drug. The likes of Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr, Aldren Ehrenreich and Isaih Whitlock Jr. Maintain solid tropes with this kind of thriller comedy, while many more feel a bit stereotypical in their roles like Margo Martindale as a lethal park ranger, Jesse Tyler Ferguson as an overly confident wildlife activist, and newcomer Aaron Holiday as a pathetic forest delinquent.So with all of these different qualities intact, Cocaine Bear does succeed a bit more in its fluff than much of anything story wise. Cinematographer John Guleserian helps paint a smooth contrast between the more pristinely lit daytime and the haunting nighttime all through the context of whether or not the bear could strike at any given moment. The added touch of Mark Mothersbaugh's score creates a lot of genuine horror from the suspense stemming through everyone trying to avoid this unstable freak of nature. Of course, the use of 80s rock songs are to be expected, and while some are a bit more obvious than others, their usage does not take away from the already wacky concept executed even further by the insane camera tricks and technical props shown on display. At the end of the day, this is a major motion picture's answer to a dark comedy B movie, and the silliness might have benefited more from genuine stupidity rather than too many characters ending up at the scene. As a noble effort to only do so much with the outlandishness, the film could've gone further.In the end, despite a half-baked plot and too many cooks in the character department, Cocaine Bear is saved just enough by its titular character's drugged out frenzies and the solid amount of absurdity with a concept this cooky. I would recommend this on the grounds that it may only give what one is truly looking for to a certain extent, as this is a more mainstream effort compared to the likes of Troma and Rob Zombie. Perhaps this flick has the potential to be a cult classic in this coming decade, but only time will tell if it stands the test of time before fading into internet meme obscurity or not.",

Bears can't do that!\" over an increasingly annoyed theater crowd. But personally, I'm a huge fan of \"deadly beast goes on a killing spree\" films. I rent every mediocre shark attack movie when it launches straight to streaming because there's something oddly satisfying about watching arrogant, headstrong, generally unlikeable surfers or college kids on a boating trip gone awry get torn to shreds. Cocaine Bear has all of those cheap, guilty pleasures in spades, but unlike something like Sharknado, its coked-up bear is actually convincing enough to be scary when it tears apart every morally questionable person it comes across. There will be Before \"Cocaine Bear\" and After \"Cocaine Bear.\" This is how we will mark time from now on as a society. That's how transformative this motion picture is. That's because \"Cocaine Bear\" knows exactly what it is and what it needs to do. It's about a bear ... on cocaine. Comparisons to the 2006 disaster extravaganza \"Snakes on a Plane\" are inevitable, with its high-concept, wild-animal premise, as well as the giddy hype that preceded it. Both movies do precisely what their titles suggest, with a minimal desire to be more substantial or meaningful. Because \"Cocaine Bear\" does what it does so well for so long, it's a disappointment that the filmmakers break from the action to make us care about these characters as actual people. Some standout supporting players do evolve in surprising ways, including Scott Seiss as a paramedic and Aaron Holliday as one of the obnoxious teens. But while the suspense that had carried the film for the first two-thirds of its brisk running time dips as it nears its conclusion, \"Cocaine Bear\" still emerges as a hell of a high. The few times \"Cocaine Bear\" injects even a meager amount of sentimentality, the pacing starts to lag. This is not why we are here. We're here to see a bear snort a bunch of cocaine, then go on a murderous rampage in the forest. The fact that Banks' film is based on a true story is just one of its many crazy components. Screenwriter Jimmy Warden has taken the basic facts-a 175-pound Georgia black bear ingested some cocaine that a drug smuggler dropped from an airplane in 1985-and imagined what might have happened if the bear hadn't died, but rather sampled the stuff and gotten hooked. An eclectic ensemble of hikers, rangers, criminals, and police officers just happens to have the misfortune of getting in her way. For that reason and so many more, you'll probably also find yourself rooting for the bear to succeed. She's just so gleeful as she tears into brick after brick and gets a big whiff of the white stuff up her snoot. The ways in which she ingests cocaine are often quite clever, including doing a line off a leg she's just severed. And one sequence, in particular, involving the marauding bear, a fleeing ambulance, and Depeche Mode's catchy \"Just Can't Get Enough\" is a tour de force of pacing and tone. Speaking of music, Mark Mothersbaugh's score adds the perfect synth touch to these antics; similarly, the period-specific needle drops, costume, and production design are on point without being obvious parodies. The posters that adorn the teenage Prince's walls are especially inspired.",

I wouldn't say that this movie is revolutionary or any but it is certainly good enough to get lost in and have some solid laughs and watch over the top yet still funny gore. The actors in this are real and relatable the script is well written and very true to the time period that it was based on which is the 80's . I like that this movie doesn't try to be something that it is not it is kind of refreshing to see a movie that is not preachy and doesn't have a pretence it is just fun. It is a movie you can take anyone in their teens up to see and they won't be disappointed.",

The bear eats people alive rends them limb from limb, nothing hds better get in the path of it;s hunt for more cocaine. A park ranger, assorted crooks, kids playing skipping school, an anxious parent and cops all come into contact with bear with tragic, comic and tragicomic results. There' plenty of humour in this film but it's mostly of a very dark nature which reflects the many gory incidents which occur. This is the late Ray Liota's last film, he plays a gang boss who is intent on recovering the cocaine, he ends up pursuing a vendetta against the bear, like Ahab in pursuit of Moby Dick. A fun horror comedy but not for the squeamish. Directed and produced by Elizabeth Banks and written by Jimmy Warden. 8/10.",

Sure, but why not? He was so good at this type of heavily flawed Alpha male character.It's an eclectic cast with Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr. Playing another drug dealer working for \"Syd'.Star Wars' Alden Ehrenreich is \"Syd's\" messed up son with a bad tattoo.Of course large out of control furry creatures are nothing new for Star Wars fans who've lived with Wookies since the 70's.The bear itself looks so realistic...it's a combo of live costume movement and CGI and it works brilliantly!\"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey\" creators take notes.Former Mouseketeer and Golden Globe winner Keri Russell is the archetypal mother Sari.Modern Families' Jesse Tyler Ferguson is \"Peter\".Margo Martindale is the trigger happy \"Ranger Liz\", who should never have been issued a gun.Award winning Isiah Whitlock Jr. Is \"Bob\", the thin blue line tracking down the lost cocaine that was thrown by Emmy Award winning Welsh actor Matthew Rhys (Thornton) from a plane.Rhys actually worked with Russell as husband and wife in \"The Americans\".\"Cocaine Bear\" was inspired in part by a true event in 1985 when a corrupt Kentucky cop and lawyer-turned-drug smuggler, Andrew Thornton, flew in a smuggling run, dumping packages of cocaine over Georgia before attempting to escape with nearly 80 pounds of it strapped to his body.However, the parachute malfunctioned (possibly from the extra weight), and Thornton fell to his death in a Georgia resident's driveway (as shown in \"Cocaine Bear\").40 kilos of the thrown packages landed in a national forest and were consumed by a black bear who overdosed most likely within minutes, dying from cerebral hemorrhaging and respiratory and heart failure, after eating $20 USD million-worth ($55 USD million adjusted for inflation).With the lone exceptions of Thornton and the bear, no other casualties have ever been reported. That bear did not actually attack anyone.The real life \"Cocaine Bear\" that inspired this movies crazy plot line has also been jokingly referred to as \"Pablo Escobear\" and is on display at the Kentucky Fun Mall.Unconfirmed rumours say it was previously owned by musician Waylon Jennings.\"Cocaine Bear\" was filmed on location in Ireland not the US as the producers would have you believe.This is not even close to Yogi Bear & Boo Boo's, Jellystone National Park and their picnic baskets, but instead beautiful countryside around Dublin.Watch out for: A Billboard sign advising tourists to visit \"the original glory hole\".\"Cocaine Bear\" was originally just the working title, but it stuck.Under Elizabeth Banks skilful direction is a hilarious black comedy, thriller, horror movie that could make a fun date night.If watching an 80's genre oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converge on a forest where a huge black bear goes on a murderous rampage after unintentionally ingesting cocaine then this could be for you.In some ways it reminded my of the 60's classic \"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\", which is a huge wrap...anything that could go wrong, does go wrong.\"Cocaine Bear\" is a hoot and a good reminder to stay away from Bears in the woods regardless of what Wikipedia tells you!",

I gave it a lower rating because I thought a lot of the movie fell flat on what it could've been in my opinion. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, and I'm the type of person to easily give 9 stars to my favorite comedies, since I recognize that a film doesn't need to be deep or dramatic to be great and enjoyable. After walking out of the theater though, I thought that an entire side plot could've been wiped from the movie entirely, and it would've made the movie not just the same, but much better.The first half of the movie was perfect for what it was trying to be (outside of the side plot that I'll mention later). It's a wacky comedy about a bear who got into a bunch of cocaine and thus became the most feared and dangerous predator on the planet. It was the concept grabbed the interest of audiences, and it was exactly what I went into the theater to see. I was having the time of my life.By the second half though, the movie's fun meter noticeably dropped when the plot became less about how the characters were gonna survive in the woods, faced against a bear high on cocaine, and more about the side plot where a bunch of cocaine was thrown out of a plane, and a couple criminals were tasked with retrieving it from where it all landed... oh, and there was a bear in a few scenes for comic relief purposes. At that point, I was just sitting there, wondering how the movie was going to end off. To avoid spoilers, all I'll say is that the ending was weird, even by this movie's standards, and it left me unsatisfied.Overall, I liked the movie better when it was simply just Cocaine Bear and not whatever the screenplay writer was trying to make once he got bored of typing out 50 pages of Cocaine Bear.",

Instead of lazily lining up attack scenes with gratuitous violence (which filmmakers of something like this could've easily done), there was an actual plot, so each action scenario weirdly made sense in the story line and was surprisingly tense. The story took its time to introduce the characters and their idiosyncrasies, so that we can actually give a damn about them, why they're here, and whether or not they live or die. The characters themselves are also interesting and entertaining so you're not necessarily just waiting for the next bear attack, you're enjoying their innate goofiness.That said, with the character building, some of the scenes were filmed in a way that felt awkwardly dragged out. At the time it felt a bit confusing why were spending so much time on a particular plot point, but they inevitably do a decent job of looping back to it.The approach the filmmakers took overall I think struck a good balance of comedy, horror and reality. A situation like this in real life would be very sad with bears ingesting a dangerous amount of drugs and likely dying (I haven't read much into the real life story this is based on) but thankfully the filmmakers are here to just give audiences a good time and stay in a lane that is ultimately entertaining.",

There are seven to eight characters introduced throughout the course of the film, with each given significant time to develop their story and motivations.

There is a period of almost 45 minutes where we are focused on these \"secondary\" characters, without any action or appearance of the cocaine bear. This section was pretty slow paced and started to lose me, but once the bear is re-introduced, the film gets significantly better. The paramedic scene was superb.The comedy was pretty lackluster as well. The entire theater was laughing aloud, but I found myself only chuckling at a few jokes. This left the script feeling somewhat bland. But the lack of humor is made up for by the absolute brutality on display. There are some really messed up kills that do not shy away from the blood and gore. Some of the effects looked to be prosthetics as well, which always have an especially disgusting appearance to them.The story overall was pretty decent, but the ending was atrocious and incredibly predictable. I found that it was really over the top and cheesy, but not in a good way.The visual appearance of the bear was pretty solid. The CGI was done well but is spotty in a couple of scenes.

            "content": "Everyone is going to watch the Cocaine Bear trailer and be rooting to see some carnage but I want to start with the deceptively deep cast Cocaine Bear boasts. The movie doesn't really have a protagonist (unless you want to count the bear) but if you made me pick, I'd credit Brooklyn Prince and Christian Covenry as Dee Dee and Henry. They're both solid for kid actors, Christian especially has a couple of funny moments screaming and losing his mind. Getting to the more well-known cast members, Ray Liotta gives his final performance as drug runner Syd. Liotta is fine, he could have played this character in his sleep but he still had the gravitas to make a believable villain. It's always a delight to see Keri Russell and she does decent job at playing the concerned but understandably worried mom. The two best performances came from Isiah Whitlock Jr as the even-keeled but flabbergasted detective Bob and Alden Ehrenreich as the depressed and philosophical Eddie. Alden especially is giving it his all and selling out as this character. I appreciated the effort, he got a raw deal as Han Solo and I'd like to see. Margo Martindale was a nice inclusion (rounding off The Americans reunion that was this movie) and she's sells a lot of the awkward bits her character is put in. She's an odd fit for the material however. Scott Seiss is given a small role but he's great at going all bug-eyed and freaking out in his small amount of screen time. On a disappointing note, I've really liked O'Shea Jackson Jr. In other projects but this wasn't his finest work in Cocaine Bear. I don't know if he wasn't into it or how the movie was spliced together but he seemed detached or uninterested.Cocaine Bear is a dark comedy but it's also an action movie and I thought the movie was captured well overall. Elizabeth Banks and her team did a great job of setting up the environment and handling the CGI with the bear. Our titular character doesn't look completely lifelike but it seemed realistic enough and there weren't any noticeable flubs interacting with the human cast members. The action is both surprisingly funny and very tense. The bear is captured much like the shark in Jaws, it's something to be feared and it kills indiscriminately. Cocaine Bear is also more graphic than expected (it does have an 18A rating), but I'd argue the movie needed that. The film revels in the chaos and the film works best in the darker bits like when the bear is snorting a line off a severed limb before wreaking more havoc. You're inviting expectations by calling a movie Cocaine Bear, people are going to want some zany and bloody action. Cocaine Bear delivers on both counts, the movie doesn't shy away from controversial subject matter and it led to a lot of big laughs from me.Cocaine Bear has some genuinely inspired moments of dark tinged hilarity but the most obvious and blatant problem with Cocaine Bear is that there's an premise for a movie present but there's nothing else here. Any substantial bit of time spent away from the rampaging bear grinds the movie to a screeching halt. The subplots and supporting characters aren't interesting and there's so much dead air in Cocaine Bear. I understand they couldn't cleave the movie apart in the editing room and submit a cut that was an hour long, but I'm convinced it would have been a better movie. The other complaint I have is that the choices of the characters (including the bear) don't hold up to scrutiny. That didn't bother me as much because the movie is \"based on true events\" so if the characters don't act the way they do, there's no movie. But even with cutting the movie the slack, there was still a few times where I threw my hands up and started muttering under my breath.What did you want to get out of Cocaine Bear? That sounds like a cop out but you get what you pay for with this film. The film is shot well, the cast is stacked with talented people and there's some scenes that had me laughing hard or wincing in my seat. But it doesn't offer anything past that and those hoping for more than a drug fuelled frenzy where a bear mauls some people, you'll be disappointed. But I knew what I was signing up for and Elizabeth Banks and her team got the job done. I'd recommend keeping expectations low but I'd give Cocaine Bear a 6.5-7/10. I enjoyed seeing Cocaine Bear on the big screen but from a quality standpoint, it just passes the line of whether it's worth paying full price for a ticket. I would say it's worth catching at the theatre but you don't need to sprint to get there.",

I left feeling flat and saying to myself \"what a waste of money, this should have just went straight to shudder\" it should have never had a cinematic release and I won't be going back to watch it again anytime soon.

Lots of humor, surprisingly good action scenes that hold your interest the entire 95 min run time. While the real bear died in 1985, it seems this bear is more like Popeyes the coke head.Storyline: if you want to really know involves a drug dealer who's being trailed by that dude you'll recognize as a tv detective. Some product drug dealer is peddling falls mid transport and a ice cube's son is sent in to fix the situation. Unfortunately a big black bear finds, inhales, and becomes a raging mauler after inhaling the drugs. From there we get the cliche towns people coping and dealing with stopping the bear. Our heroine is nurse played by Keri Russell who's cute but miscast here. A little too prissy to cope with a real black bear let a lone a CGI one. Then there's the flawed townsfolk who are either eaten or running from the bear until it gets it's next fix.Don't take it serious, just check your brain at the door and relax.

The uneven narrative flow disconnects it's audience who are just wanting to see crazy bear action. By the time we see the action, it involves characters we don't care about. The sense of urgency is non-existent. You keep waiting for the movie itself to do a line of cocaine and get crazy, but it mostly plods along with one too many plots and bear action that has only a few moments of fun.It feels like the script started off as a horror suspense, but got changed into an attempt add comedic elements. A bear doing cocaine is not funny in itself, so we get a lot of forced comedic moments with characters that never feel real. You can be told to watch the ambulance scene, the kids finding the cocaine, and the tree scene. Then you'll save an hour of your life wasted on everything else in the movie. Overall, this was a movie that didn't have to be a great film in order to succeed, but it failed at delivering even the only thing it needed, to be more fun.",

A drugs parcel is dropped from a plane, resulting in the death of the courier responsible after a misjudgment with a parachute. Bob (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), a local cop, discovers the body, and sets a chain of events in motion. Drugs boss Syd White (Ray Liotta) sends his two minions Daveed (O,Shea Jackson Jr.) and Eddie (Aiden Ehrenreich) to find the drugs. Meanwhile, school friends Dee Dee (Brooklyn Prince) and Henry (Christian Convery) skip school and discover one of the packets, with catastrophic results. But a great deal of it has been consumed by a massive bear...and it's going on a rampage.This unbelievably true story, directed by Elizabeth Banks and written by Jimmy Warden, is actually loosely based on the truth, and given it's so wild, that's as good as can be expected. It's actually adapted from some pretty tragic source material, as indeed it seems a bear did really consume a tonne of dropped cocaine, but was found dead in the middle of the woods. But, as a film, with all the facts not established, the makers are free to take some creative license, and with material as unhinged as this, they're free to go mad.The very title promises something not intended as some kind of deep, searing drama or to be taken seriously in any way, and it is indeed a short, sharp, whacky ride, with its tongue firmly in its cheek, regardless of how outrageously gruesome and gratuitous it gets. It just plays out, does it's thing and leaves you unable to comprehend just what you've watched, and even more nonplussed that it's a true story. But it's helped along by spirited performances from its young leads Prince and Convery, along with strong support from Keri Russell as Dee Dee's nurse mom, Margo Martindale as a sturdy park ranger, and most notably Ray Liotta in one of his last roles, still unnerving as the ruthless crime lord, even in a lighter role. There's also a nice soundtrack to go along with it (to wit, the bear running wild after an ambulance to Depeche Mode's I Just Can't Get Enough.)It's a bizarre little Frankenstein's monster of a film, a kind of family drama, horror film, crime drama, all wrapped up in around an hour and a half, and all the more perplexing that it's based on a true story (or, at least around true events.) It's just a fun, wild, strange little ride. ***",

They did some strange angles, but most of these non-conventional shots were made only to enhance the comical situations.Acting, same as camera work, is not superb. But you don't expect it to be , with such movie. Saying that, it's not bad either. Few of the exagerated characters have bad acting, which looks very intentional for the comic reasons. The main actors are actually decent for such movie, again - exceeding my low expectations.Soundwise, the movie is with Atmos. Although you don't have big Atmos presence , it gives (rarely tho) an overal ambient sound for that. Surround is mediocre , they could have done much better job with it ... It was very nice in the first 5mins, then they like forgot about having surround sound. Anyway, with such silly movie, you don't expect masterful surround sound anyway.Overall, very fun movie to watch, just a casual chill evening movie with some popcorn or whatever is your comfort food and drink.P.

Out of all the characters though, I will say that the trio centred around Ehrenreich mostly worked for me, the three of them had a fun chemistry, but the other groups were just... there, I guess? And if they'd just been barely fleshed out characters who were only there as canon fodder I'd have been fine with that - throw in a couple quips and funny deaths and I'm good - but no, even the Pulp Fiction-esque death in the cabin just fell flat for me even though that's exactly the type of thing I'd come to this movie for.In my opinion, this film tried to do too many things at once and its worst mistake was to try and make us care about an overly large cast. It should have really focused on the horror comedy aspect - and even that was lacking when they did focus on it.

            "content": "\"Cocaine Bear has saved cinema!\" \"Cocaine Bear is a flawless masterpiece!\" ...said no one ever. But who cares! You know what you're getting into with this one, and you'll either be on its wavelength, or you won't be. Luckily, I 100% was and had a blast! It's a solid B-movie full of camp offering exactly what audiences want from it - an absolutely insane bear wreaking gory, bloody havoc. And when it does this, I was so in! It's like a slasher movie where the killer is a bear who did cocaine! Some of the kills are even so outrageous that they end up being pretty funny! Sure, this is definitely full of ridiculousness and absurdity, but it delivers on its promise of being an extremely entertaining time at the movies! It was funny, gory and was a straight-up wild time... in certain areas.The movie unfortunately only delivers whenever the titular bear is on screen. The good part about this is that it is a good chunk of the movie, and the movie is at its peak when it fully commits to the drug-fuelled chaos! The not-so-good part: the scenes in between were somewhat dull. I definitely didn't care about the human characters all that much, and just found myself wanting to get back to the bear and see who it was going to kill next. The performances were overall fine and I quite liked the cast, but I found some of the actors played it a bit too seriously (Keri Russell), while others knew exactly what type of movie this was and played it accordingly (Alden Ehrenreich, Kristofer Hivju). There was a lot of this unevenness, not just in acting but in story and tone, and the film had a wonky structure. The film has a lot of storylines that really drag out the pacing, some were entertaining and some were not. And it sucks that this kind of held the film back from being the completely wild and crazy time I thought it was going to be. When the bear isn't on screen, it was really hard to care as moments without the bear were only lightly amusing. The screenwriters weren't too clever with the jokes, and when the movie wasn't being completely outrageous it seemed like the movie found it hard to be funny. It felt a bit like an overlong SNL sketch, where it tried to flesh out its premise too much which takes away from the joke of it. The movie is at its best when it is going way over the top, and frankly, it could have gone even crazier, even more stupid and mindless. But still, despite me wishing it was overall more tonally balanced, I still enjoyed it.I wanted a stupid fun time with a bear murdering people, and for 75% of the time I got that! The kills are brutal and outrageous - I was laughing while my jaw was on the floor at the surprising amount of gore! I just loved seeing the bear murder people! Every time the bear was on screen the movie was extremely entertaining. It's campy, and the film embraces this. It thrives when it sticks to this camp and the 80s-esque horror! Plus, with a runtime of only 95 minutes, even at the dull points this movie was never boring, it is consistently entertaining! I wish it was a little more balanced, but hey I can't really complain can I? I got the movie I signed up for, and I still came out of it loving the ridiculousness of the premise! I'm so happy Elizabeth Banks was able to pull it off and craft this wild camp-fest of a film with some really fun moments! All hail the return of the campy, hour-and-a-half, B-movie! It's pure dumb fun, and if you think the idea of a bear getting high and going on a killing spree sounds fun (like I did) I'd definitely recommend checking this out, it's a really great time! Yes, it has issues and overall isn't an amazing film by any means, but really who wants a cinematic masterpiece with this type of film? We just want a totally nonsensical yet extremely entertaining time where nothing else matters besides the bear who did cocaine.",

            "content": "It's clear going into this that the movie was designed entirely with concept in mind. The idea pretty much runs the movie with the singular question: What would a black bear do high on a whole lot of cocaine? In real life, the bear was found dead from an overdose. In this movie, it goes on a near rampage, mangling and killing near everyone in it's path. What we get is a movie that's entertaining when it's focused on the bear and lagging when it's not. But overall, it's a pretty decent, mostly fun movie, if too forgettable.After a fun and bloody opening, the film spends a good chunk of it's time introducing us to our main characters. It's a mixed bag: Keri Russel and Oshea Jackson probably get the least interesting characters, but do a decent job with the thin parts. Ray Liotta shows up mostly for the third act and it's great to see him in what is one of his last major roles. Alden Ehrenreich Does a decent job as the sympathetic son of Ray Liotta's kingpin. The highlights were the kids and especially Margo Martindale in short role as a forest ranger.Of course, the highlight here is the bear. The bear on cocaine is played up for campy laughs and gory horror, and fans of both will be very pleased. I'd even go so far as to call this, in part, a slasher as it plays it up like one at many points. And whenever the bear is on screen, it's an entertaining ride with lots of bloody bits and missing limbs. Of particular highlight is the ambulance scene teased in the trailer. Unfortunately, when the bear isn't on screen, the film lags. It feels almost like the characters and story exist to pad out time and lead into the bear tearing it up. Fortunately, what is fun outweighs what isn't.This is the kind of movie that, later down the line, will likely have the kind of cult status we get from a lot of 80's and 90's movies. I don't expect it to be particularly memorable after it's time in the theater, but those who love it will love it and those who don't will likely forget it after watching it. But the film does give you exactly what you came to see.",

When the film finished I stood up, with a tear brimming in my eye, and applauded. I have seen this film 7 times in cinema and I have 2 posters of it in my house. This film can only be enjoyed by the top 1% of individuals. This film wouldn't be complete without caviar and wine to accentuates its incredible audio, visuals, acting, plot and cinematography. When 'Cocaine Bear' inevitably gets awarded ever Oscar award - Elizabeth Banks should decline them as they simply aren't prestigious enough.

I thought it was really cool how we got a killer bear movie again because I don't think there's been a real proper one since Grizzly! So all in all it was just very fun and not much more than that, but you know maybe that's a good thing I didn't go in expecting Shakespeare from that title!

            "content": "A coked up bear on the rampage sounds like a slam dunk but turning an over the top idea into a serviceable film is a tricky business. The Hollywood dumpster is choc full of great sounding elevator pitches that became lifeless, one joke husks when they made it to the screen. Fortunately Cocaine Bear is more Anaconda than Snakes on a Plane.Needless to say the film bares (ha ha) little resemblance to the \"true story\" it claims to be based on. After all the story of finding a dead bear next to a duffle bag of cocaine probably wouldn't pack theatres. Here, rather than die from eating copious amounts of drugs, the bear simply gets a bit of a habit and goes on the hunt for more. This is bad news for people trying to find the rest of the lost stash themselves or those simply trying to enjoy the woods.Director Elizabeth Banks does a good job of leaning on the premise just the right amount. The bear on cocaine joke is only made once or twice, the bear is mainly just a feral animal tearing chunks out of idiots who keep getting in its face. Most of the comedy comes from the large assortment of oddball characters that cross the bears path. The movie does a solid job of giving the audience people to root for and against while providing plenty of fodder for entertaining kills. Particular props to O'shea Jackson Jnr's conflicted gangster and Jessie Tyler Ferguson's over the top park ranger. The most important character, the bear itself, benifits from being used sparingly. This means its presence is always impactful and we never spend too long looking at the less than perfect CGI.The pacing isn't always spot on, dragging just a smidge at the beginning and end, and the type of comedy will be a real turn off for some but you can't accuse Cocaine Bear of not delivering on its premise.7 cocaine laced marmalade sandwiches out of 10 picnic baskets.",

The over-the-top characters (a whole bunch of 'em), the nasty kills, the '80s setting, the frequent bouts of laughter - they all make for a delightfully weird concoction that keeps you engaged for 90-something minutes. The silliness meter is on a whole different level here, and the screenplay (by Jimmy Warden) deliberately cranks it up to eleven. While the human characters lack depth and swing between various levels of annoying, unlikeable, bewildered, hilarious, and wise-cracking, it's the titular bear on cocaine that truly stands tall. Don't expect anything profound or subtle; Cocaine Bear is only looking to amuse you as an exaggerated horror-comedy with plenty of gore and guts. Also, RIP Ray Liotta!",

Cocaine Bear (2023) was exactly what I expected but also not what I expected at the same time, plus this is inspired by true events that happened in the 70's or 80's with this movie stretching it with fictional events that did not happen.The acting in the movie is not entirely great but it is fine for what this movie is doing, but this movie focuses on these characters too much and does not have enough time with the bear. The movie involves drug dealers trying to get the cocaine that was lost, kids lost in the park, and other characters that I did not need to follow for half of the movie.The bear itself is clearly CGI and it did not look bad, but it is not great even though it is believable enough for this movie. When the bear is killing people, doing dumb things, and doing dumb action scenes the movie was entertaining, but I wanted more of the bear because it shows most of the time in the halfway point to the third act.The movie occasionally has a funny line or has funny moments happen, but then the other times it can be cringe-inducing, along with the dialogue not being awful but does have some lines that are not written well. The cinematography is nice, and Elizabeth Banks as the director was not that bad, but there are some weird editing choices that did not make sense.Cocaine Bear (2023) was what I expected, but I did not expect there to be too much focus on the characters and less focus on the bear till the second and third act.

You get what you pay for and nothing else.This is a movie that knows it's ridiculous and sadly doesn't lean into it enough. Though, you can't deny that everyone in this film enjoys himself (or herself) with the premise.Based on a true story (and I do mean \"based\"), this tells the story of a man who dumped a lot of cocaine in the Chattahoochie National Forest. A bear gets into it, and all hell breaks loose. It weaves three different subplots: a mother looking for her lost daughter (Keri Russell), two drug dealers looking for the lost stash (O'Shea Jackson, Jr. And Ehrlen Emmerich), and a cop looking to capture the drug dealers (Isaiah Whitlock, Jr.)None of the characters are really deep. Emmerich, the son of a drug kingpin (the late Ray Liotta in his final role), grieves the death of his wife. Keri Russell wants her child back. Jackson loves his clothes and shoes. No one here is someone you feel too sorry for, but that's passable with a movie like this. No one watches a slasher or a monster movie to sympathize with the characters too much. Jackson and Russell make the most with their characters, and seeing Jesse Tyler Ferguson playing a Southern forester was surprisingly entertaining. Probably because you get Mitchell Pritchett with a Southern accent (not a bad thing). The bear was also a decent albeit cheap effect. You know it's a CGI bear, but it's a beautiful, emotive beast that gets into mode.While everyone has fun with this ridiculous premise, and there's plenty of blood and gore to go around, the movie doesn't really go into much of the silliness as it should. The deaths don't seem too over the top or hilarious. Only a handful of moments had me really laughing. It's a movie that wants to be a cult film but doesn't quite understand what makes a cult film. You would think that someone like Elizabeth Banks with her comedic background would know how to bring more comedy into this premise.Fortunately, this flaw isn't enough for me to say \"don't watch this film\". It's fun enough and ridiculous enough to warrant all the jokes. I can't say that you'll be bored because you won't. There's enough in this movie to elevate it from the same fate as \"Snakes on a Plane\": it's not a joke forcing itself to be a thing. Just remember that you get what you pay for and little else.",

            "content": "In case the title and the movie poster weren't enough of a clue, all you need to know is that there are multiple storylines and several parties of characters who link together through a rampaging bear attacking people whilst high on cocaine. The film is loosely based on the events of 1985 in which an American black bear was found dead after ingesting millions of dollars worth of cocaine that had been trafficked from Columbia, but the difference between history and the movie is that the bear doesn't die after this significant overdose, and it goes on to kill a bunch of people in a Georgia forest.The truth is that Cocaine Bear is exactly how it sounds; the trick to enjoying it is just whether or not you're able to buy into the absurdity and have fun as you watch all these fictional characters get mauled by a 500-pound black bear. It's not until 30 minutes into the movie where the action finally awakens (with the exception of the opening scene), because the movie is trying to get the audience adjusted with several storylines playing out at the same time, between drug smugglers, tourists, cops, children and parents. It starts off with a lack of promise, but sh#t gets real when they collide in the forest.Cocaine Bear is kind of similar to Sharknado, except it's actually entertaining and the fun you're having with it is real. It's extremely funny, highly entertaining, frequently gory and there's no drugs other than constant cocaine. It's mainly the eccentricity between the several groups of characters that make this movie a blast to watch. Undeniably the best comedic performances are given by Margo Martindale, Isiah Whitlock Jr. And O'Shea Jackson Jr., who each provide the film's greatest sequences, especially involving the ambulance and the gazebo. But the other cast members, including Keri Russell and the children, each have their own supply of chemistry to offer. While it can sometimes be frustrating and usually is maddening when done in other movies, the switching between the settings of each of the characters after they've had a lengthy sequence is done exquisitely and necessarily.In addition to the amount of drug and cocaine content this film obviously contains, it's also very gory at times. With dismembered legs flying around, most of the effects are honestly super cheesy, but this is meant to be funny while it's also somewhat rational; it's not like how Sharknado features terrible effects and calls it \"brainless-fun\" as an excuse for how bad it is. It's difficult to explain how the CGI for the bear could be better, although it's very silly at times. At least the moments where it's hunting or encountering the characters are still intense. Other than the first act, another issue in this movie is that the climax during the third act isn't as exciting or fun as some of the previous sequences are, making the second act the most enjoyable third of the film. But if you can ignore this, Cocaine Bear is a very fun comedy that doesn't hold back on gore and knows how to deliver humour.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

There are many aspects I was scared a movie that wasn't taking itself very seriously would have (Dated memes, Pop Culture references, dumb cameos) but Cocaine Bear definitely leaves some method to it's eccentricity.The film very much acts like a typical slasher film, where there's a body count and a monster taking out the half-baked characters one by one. And while there are definitely films that do this premises way better, Cocaine Bear handles the basic dread and tense moments decently well. Although there are moments where the film feels \"Tame\", there are also moments that took me by surprise in terms of shock.None of the characters are very memorable, the story isn't anything special, but it's good popcorn fodder. Which is clearly what it aims to be.",

A bear high on coke, scooting around on its back, hugging trees, chasing people plus funny lines - this was going to be an over the top comedy with elements of Jaws-like horror and surprises. Maybe a bit like Lake Placid, a favorite of mine. Nope. That was not the case.Sure, there were some dark, even black, comedy bits that made me laugh. Far fewer than expected. It's mostly a horror movie with lots of blood and gore, far more than I anticipated based on the trailers and TV promos. A man sitting behind me told his friends it had been a long time since he'd gone out to a movie. After Cocaine Bear, it may be a long time again before he goes to the theater.I will say much of the cast did a good job with their roles. Ray Liotta was as menacing as ever, almost as menacing as the coked-out bear. And the smartass kids were good. The plot makes a good B-movie setup - a diverse group of people winding up in the Georgia woods at the same time unaware a 500-pound black bear is coked out of its head looking for more of the cocaine bricks that had been dropped from a plane and ripping apart any people who cross its path.This could have been a B+ movie if it played up what was in the promos and played down the gore. At best, B- maybe even C. Cocaine Beat definitely is no Lake Placid.",

Elizabeth Banks shows her talent as a Director by bringing to life a story that most likely was a result of a very interesting question that was asked one day, \"What would happen if a bear did cocaine?\". Unlike a lot of movies I enjoy, this one did not have a huge lesson about humanity or some deeper meaning of life. What I learned from watching this movie is if I encounter a Black Bear in the wild, I will be throwing hands on sight. If it's a Brown Bear, I will be laying flat on my stomach. Although everyone's sense of humor is different, there is no denying how this movie nails the comedic timing of its jokes. This was also by far the most insane thing I've ever watched. Limbs were getting cut off and flying around everywhere, people, including children, were accidentally doing cocaine, and it kept getting more insane with each new character introduced.

I haven't been this disappointed since the Simpson's movie. Too bad because I really wanted to have some good laughs. Ray Liotta appears briefly near the beginning of the film and doesn't reappear until the end. No complaints with his acting of course but others were just so-so. Yeah, too much slapstick here that I felt constantly missed. A movie that did not hold my interest. Also, the bear itself was more like Jaws than, say, the Chipmonk in Caddy Chack; just very scary and w/o humor although I believe it was attempted once or twice. I attended this movie with a small audience and no one was laughing out loud either. So *that's* why it got just a 6.4 rating - I had assumed it was due to too many folks being too critical and not just relaxing and enjoying a fun movie such as There's Something About Mary, which most people liked. But it appears I'm the one who is quite critical of this movie even though I think it's justified. Definately a film you will either like or dislike.

With relatively good performances, Cocaine Bear is a hilarious yet gruesome man vs wild flick which promises some mindless entertainment.Based on a real life incident, a real bear was found dead in the forests of Georgia due to a cocaine overdose and a film out of such an event contemns it but a adding imaginative characters and going all crazy is a commendable effort by the makers. The screenplay doesnt necessarily wastes any of your time and the bear comes out in first 10mins. A rampage which is hilarious and excruciating at the same time. Mad fun and silly characters make this a good one time watch.

            "content": "I went into this movie with little to no expectations, my coworkers were doing a management bonding trip and I went along, we got dinner then went to the movie which at that point in the night I hadn't formed a major opinion on other than the novelty of watching a film about a bear that does cocaine.However once the movie started I began to notice some of the trends, the first two people introduced are literally there to introduce the premise of the bear, one of them just dies, then the other is just left in the woods never to be reintroduced until the end of the film where he points Keri Russel's character in the right direction of the bears cave. This movie has comedic points, and utilizes them well enough but they are largely overshadowed by the next scene, the jokes either flopped or the next scene was introduced too quickly which left me with a feeling of whiplash essentially. I found the peak of the movie around the midway point where an ambulance is called after 3 teens were beat down after attacking O'Shea's character, the bear of course being in the rangers station after attacking the Ranger and 1 of the teens, has an elaborate chase resulting in the ranger's death, and the two emts. By this point the movie felt flat, the quick jumps from each group felt choppy and quicker than I would have preferred.The concept in general was fine? I mean there isn't much you can do with a story that consists of a bear finding a drug dealers dropped crack and then dying shortly thereafter, but I found that the plotlines of the characters introduced (because let's be honest unless they're going in a Disney animated direction where the bear talks and sings its hard to get a plotline out of a cracked out bear), were good but they were not developed nearly enough for the audience to get invested. I found that the most compelling one was Alden's characters and his was one we saw throughout but that could have also had to do with the chemistry between him and O'Shea as neither character felt compelling on their own.I read a few reviews who were not fond of the kids roles in the film and while I found their presence jarring and simply there to give Keri's character a reason to be out there (Because genuinely there was no real reason for her to be out there than her kid), but I felt that their acting was good, anytime the two kids were on screen they felt compelling and boosted the performance of those around them in a good way. Towards the end when the two children and Keri's character run into Alden, O'Shea, and Ray's characters suddenly the 4 of the adult actors were compelling and felt like they actually had things to live for and a story to complete, however before then the drug group (what I'm calling Alden, O'Shea, and Ray's characters), felt sorta one note, O'Shea was someone who got involved and was the grunt for Ray's character, and Alden was the mourning husband who left the business to be with his wife, while each were interesting in their own rights none of the stories actually felt compelling enough in the scope of the story to make the audience want them to actually get out of this. The minute the two children are in the scene the drug group felt like they had more character than just a grunt and a mourning husband. O'Shea wanted to leave the business and Alden finally found the will to move on after seeing how fiercely Keri defended the kids. Which to have this sorta character development in literally the last like 15-20 minutes of the movie was just frustrating personally. I would have loved to see some sort of inkling of change happening as the movie progressed, but literally the entire movie when he's on screen is just one note, someone who got dragged back into the mess of his families business and wants to just leave.Character development aside I found the sheer amount of gore overshadowing in the grand scheme of things. While yes I can see where its necessary in some movies and settings I found the sheer amount of it to be unnecessary at times and made the movie hard to watch in some moments. Like me personally I could have gone without seeing Jesse's characters lifeless body fall from a tree and crunch as his gnawed off leg followed shortly thereafter. I could have gone without seeing Ray's character disemboweled on screen while the bear cubs eat his innards. I understand in some cases gore is acceptable and fine but in this it just felt like it was trying to shock the audience but failed as the times it was on screen made the audience feel numb to it after a while since it was genuinely every other shot in some parts was just a blood and guts fest.It felt like it was trying to be a horror gore movie, and then also a comedy, and then also a suspense movie while all being literally about a bear doing crack. It was trying to be all these different things but (as one of my friends described it as) \"gave us a nothing burger\". I felt that if it picked a genre and stuck with it it could have gone well, but since it was trying to do so many things at once the movie felt like it never knew what it was doing other than \"guys c'mon the bear does cocaine, like you have to look at this guys the bear is DOING cocaine\". Which for some is good, but for a lot of viewers it feels like it falls flat and doesn't entirely do anything, there is no deeper meaning, there is no deeper resolution the director sought to speak about, I found it just confusing to watch, and while I can usually handle gore it crossed the very fine line between too much and the good amount unfortunately.",

Now that's not to say I didn't enjoy it or that there weren't any good parts either. For example, the gore was probably the biggest star in the film; Cocaine Bear got brutal at some points, and I liked the somewhat unhinged violence. But almost every other aspect of the film came up short. All of the acting was bad, the writing was hard to listen to, and not every joke really landed for me. Cocaine bear succeeds in entertaining but fails to create anything memorable.Something I've never had to complain about before was the actors' voices. One thing I couldn't help but think about throughout the entire film was how bad the casting was. I think the most off-putting performance was from O'shea Jackson Jr. His character was just awfully written, and every time his plot was on the screen, I could only sigh. He simply did not fit in his role, and that's how most characters felt (except for the children). Everyone felt out of place, fictional, and offputting.The writing certainly didn't help with any of the performances either. I know this is supposed to be a \"funny\" movie, and there were some funny parts, but listening to some of the dialogue throughout the movie was tough at times. The writing made it feel like an indie movie written by a 12-year-old. The script also failed to create any attachment between the characters and the audience. For the most part, I didn't care if any of the characters died or not. In fact, by the end, I was hoping some of the characters would die since the gore was much more pleasant than hearing them talk.I know I am being harsh. So despite my complaints, I will admit the movie was entertaining; it was fun to watch while I wait for something better to come to theaters. I'm glad I saw it now that it has come out, but I will most likely never see Cocaine Bear again, which is something that I can live with.",

Keri Russell is good as a mom looking for her lost daughter while the drug addicted bear is on the loose. After his failed outing as a leading man in SOLO, Alden Ehrenreich shows that he still retains some comedic timing and deliver a decent performance. Ray Liotta is the human antagonist in his very last live-action role before his sad untimely death. And he's good with what he has to work with in the movie.As for the downsides, there is stuff in this movie that does not work at all. There is some family drama set up at the beginning of the movie which kind of escalates out of nowhere. But it's ignored once the 'Cocaine Bear' begins its rampage. And there are a couple scenes that feel like they were shot out of sync. One supporting character dies off-camera but it feels like they were almost ignored until we see the body later.It's far more silly than actually scary, but for audiences who know exactly what kind of movie they're in for, they will get their money's worth.",

            "content": "COCAINE BEAR is slow-paced and full of scene fillers. Much of the story beats are unnecessary. For a slasher film with no protagonists, we didn't need the character building of any of these characters, especially Keri Russell's and O'Shea Jackson Jr's.STYLE/TONE:There's a lot of nothingness going on in the story that highlights how weak Jimmy Warden's screenplay is. Too much walking through the forest to get from point A to B. It wasn't paced well enough or humorous enough to take the journey with those characters.Elizabeth Banks' directing style of allowing the humor to linger long enough as if those long beats were placeholders for a laugh track was awkward and amateurish.The time/setting weren't properly conveyed, neither were wardrobe and props. The characters were dressed in 80s garb and the vehicles were 80s clunkers (with seatbelts btw), but they -- many of them -- had smartphones.The CGI of the black bear was captured with realism. That's what the movie has going for it--the well-crafted CGI.MARKETING:\nThe viral marketing campaign for the film will pique your interest enough to see it opening weekend. But the trailer features the best sequences of the film and it's spoiler-heavy. I just don't see how this film will have legs throughout March and grow a cult following once word gets out that it's too gimmicky and empty of substance.WHAT WORKS:\nMargo Martindale, the kids (Christian Convery & Brooklynn Prince), the Black Bear and well, the coke. The best scenes involve them.Isiah Whitlock, Jr. Has great comedic timing, but not a whole lot to do. He has a prop in the form of a lapdog to justify the cruelty of the bear(s).That's Jesse Tyler Ferguson's arc, too. To humanize the humans, which is futile exercise. He does have funny moments during his brief stint and is nearly unrecognizable in hair and makeup.It was good seeing the late great Ray Liotta as a kingpin again. One final hurrah! But his role was also brief and written so milquetoast and one-dimensionally -- he did what he could.EXTRAS:\nStick around for some funny mid-credit scenes (there are 3).If there's a director's cut and outtakes, I'd be interested in seeing them if only to imagine a better version of this film.The film is setup for an inevitable sequel. The production budget for this film is estimated at $35M and I'm sure the marketing budget was at least $20M. It has a lot of earning to do to justify a sequel.SEE OR SKIP?:\nSee Cocaine Bear in theaters this weekend. There is enough in the film that works to justify paying to see it opening weekend.",

What totally blew my mind was that this movie was based on a true story but much like most adaptations, this one expands on how much was true while at the same time is used for comedic horror filter. The story itself spans an entire day where it focuses on several individuals ranging from a drug dealer (Ray Liotta), a mother who doubles as a nurse (Keri Russell), a detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), a sheriff (Margo Martindale), and a pair of drug smugglers (Eddie Ehrenreich and O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who are all somewhat connected to this one similar situation.At first when viewing the trailers, it looked intense with the cottage being presented and from what this movie viewer can tell you, it was a lot more than not only I could handle, but a lot more than what everyone in the theater could handle. I used to think that the Evil Dead movies were gory but OMG this takes the entire cake. While it had a lot of gory scenes, it should be worth noting that there were a handful of funny moments in the film too. It had me howling with laughter at times when first seeing it.On a very sad and unfortunate note here, this was known to be Ray Liotta's last film he was involved in before he passed away during production.

The bear in question DID ingest a good amount of cocaine, but in reality dies almost immediately after. But where's the fun in that.The movie is overall stupid and inane.

Though the actors do their best to energize the proceedings, the film's ensemble of \"wacky\" backwoods characters not only falls short, but also doesn't intersect with the bear aspect of the story as well as it probably could have.Each character needed a more distinct motivation that would not only put them in sharper conflict with other characters, but would also provide more emotional depth and intensity to conflict with the bear. (Mere survival isn't enough, especially not in a comedy.) We know the bear is coming, but don't feel a sense of anticipation as to how the characters and their motivations, flaws and conflicts will come into play when confronted by the bear.For instance, what if a character had an intense bear phobia, perhaps instilled during an intense, but ridiculous childhood memory (shown in flashback)? Though it's a Hollywood cliche to force a character to face and overcome a childhood fear, it's that kind of character arc that creates anticipation and, therefore, tension and engagement. It also makes for a more satisfying resolution.The story lacks a ticking clock; the anticipation of a larger (third act) event in which the arrival of the rampaging bear would foreshadow danger and mayhem on a larger (movie-sized) scale. For instance, adding the impending arrival of a Boy Scout jamboree or a Forest Ranger convention would create a locus to connect all of the characters to the coming danger of the drug-addled bear.Such an event would both motivate and connect Ranger Liz, Bob the cop, the drug dealers (who don't want other people finding the cocaine), the thieves (who might \"work\" the event), and also perhaps Dee Dee, who could plan to attend the event, despite her mother forbidding it. Such an event could help the ensemble to \"gel,\" uniting them on an inevitable collision course with the bear.All of the characters needed to be bigger and more theatrical (so as to be on par with the larger-than-life aspect of the bear), with larger, more ridiculous motivations and conflicts. For instance, Jesse Tyler Ferguson's character, Peter, could've been a pompously arrogant (self-published) nature author with a book signing at the ranger station. A public signing event would be a bigger deal for Ranger Liz, who could be starstruck by the author's \"celebrity.\"It becomes obvious, however, that Peter has never even been in a forest before and, worse, is terrified of it. His knowledge of nature, gleaned from Wikipedia, proves to be of little use when asked for his advice about how to handle the bear. He gives the worst possible advice, which eventually leads to his own humiliating demise. (Even Ranger Liz might admit that his actions are incredibly stupid.)If the audience knows that Peter's a fraud before the other characters do, it creates audience anticipation as to how and when his incompetence will be revealed, and how it will be detrimental to his survival when confronted by the bear.Every primary character needed a similar weakness (or strength) to be exploited by the arrival of the bear; creating set ups for later (comedic) pay-offs. Those pay-offs could relate to conflict with the bear or with other characters.For instance, there could be a rival drug kingpin who's fought a turf war with Syd for decades, who learns about the dumped cocaine and is determined to find it before Syd does. Resolution of that rivalry could be settled by the bear, either the two of them deciding to join forces to survive, or the \"victor\" being determined by the bear. (One kingpin could perhaps throw the other to the bear, only to have his \"victory\" cut short when the bear kills him as well.)To be clear, I'm not saying that my examples are the best solutions. I only offer them to illustrate ways in which the human stories could not only better connect characters to one another, but also intersect better with the bear story. As-is, the human stories and the bear story operate on mostly separate tracks, with too little new or surprising occurring when the story tracks intersect. Thus, because the setups are lacking, the pay-offs are either nonexistent or not as satisfying (or funny) as they could be.Pacing is also an issue, particularly during the first act. The scenes establishing the characters needed to move much more quickly and needed to better connect to one another. (The audience should be thinking, \"Oh, boy... I can't wait to see these two characters come into conflict. That's gonna be awesome!\")Those early scenes needed to do double duty, both establishing the characters and their relationships, PLUS creating anticipation of what may happen when those characters come into conflict with one another AND the bear.Speaking of character development, I think the bear itself also needed more personality. You might say, \"But it's just a big, dumb animal.\" True, but this is a comedy. So, we still need comedic setups and pay-offs that spring from the bear's personality and choices as well. What typical bear behaviors could be established, then exploited for comedic effect after the bear ingests the cocaine -- and how might those behaviors help or hinder the human characters?Lastly, the movie has an uneven tone. While some scenes are nearly cartoonish, others are played more straightforward. Both Margo Martindale, Isiah Whitlock, Jr., J. B. Moore and Scott Seiss hit the right comedic tone. Though believable, they're just \"theatrical\" enough to give their scenes the proper comedic tone and energy.Martindale's Ranger Liz is impatiently cynical about others, but blindly vain and self-indulgent when it comes to herself. Whitlock's Bob is a hard-as-nails cop, yet has a soft spot for the effete Rosette. Seiss' character tries to be the brave, heroic EMT, but is, in fact, a self-serving coward.All of the characters needed that kind of inherent contradiction and/or flaw, played with just a dash of larger-than-life theatricality. It would be even better if those flaws put them in heightened conflict, not only with each other, but also at a disadvantage (or advantage) when in conflict with the bear.With stories like this, I think it's best to flesh out the human characters and their story first. Then add the wild card, in this case the cocaine-crazed bear, as a catalyst to heighten character conflicts, while also exploiting their strengths and weaknesses to maximum effect. In this movie, it sometimes feels like the characters existed primarily as fodder for bear attacks. If there's a sequel, I hope as much time will be put into story and character development (with a focus on comedic setups and pay-offs) as is put into the engineering of the CG bear.",

This may not be everyone's cuppa to begin with. But knowing that, I really don't see how else the film could play out. They needed to make some effort to make it half plausible (based on a real story) and for that matter, the bear needs people to kill.But if you can allow yourself to enjoy the ride, it is a hell of one.

            "content": "Elizabeth Banks has made a considerable jump here to be an elite female director in my book(leapfrogged \"Power of the dog\" Jane Campion). This film had great pacing, good beats point and a solid story arc. I love that it's a throwback to 1985; all the costumes and the soundtrack were paired perfectly. This was clever and poetic casting for a horror comedy romp. First of all the great Ray Liotta's last movie(Nuff Said.) Having three cast members for the final season of \"The Americans\" was superb. Also, having her modern family cast mate as the wildlife inspector was fun. The judge from \"your honor,\" best buddy being the sheriff, was dynamite too. I can go on and on about the casting; ice cube's kid, I can't believe it; he looks almost the same as his dad. I can't stress how difficult this type of film is to do. I've seen fewer than a handful of horror comedies work, and this one works so well I was spitting up Junior mints every other scene. This is also a brutal movie to sneak in a burrito and try to eat while watching; if you were going to do it, do it early. Now I see why this film cut into the Ant-Man quantum mania box office. Cocaine Bear is pure storytelling and fun with total escapism and no agenda. And for this reason, I am grading lesson eight probably if this was released, and 85 would be like 6 1/2 or 7 stars because of the overall content we have to watch these days; it's such a delightful pleasure to have something that is just pure entertainment. This movie is \"the Maverick\" of 2023 YTD, and I can't wait for the sequel Cocaine Cubs.",

As soon as I saw the first advertisement for this movie, I knew it would rival the CGI quality of the Avatar franchise and the deep character developing plots of Wes Anderson movies. When it came to seeing it in theater, I was blown away more than the bear was that was one coke. Not only was the plot and CGI incredible, but also the sound design, set design, lighting and creative camera movement and angles blew me out of the water more than Avatar: Way of the Water. This film is by far the greatest piece done by Elizabeth Banks and she should be acclaimed among one of the greatest directors to ever step foot on this earth. Akira Kurosawa never even came close to this level of filmmaking. It captured the three transcendentals of art; truth (since it was based on true events), beauty (everything mentioned previously), and goodness (filling me and everyone else in the theater with a good feeling after seeing the film). For my fellow filmmakers who dislike or do not agree with my opinion on this masterpiece, while I do respect that it is your opinion and beliefs, there is also rules to art to define it's quality and I feel that you forget the fact that this film qualifies all the requirements to make this film a 10/10. Overall, Cocaine Bear is the best movie to have ever been created and will likely never be topped until The Room 2 comes out.",

            "content": "A title like Cocaine Bear might sound like a Sharknado-style cringefest worth avoiding but this is actually inspired by a true story and like all great movies based on true stories - e.g. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - only about 2% of this story is factual and that's the part where a bear consumed an unhealthy amount of cocaine. While they could have just made a movie about what happened to the bear posthumously which is a crazy story all on it's own, writer Jimmy Warden has given us a \"what if?\" alternative. What if the bear had come across a bunch of tourists while high on cocaine?Back in 1985, Andrew Thornton died from a parachuting accident while smuggling cocaine - the same cocaine a Black Bear found in the woods and ate - and this is where the film starts. We've got a dead drug smuggler, a couple out hiking, police on the hunt for where the drugs might have ended up, drug dealers trying to find the stash before the police do, a trio of teen thugs, two kids who ditched school to go paint at a waterfall and horny Ranger Liz who is put out that some woman has come along distracting her man candy by wanting to find her missing child.... all while a drugged up bear is on a killing rampage looking for more cocaine.Margot Martindale gives a standout performance as the ranger desperate for some loving. This 71 year old is proving you're never too old to star in an action movie: she's snarky, gets her ass beat by a bear and has a total inability to aim her gun and she's only mildly apologetic about it. Another scene-stealer was Christian Convery who plays the school-ditching Henry. That kid is 12 going on 40. He's having a day and he's done with it.Despite an MA15+ rating, a fair amount of the bear-related violence is off screen but they don't hold back on showing us the blood and guts of it all. Maybe that was a choice since it's a CGI bear, but sometimes less is more. Personally, I don't think it took anything away from the film not being able to watch a leg get gnawed off.If the packed cinema tonight was anything to go by, Cocaine Bear is 95 minutes of non-stop laughs with just enough flying body parts to make you cringe and one scene in particular made the guy sitting next to us cringe quite a bit. There was no missing his uncomfortable groans. I even caught my friend covering her eyes a few times. Intestines are not her cup of tea it seems and it's possible she will never trust me again when I tell her \"it's just a comedy\". Myself on the other hand, grinned from start to finish. Who doesn't love limbs flying across the screen?I loved every single minute of this movie. It's hilarious. It's got a fantastic script, acting, awesome make up work and the bear looks incredible. Elizabeth Banks is underrated as a director and I hope this film gets her some more attention in Hollywood. If not, I look forward to the rumoured Cocaine Shark film she wants to make next after New Zealand police found 3.5 tons of cocaine in the Pacific Ocean earlier this month.

This is unrelated but still) were definitely the stand out characters for me. This would be a GREAT movie to put on with friends, smoke a bowl, and watch. And maybe fall asleep towards the end. It drags a little towards the ene but if you love campy b horror movies like me and are curious about this movie, i'd say give it a watch!",

The scenes with Margo Martindale are exquisite! As is the scenes with O'Shea Jackson, and the two kids in the movie! I went in expecting a fun ride and that's exactly what we all got! The entire theater was in happy mode, laughing and enjoying. I've been to some movies with the audience doesn't get into it, but this one was not to be the case, this movie does not disappoint. Everyone living in theater had nothing but great things to say you, will not be disappointed!",

The story was good but it is not Titanic. It's a bear and cocaine and exactly what your mind is picturing right now. This movie is in that same category as Sharknado and Piranha 3D just silly gory fun.The entire theater laughed the entire time, mixed with a lot of oh no's and screams. The CGI was pretty darn good and no CGI bears were hurt in the making of this movie.Excellent cast and directed by Elizabeth Banks. I give it 10 out of 10 kilos.",

This plot was actually used before in a 1976 movie called Grizzly the only difference is the bear didn't use cocaine. This is a fairly exciting movie but the only thing is that except for that girl's mother there are not ANY likeable characters that you care a fig about! Ray Liotta was just a slimy villian and his son and the two others were just losers as well, two bit drug dealers. Those two kids were supposed to be cute but I just saw them as a couple foul mouthed brats who needed a good spanking. The CGI effects really pack a wallop and this movie does keep you on the edge of your seat at times, however, if you really want to see a good movie about bear attacks watch The Revenant OR Man In THe Wilderness.",

I was hooked after the opening sequence. This is genuinely funny (and gory), and it's definitely not your typical creature feature. I was actually intrigued by most of the characters, and while I figured most of them would die, I was rooting for many of them to live. Having so many great actors in this, you couldn't predict who would make it, like some creature movies where only the most famous people survive. Overall it was very fun to watch, and I recommend it to any fan of the genre!",

The characters were precisely the sort of individuals you would hope to see facing off against a cocaine-fueled bear. Although each character had their own set of flaws, they were still lovable, and their endeavors to escape danger were both amusing and full of suspense. The film boasted a perfect balance of humor, action, and pacing, and didn't shy away from the necessary gore when depicting bear attacks.It's highly likely that this movie will attain cult status in the future.",

            "content": "This movie was unquestionably fun. The trailer and title deliver the point effectively and the film truly brings out the fun of cinema. In a time where franchises and movies made for the box office are controlling the industry it is nice to just sit down and watch something that displays the film makers love of cinema. In terms of cinematography the film is top notch the close up shots of characters and animals is well executed. Furthermore, the long and wide shots add to the atmosphere as well as establishing the setting. These are basic details that are often lacking nowadays in film but Cocaine Bear goes above and beyond with ensuring each shot is important. The lighting of the shots was stellar and even in shots taking place at night you could see what was happening, another thing uncommon nowadays. In my opinion this film contains some bits of clunky dialogue however, more often than not the interactions between characters has superb. Musically this was the only category that was lacking as I felt the use of techno music frequently was not the best choice.Shifting to the story and plot of the film is where I feel this movie shined. There's only so much you do when the plot is a bear thats on cocaine but this film pushes the boundary. The alternation between comedic and heartfelt storylines was interesting but the most entertaining part was obviously the bear. How I can manage rooting for a bear high on over 30kgs of cocaine is beyond me but I did. The shear level of epicness surrounding scenes with the murderous bear is inexpressible.Overall this film was a refreshing watch thats worth the 1 hour 50 minutes if you want to just enjoy and have fun. The technical aspect is also top notch so the quality of the film is undebatable.",

Regarding being \"inspired by a true story\", I will equate this to Titanic - it's a fictionalized story embedded inside true elements (the plane crash, the missing cocaine, the bear that got a hold of the cocaine). For the 80s music fan, the soundtrack is very enjoyable to the ears from the opening credits to the ending credits. Very fun movie to watch. We definitely have to give kudos to Elizabeth Banks for taking on such a crazy story to direct.",

Great practical FX mixed in with CFI horror FX! The ending was a let down, it bordered hokey, and it's definitely nothing I'd call original. It's a let down, with a strong ending this movie could've been epic. There could've been a tad more carniage too! Saw this at the Alamo with Jack & Cokes & a Buttered bottomless popcorn.

The writing is top-notch, with witty jokes and clever one-liners that had me doubled over in laughter.
