            "content": "Told in flashback mostly, \"Laura\" is quintessentially a taut and atmospheric romantic mystery, in which a New York detective is investigating the murder of a beautiful woman and falling in love with her image. The plot is moody, intriguing and well constructed. I will admit I did find the ending abrupt when I first saw it, but it has grown on me, and Otto Preminger's direction is stark and suspenseful. \"Laura\" is also stylishly filmed, with breathtaking black and white cinematography, and the drama is really helped by an elegant and sophisticated screenplay and a truly haunting score from David Raksin. The casting is absolutely perfect, with the gorgeous Gene Tierney at her most entrancing in the title role and Dana Andrews commanding and authoritative in the role of detective McPherson. Also impressive are Judith Anderson's vain and silly society dame, Vincent Price's southern-accented and smarmy(handsome too) fianc\u00e9 and especially Clifton Webb as truly shifty columnist Wacko. One thing of note, the opening narrative line \"I shall never forget the night Laura died\" is one of those opening lines that will really stay with you forever. In short, \"Laura\" really is a classic and shouldn't be missed. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Laura Hunt has been murdered in a most grisly way, a shotgun blast to the face as she answered her apartment door. Dana Andrews as Detective Mark McPherson is assigned to the case and he's got a good list of suspects to work from in this up close and personal murder.Laura Hunt hung out with some real characters. Dana Andrews has a good group to choose from. There's Vincent Price who was to marry Laura, a worthless playboy who spends his life as a permanent party guest. There's Clifton Webb as the epicene critic and noted wit who was a kind of sponsor for Laura into society. There's Judith Anderson as Laura's sophisticated aunt who has a yen for Price. There's even Dorothy Adams as Bessie, Laura's lesbian maid who is carrying a titanic torch for her ex-employer.Andrews very patiently and methodically goes through the suspects. In his way he's as officious and annoying as Lieutenant Columbo on television. But he does get to the truth. Of course there's one very big surprise for him during the course of the investigation.Gene Tierney is Laura and she was a beauty in her day. Man or woman, who wouldn't be crushing out on her. This film was the first one that got Dana Andrews any real notice from the critics. And of course Clifton Webb made a screen debut in this after a long career on Broadway. Webb got an Oscar nomination for his role of Waldo Lydecker as a Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Barry Fitzgerald for Going My Way.David Raksin's musical theme for this film is one of the great ones ever done for the cinema. So popular did it prove that Johnny Mercer wrote a lyric for it after the film came out. At the time people like Frank Sinatra and Dick Haymes and a host of others rushed to record it. I guess you could classify Laura as a kind of sophisticated noir police drama. It's dialog will leave you begging for more. It's not much in the way of mystery because about a third of the way through you will realize at the same time Andrews does who the murderer is, maybe even before Andrews does. That doesn't matter though because Laura is entertaining every step of the way.",

            "review_title": "Has to be considered a classic example of film noir...",
            "content": "LAURA is, quite simply, as good as it gets as far as \"film noir\" is concerned. Aside from an interesting story, a witty script, excellent B&W photography of elegant sets and the beautiful Gene Tierney as the center of attention, it works on every level imaginable. Dana Andrews has an intriguing role as the detective drawn to the portrait of Laura after believing her dead. And Clifton Webb has his star-making role of Waldo Lydecker, the snobbish and elegant man who seems just as obsessed with the dead woman as the detective. Adding to the impressive performances are Judith Anderson and Vincent Price.\nThe only flaw seems to be that Laura herself is not as well-defined in motives and background as the other players. But Gene Tierney's mesmerizing beauty hardly makes that important. Nevertheless, she is too passive in the role and actually gave far stronger performances in films like The Razor's Edge and Leave Her to Heaven, something she herself admitted--but her looks were never used to better advantage.With several plot twists and turns, it keeps you thoroughly absorbed until it reaches its satisfying climax under Otto Preminger's knowing direction. Not to be missed, it's a classic of its kind.For a detailed look at the career of DANA ANDREWS, see my current article on him in FILMS OF THE GOLDEN AGE, Summer 2001 with a look at all of his films and many photos.",

            "content": "Alright, I confess...I hadn't got any experience with Otto Preminger-movies before I saw Laura. But, if they're all as promising as this one...I'll soon become his biggest fan for sure! A fan of Vincent Price, I was already. That was my motivation to watch Laura in the first place. I wanted to see this favorite actor of mine in a good old-fashioned and intelligent tale of mystery and murder. I got what I expected PLUS a hell of a lot more!! Laura can be summarized by using one single word: BRILLIANT! Like no other film, Laura is the perfect proof that cinema can be the purest form of art. The dialogues are superb. Every line that's being said in Laura is a highlight, every facial expression made is a stunning one. Preminger's film is Film-Noir perfection. Period. First and foremost, the story of Laura impresses you bigtime. The script is extremely intelligent and it's always one step ahead of you. There were most movies desperately TRY to fool the audience ( and fail ), Laura pulls it off without any effort. The atmosphere and design just sucks you in completely and you're overwhelmed by every surprising twist. I'm not telling anything about the plot or storyline here. It would be a shame to spoil something about this masterpiece. See it for yourself and be astonished! I am willing to write one last word about the cast, though. Laura has the most entire charismatic cast I've ever seen! Gene Tierney was an obvious choice to play the title role, I may say. She's one of the most beautiful girls who ever appeared on the big screen. It's only normal that she's in the spotlights here. Heck, I even fell in love with her myself while watching her. Clifton Webb is terrific as the men-hating critic named Waldo. His constant sarcastic remarks are a joy for all senses. And - as I said before - Vincent Price is the one who's making this film complete. Laura was shot pretty early in his well-filled career but his talent is obviously there already. Even though he grew out to become a legendary horror-icon, he certainly proves here that he could handle all kind of characters.\nGo and see Laura! See it now!! It's one of the greatest films ever made and the undeniable proof that classic cinema will always be the best. No matter who're they're trying to impress us with sound and visual aspects nowadays, nothing compares to the charm and intelligence of a good story!",

            "content": "\"Laura\" is a classic murder mystery and more.  The main characters make for a fascinating psychological study, and the movie is also filled with wit and style, in addition to a murder mystery that holds plenty of interest in its own right.The story opens with a detective (Dana Andrews) questioning suspects in the murder of popular, beautiful, and successful Laura Hunt.  As he does, we learn not only about the suspects but about Laura herself, through flashbacks.  We see Laura (Gene Tierney) develop the career and relationships that eventually led to danger, and we also learn that Laura meant something very different to each of the suspects: the snobbish, venomous writer who launched her career (Clifton Webb), the worthless playboy whom Laura was going to marry (Vincent Price, in a role quite different for him) and her rather desperate aunt (Judith Anderson).  Even the detective quickly becomes obsessed with Laura's memory.  The psychological overtones of all this add considerably to the mystery plot.The mystery story itself is quite good, with interesting details and at least one major surprise along the way.  The climax is tense and exciting, a fitting conclusion to both the mystery plot and the complex relationships among the characters.  The acting and direction are all very good, and make the most of the story's possibilities.\"Laura\" is a must-see not only for those who like mysteries, but for anyone who likes classic cinema made with style.",

            "review_title": "A perfect Noir film",
            "content": "The first time I saw this film, about eight years ago I ended up almost losing a friend because I was hoarding the VHS copy he had lent me for about two months.  After seeing it, I quite simply didn't want to give up the tape because in doing so, I wouldn't be able to watch it anytime I wanted to; and I did watch it anytime I wanted to, and often, until he threatened to call a Noir Intervention.  I may have loved this film from the first viewing, but I wasn't prepared to deal with something like that, as entertaining as it may have been.I fell in love with `Laura' because it is biting and evil, intelligent and surprising.  The unfathomably gorgeous Gene Tierney plays the title character, an advertising executive whose best friend Waldo Lydecker (played by the always wonderful Clifton Webb) and fianc\u00e9e Shelby, (a really young Vincent Price) are some of the prime suspects in her murder.  The gruff detective leading the case (Dana Andrews) is Det. McPherson, and he quickly essentially falls in love with a ghost while he is trying to solve her murder.`Laura' has one of the great Noir scripts in that just as the audience thinks they have the case solved, another curve ball is thrown at them which blows that theory out of the water.  The acting is pure delightful melodrama, but Clifton Webb's performance is simply show-stopping.  His character is a vicious snit of a writer who uses his column as a weapon against anyone he doesn't like or even tolerate.    Even upon multiple viewings I can't help but howl at some of his lines and mannerisms. \nIf anyone was to request suggestions for good Film Noir movies, I would prescribe a heavy dose of `Laura' because it has something for everyone in that it is romantic, thrilling, mysterious, wickedly funny and above all, thoroughly entertaining.  --Shelly",

            "content": "Laura A definitive film noir classic, and simply put my favorite film of all time. Laura tells the shocking story of Park Avenue society beauty, Laura Hunt ( Gene Tierney) who is murdered in her apartment, which brings Detective Mark McPherson ( Dana Andrews) to New York's most elegant neighborhood to investigate. As he tried to get inside the head of the victim, he also questions the men in her life-the acerbic critic Waldo Lydecker ( Clifton Webb) and her playboy fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter ( Vincent Price). But who would have wanted to kill a girl with whom every man she met seemed to fall in love? Fueled by her stunning portrait, liquor and classical music, McPherson quickly finds himself falling under her spell too. A police detective falling in love with the woman whose murder he's investigating? Then in one stormy night, halfway through his investigation, something so bizarre happens to him, that he is forced to re-think the whole case.This reveal still kind of leaves me guessing. Is it all a dream? Or maybe it is all formulated by the ' spell' of the movie. An alluring cast and no doubt the famous musical theme by David Raksin has something to do with it.There are so many scenes I could count as my favorite but, the one that always stands out to me is the scene where McPherson falls asleep under the portrait and he awakes with the sudden appearance of a woman who seems to be Laura Hunt herself!, dressed in a drenched trenchcoat. This entire scene is fuelled with more sexuality than Hollywood Studios these days can ever dream of in their bids to put two stars together.Another scene I love is when McPherson slugs Carpenter in the stomach. \" It's too bad. You didn't open up that door Friday night.\" I'm not kind, I'm vicious. It's the secret of my charm.\" \"You'd better watch out, McPherson, or you'll finish up in a psychiatric ward. I doubt they've ever had a patient who fell in love with a corpse.\" \"People are always ready to hold out a hand to slap you down, but never to pick you up.\" \"Waldo, why are you doing this?\" \"For you, Laura.\" \"I was 99 percent certain about you.... but I had to get rid of that one percent doubt.\"",

            "review_title": "This movie is more about style than substance..",
            "content": "... and what style it has, from its cinematography to its score, to the interesting characters to the well crafted dialogue. However, in many ways it is like \"The Big Sleep\" and \"The Maltese Falcon\", because plot point by plot point it is baffling.The body of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) is found shot point blank in the face, apparently as she opened the door to her apartment. She is an advertising executive who has risen to high society thanks to doors opened by columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who has the opening lines \"I'll never forget the weekend that Laura died..\". The third main character is a tough New York cop, Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Mark is instantly smitten with the portrait of Laura that hangs in her apartment. He is so smitten that he seems to forget all rules of evidence and police procedure. He lets a civilian and a suspect himself (Waldo) accompany him on his rounds to question other suspects and he walks all over the crime scene -heck - he practically moves in for a few days, reading Laura's private diary and letters, and drinks heavily, even in the morning, while on duty? Was Frank Drebin of Police Squad his only competition when he was promoted? While he was practically moving into Laura's home he MIGHT have asked why her housekeeper continued to come in every day when her mistress was dead. Exactly who was she cleaning up after and who was paying her? Questions unanswered and unasked.And everybody in this film is lying their heads off, seemingly to no avail. Vincent Price as the lazy, effete, amoral Shelby is deliciously funny. Why does he lie - twice - about the classical music concert he claims he attended? To what purpose? And the scene where Laura and Waldo burst in on Shelby and Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) having dinner is priceless. In fact, every scene with Price and the wonderful Judith Anderson is both funny and touching. Judith's character really loves this charming skirt chasing gold digger in spite of the fact that she sees all of his flaws. He really should follow her advice and marry her.Well then, it turns out that Laura is alive, and the very fact that she is alive makes her a suspect too. After all there WAS a killing it just wasn't her! Laura was all mystery and allure when she is just a beautiful portrait with a personality built by Waldo's words and Mark's imagination. However, the real Laura is disappointingly ordinary. Waldo does to some degree seem to be her Svengali, and he does seem to be right when he says that her doom is being attracted to any guy with a good build. Back to the lying - Laura herself lies like a carpet. What's all that nonsense about the radio? It's there, it's not there, it's broken, it's being fixed....who cares? Why does she lie about whether her radio works or not? Meanwhile, once Laura returns, Mark's attention in questioning suspects seems to be focused on whether or not Laura really loves Shelby or anybody else, in other words, does Mark have a shot with her? He acts like a schoolboy every time he gets an answer in the affirmative.How does this all work out? Watch and find out. I highly recommend this one, just don't get too wrapped up in the plot. Instead, enjoy the atmosphere and dialogue.As an aside, this was the first time Clifton Webb had been in any film since 1930, when he costarred in a Vitaphone short with radio personality Fred Allen. He refused to do a screen test from Laura's script, but did agree to be filmed doing a scene from \"The Blythe Spirit\", which was a play in which he was starring. So at age 55, from his single performance in \"Laura\", Clifton Webb was catapulted to stardom at Fox for the next 15 years.",

            "content": "Laura is another brilliant addition to Hollywood's golden age with its incredible screenplay and a great non linear narrative structure. While it might not reach the heights of Double Indemnity or The Third Man, it is still a fantastic motion picture.One thing that never seems to disappoint about ( Most of ) the classic Hollywood Film-Noirs is that they have incredible writing, and Laura is no different. The dialogue that is said is most of the time highly intellectual but shockingly coherent at the same time. This is especially the case whenever Waldo Lydecker ( Clifton Webb ) comes on screen, and his character, which is the vicious columnist, fits this poetic dialogue perfectly. ( Just look at the 'lunch' scene, or his narration near the end, or the narration where he describes Laura, as all of them have a superb screenplay ) Webb's impeccable delivery of these lines also helps ofcourse, as his performance is definitely the acting highlight of the show. Dana Andrews has the perfect face for this film noir detective kind of type, and his rugged and tough mannerisms fit perfectly for his character, although at times he might appear a bit wooden. Normally i do not care much for the outer look of women in film, but since Laura ( Gene Tierney ) is supposed to be this fascinating dame that everybody becomes obsessed with, it ofcourse helps that she is a looker, as this further enhances the immersion of the audience into the picture because it becomes relatable.The indoor set design is as per usual in the golden age in Hollywood once again stunning. The cinematography uses a lot of low key lighting to capture the sinister and mysterious feel of the film perfectly, and the decoration of the sets is very elegantly created, with a lot of classic baubles in the background so the audience has enough to see in every shot in the entire film. The narrative is top notch, as it uses unpredictable twists and flashbacks created to enhance our relationship to the characters a bit more so we know what they were like before the 'murder'. Not a lot of characters are likeable, but those that are not likeable are so in a way that they still feel as if they were real people to which this is happening to. It is also a wonderful study on compulsive obsession ( The ending will show you why ) and man's nature to make rash decisions for the sake of love. It does seem to be a bit too hasty near its final couple of minutes, but this is a slight issue that a lot of Hollywood films from this era seem to have. The haste is only there for the ending though, as the rest of the film is still executed wonderfully. The movie has the suspense in its narrative to keep the audience extremely interested in how its final events will unfold, and this creates a non stop thrill ride along the way.Never does Laura insult our intelligence with obvious things, and instead it respects the audience's intelligence since every character seems to be highly intelligent in it, and the unpredictability of it further enhances this. It also has fantastic acting performances ( Especially Clifton Webb ) and a superb screenplay. Although the ending might seem to sudden, this still makes for a beautifully crafted Film Noir.",

In this one Gene Tierney is the mysterious \"murder victim.\" Because she has been violently murdered and has touched so many lives, she becomes bigger than life. People reminisce about their connections to her. The detective who has never met her, begins to fall in love with what she was and with her beauty. Her romantic connection, Vincent Price, in all his wolfish, threatening glory, is mourning her passing. The key is that since Laura died of a shotgun blast to the face there are implications that must be realized. As things thicken, certain questions about reality, as it relates to her associations, begin to surface and questions are ripe for investigation. The darkness of this movie makes it sparkle and that haunting theme that is played throughout adds to the atmosphere. Good film noir requires a sort of sober being about it, characters who are potentially dangerous, and even the possibility that those whom we initially respect being a part of the darkness.

            "review_title": "The crafty Preminger's coded, high-style murder mystery hasn't lost its perdurable appeal",
            "content": "Rashomon-like, Vera Caspary's clever suspense novel Laura falls into  five sections and five separate voices, telling its story from the  viewpoint of each of its principal characters. It was too cumbersome a  structure for a 1940s mystery, so the script (by Jay Dratler and  others) simplifies and concentrates the narrative for director Otto  Preminger to play with.   Judith Anderson as Laura's aunt Ann Treadwell, a vain and silly society  dame, and Vincent Price as Shelby Carpenter, a 'male beauty in  distress' and on-again, off-again paramour both to Treadwell and to  Laura, find themselves demoted to supporting players (if still a couple  of satisfyingly kippered herring). Caspary's pentacle gets rejigged  into an old-fashioned triangle, with viper-tongued newspaper columnist  Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) and wise-mouthed police  detective-lieutenant Mark MacPherson (Dana Andrews) locking horns over  the elusive Laura (Gene Tierney).  Elusive isn't the half of it. For the first half of the movie, she's  presumed dead, her face obliterated by a load of buckshot when she  answered the door of her apartment one stifling Friday night in New  York City. MacPherson's on the track of her killer and pieces together  her story: How through brains and determination (not to mention looks)  she rose in the advertising industry, how she met the powerful Lydecker  by seeking his endorsement for a fountain pen (first meeting a rebuff  on the grounds that he writes with 'a goose quill dipped in venom'),  how they became a high-profile, May-December couple in Manhattan  society. But to Lydecker's sniffy chagrin, Laura didn't see herself as  his exclusive chattel. There were other men: The painter who did her  portrait that hangs over her fireplace, for instance (out of spite,  Lydecker demolished him in the press), and then the indolent hulk  Carpenter.  MacPherson learns most of this while interviewing Lydecker in his bath,  where the feared and lionized wordsmith fashions his prose on a  typewriter perched atop a trestle across his marble tub ('It's lavish  but I call it home'). With his imperious \u0096 queenly \u0096 airs, Webb takes  his performance as Lydecker into a rarefied realm that can't have  failed to register even in 1944, that of the closeted, elegant  gentleman critic using the glamorous Laura as his beard (it's a  dimension that was far fainter in the novel). But his full-tilt camping  makes his desperate obsession with Laura \u0096 if taken at face value \u0096 too  perfumed a lozenge to swallow.  MacPherson's obsession, however, looks like the real McCoy. The  testimonials to her beauty, her vibrancy, her elegance start to work on  him, until he finds himself holed up at the crime scene \u0096 her apartment  \u0096 gazing at her portrait while drinking himself into a trance (to David  Raskin's entrancing title song) and falling asleep in her armchair. (As  Lydecker puts it, he's fallen in love with a corpse.) When he awakens,  it's to find Laura, come back from the dead \u0096 actually from her country  place where she's spent the weekend, oblivious to her supposed murder.  (The victim turns out to be a model who worked at her agency.)   Laura's eerie reemergence reactivates all the tensions and antagonisms  slackened, or frozen, by her presumed death. With Laura now among the  living, Lydecker finds in MacPherson a more formidable \u0096 'disgustingly  earthy' \u0096 rival than the penniless playboy Carpenter, while MacPherson  finds himself working not on a remote case but seeking the perpetrator  of the attempted murder of a woman he's infatuated with (who, since  there was in fact a corpse, finds herself a suspect as well)....   One of the more perdurable movies of the 1940s, Laura nonetheless  remains perplexing. Set in the upper-crust New York of terraced  penthouses and chic bo\u00eetes and the Algonquin Hotel (where Lydecker's  prototype, Alexander Woolcott, held court at the fabled Round Table),  it gives off more than a whiff of the Gothic, of tales set on the moors  or craggy seacoasts. (Echoes of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca abound,  above and beyond the presence of Judith Anderson, as do those of a more  contemporary New York story, I Wake Up Screaming). It's a stylish and  stylized murder mystery that finds the tangled liaisons among its  characters more absorbing than what clues may be hidden inside the  grandfather's clock.   Those characters have been written off as superficial, and their  liaisons as implausible, a point which carries some validity. The  making of the movie was troubled, with producer Darryl Zanuck replacing  Rouben Mamoulian with Preminger, then clashing with Preminger over his  casting of the flamboyantly gay Broadway star Webb. Preminger was a  shrewd and worldly man who surely knew how Webb would 'read' even to  audiences in the boondocks (not to mention his casting of Price and  Anderson, two more actors about whom rumors persist). So there's little  getting around the fact that Laura stands as what has come to be called  a 'coded' movie, brimming with subtext.   But coded how? Preminger saw his movie as less about heterosexual  passion gone homicidal than about a superficial culture of celebrity  and hype and image. Lydecker's obsession was not so much with Laura's  flesh as with fantasy \u0096 a rising star to which he could he hitch his  jaded wagon. He's a demented fan who fancies that only his own  enthusiasm and puffery make her shine. It's the only version of reality  that the narcissistic, grandiose Lydecker can accept, with himself as  both creator and custodian of her legend. It was the world Laura, too,  occupied and enjoyed, if fitfully, a world which she departed for  meatier trysts, albeit with lovers who lived in the same fairyland of  ritzy illusion. Until she met (and almost too late) MacPherson, a prole  without affectation who came to love her as a physical organism rather  than as a creature of publicity, a fabulous freak of the zeitgeist.   Under a veneer of arch sophistication (aptly captured by director of  photography Joseph LaShelle), Preminger found an affirmation of bedrock  American values. But he burrowed into that bedrock by the most oblique  and unlikely of routes, having himself a great deal of perverse fun  along the way. As crafty in his own way as Caspary was in hers,  Preminger managed to satisfy wartime ticket-buyers, and he continues to  satisfy decadent cin\u00e9astes six decades later.",

            "review_title": "One of Otto Preminger's best",
            "content": "This is film noir played in part as a comedy of manners. (Incidentally, a comedy of manners gets its name from the satirical possibilities in the differing class views on proper behavior--manners--exploited by playwrights to the delight of an audience placed in a superior position--they think--of social discernment. Here we can see the differentials, but they are not played for comedic effect.)Gene Tierney (at twenty-four) stars as Laura Hunt, a beautiful career girl who, as the picture opens, has been murdered. (Shot in face with a double barreled shotgun, a point of information not dwelled on by director Otto Preminger. Today's directors, of course, would have begun with a full facial shot of the corpse.) Dana Andrews is the leading man, playing Mark McPherson, a hard-boiled police detective with a soft heart. Vincent Price, who before he became a maven of horror, was actually a soft-spoken, hunkish ladies man, plays Shelby Carpenter, who could afford to have his reputation blemished, but not his clothes. He is a man about town who would fit nicely into a British comedy of manners at the turn of the nineteenth century.But the surprising star is Clifton Webb who plays Waldo Lydecker, venomous columnist and radio personality, who against his first impressions, falls madly (and of course hopelessly) in love with Laura and becomes her mentor. This was before the genteel and very precise veteran of the musical stage was Mr. Belvedere, and before his triumph in Cheaper by the Dozen (1950), that is to say, before he was typecast as an irascible but lovable middle aged man--but not before his fiftieth birthday; strange how the fortunes of actors may go. By the way, George Sanders's Oscar-winning performance as the cynical critic in All About Eve (1950), owes something to Webb's work here.The strength of the movie is in the intriguing storyline featuring surprising but agreeable plot twists, and especially in the fine acting by Webb, Andrews, Tierney and Price. Webb in particular is brilliant. I think this is another example of Otto Preminger getting a lot more out of his actors than he is usually given credit for. See Anatomy of a Murder 1959, starring James Stewart and Lee Remick, for another example. Known for turning commercial novels into commercial movies (e.g., The Man with the Golden Arm (1955); Exodus (1960); Advise and Consent (1962)) Preminger is at his best when he lets the material have its way. I call that the invisible style of directing and he follows it here. Add the beautiful score by David Raksin and this movie is a special treat.As a mystery however it is a little predictable. We know from the beginning not only who will get the girl, but with a very high probability who pulled the trigger. What we don't know in the first case is how, since she is presumably dead, and in the second case, why. The lack of motive hides the killer's identity from us. But rest assured, all is unraveled in the final reel.See this for Clifton Webb whose improbable Hollywood success, beginning with this movie, started when he was in his fifties and ended when he was in his sixties. If I were a thirty-year-old actor running to auditions, I would call that inspiration.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "When the famous advertising executive Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) is found dead in her apartment shot by a shotgun in a Friday night, Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is in charge of the investigations. He interviews the prime suspects and friends of Laura: the snob and arrogant journalist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) that promoted Laura in the beginning of her career and felt in love with her; and her fianc\u00e9, the playboy Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). While investigating the past of Laura through her diary and personal letters, Det. McPherson falls in love with her. The mystery increases when Laura returns home on Monday night and also becomes a suspect of the murder.I have just seen \"Laura\" for the first time in an imported VHS, and I found it a great film-noir. The screenplay is very consistent, with a good development of the characters, and very mysterious, with many twists, suspects and motives. In my opinion, the desirable \"Gilda\" has some characteristics of \"Laura\", mostly because everybody falls in love with her, and Gene Tierney is perfect in her role. Clifton Webb is amazing, performing the sophisticated and also disgusting Waldo Lydecker and certainly deserved his nomination to the Oscar. Vincent Price, very young, and Dana Andrews complete the efficient cast. The direction of Otto Preminger is precise and excellent as usual. The magnificent black-and-white cinematography deserved the Oscar, and the music score is also wonderful. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Laura\"Note: On 23 April 2012, I saw this magnificent film again.",

It's quite a unique movie from the legendary Otto Preminger, who took over from the original director and started from scratch. Gene Tierney plays the title character, a woman who seems to bewitch every man she meets. It's no wonder because Tierney is mesmerizing to watch. I think she could well be the most beautiful actress of all time. Dana Andrews, Vincent Price and Clifton Webb play the three men in Laura's life. Andrews ('Night Of The Demon') plays a detective investigating Laura's apparent murder, Price, years before becoming a horror icon, a gigolo type who is due to marry her, and Webb (best known as Mr. Belvedere) is a snobby columnist and wit who is Laura's mentor. All four actors are just terrific and the plot is full of twists and surprises. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. 'Laura' is one of the very best Hollywood movies of the 1940s.

            "content": "Empty pleasure.I thought of ending this review there, but Dana Andrews deserves more.Laura is a whodunit with a sort of surreal happy ending, and enough twists and pretend twists and twists on twists to make you give up guessing and just watch. It's not such a good thing to have the movie control the facts so that we can't participate in solving the mystery, not really. I know I gave up on this one easier than other people, and for me, the second time, not remembering who did do it, I still gave up on the guessing game. But there is more here than that, by far. Just start watching as a start. Very smartly staged and photographed (LaShelle, masterfully), and with strong, clean performances, mostly from the demurring detective played by Dana Andrews (better known for his performance in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\"), watching is easy. The long scene two thirds through, where Andrews is alone in the posh apartment brooding, considering, puzzling, and possibly falling further in love with the dead Gene Tierney of the title role, is a little masterpiece of careful, restrained movie-making. As if to confirm his feelings (and really make the movie perk up), this is where he has a glass of whiskey, falls asleep, and wakes to see Laura standing there like a mirage or an angel. Or a mistake. Laura, the supposedly dead main character we had seen only in flashbacks. From here it takes us on a circuitous wrapping up and we sort of know what will happen, though still don't know how to guess who may have done it.There might be some issues of confusion not intended--a plot this precise and interwoven begs for nitpicking. Watch the final big party scene with all the suspects gathered, where Andrews accuses, implicitly, Laura herself. Does she panic? No. If she wants us to think she did it (killed the model in her clothes), wouldn't she worry that she would go down by mistake? Isn't the electric chair a lot to risk? And then there is the clock, and Andrews smashing the bottom panel. Shortly later, a replacement panel is perfectly in place. Is this just good police cabinetry? Did I miss something about the second clock (there is an exact match somewhere)? Finally, we would all like to know how Laura could afford such a spectacular (and not very attractive) apartment on her working woman's salary. No one besides Andrews is especially admirable or evil as a character here. And as actors, no one is especially amazing or awful, either, professional competence begetting the unexceptional. Of note: Vincent Price, a cult favorite, is strained as a chipper disingenuous boyfriend. And potential killer. Clifton Webb, is pretty amazing as a disdainful local writer. And potential killer. His verbal barbs are cutting and hilarious all the way through.This is a quirky murder mystery, a little cutting edge for its time, and yet without social or psychological compensations. Like a Hitchcock thriller, we have intrigue and surprise, but unlike Hitchcock, there is too much composure and glint. And that painfully recurring theme song, which became a hit. This is somehow a great movie, but a flawed great movie.",

            "content": "Shooting commenced 24 April 1944 under the direction of Rouben Mamoulian. Preminger produced, Lucien Ballard photographed, Rene Hubert designed the costumes, while James Basevi and (probably) Joseph C. Wright designed the sets. Tom Dudley was assistant director. Although Preminger himself had initiated the project, working with Jay Dratler on the first draft of the script and then hiring Hoffenstein and Reinhardt (\"Hoffenstein practically created the role of Waldo Lydecker for Clifton Webb\"), and casting Webb (his first sound film) and Dana Andrews against Zanuck's choices of Laird Cregar and John Hodiak, Mamoulian insisted on total control. Preminger was banned from the set. The dailies were so disappointing, Zanuck asked Mamoulian to re-shoot. The second set were if anything worse than the first: \"The performances were appalling\u0085 the sets and costumes totally wrong for a contemporary story.\" In mid-May, Mamoulian was fired and Zanuck allowed Preminger to take over direction. Preminger fired Ballard and brought in La Shelle (until near that time a first cameraman with only Happy Land as a fully-fledged photographic credit) as director of photography. Bonnie Cashin who had worked with Preminger on his previous film In the Meantime, Darling was assigned to re-design the costumes. (\"The wardrobe Miss Cashin created for Laura was in marked contrast to the over-dressing so common in American films of the 40's. This was a natural antidote to wartime austerity, but it meant that the films often looked ludicrous in retrospect. Bonnie Cashin never fell into this trap and the clothes for Laura do not look out of place today.\"). Laura completed shooting on 29 June 1944 \u2014 but Preminger's troubles were still not over. Zanuck did not like the ending and insisted on dictating a new one of his own. Preminger shot the revised ending from 15 July to 20 July 1944. Water Winchell, however, was not impressed and suggested to Zanuck that the ending be re-shot. Zanuck restored Preminger's original conclusion. Preminger even invited him to visit the set and work on the score while Laura was shooting.I have not read the Caspary novel, but I am told it lacks a great deal of the sparkle and sophistication of the scenario \u2014 particularly in the Waldo Lydecker character. Such comeuppances as Waldo's acid retort to Laura's professed admiration of the warmth and humanity expressed in his newspaper column \u2014 \"Sentiment comes easy at fifty cents a word!\" \u2014 are not to be found in the original. This confirms Preminger's declaration that Hoffenstein virtually created the character for Webb. Mind you, the actor is absolutely magnificent. Few actors have burst upon the screen with a part so meaty, so well-tailored, so unforgettable as to make the rest of their career seem a slow, gradually-descending post-climax. It's a tribute to Preminger's acumen and tenacity that he insisted on casting Webb despite the objections of Zanuck and Zanuck's yes-man, casting director Rufus LeMaire.Dana Andrews also throughout his long later career never had a role so perfectly tailored to his taciturn, somewhat expressionless but ploddingly persistent personality (though he came close a couple of times, particularly when he was re-united with Tierney and Preminger for Where the Sidewalk Ends in which he plays a cop named Mark Dixon).Gene Tierney is also perfectly cast, perfectly coached \u2014 just right as the unsophisticated yet glamour-seeking ing\u00e9nue \u2014 the willing Galatea (and stooge) to Webb's persuasive Pygmalion.Judith Anderson has also rarely had a Hollywood role she was able to play with such characteristic verve and force. Only the memorable Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca excels her characterization in Laura.\"Laura\" is a murder mystery so intense, so powerfully evocative in mood, atmosphere and both inner and outer character conflict and tension, it can be seen again and again with no diminution of interest \u2014 so fascinating are the people and the backgrounds, so witty, polished and sophisticated is the dialogue.",

Dana Andrews is well cast as Mark MacPherson, the handsome, no nonsense detective assigned to unravel the case.Clifton Webb is superb as Waldo Lydecker, Laura's mentor and an egocentric, effeminate newspaper columnist who has made a career of eliminating Laura's prospective suitors. Lydecker detests Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a southern playboy to whom Laura is engaged. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson) is Laura's aunt who, incidentally, is in love with Carpenter herself.As MacPherson sorts through the motives and alibis, he finds Laura too bewitches him. In one of the most memorable movie scenes of all time, Dana Andrews gives an intense performance of a man driven to distraction by the story of Laura, her letters, private diary, perfume, and hauntingly lovely portrait above the fireplace. Clearly agitated, he takes a drink as he sits in a chair beneath Laura's portrait. He falls asleep, and the audience is left wondering if his dreams of Laura are coming true, as she appears through the doorway. He awakens and rises from the chair, his soul shaken by the sight of Laura alive.This intriguing story, combined with Clifton Webb's biting quips, Gene Tierney's beauty and elegance, Dana Andrews' intensity and dark good looks, and Vincent Price's sense of humor, makes this film immensely watchable again and again.",

            "content": "Like WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION and other favorite films of mine, discovering who really dunnit doesn't spoil LAURA's enjoyment on repeat viewings; instead, paying closer attention to the real killer the next time you watch makes you realize all the clues to their true nature that you were having too much fun to catch the first time around. For example, when you re-watch Clifton Webb as waspish columnist Waldo Lydecker during his flashback-laden dinner conversation with Dana Andrews' Lt. Mark McPherson about Gene Tierney's Laura Hunt, you suddenly realize how truly obsessed and self-centered Lydecker really is. Note that everything he says about Laura really ends up being more about him than about her: \"...she deferred to my tastes...the way she listened (to me) was more eloquent than speech...\", etc. Though Webb steals the show with his Oscar-nominated performance and viciously witty lines (if I start quoting Webb's best lines, I'll pretty much be transcribing every word out of his mouth), the whole cast hits all the right notes in Otto Preminger's spellbinding adaptation of Vera Caspary's novel, with Vincent Price and Judith Anderson memorable as two of the wolves-in-chic-clothing in Laura's circle, and Andrews and Tierney's chemistry sending sparks flying even before they actually share the screen after the Act 2 twist. Tierney is quite convincing as a sophisticated yet soft-hearted young woman whose kindness almost does her in; as Andrews aptly points out, \"For a charming, intelligent girl, you've certainly surrounded yourself with a remarkable collection of dopes.\" Webb and LAURA's screenwriters re-teamed later for the similar THE DARK CORNER, which might as well be called LAURA 2 -- and I mean that as a compliment! :-)",

            "content": "I was rather enjoying this movie as I was watching it, but I found myself dissatisfied with the ending, and the more I think about the film, the more flawed it seems to be. My main complaints are plot holes and character inconsistencies.o Laura is portrayed as a quite intelligent woman. So what does she see in Shelby? Everybody else has figured out this guy is a shallow, lying loser. How does she not see through him? Why hasn't the aunt long since opened her eyes? We know that the aunt sees right through him, and what's more she wants him for herself.o For that matter, what does she see in Waldo? She hates his cold, arrogant personality at the start, and he does little to hide it the rest of the way. You'd think, gratitude or not, he would have rubbed her the wrong way much, much sooner.o What on EARTH was Shelby doing fooling around with the model in the first place? He was clearly dabbling with the aunt for the money, OK. He had a sweetheart deal with her, so why was he sacrificing it to marry Laura? The only reasonable answer is that he actually really did love Laura. OK. So what *possible* reason does he have for risking *both* of them to trifle with this poor, unimportant (and not even that great looking) model?o Explain to me again why on earth he took the model to *Laura's* apartment? And dressed her up in Laura's negligee? And why the model went along with this? This is crucial to the plot yet barely touched on.o MOST DAMNING: Why, why, why would Waldo go kill Laura (the first time) that Friday night, *when he was on the cusp of victory*??? He already knew that she was going to take the weekend to decide if she was going to break off the engagement to Shelby, and it sure seemed likely that she was going to. All evidence was that he was succeeding in breaking up that marriage, so the \"If I can't have her, nobody will!\" motive makes NO SENSE!!!Aside from these plot holes and character inconsistencies, I had three other complaints.First off, the best moment of the film was completely marred for me by bad film making. That is the moment when Laura comes back and we find out she's still alive. The way the scene was shot, I was *absolutely sure* that this was a dream sequence, and not really happening. It took me quite a while to readjust my thinking and go along with it all being real. And I was still half-expecting it to turn out to all have been a dream, up to the end of the movie. Turns out, I was right. From what I've read, there originally *was* supposed to be an it-was-all-a-dream ending, that was scrapped. Which is fine, the movie is better if she really were still alive and all. But that scene should've been re-shot without the detective falling asleep like that. As it stands, it's just clumsy and confusing.And then there's Laura herself. She's certainly beautiful. But the character just didn't come off to me as being this amazingly magnificent woman. It's hard to buy why everyone is so obsessed over her. She seems pretty ordinary, frankly. I guess the problem was that she failed to make *me* fall in love with her, and so it didn't resonate with me when everybody else did. I agree with what someone else said, that she worked better as a painting than a character.Finally, I found the ending disappointing. At the moment that the detective announces he's about to make an arrest, we had a pretty nicely tangled web, with some reasons to suspect every character, yet also reasons to doubt. I actually paused the movie at that point to consider the possibilities. I imagined various combinations of possible conspiracies and alliances between various characters, less obvious motives, surprises. I was hoping for and expecting something much more clever and interesting than just that old-sourpuss did it.So there you have it. My strongest emotion is disappointment. And the usual bewilderment at the people who gush over this movie. It's a shame, because, handled better, this really could have been an excellent film.",

            "content": "I guess LAURA will always make the top ten list of film noir because of it's wit and cast - in particular one actor who demonstrated a waspishness that had not been seen before in film except by his fellow homosexual actor Monty Wooley. I am speaking, of course, of Clifton Webb, who had been a great Broadway star of the 1920s and 1930s, and then (when that career began to peter out) got the nod to play Waldo Lydecker, and became a fixture of the movies from 20th Century Fox from 1944 to 1960 or so.Webb's carrying off the film's notices (except for general approval of the work of Otto Preminger as director) is ironic because the film's name centers on it's heroine: Laura, played by Gene Tierney. She is a career woman - a talented artist and advertising copy creator, who becomes a leading model - a fictional counterpart to say Grace Kelly a few years later. She does this when she gains the hard attention of Lydecker (who initially rejects her attempts to talk to him) but he has second thoughts. Later he admits it's due to his sexual fascination with her.The problem for Waldo is, of course, that no matter how much passion he does feel for Laura, he doesn't have the physical wherewithal to get an equal reaction from her. She sees him as a fine mentor and friend, but nothing else. And he feels this rejection keenly - too keenly. Today, a film version would show the sexual confusion of the man, as his personality shows his homosexual leanings (they crop up occasionally towards Dana Andrews' McPherson, who seems to have a muscularity that fascinates Waldo), and his definite wish to consummate with Laura. Poor fellow - it just was impossible.Yet it might have worked - a so-called \"white marriage\" like that of Cole and Linda Porter (close friendship, but going their own ways sexually). When looking over Laura's attempts at a heterosexual boy-friend, Jacoby the artist (whom Waldo maliciously destroys in his newspaper column) and later Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) we see she wants a masculine hero. A case can be made, by the way, that Laura's interest in Jacoby was mere amusement (we see her enjoying Waldo's column attack in the newspaper). As for Shelby, whatever was wrong with Waldo he certainly saw through the socialite as the questionable type he really was. In fact, McPherson ends up thoroughly agreeing on this with Waldo and in a physical way.The film (as it is now) gave her Dana Andrew's detective. He, it is, who rescues her in the end. But there will be a price. Leslie Halliwell, in discussing the film, pointed out that Waldo (whatever his feelings about rivals) respected Laura's true talents, and would have always encouraged her there, and assisted her in developing them. Andrew's McPherson expected his \"dame\" wife would be at home, cooking, cleaning, and (presumably) being ready for sex. Halliwell ended his discussion suggesting that Laura would have ended up missing Waldo's personality and support terribly.Curiously enough, the original film would have been quite different in it's resolution. McPherson goes back to Laura's apartment after he first meets all the suspects, and he sits on a sofa looking at her picture. He is supposed to meet Waldo, coming to assist on the investigation. The next forty minutes or so of the film is the heart of it, leading to the tragic conclusion as it now exists. But in the original script, we see McPherson being awaken by Waldo shaking him on the sofa. McPherson had dreamed the entire story the audience saw. He leaves with Waldo to jointly try to find the killer (presumably it would have had to be Shelby). Whether or not it would have led to a \"beautiful friendship\" between effete newspaper/radio personality and detective is doubtful, but it probably would have led to some mutual sympathy.",

            "content": "I have often heard of this film referred to as being a \"Film Noir\" flick, but that is debatable. While the movie is about a woman who was murdered with a shotgun and does feature Dana Andrews as a snappy-talking cop, the movie seemed too polished (with lovely music and production values) and sophisticated to be true Noir. Now this ISN'T to say this is a bad film or it was overly sanitized--it just isn't exactly the gritty and dark film that true Film Noir seems to be.The film is about the murder of a young woman and its subsequent investigation. The film actually has very few characters, but those who appear in the film did a wonderful job. Dana Andrews, as always, plays very capably as a detective who is perhaps too involved in the case. Vincent Price plays a somewhat sleazy and contemptible fianc\u00e9. Clifton Webb plays the most complex and strange character--a fastidious misanthrope (\"hater of mankind\") who, in some ways, seems both obsessively attached to her with perhaps a hint of homosexuality or asexuality. As I said, he was a truly complex and unusual man in the film--sort of like a crazed and even nastier version of \"Mr. Belvedere\". And, of course, there is Gene Tierney as \"Laura\"--a lovely and sophisticated woman who is the object of the three men's desire.The plot is both intriguing and offers some dandy twists and character studies. Producer/director Preminger did a marvelous job with the script and was able to take a simple idea and make the most of it. A fine film--one of the better ones of the 1940s and, with the possible exceptions of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN and THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR, the best thing Ms. Tierney ever did.By the way, the new Fox DVD is exceptional. In addition to the film, the extras make it a real value. In addition to one additional scene, the DVD packs two shows from the excellent A&E Biography series narrated by Peter Graves--one on the tragic life of Gene Tierney and the other on Vincent Price. This is great, but in a perfect world there also would have been one on Dana Andrews (his private life is fascinating and pretty tragic also)--but I can't blame Fox, as the extras were already a lot more than I had hoped for.",

            "content": "In addition to being a fascinating story and a compelling murder mystery, \"Laura\" employs a technique I've never seen before in a movie. There's a dream sequence in which the dreamer, Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) suddenly wakes up and sees the dead woman who's murder he's investigating. For a moment this viewer, (and I suspect most) found it a little disorienting trying to figure out if the dream is still under way or something more mysterious is about to be revealed. I thought that was just a brilliant way of moving the story forward without resorting to more mundane conventions.Interestingly, this movie has many Hitchcockian elements without the fabled director's name attached to it. It's a clever noir story that replaces the title character at the center of a murder mystery with a stand-in who we learn about but never see via Detective McPherson's careful analysis. Thinking about it now, one might consider that Diane Redfern's disappearance should have raised a red flag at some point, but the story's compact time frame over a couple of days allows one to overlook it.Each time I see Gene Tierney, I become firmer of the opinion that she's one of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies of all time. No wonder her character here held such sway over a variety of men, including the detective who finds himself falling in love with a 'dead' woman. Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are well cast for their roles here, but the real surprise for me was Clifton Webb, a stage actor tapped for the part of columnist Waldo Lydecker, he of poisonous wit and equally poisonous pen. Ultimately, though his revelation as the killer comes across as entirely reasonable, the film crafts an intriguing story in which any of the main players could have been the perpetrator.Turner Classic film host Robert Osborne calls \"Laura\" the perfect murder mystery. I don't know if I'd go that far because with a limited number of suspects, one is able to arrive at the same correct conclusion as McPherson. What you do have though is an engaging story and believable characters that make a seventy year old film as fresh as if it were made today.",

            "review_title": "Of Love, Murder and Obsession",
            "content": "It's a classic tale of love, murder and obsession, when a homicide detective becomes enamored of the victim of a brutal murder he's investigating, in `Laura,' directed by Otto Preminger and starring Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews.  The story begins with the discovery of the murder of Laura Hunt (Tierney), a young advertising executive in New York City, and as detective Mark McPherson (Andrews) makes his investigation and begins to fit together the pieces of the puzzle of Laura's life and death, the essence of who she was begins to emerge.  And it gives the story an interesting twist; for after seeing a portrait of Laura, and getting to know her by reading her most intimate personal letters and diary (routine for a murder investigation), McPherson becomes obsessed with her, and soon discovers he's not alone; there was another man obsessed with her as well.  Subsequently, he must determine if that obsession played any part in Laura's death. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe suspects include the men in her life, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a radio personality/columnist who helped her begin her career, and Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), her fiance, a man of seemingly dubious character who had recently been involved with a model who worked for Laura's agency.  The list doesn't end with them, however; also in the running is a man named Jacoby (John Dexter), the artist who painted the portrait of Laura that so mesmerized McPherson, and then there's some question as to the relationship between a certain Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and Carpenter that is yet to be resolved.  \tPreminger delivers a solid mystery that will keep you in suspense until the very end, but with only enough tension to keep it interesting rather than engrossing.  And though the story is believable, there are elements of the plot that develop so quickly it stretches credibility a bit.  An additional two or three scenes relating to certain aspects of the characters lives (especially Laura's) would have had a significant impact of this film-- good as it is-- and with a running time of 85 minutes (on most prints) it wouldn't have been out of the question to expand it somewhat.\tAs far as the characters, McPherson, Lydecker and Carpenter emerge fully sketched and need little development; you know exactly who they are and where they've been.  This is not the case with Laura, however; Tierney's character suffers somewhat from lack of development, and as the story unfolds, she seems to get from here to there with little discernible change. What the character needed was a bit more depth and some real definition.\tWhich is exactly what Andrews and Webb give to their characters; Webb as the flamboyant and self-assured Lydecker, Andrews as the stoic and deliberating McPherson.  Price gives a notable performance, as well, but has a tendency to lapse into melodrama occasionally, which can be distracting at times.  And Tierney gives a passable performance, though her acting is not on a par with her exquisite beauty.  In her initial encounter with Lydecker, for instance, her pronounced coyness is somewhat diverting.  Still, her presence on the screen is radiant, which makes it easy to overlook the slight flaws in her acting.  \tThe supporting cast includes Dorothy Adams (Bessie), Cy Kendall (Inspector), Grant Mitchell (Lancaster Corey), Buster Miles (Office Boy) and Frank La Rue (Hairdresser).  A good mystery, but with few surprises, `Laura' nevertheless remains a classic in it's own right.  It's not a perfect film (the final words spoken, in fact, are decidedly melodramatic), but it's good storytelling, and is ultimately satisfying.  Saying that there was room for improvement would be nit-picking; suffice to say that it is what it is, which is a pretty good movie.  I rate this one 7/10.",

            "review_title": "A Study in the Destructive Effects of Narcissism",
            "content": "Otto Preminger's classic film noir paints such a cynical portrait of mid-Forties New York that it's difficult to identify any redemptive points.Living in a bubble-like world of parties, social rituals and other high-society occasions, the protagonists have little or no understanding either of themselves or their fellow human-beings. The tone is set in the initial encounter between Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), and Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney) that takes place in New York's Algonquin Hotel, the site of the famed Round Table that flourished two decades prior to the film's release. The allusion is a suggestive one: Waldo displays all the cutting wit, narcissism and sheer cruelty associated with his illustrious contemporary Alexander Wollcott (who had passed away a year before the film's release). Both men reveled in their celebrity and made extensive use of it to manipulate others.Walso treats Laura as a Pygmalion-like figure to be molded according to his whims. However things start to get rough when Laura displays a penchant for branching out on her own, most notably by planning to marry feckless socialite Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). The rivalry produced thereby provides the mainspring of the story. Add to that a vicious cameo by Judith Anderson as Ann Treadwell, Laura's supposed \"confidante\" who would drop her like a stone if necessary, and we have the ingredients for a murder mystery that twists and turns towards its unexpected denouement.What perhaps renders this film so memorable is its use of symbolism. Waldo has a penchant for writing his articles in the bath; totally unfazed about his nakedness, he seems completely confident in himself. In public, however, he makes sure that every item of clothing is in place; the tie matters as much as anything else. Through such rituals Preminger suggests the importance of outward show; what matters is not what people think, but what they appear to think. All of the four protagonists - including Laura - resemble empty vessels, devoid of moral scruples and totally committed to maintaining their sophisticated facade in high society. If one of them should be accused of the murder, it doesn't really matter, as they would simply hire the best attorney to exonerate them.Yet Preminger simultaneously suggests that their days are numbered, through the repeated use of ticking clocks on the soundtrack. A clock plays an important part in the denouement; but on other occasions we hear it as an accompaniment to the dialogue, suggesting some kind of impending doom. However badly the characters might behave, they have to face the day of reckoning at the end, and none of them are prepared to acknowledge this.As the eponymous heroine, Tierney might be considered an innocent victim of male machination, but as the action unfolds, we see that she is as manipulative as anyone else. She ends up falling in love with investigating officer Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), but we have little faith in the relationship's future. She is as willing to sacrifice her loved ones as anyone else.LAURA is a highly uncomfortable film in spite of its memorable theme (by David Raksin). We feel as if we have been unwillingly thrust into a nest of vipers and are mighty relieved to escape.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Some movies from the 1940's remain fun to watch for mostly nostalgia reasons. Others still hold up well today and can be enjoyed for the story, script, acting and production value. Director Otto Preminger's Laura falls easily into the latter category. This quasi-film noir, murder mystery, creepy love story is based on the novel from Vera Caspary is probably more respected today than when it was released ... 5 Oscar nominations, but not one for Best Picture.To fully appreciate the film, it helps to know the tortured back story. This was always Otto Preminger's baby, but Daryl Zanuck initially chose a different cast, a different director and a different ending. In the end, Preminger (Anatomy of a Murder) won all of his battles - directing Gene Tierney with the ending he wanted (thanks to Walter Winchell). TCM's Robert Osborne correctly states that the film has one of the best opening lines: \"I shall never forget the weekend Laura died\". The line is spoken by narrator Waldo Lydecker (great screen name) played by the elegant Clifton Webb.Playing out as mostly a murder investigation led by the detective (Dana Andrews), we are treated to a stream of unusual story choices and only one scene at the police station ... a terrific interrogation scene. Instead, we spend the entire movie on the turf of rich, high society types. There are at least four credible murder suspects and they are strung along by a mostly monotone detective, who only flashes personality on his date night with the dead girl's portrait (well, that's how it plays!) and when he is messing with a pocket baseball toy.Gene Tierney plays the titular Laura, and every time she appears on screen her startling beauty distracts us ... just as it does the other characters in the film. Tierney was only 23 years old when this was filmed, and a couple years later she had a romance with young John F Kennedy (though she became a long time supporter of Richard Nixon). Her tragic personal story was the basis for Agatha Christie's novel and movie The Mirror Crack'd. In the 1950's a suicidal Tierney was treated with shock therapy in a sanatorium, and though she recovered, she struggled for the rest of her life. Her second husband was Houston oil man W Howard Lee, who had previously divorced actress Hedy Lamarr ... another of the all-time screen beauties, who also turned down the lead role in Laura. Lucky guy.The spirit of the movie comes courtesy of the magnificent performance of Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker. He is mesmerizing in his ability to take over every scene. This was Webb's first \"talkie\" feature film - he left for the stage 15 years prior. The 30 year age difference between Waldo and Laura only works because Webb plays it as her society mentor, though it's obvious he is obsessed.Some of the best scenes and banter occurs with Webb and Vincent Price, who plays Laura's fianc\u00e9. If you are only accustomed to Vincent Price in horror films, you will certainly get a kick out his odd role here as the virile, insecure fianc\u00e9. He also has some very good and uncomfortable scenes with the great Judith Anderson, who clearly lusts after the Price character.The aforementioned portrait of Ms. Tierney was also used in 3 other films, and it's interesting that Tierney and Andrews made 5 total films together. David Raskin's haunting \"Laura's Theme\" plays throughout the film in various fashions, and Joseph LaShelle won the film's only Oscar - best black & white cinematography. This is certainly one of the best from the 1940's and holds up very well today ... enjoy the many facets of quality filmmaking.",

They are presented lovingly by Preminger, and his award-winning DOP Joseph LaShelle.The excellent script ranges from caustic Laedecker/Webb put-downs, through brutal Treadwell/Anderson self-assessment, to laconic MacPherson/Andrews minimalism.The score is, of course, a classic. Raksin's sinuous melody, brilliantly deployed, haunts the picture as powerfully as Laura's portrait haunts Detective MacPherson.The central performances are wonderful, not least because of the perfect casting. Tierney shines as the enigmatic title character: beautiful, intelligent, somehow both cool and passionate at the same time. Webb dazzles, Price slithers, Anderson simmers. Best of all is Andrews as the detective who barely opens his mouth when he speaks, and on whose face desire barely flickers - but he does enough to show you exactly what he wants and how he feels. It's a great movie performance from an underrated actor. Only Dorothy Adams doesn't quite fit, in a role - Laura's maid - that could easily have been as showy as the others with the right performer.LAURA doesn't appear to be about anything significant, but it leaves behind it a feeling that it is greater than the sum of its parts. I don't know how this was managed, and perhaps no-one involved in it did either. It's one of those movies where everything just clicked. Seeing it again recently, after many years, confirms its status for me as a significant work, but exactly why or how remains as much of a puzzle as Laura herself.",

Inserting himself when she needed his endorsement for a product her marketing firm was responsible for promoting, Laura allows an odd-ball by-line writer/radio personality Waldo Lydecker to become much more in her life. Waldo becomes a kind of mentor/Svengali in addition to being an overbearing suitor. When Waldo has competition for Laura in a more age-appropriate suitor he calls on all of his high-brow blue-blood ambitions to expose the questionable reputation of Shelby. Waldo raises the doubts regarding Laura's intentions to marry Shelby and a murder mystery ensues.Enter detective Mark McPherson who must solve Laura's murder and bring the perpetrator to justice. With scant evidence and a menagerie of colorful high-society friends, none of which would possess any ill toward Laura, this won't be solved easily. McPherson immediately becomes attached to the fallen beauty and like a bull-dog after a bone won't give up. It will take a few turns before something shattering changes everything. Now McPherson has a angle he's keeping close to the vest yet he almost faces another murder before he can make a case. It's a good ride and as in the best mysteries you're not really too sure until the final act.This film came out in 1944 before the end of the war. Folks needed some diversion and as such this was well received at the time. The element of the beauty of Gene Tierney is well leveraged for a compelling story of obsessive murder. The film was also nominated for five Academy Awards winning best black and white cinematography. This is one all fans of noir should put on their list to see as it is definitely a worth-while watch.",

Most of the films I review have an IMDb rating which is too low. LAURA on the other hand, currently (as I write this) with a running score in the high 8's, is not a film I would consider under-rated. If anything, the score is just a tad, a touch, a whisker, too high. Here is the skinny: in its day this film was a revelation. Even in its genre, it was a standout. The idea of falling in love with a picture is something you would expect in a fantasy or tear-jerker, not a police procedural or mystery. The audiences that saw it in a theatre were gob-smacked and (with the trick ending which I will NOT discuss) justifiably so. But, the musical question, does it hold up well today? I am not so sure. We are talking about a film where the character playing the hook, the draw, is, for all argument's sake, not actually there. Like John Cleese would say in the infamous DEAD PARROT skit, dead, deceased, no longer among the living. Therefore the film has to be carried by those talking about her. And to this wizened old reviewer, much of those scenes resemble the \"living room\" pieces in the old Charlie Chaplin films, where the exposition, however interesting, proceeds much like a stage play, with various characters banging lines of dialogue back and forth.

            "review_title": "The ultimate film noir-romantic, suspenseful and sophisticated!",
            "content": "1944 was the breakthrough year of film noir, creating several classics, among them \"Murder My Sweet\", \"Phantom Lady\" and what is probably the quintessential film noir, \"Double Indemnity\". Between \"Laura\" and \"Double Indemnity\", there is a tough call to identify which is better. However, they are so different. \"Double Indemnity\" is certainly much trashier, in a fun way, and with all that clever dialog, probably the best written film noir ever. \"Laura\" is pretty much everything that \"D.I.\" is not-a look at high society through its darkness and cynicism, a plethora of unhappy people in relationships they really don't want to be in, and the quintessential gay villain who can snap your head off with just an ordinary line like, \"I don't write with a pen. I use a goose quill, dipped in venom.\" Imagining Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) going up against Barbara Stanwyck (Phyllis Diedrickson in \"Double Indemnity\") creates the bitch fight of all bitch fights. Waldo is everything that Phyllis was not, urbane, educated, and not without scruples. He probably never figured he'd get into a relationship with a woman, yet a psychological need for companionship made Gene Tierney's Laura the perfect choice. He figured she'd find a lover at some point, but obvious gigolo Vincent Price or rough-neck detective Dana Andrews didn't crawl into his mind as possibilities. He was Henry Higgins to her Eliza Doolittle, taking the mousy young lady trying to get him to endorse her pen, and he enjoyed sharing all the finer things in life with her. So when she calls him on his sardonic behavior, he is impressed, and before you can say, \"Where's Waldo?\", he has brought her into his life as the perfect \"beard\". A scene cut from the original print (added onto the DVD) shows how Waldo turned Laura into the sophisticate she became and adds much needed dimension to the story. This was in spite of the producer's feelings that this gave the film a pretentious, non-war era ethic that may have turned off audiences who were craving more patriotism and less self-centered motivations.Laura, of course, doesn't come from a low class background herself. She's the niece of the wealthy sophisticated Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson) who claims she adores Laura, which she did as long as Laura stayed away from Shelby Carpenter (Price). Anne knows that Shelby prefers to drink his juice with Laura, not her, and her grasping manner makes it clear that she is not going to let him go without a fight. So who shot Laura? That is the question we know is the basis for the plot at the beginning of the film, and all the suspects are there. Detective Mark McPherson (Andrews) questions all of the people who knew her, and when he visits Webb, he is greeted by the sight of the middle-aged columnist getting out of his tub, no shame in showing himself off to the eye-rolling Andrews.That's the humor behind this film version of the Vera Caspary novel which enjoys showing New York society at its dirtiest. If \"Double Indemnity\" exposed rich Hollywood trash for what it was, New York sophisticates get an equal tongue lashing here. Even Anderson, a pretty tough female herself, is too tongue-tied to take a ribbing from Webb, while Price is simply playing the martyr for whomever he can get to support the lifestyle to which he has come accustomed to. As Anderson tells Tierney at one point, she's not a very nice person, and thus she deserves to be with Price. Imagining \"Rebecca's\" Mrs. Danvers lusting over a George Sanders gigolo type is pretty funny in itself, but Anderson is dressed to the nines, and she plays the role very subtly.Tierney, as you may have figured out, is seen initially in flashbacks until a sudden twist reveals the truth. Her \"entrance\" is low-key in the manner of the usual diva entrances, yet you already know by her beauty that she's quite the woman, one that Price, Webb and Andrews will do anything in order to protect, or so it seems. Otto Preminger takes the actors through the proper steps to identify who is who and reveal their moralities or amorality's. Everybody has a mystery, and that is the charm of this intelligent screenplay which has influenced many film noir classics over the years.Then, there's that fabulous score which grabs you and holds you until the shocking finale. Of course, the finale isn't a total shocker, because as clues are dropped by the writers, it is obvious why the culprit would do what they would do. While Judith Anderson may have become the \"Dame\" in the cast (knighted by Queen Elizabeth less than 20 years later), the phrase \"dame\" here as uttered by Andrews means something completely different, and that isn't acceptable in one person's terms to characterize our heroine. Tierney may have gotten her single Oscar Nomination for \"Leave Her to Heaven\", but it will always be the role of Laura Hunt, the mysterious victim, that will signify what her film career was all about and what she will be remembered for.",

            "content": "I'm not sure if \"Laura\" truly qualifies as a film noir, although it certainly looks the part. If anything, it is a bridge between the standard romantic dramas of the '30s and '40s and the far darker truly noir films, such as \"Double Indemnity,\" in which the main characters are either weak, desperate, or truly evil. Tierney, here, is luminous as always, but hardly unsympathetic. And Andrews is your basic Dick Tracy -- colorless, but solid and honest. It's no surprise then that Webb walks off with the film, but his character is significant in other ways. Outwardly fey, Waldo is a variation on the stock \"gay\" Hollywood character seen at a time when homosexuality was hinted at but never really acknowledged. He insists he loves Laura, but there appears to be no actual love affair. He chooses her clothes and hairstyles, shows her off on his arm, but never seems to have any real physical contact with her. (The visual clue is his apartment, filled with pretty things that no one is allowed to touch, although Waldo will gladly tell you how expensive they are.) His scenes with Andrews become far more complex in this context, particularly when he discusses the case with the detective from his bath. Their verbal sparring continues throughout the film, and Webb makes frequent remarks about why women find Andrews' type so alluring, while they reject more \"refined\" males of taste and breeding. But Webb's Waldo, despite the refinement, is a catty and cruel little monster, a man who writes of love, but has none in his life. Unlike David Wayne's comic sissy in \"Adam's Rib,\" who repeatedly proclaims his love and adoration for Katharine Hepburn's Amanda, Webb's Waldo has an edge so vile that we fear him, and, because of that, can accept him as a suspect. The film is also notable for Vincent Price's performance as a needy boy-toy who is manlier than Webb, but still sexually vague, indecisive and weak. Viewers unaccustomed to seeing Price in such roles may think he was miscast. Perhaps he was, but he seems to be doing precisely what he was supposed to do, giving Laura another worldly but inappropriate suitor.The plot, predictable or not, is great fun; a bit of a whodunit with a psychological edge. The score is legendary, and like the painting Andrews falls in love with, the music gives the film its haunting quality, particularly at those moments when we segue into another flashback.There's a bit of inscrutability in most of Tierney's performances, which makes her perfect for this role. We rarely know what she's thinking, or precisely how she feels about the other characters. And because of this, her flashbacks provide few clues as to why anyone would want to murder her.There are a few other suspects, of course, including the great Judith Anderson, and there's even a smart little cocktail party where you can look them over one more time. As for who really did kill Laura -- well, good luck with that one.",

I rarely find myself in disagreement with the consensus when it comes to widely-praised films from this era. But every once in a blue moon I find myself disagreeing with popular opinion on a classic film, even if it's just a little. Which brings me to Laura. I first saw Laura nearly twenty years ago. Then, and every time I've watched it since, I thought it was okay but was left underwhelmed that it didn't live up to its reputation. I return to it every few years with the hopes I would finally \"get it.\" At this point, I doubt my opinion is ever going to change on this movie. It's one of those movies that leaves me wondering what I'm missing. You know the feeling. You watch a movie and you like it okay but you look around and see everybody else LOVES it. They heap it with praise. I have seen countless movies that I felt this way about, especially recently as every summer blockbuster is heralded as the new king of cinema and skyrockets up IMDb's increasingly worthless Top 250.The problems I have with this movie start with it being a film built around a mystery that leads to the entirely unsurprising plot twist midway through that Laura is not actually dead. Even if this twist were not spoiled by the plot summary on the back of my DVD and in the TV plot descriptions from TCM, which it is, I would still find it hard to believe anyone is really surprised by it. To make matters worse, the film is not the same after the twist as it was before. The first half of the film is excellent, with the always-wonderful Clifton Webb giving a standout performance as Waldo Lydecker. Dana Andrews is also great up to this point. But then, shortly before Laura shows back up, we're led to believe that McPherson (Andrews) has fallen in love with her. There's no build-up to this. It just happens. Then we get a second half of McPherson acting like a jealous nut instead of the calm and collected police detective he was in the first half.Okay, there could still be a great film there. Perhaps an examination of the similarities between McPherson and Lydecker. Maybe even making McPherson take stock of his own obsession with this woman and pulling back from the brink. But no, the film doesn't do this. Instead, while Lydecker's crime is exposed and we see how far obsession has taken him, McPherson's obsessive \"love\" for Laura is treated like a true romance. Laura returns McPherson's feelings and we're led to believe these two wacky kids really are in love. While we're at it, the character of Laura really doesn't seem worth all this attention. Outside of her very pretty face, she's about as interesting as wallpaper.The film's certainly got some positive qualities. It's beautifully shot, it has a great cast, nice music, and good direction. Gene Tierney is very easy on the eyes. I know I'm in the minority by not loving this film. It's got a great score on IMDb for a film this old. Its reputation has stood the test of time, even if I don't totally agree with it. My final thoughts are that I think it is a good movie, not a great one, that is predictable and uneven with a weak second half. Your mileage may (and probably will) vary, however.",

            "content": "(Spoiler warning at suitable point below) Ah, love and death\u0085 I've found myself referencing \"Laura\" while thinking about so many other films lately (most particularly the excellent Korean thriller \"Tell Me Something\") that I just have to add my pennyworth, despite being the millionth person to contribute.The premise: 1940s New York: tough detective called in to investigate a nasty Park Avenue society murder finds himself falling for the victim through her portrait, her things, his contact with those that knew her. One night a startling twist sends him \u0096 and the film \u0096 in a completely unexpected direction. Don't mistake the brusqueness of style, the punchy delivery and starkness of this film for one-dimensionality. Just as the work of Preminger is greater than the sum of its parts, so \"Laura\" is more than meets the eye. It owes a lot to the excellent and subversive book by Vera Caspary from which it is taken. (Am I the only one who had no idea women were instrumental in every sub-genre of pulp magazine writing from the 20s to the 50s?) Much of the psychodrama came from the book \u0096 but the visual and stylistic tone is pure filmic noir. However, in classic film noir the femme fatale is always the powder keg for everyone around her, and she usually pays for her sin with death. In \"Laura\" the central death is only the start of the story, not its retributive finale; the 'femme fatale' anti-heroine is really no such thing; and its hero, a portrait of curt masculinity, falls most unusually for an image, an idea. * * * spoilers from here on * * * This isn't so much a study in police procedure as a study of a man in love. The underrated Dana Andrews' Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson may seem like a cartoon hard-boiled copper, but look a little harder: his terse, tense, scrutinising detective is a study in the transformative power of love on such a man. From Waldo Lydecker, Laura's friend, we learn that McPherson is damaged \u0096 a silver shinbone in his leg as a result of a gun battle with a gangster. He reveals very little of himself \u0096 we know him rather from what others say, or by his actions. But his tension, control and intelligence lends an edge to his masculinity. He has ways of looking which speak volumes. His big, sad eyes reflect the bafflement of a man lifted by the love he finds himself experiencing. He plays continually with a baseball toy, to rein himself in. The point \u0096 reinforced by a great punch late in the film \u0096 is that he has reason to. The sensual, swooning quality of the theme music is made flesh by the magnetic Laura herself (Gene Tierney). She's not just beautiful \u0096 she's like something people dream of. Mark thinks he's dreaming when he wakes to find her standing before him: she's the woman who could make him feel whole. Laura \u0096 whom he gets to know, uniquely, from the inside out \u0096 is neither a 'doll' nor a 'dame' (his enraging, early words); and in reaching for her he becomes a gentleman, against his own character or background. His 'real' gentleman is in marked contrast to the apparent gentlemen (and Laura's admirers) that we first meet \u0096 the acerbic, snippy Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb on great Wildean form), who narrates the first half of the film, and the Southern playboy Shelby Carpenter (an oddly cast Vincent Price). They both turn out to be fakes in a way. So Laura emerges from her portrait, from her elegant apartment, and from Waldo's museum \u0096 his clock, his story, his possession \u0096 to become real for Mark. From here on in, it isn't Waldo's world any more, it's hers, and his. I think Tierney takes great credit for \"Laura\" not merely being the story of a tussle between three men for something they want: she shows you that there's something she wants, too, and that she has the spark and independence to get it.The extraordinary circumstances of McPherson's contact with Laura lends their connection an intimacy which isn't lessened by the suspicion under which she labours. When Mark makes a move to arrest her at one point, it's almost as if she wants to go; she'd rather be with him under arrest, than listen to Waldo's sniping, or put up with Shelby's lies and lack of faith in her. The moral ambiguity created by these circumstances sets the tone of the piece, creating a sort of swirling, swoony romance with a very dark heart.\"Laura\" stands watching and re-watching. For an interesting companion piece, check out Tierney and Andrews a few years down the line (and both incidentally somewhat battered about by life), in another great noir, \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\". I'd also strongly recommend reading Caspary's original pulp novel of the same name.",

The cost is her total allegiance to him, but, as we see in the opening scene when he's in his marble tub, physically he's not much for such an attractive woman, plus the fact that he's probably more than twice her age. Once Laura has established herself, Waldo becomes less and less a necessity and more a pain in her pretty neck. But an obsession with her grows within him, in spite of or maybe because of his own amorphous sexual instincts. He's appalled by sex, but driven to possess Laura. It's an interesting character, and when the social and professional upstart starts seeing other men, Waldo's feelings are smashed upon his own inadequacies. That she would first dump him for her portrait painter and later an unscrupulous playboy played by Vincent Price, is more than he can take. With a beautiful theme song wafting through and a tough Dana Andrews as the detective, the story unfolds from different highly interesting perspectives, especially when the detective falls in love with the presumed dead Laura, transfixed by nothing more than her purported qualities, which he's jotted down from interrogations with different suspects. Through it all, there is unsurpassable camera work, direction, and acting, and a classic theme song.",

            "content": "This film was one of the first movies Otto Preminger directed in America. He was lucky in getting this assignment as the original director, Rouben Mamoulian, got fired. In the original book by Vera Caspary, the adapter, Jay Dratter, who is the only one credited with the film treatment, found a lot to work with, but ultimately, it was Preminger who delivered a movie that has been a crowd pleaser. Every now and then when it's shown on cable, we take a look at it. The first thing that surprises me is the classification in the IMDb, as this being a film noir, which in my humble opinion, it doesn't belong. Yes, \"Laura\" is a mystery. It also could be considered in the crime film genre, or even a romantic one, but film noir it is not; we don't have the elements here to be considered an example of that category.If you haven't watched the film, please stop reading now.There is something strange in the opening sequence of the film. We hear a voice over narration by Waldo Lydecker, who we all know is not around to tell the story. It is something that always bothered me, for if the film required a narration, none other than the detective, Mark McPherson, should tell the viewer what happened. The film, a typical Hollywood picture of the 40s, presents the figure of Lydecker, who was the prototype of today's metrosexual, obviously an old queen, who is in the entertainment business, perhaps a gossip columnist working in the Manhattan of those years. He plays Pygmalion to Laura Hunt's Galatea. Waldo transforms this unsophisticated girl into being a cafe society and party girl with the right connections. Lydecker had everything to lose when Laura falls for the worthless Shelby, so he had to put a stop to it.Mark McPherson is a jaded policeman. He calls the supposedly dead Laura, a dame, which sends Lydecker into a frenzy. McPherson plays cat to Lydecker's mouse in a game to know the truth, which finally comes at the end. The film belongs to Clifton Webb, who plays Waldo Lydecker with great panache. He truly understood this man and what really made him tick. He used Laura as his way to present a front to the society he courted and not to reveal his latent homosexuality, although, it was apparent to anyone what he really was. This performance and his great appearance in \"The Razor's Edge\" as Elliott Templeton, were his best roles in his Hollywood movies. Dana Andrews cut quite a figure as the detective that unfolds the mystery surrounding the possible death of Laura. He is a jaded man that has seen a lot in his years with the department. Mr. Andrews plays the detective in a terse manner, which enhances the allure of his character.Gene Tierney was one of the great beauties of her time. Never was she more adoringly photographed than in \"Laura\". She had a good career in Hollywood in the 40s and 50s, when she disappeared from the screen. The young Vincent Price was good as Shelby. Judith Anderson is seen in the minor role of Mrs. Treadwell.\"Laura\" owes a great deal to the brilliant black and white cinematography of Joseph LaShelle, a man of great taste and impeccable excellence in everything he did. The music score by David Raskin stays with the viewer long after the film has finished showing. Otto Preminger made an excellent movie that will be a perennial favorite of the classic movie fans.",

The story unfolds as our wily Detective Lt. Mark McPherson tries to get to the bottom of what happened to Laura Hunt. He does so by interviewing those who are near and dear to Laura. The first of which is the cynical and opinionated society writer Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) who is not only in love with Laura but feels like he invented her and introduced her to society. Waldo also makes no beef about his disapproval of Laura's fianc\u00e9, wastrel Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Shelby is a self proclaimed layabout who doesn't seem surprised when it turns out it isn't Laura but a look alike who turns up dead.They still have to figure out who the murder is however...and Mark McPherson who has by now fallen in love with Laura himself, is the man to do the job.Laura is played by the beautiful and mysterious Gene Tierney. She along with the rest of the cast put in a fantastic performance in this classic film noir. Wonderful cinematography highlighting the dark and light throughout. There are also some really unique scenes...for example Shelby is initially interviewed by the detective while he is writing in his bathtub (yep, you read that right from his bathtub).Not your typical film, this is a must see for classic film and film noir fans alike.",

            "content": "The movie version of Vera Caspary's novel \"Laura\" is a murder mystery with some neat twists, great dialogue and a group of characters whose unconventional behaviour really illuminates the proceedings. Most of the action is played out in the luxurious surroundings inhabited by Laura and the individuals who become the main suspects in a murder investigation.Detective Lieutenant Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is a laconic, hard drinking, courageous police officer who's used to dealing with gangsters but finds himself moving in very different circles when he's assigned to investigate the murder of young advertising executive Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). His first move is to interview her close friend and mentor Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). Lydecker is a well known newspaper columnist who's very snooty, conceited and proud to admit that he writes with \"a goose quill dipped in venom\". He's also very effeminate and eccentric and spends part of his first meeting with McPherson sitting in a bathtub whilst simultaneously working away on a typewriter.Lydecker describes to McPherson how he initially got to know Laura, how their friendship grew and how, over a period of time, he gave her valuable guidance and introduced her to influential people. As a result, her progress in society and her profession accelerated and she became very successful in both. He also admitted that he became very jealous of any relationships that she developed with other men and generally derailed them by using both his column and his influence over her.The most significant of Laura's relationships was with her fianc\u00e9, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). He was not in employment and told her that his family had been bankrupt for some years. Laura responded by giving him a job at her advertising agency. What Shelby didn't mention was that he was a gigolo and regularly received sums of money from Laura's wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson). True to form, Waldo had Shelby investigated and found that he was having an affair with a model at the agency and furthermore, discovered that a gold cigarette case which had been given to him by Laura had actually been pawned by the model.McPherson becomes increasingly fascinated by Lydecker's information about Laura and goes to her apartment where he searches through her possessions and reads some of her personal documents. As he pours himself a drink, sits down and looks at her large portrait over the fireplace, it's evident that he also has become obsessed by her. Lydecker comes to the apartment and tells McPherson that he's aware that he's put in a bid for Laura's portrait and recognising what's happened, says \"you'd better watch out McPherson, or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward. I doubt they've ever had a patient who fell in love with a corpse\".McPherson eventually resolves the problem of his obsession and discovers who's actually guilty of murder but only after some more interesting plot developments and surprises.\"Laura\" is an intoxicating mixture of intrigue, romance, obsession and off-beat humour and also has an outstanding musical score (by David Raskin). Otto Preminger's direction and the cinematography by Joseph LaShelle are excellent and strongly enhance the piece as a visual entity. The movie's main strength, however, is its characters and the marvellous performances which bring them to life so vividly. Clifton Webb's contribution is sensational and Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Vincent Price and Judith Anderson all excel in their roles.",

            "review_title": "Provocative Mystery and Stylish Glamour; Glorious Portrait and Haunting Score",
            "content": "A portrait, a painting, a piece of art have always played a decisive role in addressing our emotions and leading our thoughts to some 'idealized reality.' A beautiful woman in the painting has been a focus of interest...men admired her, women envied her; yet both have been affected by her glamor, mystery, detail and style. \"A passion for the unavailable,\" as Petrarch once described the name Laura, is precisely what we encounter in this powerful film noir of the 1940s where one of the most beautiful actresses, Gene Tierney, at last decided to \"play a painting.\" But is it only the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN who makes this film one of the most aesthetic and fabulous screen productions? Is the widespread appreciation and applause dedicated only to her?All the merits of the film appear to focus on PORTRAIT, SCORE and ATMOSPHERE. These three aspects, as certain details, seem to create the harmony of the general conclusion after viewing LAURA. As a film noir (one of its very best manifestations), LAURA emphasizes the portrait of \"a woman of mystery and glamor\" (Gene Tierney)...an advertising executive whom we get to know with New York police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews). Just for curiosity, the portrait was initially painted by director Rouben Mamoulian's wife (first director of the movie) but...as a matter of fact, what we actually find in the movie is a blowup of Gene Tierney's photograph. The portrait leads us to the specific atmosphere of tension, suspicion, glamor, haunt, mystery and the unpredictable effects of murder investigation...the atmosphere at its best! This atmosphere is enriched by magnificent score, a unique work by David Raksin, a novelty at that time promoted by the composer for Fox studio Alfred Newman. His score supplies us with unforgettable feelings while watching the movie and helps the viewers keep interest and suspicion. It beautifully adapts detective elements, sexual references and a sentiment to the scenes. To enrich the atmosphere, we also need to add the flashbacks that play an important role in the movie and explain a lot in discovering the events as well as lead us to a certain reality and emotions. Also, the moody scenes with stunning cinematography add certain moods and resemblance.Another significant aspect of LAURA's artistry are, of course, the performances. Although there are practically not many characters in the movie, casting occurred to be pretty challenging. It is important to keep in mind that the author of the novel, Vera Caspary, badly wanted a screen adaptation but had her word in many decisions, including the portrayals of characters. After the long and tedious process of casting (even Marlene Dietrich was willing to play the lead), the results are fabulous. Gene Tierney portrays a sophisticated woman of the high society, no naive woman, no femme fatale but a strong woman who gets balanced among three men our attention is called upon: the newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) whose vicious charm shapes her decisions and who has, indeed, the strongest power in her life; her fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a gentle man who \"would not even kill a fly\" and the police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) who suspects no one and everyone at the same time. In between the men comes her wealthy aunt, Ann Treadwell memorably portrayed by the highly respected actress whose career illumined both the stage and cinema, Judith Anderson. However, let me consider the male performances in more details.Dana Andrews does a brilliant job as the detective making us not only the observers of the investigation but, thanks to the powerful and effective depiction of indefatigable determination, he lets us into his world where women are 'dames' and where suspicions are daily bread. The most unforgettable scene is when he enters Laura's apartment and the emphasis on details, the dream-like tension and his instantaneous movements occur to be the clarity with no words. Clifton Webb, who portrays the most difficult character, in fact, excellently combines the wretchedness with sympathy, doubt with certainty. He is not a villain and he does not look to be one... He is a man of power, a man of talent, a man of self esteem and mannerisms. He even becomes respectable, even in the eyes of the most suspicious viewers until... Vincent Price has his moments in the film, he is vibrant and genuine in the role; a young and inexperienced in man-woman relation? A little but shy? It occurs quite meaningful to state that both Clifton Webb and Vincent Price started their careers from supporting roles and then became legendary. However, there is yet another legendary name in LAURA that makes this film stand out as a historic production...that is the \"tireless\" (according to Gene Tierney) director Otto Preminger.Vincent Price memorably stated: \"Otto Preminger had an implicit knowledge of pseudo-sophisticated world\" and supplied the characters with the 'sense of evil' not making anyone villains. Preminger's great achievement is the fact that he managed to combine a detective story with psychology. His direction makes the film both sophisticated and romantic...I don't doubt that Rouben Mamoulian with his exquisite talents would also have managed that stylish element (he proved that in DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE)...yet, some of his requirements occurred to be of little use for the crew and the author herself.LAURA is a great atmospheric film noir, a provocative mystery combined with the stylish glamor where the haunting score leads us to the glorious portrait of female charm and mystery. 9/10",

            "content": "Laura. She's the talk of the town. She's enterprising, intelligent and beautiful. Men fall over themselves to get close to her, women envy her sophistication; Laura is, to paraphrase a very well-known detective, the stuff that dreams are made of. Such are her charms that she will even drive one respectable person to commit murder. Her murder. But who would want to kill Laura Hunt? Otto Preminger's nifty little 1940s thriller simultaneously evokes the spirit of hard-boiled pulp noir, an Agatha Christie murder mystery and even a little surreal fantasy. With a brief running time and an intimately-small cast, the film is perhaps closer in spirit to a traditional \"countryhouse murder\" tale than sprawling gangster film noir pictures like John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' or Howard Hawks' 'The Big Sleep (1946).' Nevertheless, stylistically, 'Laura' is pure noir, and cinematographer Joseph LaShelle, a notable favourite of Billy Wilder later in his career, expertly employs shadows and lighting to create the close, claustrophobic atmosphere that arises when one person in the room must be a cold-blooded murderer.There is no other way to say it: Gene Tierney is absolutely ravishing. From the film's opening moments, when we glimpse her seductive figure in a hanging portrait, my heart melted; I was instantly brought under her enchanting spell. If I may adopt the vocabulary of our hard-boiled hero, she's a perfect dame! When hard-edged cop Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews, the spitting image of Steve Martin in 'Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982)') is assigned to investigate the brutal murder of the city's most coveted women (Tierney), he uncovers a bizarre romantic triangle that offers endless motives for such a heinous crime. Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), an older newspaper columnist with a reputation for acid wit, originally offered Laura her big break in business, and had protectively maintained a relationship with her that surpassed love and bordered on obsession. Meanwhile, a wealthy charmer, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), had asked for Laura's hand in marriage, a proposal about which she had been non-committal. Even in death, Laura's femme fatale charm remains just as potent, and Lt. McPherson soon finds himself infatuated with her lingering spirit.Then, of course, comes the wonderfully-surreal moment when our love-struck detective awakens to watch his murder victim walk into the room. Originally, Rouben Mamoulian {'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)'} had been hired to direct the film, and his version ended with the revelation that Laura's reappearance had merely been a dream, a construction of McPherson's subconscious. When producer Otto Preminger decided to take over, he unceremoniously scrapped Mamoulian's completed footage and started over. Even without this final psychological complication, which might nevertheless have seemed a cop-out, Preminger's mystery is consistently engrossing and often fascinating. Most intriguing of all is Lydecker's relationship with Laura, and Clifton Webb's unconventional yet highly-effective casting in the role. The noted Broadway performer had not acted in a film since the silent era, but his flamboyant and foppish personality translates perfectly to the screen. Lydecker doesn't seem to actually love Laura, but rather he wishes to be her, to live vicariously through her, and for any man (other than himself) to be in Laura's life is an affront both to himself and his sexuality.",

This was the first film noir I'd ever seen and, being relatively new to 1940s movies at the time, I thought the story was sooooo slow. I thought the film was way too boring and vastly overrated.....way too talky for a crime (film noir) movie. Actually, this is 'noir;' for lovers of soap operas/melodramas a lot more than it is for people who enjoy a good, manly crime movie.Well, the first half hour was pretty good with great sarcastic dialog between \"Waldo Lydecker\" (Clifton Webb) and \"Shelby Carpenter\" (Vincent Price) but after that, they just kept talking, talking and talking. Yawn! I lost interest but stuck with it, even though it took me two days to finish it.Dana Andrews' role as the policeman \"Det. Lt.

McPherson, who regards all women as dames or dolls, is attracted to Laura because she is unattainably dead and thus no threat to him.  Like a number of 1940s movies (e.g. \"Rebecca\", \"The Woman in the Window\", \"Portrait of Jennie\") \"Laura\" has as a central erotic image a painting of a woman who obsesses the characters, an effect reinforced by the repeated playing (on the radio, phonograph, and by a restaurant orchestra) of the title song by Johnny Mercer and David Raskin.

That's for good reason, of course, because it's a sublime piece of cinema; but surely Laura deserves just as much of that praise. Simply put, the film is perfection and I dare anyone to argue otherwise. The acting, direction, script, morals; everything are absolutely spot on, and impossible to pick a fault with. The film works principally on two levels; on one level, it's technically stunning, with all those assets mentioned featuring heavily and to great effect, and on the other level; it's a potent love story, one that takes a premise and builds it into what is possibly the most powerful and brilliant expose of love that cinema has ever seen. Many films get one of these two things right to a great degree, but Laura manages both exceptionally - and that is a rare thing. The plot follows the murder of a very beautiful woman who seemingly has admirers coming out of her ears. She's so stunning, in fact, that she manages to gain another one in death; as Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews), the detective on the case falls for the girl who's murder he is investigating.Laura will be remembered by many for featuring one of the most shocking and surprising plot twists of all time. The twist can easily be guessed before the film, and it's this blatant edge that allows it to be such a surprise. Ace director Otto Preminger captures that film noir atmosphere that would go on to become the staple of the genre, and he captures it to such an extent that in the fifteen years or so that film noir would go on after the release of this film; it would never be bettered. The acting from all concerned is immense, and obviously Gene Tierney sticks out the most as title character. She is matched brilliantly by Dana Andrews, who brings life and believability to his character brilliantly. The cast is finally topped off by exuberant support performances from Clifton Webb and, of course, the master of the macabre; Vincent Price! This film marks an important milestone in the great horror icon's career as shortly before being cast in this movie, he was set to join the army - and I dread to think what a loss that would have resulted in for my beloved horror genre. So kudos to Otto Preminger for that casting decision! Not giving this film full marks is a completely ludicrous idea. If you see this film and deduce that it is anything less than absolutely brilliant, you seriously need to reconsider your status as a film fan.

In 1945, that Oscar went to Barry Fitzgerald in a forgettable role in an equally forgettable movie called GOING MY WAY. Tierney and Andrews are also first class, but Webb steals the show as the completely self-absorbed, cold and calculating Lydecker, who has a larger than life vision of his own merits. Dana Andrews is extremely effective as the hardboiled, ruthless detective investigating the \"murder\" of Laura -- but, very cleverly, when he questions Laura, he is more interested in finding out whether she loves, and is going to marry, Shelby.

I never cared for David Raksin's famous music, either. Gene Tierney was never a compelling screen personality, and comes off better as a painting than as an actress. Dana Andrews was a good actor but not so remarkable here as to suggest why this was a \"star making\" film for him. Clifton Webb's character of the waspish Woollcott-like columnist Waldo Lydecker was considered quite \"advanced\" and \"dangerous\" at the time, as if somehow the president himself was being insulted, and I can't figure why. The dialogue is not especially witty, and one gets no sense of the \"genius\" of the man. Like nearly everyone else in the film he comes across as a nasty, vain, parasitic snob. Vincent Price got good reviews for this one, also, and while he is mildly amusing as a gigolo he's far from convincing. Maybe it's that the movie is so anti-New York at a time when Hollywood worshipped at the Big Apple's feet. Otto Preminger's direction is as far as I can see invisible. This occasionally fascinating film-maker did far better work later on. Overall, the movie feels flat to me. Since there's no one to like, the story gets tedious awfully fast. Laura was, however, hugely influential, and made effete villains for a while all the rage. Some of the similarly-themed films made in its wake,--The Dark Corner, The Unsuspected--actually hold up a lot better.",

            "content": "I am mystified that on a first watch I accepted this at face value and liked it - I suppose tastes change as we train an abstract eye that floats through details and minutiae. Engaging this based on the rapport established by the players inside the setbound mystery, you get the most utterly nonsensical thing, piling contrived explanation on top of contrived explanation as it feigns and feigns again for the sake of doing so.No, something else is going on here. Film noir means a narrative being traveled by a viewer looking to apprehend controls or an author, and so far as noir goes this is essential viewing even though it lacks the grittiness and danger of steamblack streets.The idea is that we have a writer who sets out in the beginning to tell the story of Laura, being interrupted by ourselves in the shoes of the detective and taking charge of storytelling. It's not enough that he tells the story, it matters that it's pieced together by us and in a way that unlocks truth of her. How is this accomplished? Our man is gruff and to the point, prompting others to contribute on top of the original story their own version of events. But Preminger was not Welles, so he jettisoned the original structure of the thing where five different viewers would narrate five different pieces of the puzzle, cutting it down to three - Webb, Price, Tierney - and one narrator throughout.One half of the big clue as to what this is all about, is that only the writer's story is visual; we presume every bit of this is true, why else, because we have photographic evidence. The other half is when the writer comments on this, but speaks of photographic evidence of dreams. Clever.So our detective, as it turns out infatuated by Laura as only bits of an image, falls asleep from tiredness and whiskey and Laura is magically conjured in the same living-room.So of course more outlandish coincidence and deceit is piled, characters nonchalantly dismiss earlier drafts of their testimony as lies, new ones are improvised on the spot and sound equally improbable. The point is that since this is the writer's capricious world, truth is going to be malleable, words are going to mean nothing beyond signposts for the imagination. The point is that Laura was his fabrication, his story that he wanted told, that got out of control and acquired new life. In this life she rejects him and falls for our guy. He lashes back to destroy, but it's too late and she has already captivated her audience - both in and out of the world of the film.A nifty connection is to Bride of Frankenstein of some 10 years before; Clifton Webb in the role of Thesinger, contriving to create the image of a woman. Everyone else is only incidental in the story.Welles dismissed the direction of the film as simply glossy, and this merits mention; Preminger is a bit like the writer here, deft handling that attempts too much control where should be life. So we get a narrow visual imagination but cleverly centered. You can't fault it.",

            "content": "The opening title and credits play atop the haunting pause, yet recognizably poignant portrait of the eponymous title character as the famous atmospheric haunting theme music 'Laura' by composer, David Raksin plays in the background. It's here, where this classic film noir directed by Otto Preminger start to become one of the most stylish, elegant, moody, and witty classic films ever made without one scene with any of the ensemble cast of characters or one sentence of dialogue. It create the interest, by allowing the viewer to fixedly gaze, upon the artist work. By having the portrait in dream-like, high-contrast black and white cinematography, characterized by shadowy, it allows the audience to know, that this movie is a mystery; and a psychological study of obsession. Everybody wants to know, who in the painting, this is, and what happen to her. For some, more than others; this was the case for New York City, police detective, Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) whom investigates the murder of a beautiful and highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Laura has apparently been killed by a shotgun blast to the face, just inside the doorway of her apartment and everybody around her, is a suspect. Among of them is, a dim-witted, parasitic playboy fianc\u00e9, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a cynical, mannered and prickly society columnist, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a loyal housekeeper in Bessie Clary (Dorothy Adams) and an aging, well-heeled, matronly socialite, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson). All of them, beautiful portrayal by the well-seasoned actors with Andrews doing the best, even if his character is now so clich\u00e9s. Although, I like his acting, I have to disagree with the Academy, for allowing Clifton Webb to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor that year. I found Clifton to be, one of the weakest in the picture; because how aloof & cartoony, his character was. He was alright, but not Oscar worthy. I get that this was Clifton Webb's first screen appearance since the silent era, but he was a bit over the top. In my opinion, actor, Barry Fitzgerald deserve his win for 1944's 'Going My Way'. Why, because who else, can say, that they were nominated both for Best Supporting Actor & Best Actor in the same year, for the same role in the same movie. Nobody that's who! Despite that, the other Oscar nominates, such as Best Director (Otto Preminger), Best Cinematography (Joseph LaShelle), Best Art Direction and Best Screenplay was truly deserving for the people that work for 'Laura'. Preminger really get mad props from me, because how passionate, he was, for the project. Not only was, he willing to work, with rival producer, Darryl F. Zanuck to produce the film, but he also had to replace two weeks of work from, outgoing director Rouben Mamoulian, including the painting, when Darryl F. Zanuck fired Rouben, for lack of direction. He deserve the nominated. However, the best screenplay nominated could be questionable, since a similar theme movie where, a man fall in love with a woman's portrait was release during the same year, with director, Fritz Lang's 1944's film 'The Woman in the Window'. In the end, it's up to debate, which movie probably rip off, whom, or was it, just all a coincide. We may never know. What we do know is that, the crisply-written screenplay by Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein and Betty Reinhardt was loosely based on the play and novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. A series of changes, happen, such as the five separate voice narrators being drop; the ending of the film, alternate and a number of allusions to a character's homosexuality were cut from the script before filming began, in favor for a hyper-protective character expressed hetero-like jealousy over anyone else's attention toward Laura, particularly by the detective who shows some troubling, signs of necrophiliac. While, the twist toward the end, softened the feelings of the detective, this was still pretty shocking for the 1940s for a lead character to have. As much as I love the twist ending, it does beg the question, why the police officers didn't bother, doing finger prints or body measurements to make sure, who the victims is. While, a lot of people do mistaken Laura as an amoral femme fatale. In truth, her character felt disappointing as she's nothing like it. She just another damsel in distress broad. Don't get me wrong, Gene Tierney is a beautiful creature, but this movie isn't one of best roles. Her character haunting theme song is more famous than her role here. Gene Tierney was right with her, being adequate, here. Overall: While, this movie was badly cut up, due to wartime appeals, during its original run. It has since, been remastered and clean up for future audiences since the 1990s. Even some versions of DVDs has the rare sequence in which Vincent Price sings a song and accompanies himself on the piano. In the end, Laura was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Because of that, it's one film, worth looking out for.",

            "content": "It's hard to fault this film, whose plot I won't bother to outline. It may not be an artistic masterpiece but it shows what Hollywood could do at its very best.It's a murder mystery wrapped around a love story, with the stiff self-contained Dana Andrews as the investigating detective and the eyeball-coagulatingly gorgeous Gene Tierney as the supposed \"corpse\" he falls in love with.Every aspect of the production seems to come together -- the lighting, the decor, the wardrobe, the photography, and the players. The scene in which Andrews, half drunk on Tierney's fine scotch, falls asleep in a chair and is awakened by Tierney's arrival can be played repeatedly by itself and enjoyed each time.The film is filled with splendid little signs of genuine talent at work. Tierney returns from the dead and has no idea what's been happening, so she demands an explanation from Andrews. The writers could have come up with a clumsy scene in which the detective explains to the recently revived victim what the viewer already knows. Instead, rather than answering her questions, Andrews picks up a newspaper and hands it to her. It takes about five seconds for the astonished woman to learn what she needs to.I think I'll quibble now. I had a little trouble with three things.The maid, Betsy, played by Dorothy Adams, is treated like a devoted dolt. She overacts and is given to shrieking. She's so dumb that she needs Tierney's reassurance, \"Don't worry, Betsy. I'm not a ghost, really I'm not.\" If the dialog for the other characters is relatively sophisticated (even Andrews has heard of Sibelius) the writers seem to have no ear for the speech of the working folks.I had trouble too with Clifton Webb. People warned Preminger not to use him because he hadn't made any sound pictures before, and because \"he flits.\" I don't care if he flits or not but that Midwestern accent just doesn't allow him to sound viperish enough. \"Ridiculous\" comes out as \"ree-DICKulous.\" Honest, they needed George Sanders for the job.And maybe he's sophisticated and acerbic but we only really know about that because everybody tells us about it, Webb most of all. \"I dee-molished his ree-diculous theories,\" says Webb about the painter Jacoby. What theories are they? The script strains and grunts and creaks at the joints as it reaches for archness and wit and it winds up with lines like, \"If you come a little closer, my boy, I can just crack your head with my stick.\" It's determinedly middle-brow. The insults don't sing. And although Webb projects self absorption, he can't really show us any ironic distance from the goings on.Well, as long as I'm carping, let me add that Andrews' falling for Tierney is believable enough, but her falling for him after a day or two filled with conflict and suspicion, is a bit on the impulsive side as far as her character goes. When it comes to that, what is her life with Andrews -- a tough, blunt cop -- going to be like after they're married. What is she going to do when he can't come up with another fox fur? How about when he falls asleep and snores at Sibelius concerts?But those remarks shouldn't keep you from seeing the film at the first chance you have. It's a very good one.",

Dana Andrews comes across exactly right as the hard boiled detective who falls in love with Laura's picture and then with Laura herself.  Vincent Price is delightfully weak and despicable as the boyfriend and Dame Judith Anderson hits just the right note as his wealthy \"patron\".  But it is Clifton Webb, in his first starring role, who steals the show as Waldo Lydecker, the acidulous critic.  With a sharp tongue and even sharper wit, his character holds center stage in every scene.  He's the man you love to hate and he plays it to the hilt. Preminger directs this film with a superb touch although he was to prostitute his talents later in his career on some real stinkers.  The ending, although it may not come as a surprise, still will enthrall you.  This is a superior film which lingers in your memory long after you have seen it, as will the title tune.

But just what is it that makes the film so watchable after all these years?Sure the cast is solid, but I personally wouldn't say spectacular. Gene Tierney simmers and holds it together whilst Clifton Webb, Dana Andrews & Vincent Price are perfectly admirable in their roles as guys in drippy infatuation with Tierney's vibrant title character.Perhaps the success of the piece is with the screenplay? Adapted by at least \"five\" known writers from the novel by Vera Caspary, it is in truth delightfully bonkers! You have shades of necrophilia, potential gay suitors, and the girl the boys all court is dead, minus her face after a shotgun assault. Then there is the fact that Laura bends the conventions of the genres it can each sit in. Is it film noir, a who done it, a ghost story or just a plane old detective story? Does it matter? No, not really, because it's the ambiguity that is the films strength. As for Laura Hunt herself, well she's no femme fatale, in fact she's an ordinary woman, yet the men are in awe of her. It shouldn't work on the surface, but it does, very much so.The film had something of a troubled shoot, hires and fires and jiggled endings were abound. Preminger was originally the producer for the film but was hired after Fox head honcho Darryl Zanuck fired Rouben Mamoulian. He in turn replaced cinematographer Lucian Ballard with Joseph LaShelle (who won the Academy Award for his efforts). Regardless, what we have with the finished product is a cheeky and often twisted tale of obsession. A film where one can never be sure what is actually going to develop, right up to, and including, the final denouement. 8/10",

            "content": "\"Laura\" works in just about every way: acting, writing, production values. It's not an especially ambitious movie, and I was hoping it would explore the idea of obsession more thoroughly. One could have a field day reading subtext into \"Laura\": the fetishizing of Laura herself as mere object (emphasized by the portrait of her that hangs constantly in the background, and the valuable trinkets that fill Waldo Lydecker's apartment), the implied latent homosexuality of Lydecker as a motivation for his actions, etc. But ultimately I think \"Laura\" is a fairly superficial mystery/romance with not a whole lot to say, and Otto Preminger, the film's director, seems to be content with giving us an 88-minute movie that clips nicely if insignificantly along rather than a two-hour movie weighted down with psychological complexity. In this particular case, I don't mind, because what he's given us is one damn fine movie.The film of course revolves around Gene Tierney and its credibility relies on our belief that man after man would be infatuated with her. Overall I can buy this. She's certainly stunning and never too hard on the eyes. But she's also not a great actress, so anything compelling about her comes strictly from her looks and not from her performance. This seems to be true with many Hollywood beauties of the 40's (and really even today when you think about it).Clifton Webb gets the lion's share of praise for this film, and rightly so. You can see him having a field day with the prissy, fastidious Lydecker, and whether or not the homosexual subtext is implied, one can't get away from the odd sexual tension that permeates his first scene with Dana Andrews (whom he greets while sitting naked in a bathtub). Andrews himself uses his good looks and macho demeanor to good effect, but he's not required to do much beyond this. Vincent Price and Judith Anderson likewise don't have much to do, and Price especially seems like strange casting, given his high-pitched, fruity voice is at odds with the imposing physical presence his character is supposed to display (and which Price has, voice aside).This is a slick, great-looking film shot in crisp black and white. Preminger directs fairly straight-forwardly, with only an occasional directorial flourish to distinguish this from the average studio fair. However, on the plus side, his unfussy direction lets the strong story and good cast speak for themselves.Grade: A-",

            "content": "What is film noir? Film critics and snobs (like myself) throw that phrase around like it some kind of well-known, easily defined, internal feature of film history. Those who are casually familiar with film know who were in them; Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Vera Miles, some even know a director name or two. But Humphrey Bogart was also in westerns and Alfred Hitchcock also made comedies and film noir is still a catch-all for black-and-white mysteries with darker themes and brooding main men.Is Otto Preminger's Laura (1944) a film noir? On it's surface it certainly is. The yarn starts with a police detective prying into a murder, there are multiple plot twists and a seductive woman in the center of it all. Yet through it all the murder means very little when it comes to the theme and point of which while subversive are never as dark as Chinatown (1974) or as macabre as The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934).Nor does Laura feature a hardboiled detective with a ruddy past or a fatal phobia; Dana Andrews plays his lieutenant McPherson without a sense of urgency or malice. He's a flatfoot doing his duty and whose only drive stems from a infatuation with the assumed deceased. Likewise Gene Tierney's seductress Laura isn't much of a vamp or naif; stock characters almost necessary for the film noir fold. She's more of an unwitting victim in a inundation of intrigue.The main objective of the plot swirls about the two main leads yet it is the supporting characters that are memorable. Clifton Webb was nominated for an Oscar as New York columnist and unconscionable snob Waldo Lydecker. Lydecker plays multiple roles in Laura's drama playing the narrator, comic relief, the audiences' thoughts and the seething, bitter sidekick to the lieutenant, at least for the first part of the movie.Lydecker is also a suspect in the murder case along with society wastrel Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price); fianc\u00e9e to the distraught Laura. Price was 33 at the time of the film's release and under contract with 20th Century Fox; well before he found his mellifluous niche as the sophisticated bad guy. In Laura however, Price plays a dolt who looks like the cat who ate the canary.They, along with socialite Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson), live in their own reality, made murky by the circumstances of murder. Not because either of the three are the assassins, but because the homicide becomes an excuse to expose their dirty laundry in front of high society and the NYPD. One is embarrassed, another is accustomed to public shaming and the third relishes it.So is Laura still, strictly speaking a film noir? I would say no. While the element of murder is there, the atmosphere lacks the abhorrent juiciness, the principle characters lack anti-hero qualities and the mystery isn't all that important. Laura is much better categorized as a tense, interesting, witty and insightful murder mystery which exposes deeper meanings about love and obsession. The main characters are almost immediately overshadowed by the supporting cast and the murder holds little emotional weight.The novel of the same name by Vera Caspary is considered in many circles to be a pre- feminist story as it favorably presents a woman with a healthy professional and sexual life. While much of that was downplayed in the film, much of it shows through. So while it may still be considered film noir by some, at least it makes it less of a boy's club.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Film noir is often associated with the \"mean streets\" of American cities and its characters are often drawn from the criminal underworld or the impoverished underclass. \"Laura\", unusually, is set against the background of New York's high society. As the film opens, Mark McPherson, an NYPD detective, is investigating the murder of Laura Hunt, a beautiful young advertising executive, killed with a shotgun just inside the doorway of her apartment. There appear to be two main suspects, Laura's playboy fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter and her friend the writer and newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker. Her relationships with both men seem to have been very strange ones. Shelby likes to pose as a wealthy Southern gentleman, but in fact has little money of his own. He is effectively a \"kept man\", being kept by Laura's socialite aunt Ann Treadwell, who nevertheless has no objection to Shelby's engagement to her niece. It is never really made clear whether Waldo, Laura's mentor and a middle-aged bachelor old enough to be her father, is a purely platonic friend or a disappointed suitor for her affections. As played by Clifton Webb, he comes across as highly effeminate, with a suggestion that he might be gay. In 1944, however, any direct mention of homosexuality would have been a violation of the Production Code, and even a strong hint in that direction might have attracted the unwelcome attention of the Hays Office. The film-makers, therefore, seem to have avoided being too explicit about the exact nature of the Waldo/Laura relationship, leaving open the possibility that he might harbour romantic feelings for her.  It was, incidentally, the characterisation of Waldo which was responsible for the rift between the producer Otto Preminger and his original director Rouben Mamoulian. Mamoulian had wanted Laird Cregar in the role, but was overruled, and loathed what he saw as Webb's effeminate interpretation of the role. Eventually Preminger persuaded studio head Darryl F. Zanuck to sack Mamoulian and to allow Preminger to direct the film himself. Roger Ebert wrote of the film that \"Film noir is known for its convoluted plots and arbitrary twists, but even in a genre that gave us \"The Maltese Falcon\", this takes some kind of prize\". Ebert was doubtless thinking about the film's Big Twist which comes about halfway through. Up until then we have been thinking that this is a standard whodunit, that the title character will only appear in flashback and that it will end with the identification and arrest of Laura's killer. That, however, is not how matters play out. It is suddenly revealed that Laura is alive and well and that the dead body found in her flat was, in fact, that of another woman. McPherson now not only has to solve a murder but also has to prevent one, as he is convinced that the killer will return to murder the real Laura. Dana Andrews makes a rather uncharismatic hero as McPherson, and a young Vincent Price is equally unmemorable as Shelby. Gene Tierney, however, is perfect in the title role. It is perhaps not Tierney's most technically demanding part, but someone of her beauty and charisma was needed to explain why Laura has such a hold over all the male characters- not just Shelby and Waldo, but also McPherson, who seems to be in love with Laura even when he believes her to be dead. The best performance comes from Webb- at this stage in his career better known as a Broadway actor than a cinema one- as Waldo, a camp, snobbish, dandyish and ultimately sinister intellectual, described by one critic as \"walking through every scene as if afraid to step in something\". Despite its convoluted plot, at times almost incomprehensible and often rather silly, \"Laura\" has acquired the reputation of being something of a classic. Like some other films noirs, such as Howard Hawks's \"The Big Sleep\", it is a film one watches less for its storyline than for its general atmosphere, which in this case is one combining luxury with cruelty and sophistication with depravity, an atmosphere heightened by Webb's suavely poisonous acting and David Raksin's fine jazz-based score. 7/10",

The famous score also did not seem good to me. The worst part is the casting, though. I know most would disagree with me, but the only bright spot in the cast is Judith Anderson, and she doesn't have too much to do. Clifton Webb is okay, I guess, but most of the forced dialogue comes from his lips. Gene Tierney is certainly one of the most beautiful Hollywood actresses, but I've always found her just a little bit to the right side of talentless. And, though both were good once in a while, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are generally two of the dullest actors from the era.

I just purchased the DVD, and the addition of a two-person commentary track lent a degree of interest to his film noir masterpiece that was quite interesting\u2014from the lead, Clifton Webb's early beginnings as a young and dashing Broadway song and dance man, to Ms. Tierney's ability to express herself in ways well beyond the pretty characters she played. But perhaps, for me anyway, it was the haunting theme of the film, \"Laura,\" written by David Raksin, that is almost as memorable as Tierney's ethereal beauty. While not originally selected for the movie's love song, is was happily, finally accepted by the director as \"the best choice.\" Funny how things work out.",

            "content": "I'm with those who find the movie over-praised. It's a decent murder mystery with some interesting ambiguities\u2014 but hardly a classic. I suspect its reputation originated in Webb's unusually androgynous snob, Tierney's ethereal beauty, and the dreamy title tune. Webb's casting is rather daring for the time, causing many to wonder about his attachment to the very female Laura\u2014is it aesthetic, mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or rather unbelievably, sexual? Unless I missed something, the screenplay never does deal with this rather obvious question, perhaps because of the mores of the time. Nonetheless, the fact of this murky attachment is central to the plot.Then too, Andrews seems ill suited to his cloddish part, remaining something of an uninteresting cipher, while Price comes across as surprisingly bland. Too bad the commanding Judith Anderson is largely wasted in an ancillary role\u2014the prospect of her trading bitchy barbs with Webb would have pepped up the many static scenes. Of course, director Preminger specialized in long takes, a style well suited to psychological drama. And when the script excels, as in Angel Face (1953), the results are compelling. Here, however, too many script holes go begging, as other reviewers well document, while the long, talky takes tend to pall.All in all, the movie does have its moments\u2014mainly Webb's\u2014and does offer grist for a slow evening\u2014 that is, is Andrews dreaming or what. But the film's elevated reputation, especially as noir, does not hold up over time.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story",
            "content": "Laura was a project, based on a pulpy novel by Vera Caspery, that director Otto Preminger had to fight 20th Century Fox Mogul, Daryl Zanuck, to get made. It was a film that everyone else involved in did not believe in and assumed would be a failure. Yet the film went on to be a huge success and was a source of influence for countless film makers and endures as a classic of the golden era of Hollywood. On the face of it, Laura was in the mode of film noir, with the conventional detective investigating the murder of a glamorous and enthralling woman- as-femme-fatale; the film offers the usual twists in narrative structure and the dubious relationships and men surrounding the central figure, and their obsessions, or neuroses; but visually the film separates itself from the dark shadows and brooding atmosphere of the conventional noir films, and brings an obsessive, illuminating Freudian drama of sexual emasculation and the fundamental flaws of masculine desire.Dana Andrews's investigating detective McPherson, is assigned to the murder case of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), an assured, successful woman, surrounded by seemingly rich and powerful men, who was gunned down in her apartment. As he uncovers information about Laura, helped by a portrait hanging on her living room wall, McPherson, like the men he interviews, becomes obsessed with the woman, as her delightful character, and her determined but innocent-like attractiveness envelops him. Clifton Webb's overtly dandy Waldo, a successful columnist, displays his love of Laura through his detailed recollections of their relationship, whilst the charming yet alarmingly vacant Shelby (Vincent Price), a man having affairs with noticeably more than one woman, is the more darkly sinister of the two, and often (perhaps innocently) implicates himself in the murder. About halfway through the film there is a huge narrative shift, which at first is jarring, as the audience is not sure if this is the fantasy or dream of McPherson, but the revelation shifts the story, questioning the reality of the two main suspects.As McPherson is drawn into the elusive Laura's lifestyle, the central focus of much of the narrative is set in the presence of a painting of Laura hanging in her room. It is an idealisation of the woman - she appears dominating in the picture - an image that is captured not by Laura, but by the men around her. This image is easier to handle that the real thing, it is a passive version of the woman. Whilst a lot is put upon the sexual power that Laura has on these men, it is the neuroses and imbalanced psyches of the men. But Laura, as we discover, is a more individual, independent woman, who perhaps does not require the desire of others. So the fantasised painted version of her can be contained and controlled. A reading could suggest that the power that Laura has over these men somehow perpetuates the incitement to murder, but in fact it would be easier to read that it is the breakdown of the masculine that is the determining factor in murder, and not necessarily a woman who is unsure of her decisions when it comes to settling.The performances are phenomenal here. Andrew's hard-boiled detective is excellent, with his proto-Columbo style of investigation, playing games with the suspects, and forcing them into corners. Price and Webb are brilliantly over-the-top - Price giving a sinister performance through the disguise of charisma. But, inevitably, the titular character, through the mysterious, seductive beauty of Tierney, is awesome in a tricksy way. She is not necessarily the traditional femme fatale, she is not consciously playing these men, yet at times the audience is unsure. Is she twisting the delusions of these men to her will? Or is she as sweet as she sometimes appears? It is an almost perfect performance.The influence of this film is undisputed. The James Elroy novel, The Black Dahlia, whilst loosely based on a true-life crime, was undoubtedly broadened by Laura's influence. The Black Dahlia has the central theme of the obsession by an investigator of a dead woman. These themes of obsession must have been directly correlated by David Lynch and Mark Frost when they wrote and conceived of Twin Peaks which began with the death of a high school girl, and the subsequent investigation unravels levels of obsession in a small community, much of which extended from this one girl. It's a wonderful, twisty, and often surprising story that illustrates that the power of women is not always a product of feminine knowing, but the failures and compulsions of weak, lonely men.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "The film \"LAURA\" based on the novel is the story of the murder around which spreads continuous tension and excitement. Extremely good acting is based on a somewhat caustic and excellent dialogue. At times felt a slight discrepancy in the script, but I think that it does not cause significant damage. The murder, three men of different character and a fascinating young woman are in the heart of the story in intriguing, exciting and mysterious thriller.I just can not resist the impression that the main female character leaves a powerful impression as a portrait in the room or the memory. Her \"return to life\" is surely the height of excitement. But her appearance is mild and somewhat unconvincing. I would say that this particular turmoil in the script.Laura is found in intriguing melodrama and very good thriller. Complications are complex and somewhat ambiguous. However, although unusual, they are not confused and smoothly move towards resolution of mysteries. Romance is definitely unconvincing and superficial. Three men in different ways in love with a young and attractive woman, and I do draw the line, because after that there is absolutely nothing.Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker is toxic columnist with sharp tongue, mentor in love, negative and dominant character and the perfect counterbalance to the young detective. Dana Andrews as Mark McPherson is a young detective full of confident that soon falls in love with a portrait of the murdered woman. Although his performance is convincing, I think that did not make it into scenes that are apparently supposed to be romantic. Vincent Price as Shelby Carpenter and Judith Anderson as Ann Treadwell act as perfect for each other. Simply good performance. Gene Tierney as Laura Hunt, I'm her performance described as pale copy of her portrait. Her appearance was the culmination of the story, everything else about her character is weak and unconvincing.Laura is a casual movie in which gradually intensifies tension. The atmosphere is great. Dialog operates honestly and realistically. Far from perfect, but at times (especially in the first part) works magic. Musical score by David Raksin is phenomenal.",

            "content": "'Laura' is a film about obsession. It is about the allure of the 'perfect woman' or maybe the allure of the idea of the 'perfect woman'. It explores male yearning and the male fantasy of attaining the woman who seems the most unattainable.Right from the beginning of the film, the memory and aura of the character of Laura which permeates through every inch of every frame is palpable. The three male characters in the story, namely Waldo, Shelby and McPherson are shown to be completely fascinated by Laura, or the idea of Laura in the case of McPherson. Just like 'Citizen Kane', the screenplay divulges details and backstory regarding the character of Laura with the help of the recollections and memories of Laura's acquaintances and the details uncovered by McPherson's investigations during the first half of the film. This film has a clear midpoint where a particular camera movement changes the tone and the perspective of the narrative.Otto Preminger was always known to explore controversial themes in his films, themes that might ruffle some feathers. We get an exploration of themes like necrophilia, gender ambiguity(through the character of Waldo) and there's even a moment of implied nudity. The cinematography is beautiful with the use of shadows and darkness similar to the noir films of Huston and Wilder. The camera movement is fluid with the use of dolly shots and as I mentioned before, there is a moment at the midpoint of the film which is ornamented by a specific pan forward of a dolly shot and what happens subsequently in the 2nd half of the film can be interpreted in various ways due to that particular camera movement. The ambiguity involved in the 2nd half of the film makes it all the more rich and adds layers to the themes going by my interpretation.The acting is solid from everyone involved, but I have to give a special mention to Clifton Webb. He commands every scene that he is a part of by exuding authority. He is also given some of the best one-liners in the film which he fires off with an electrifying intensity.Big Recommendation.",

            "content": "This film strikes most viewers as being unusually atmospheric, tense, and well-mounted. It is arguably Otto Preminger's best directing job; it has the added feature of having only six persons with featured roles, to which were added dozens of uncredited minor or supporting parts. The result in this B/W dense and shadow-haunted succession of interiors and offices is I argue an unusual and much-copied \"look\"-and a very focused mystery whose creators use their seven featured performers wisely. In assessing the film's quality, one must perhaps turn first to its artistry by understatement, suggestion and sublimated seeming lack of emotionality; David Raksin's famous song and score is universally regarded as one of the film's chief assets. Writing credit for the adaptation of Vera Caspary's apparently partly- autobiographical story goes to Jay Dratler,, Samuel Hoffenstein, Betty Reinhardt and Ring Lardner, Jr. Joseph LaShelle's cinematography added to the art direction of Leland Fuller and Lyle Wheeler are more than adequate in every respect. Thomas Liitle's set decorations are unusually good, and Bonnie Cashin's costumes enhance the desired effects. One of the opening narration's line compares the sun memorably to a burning lens; the film seems to spare no one as that magnifying glass's lens is focused on their foibles, ways and values. The famous plot line involves a lovely young woman who has been murdered in New York and the heroic detective who finds himself falling in love with her as he probes deeper into the crime and into her life's history. As the girl, Laura, Gene Tierney is pretty, bright and quite inadequate both in accent, age and training to play a brilliant female creator; playing her as a very young woman however mitigates the typical Hollywood miscasting for looks, not talent. As her micro-controlling mentor, Waldo Lydecker, Clifton Webb is both powerful and interesting throughout a long role. Dana Andrews as Mark McPherson, the smitten detective, does more with an underwritten role than can be expected or perhaps imagined; in the other featured roles, Vincent Price and Judith Anderson are asked to suggest weakness, whereas their usual forte was strength, and Price is superb. Dorothy Adams as Laura's loyal maid has her best film role here. The director does more than keep the story moving; I argue that he sustains a mood and a pace that sharpens every detail and makes every moment memorable. The storyline is frankly a bit obvious from the first; but the production is so good that the stunning climax and ending lose none of their potential power. A B/W detection classic without being noir at all, I consider this seminal work 1944 film-making at its best.",

            "content": "Film noir is supposed to be subversive but in Laura it is itself subverted in the most delightful way imaginable when you compare this film with the equally brilliant but downbeat and doom-laden Build My Gallows High (released in 1947 and also called Out of the Past which starred Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer but pretty as Jane Greer was she could not hold a candle to Gene Tierney). Build My Gallows High was a true film noir memorably described by critic James Agee as 'strong in virtues of a negative kind'. Laura is an almost infinitely subtler balance of virtues both positive and negative, but underneath them all it is founded on a sumptuous romanticism and it is the romanticism which gloriously subverts film noir here. What I suppose, borrowing a term from the classical German philosopher and poet Goethe, can be called the Eternal Feminine.In true film noir, drawing inspiration from the novels of Raymond Chandler, the women are beautiful but treacherous (he memorably described one of his femme fatales as so alluring that she could make a bishop kick in a stained glass window) and the men are helpless saps.In Laura, the eponymous heroine is well, a genuine heroine through and through, and of course in the incarnation of Gene Tierney heart- stoppingly beautiful. Most of the men are still hopeless saps. Dana Andrews as Detective Mark McPherson is a hopeless sap in a muscular way and Clifton Webb as the columnist Waldo Lydecker is a hopeless sap with a way with words. McPherson, although not as cultured as Lydecker, can nevertheless give as good as he gets when it comes to wisecracks. In one scene, Lydecker complains to Andrew's detective character, about him reading his love letters to Laura. MacPherson responds: \"Yours are the best of the bunch.\" Lydecker exudes a momentary writer's pleasure in this praise and then quickly snaps back. \"But I didn't write them for you.\" The McPherson character is given some other memorable lines in the film, too, a favourite of mine is when he exclaims in exasperation at one point: \"Isn't that is a dame for you, always pulling a switch\", in a nice little bow to film noir. I think all the leading actors and actresses give them best performances in this probably Otto Preminger's best film, which is rather hard on a director when it is also his debut. I do aver that this is Dana Andrew's best role, playing the outwardly world weary detective but with more than a hint of the romantic knight underneath, if he can ever find a maiden worth rescuing from dragons. Dana Andrews is normally associated with the flier returned home from the War in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) but I think he was too old and cultured for the role he was playing. As McPherson in Laura he is picture and word perfect. It is amusing to see a juvenile Vincent Price playing a juvenile lead. Fortunately, he soon cast aside that role for his true metier, the grand guignol. To end, this film has my absolutely favourite moment in all films of any description. It is a dark, rainy night outside and McPherson is in Laura's apartment, enjoying her good liquor, and looking up at a lovely portrait of her, which we have learnt he has put in a bid for (I wonder where that picture is now? I hope it survived) and trying to figure out from the evidence he has so far accumulated who murdered her. Looking up at the picture clinically but also looking up at the picture with love and yearning for a magnificent beauty brutally snuffed out. A beauty that Lydecker accurately surmised McPherson imagined himself by his side in the bleachers or at the police ball. Lydecker has warned McPherson that he may end being taken away by the men in white coats for \"being in love with a corpse.\"Then suddenly the door is unlocked and a woman enters the room. And the film really takes off! I need not say any more but that it is for me one of the great redemptive moments in all film. And as I say, subverts the whole genre in the most delightful and romantic way imaginable. This film noir, unlike any other, then begins to struggle its way up towards the light.",

Reportedly, she was seriously considered, however there were too many strings attached and that's another story.

How many times have you got to say... \"That guy has it bad!!\" Then in marches arrogant Clifton Webb, as columnist Waldo Lydecker, the bad guy you love to hate. Talk about a psychological train wreck! Everything changes! Vincent Price is, likewise, well cast, though not as egocentric, and in a role he personally thought was one of his best. Quite fascinating is Judith Anderson, the textbook definition\nof moodiness, if not ominous. It has been long debated, and it will continue, that LAURA may be director Otto Preminger's finest hour.

            "content": "Otto Preminger's Laura is a crackerjack suspense film, and it's all driven by character, motivation, and superb dialog. Hell, even the narration is fitting, at least when it's delivered by the likes of Clifton Webb: he was the newcomer to film, for the most part, though he was known on Broadway. This makes him an unknown quantity for audiences in 1944, and he comes off right off the bat as a little (or a lot) fishy, as he is in a bath, seeming like an aristocrat but nothing more than a 'columnist' of pretentious heights. Indeed, the best word to use for Webb's performance is pretentious, but in the best complimentary way: you may be able to peg him, but he is able to spin a tail like it's nobody's business. Hell, he even gives Dana Andrews a bit of the slip. At first.What drives this story is this woman at the center: is Gene Tierney's title character a dastardly \"dame\"? What's she playing at? Suspected dead, and yet (as we are soon to find out, not really a \"spoiler\" exactly, unless you want to go in totally blind), she keeps her own self mysterious. But unlike Webb's character/performance, Tierney may have more underneath, and yet it's interesting how she starts out as a very decent, kind person. That first scene that Lydecker describes when Laura comes up to his table, trying to offer advertising and Laura being rebuffed and her all-too-kind response, says it all, even as it's from HIS point of view. He could make her out to be worse than she is, but if anything she is the sweetest person ever - even, or especially, as she puts him out during his lunch. Good heavens! Andrews is the detective here, and yet for a role that is practically the straight-guy - that is, the one without the same levels of personality as Webb and Price - he delivers the goods as well. There's a scene where he is alone in Lydecker's apartment at night, pondering details, having drinks like any good private dick in a film noir, and stares at the portait of Laura. For a moment I almost wondered if Preminger would go into the surreal - is Laura's return for \"real\"? It's that convincing of a film noir world, of the unexpected, of the subterfuge coming up over and over, of the 'disguises', that it could have been plausible, if only for a moment.Of course, this is Hollywood in 1944, a studio production under Zanuck, so it can't get TOO crazy. What Laura provides for the viewer, most so for someone looking for a solid example of what film noir was, is mystery and intrigue, and Motivations with a capital M. You know there are some slippery characters, and this includes an older woman who admits at a key point to the main character that she *could* conceive of committing murder (though she doesn't). When you have actors playing these people, becoming them even, you know something is up through the first half, you don't quite know what it is, and neither does Andrews' detective. And he may be tricky too: is he falling for her? One can hope, at this point, that it's not so - even if she may be what she appears to be... or she isn't, who knows? You want to go along for the 'ride' in Laura because of the personalities, and what can turn on a dime in an instant. Preminger keeps the screws tight with the plot, but also manages to get a helluva lot of spectacular images. Sometimes it's just the placement of four people in a frame, showing the depth of the composition, with those blinds-through-the-window providing that light that gives everything a further mystery. One might find it a clich\u00e9 today, but Preminger is among those creating the language of noir (at the same time as Wilder with Double Indemnity, at least in part with Hitchcock), and it all adds to the material.There doesn't feel a moment wasted here, not when Laura gets an all-too-bright light shone on her in an interrogation, not when Price tries to flub his way through another talk and barely gets by. It's enticing, exciting, the music is tense and the script has more than its share of wit and zingers. Immensely watchable as a classic 40's noir.",

He did much of the same in Hurry Sundown and other films he has made, except when the writing was just too powerful.In this film, nearly everyone is an unlikable character, a staple of film noir, and even Laura herself is nearly so because of the excessive praise heaped upon her by others.

Otto Preminger was able to direct a movie that is gripping and very mysterious because of the storyline, and at the same time tremendously dialogue-oriented, because of its structure.He gave this noir movie a fine European touch, mainly due to the fact that there aren't any spectacular gun fights, chases or on-screen murders, but the emphasis is put on dialogues, which encourage one's imagination to produce vivid images of the crime.It's a tale of brutal murder, and huge obsession that lead to it. However, the unexpected turn, placed brilliantly somewhere in the middle of the movie, makes it even more suspenseful.The film makes a great use of various flashbacks to show the roots of this enormous obsession and jealousy coming from the side of Waldo Lydecker.Fine narrative voice-over that is somehow very similar to the one used later in Sunset Boulevard. It is supposed to set the mood and impose an intrigue that will satisfy the viewer and make him concentrated on every detail of the story.You can see the director's professionalism in every aspect of the film. For one, he makes a fascinating use of symbolism, and various elements that come with it (namely the two clocks), which ultimately lead to an important discovery, providing the horrifying explanation of this tough case.Dana Andrews is fantastic as a detective, who is serious about his job, but at the same time inescapably falls in love with the girl, whose murder he is investigating. He wants to show how tough and unemotional he can be when it comes to his line of work, but after some time the only thing he cares about is Laura and her safety.Talking about the titular girl: Gene Tierney is really appealing and convincing as pure, seemingly innocent and very amiable Laura. Her mesmerizing beauty makes it very easy to believe that every man falls in love with her right away and wants to have her only to himself.Clifton Webb is great as this really clever and wise writer, who with a little help of his huge intelligence and cunningness is able to convince everyone that he should be the least suspected person in the whole case. All in all, Laura is a very fine thriller with a properly developed plot and well-selected cast of characters. Everyone can be a suspect, just like in all the decent detective tale that you will find. But the somber atmosphere surrounding the story and incredible jealousy and obsessive behavior depicted in it provide for a noir title that everybody should see at least once.",

            "content": "For decades LAURA has had a big reputation as one of the all-time greats of Hollywood Golden Age cinema. People gush and sigh when they talk about it. It inspires awe. I had seen snippets of it over the years but always lost interest after about five minutes. Having just watched the whole thing through, I now know why. Three of the main characters are cast with boring actors, so that whenever they are on screen the movie sags and dies. Those actors are: Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Tierney is at least beautiful, so that even though you don't care one whit about her as a human being she is pleasant to behold. And truth be told, she did excellent work in subsequent films. Andrews was one of the most nondescript actors of his generation with no distinguishing features and no passion. Vincent Price, who exuded villainy without trying, could have been better but he was either given bad direction by Otto Preminger or had not yet developed much as an actor; as he evolves through the course of the story we never care about him, never feel what he must be feeling, but only listen to his dialogue so that we can follow the plot. He goes through the motions of what his character is supposed to be in a limp fashion. He is supposed to be from Kentucky but hardly ever uses that accent, and when he does, it's weak. It is also puzzling that the title character, praised by others for her warmth and genius and intelligence and magnetism, would be attracted to such a zero. The script is good and witty and clever but these actors do not live up to it. There are, however, two actors who do indeed live up to it, and those actors are Clifton Webb and Judith Anderson. Whenever they are on screen the film crackles and delights. With this performance, Webb launched a long and successful screen persona as the sarcastic, effete authority figure. Anderson, with her softly cutting voice, chews up any acting partner other than Webb; her scene with Tierney in the ladies' room as she dissects her own character and that of Price is\u0085 priceless! Dorothy Adams is also very good as Tierney's loyal maid. The plot itself is nothing special - just a rather routine murder mystery with more in-depth participants than usual. It's a handsome production that physically evokes the penthouse world of New York City in the 40s. The photography is attractive. The score is overrated. After the initial 8-note repeated opening motif the much-lauded title tune fizzles out.",

            "review_title": "A magnificent film-noir founded on Laura - Gene Tierney's beauty",
            "content": "Strangely enough, of all movies Gene Tierney starred in, \"Laura\" seems to be the only one where Gene's supernatural beauty is the real core of the story. The movie has great merits: the dialogue is sharp and witty, the timing is admirable, the cinematography is stylish and accurate, the mystery is exciting, the suspense in the final scene is cleverly elaborated. The justly celebrated music is unforgettable and the acting of the whole cast is excellent. Yet the peculiar atmosphere of the film is created by Laura Hunt-Gene Tierney's beauty, by the way it deeply affects all the characters of the film. A relevant instance is the adoration paid to Laura by her maid Bessie (Dorothy Adams). She considers her \"young lady\" the pattern of all perfections, especially moral ones. Actually, we realize that Bessie is overwhelmed by Laura's beauty, by her natural grace, class and refinement, and she makes the easy identification \"perfect beauty = perfect goodness\".\nThe cop Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) sees her portrait and utters \"Not bad\": in fact these words, somewhat rude, deliberately intended to assert his own tough-guy status, show us that he is smitten, that his feelings are taking a way he's not able to check. Very soon we'll see him rummaging Laura's clothes and toilette-ware like a miserable fetishist.\nLaura for the shrewish aesthete Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) is the insuperable work of art he has contributed to create: now his task is to preserve her from the touch of the coarse paws of other men.\nThe fatuous phoney Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) is probably scared by Laura: he feels deeply inadequate to her superior endowments, and he prefers to chase cheap girls and to pursue his career of squalid gigolo.And Laura is excruciating also for her aunt Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson): and not just because Anne is aged and unattractive. In fact this rich and selfish lady seems to be apt to face any younger and prettier woman to reach her love-goals: but how to struggle with the goddess Venus?Thus we realize that everyone could have a reason to desire Laura's death. And yet, for all the awe and disorder her divine beauty spreads over people surrounding her, Laura is not an idol. She is a sound woman, with a career she faces with determination, and with a \"modern\" way to treat males. In fact she makes free and abundant use of her sex-appeal, and she appears to amuse herself in collecting \"dopes\", as McPherson puts it. This contrast between the idealized and the actual Laura makes a fine artistic effect, creditable to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger.Well, Laura is certainly a wonderful dream for the viewer of the movie. Nonetheless, don't forget this character was played by a real woman, an actress of superb talent: her name is Gene Tierney. After fifty-six years (fifty-six!)  we are still inundated by her incredible beauty, loveliness, grace, class, refinement, sex-appeal. Bless the cinema, which forever preserves this joy for all us!",

            "content": "I probably saw this first on TV as early as the 1950's. Have seen it many times since and can probably recite much of the dialog by heart.I agree with most of the positive reviews and I'm glad it has stood the test of time (considering the times in which it was made). I was a young girl so impressed, I named my first daughter, \"Laura\" -- as much for the beautiful theme as for the character. I also found and read the novel at a used book sale in the late '60s and owned an original copy of the sheet music. I was surprised to find out that this is considered a film noir classic. A film noir with a happy ending? Just the type of old classic movie to thrill a young girl's heart.My impressions then: Laura was a glamorous career woman -- even for the 1950's when I first encountered her, but I enjoyed Gene Tierney's movies, because I could identify with her. Much is said about her socialite and high class background and demure; however, she had an every girl quality too and many educated young women fancied themselves quite sophisticated a la Tierney. Beautiful yes, but there were many actresses even more beautiful. Don't forget the overbite.I most recently saw this movie in the past few years. Clifton Webb is the star of this movie -- a fine actor -- but he had the best lines by far. Vincent Price overacted (as he always did), and Dana Andrews literally sleepwalked (nothing new). Gene Tierney just glowed with star quality as ever. I love when old movies can just suggest what's happened thru dialog and acting, instead of beating you over the head and rubbing your face in it. But I did wonder, this time, what Mark and Laura would have in common or even to talk about once they rolled out of bed.Laura is a perfect movie for its time, but I don't believe it would impress my daughter. It would probably be a yawn.",

Am I jaded, did I miss something and/or what's all the fuss over this movie? I figured out in the first 15 minutes who the murderer was and except for some great costumes this flick was regrettably disappointing. The music became insipid after so many rounds. The only notable acting was on the part of Clifton Webb ....Waldo Lydecker, who struck me as over the top gay...but of course being 1944...still in the closet. This is a famous movie and I was expecting to be astonished with it's masterful cinematography and script but neither were that outstanding.  As for film noir, there are many better examples. \u0091The Third Man' and \u0091Notorious' come quickly to mind.\nI think the problem with Laura is that the characters were so lackluster it was difficult to get involved with them. I really disliked Vincent Price in this movie. He was so unconvincing as a Southern gigolo type and he wasn't charming or good looking enough for us to think that Laura could ever truly fall for him. The investigating detective, Dana Andrews ....Lt. Mark McPherson was not exactly inspired, but at least he could act well enough to be convincing as a policeman. Lastly, Laura herself  was really just a pretty face...the very pretty face of Gene Tierney but nothing like the Pygmalion of a woman she was supposed to be portraying. In fact she had more spunk and magnetism before Waldo Lydecker got a hold of her and transformed her into a proper lady. At least it's not listed in the top 100 of IMDB...I hate that when that happens!",

            "content": "\"Laura\".....for me, the very title evokes a flood of nostalgia for the charming, long lost, politically incorrect era of mid-40's America.  From the haunting theme by David Raskin, later so wistfully verbalized by Johnny Mercer and recorded by a young Sinatra on Columbia....Oh, just try and find a current lyric to compare with \"Laura, is the face in the misty light, footsteps that you hear down the hall, a laugh that floats on a summer night that you can never quite recall...and you see Laura, on the train that is passing through, those eyes, how familiar they seem...she gave her very first kiss to you, that was Laura, but she's only a dream...\"This movie, which I first saw as a youngster, burned a hole in my memory, though I didn't of course appreciate its subtle undertones until many years later.  It might have more properly been titled \"Waldo\", since the real protagonist was the prissy, acerbic and vindictive narrator, played to perfection by Clifton Webb, a Broadway dancer and actor whom the Fox executives pleaded with Preminger to replace (he being \"one of those\" at that time)...fortunately Otto refused, and Webb went on to become one of their top stars, with a seven year contract.  The only other comparable movie character of a similar vein I can think of was Adison DeWitt (eight years later, by the nasally sonorous George Sanders in \"All About Eve\").You can check out the many summaries which precede mine, but what can I tell 'ya!  Gene Tierney manages to look iridescent throughout, despite those terribly dated hats which were de rigeur in that era...Dana Andrews is perfect as the sardonic gumshoe who matches Lydecker's pretentious observations with his street-smart bottom line comebacks...Vincent Price exemplifies the heap big smoke no fire gigolo...Judith Anderson, portraying the tarnished lady \"of a certain age\" who unabashedly takes what she can get...and, finally, Clifton Webb...the real star of the movie.  One cannot help but admire his baring of the soul portrayal, from the opening scene where he sits in his tub, exposing his frailty for all the world to see, stands up and asks McPherson for a towel.  Next time you view this, watch for the ever so momentary smirk by Dana Andrews as he complies, glancing downward.Finally, I am duty bound to inform you, gentle reader, that McPherson did NOT fall in love with Laura's admittedly haunting portrait (as most movie reviewers insist)...nobody falls in love with the mere subject of a painting...it was Lydecker's entrancing verbal portrait, combined with the reminiscences of all who knew her, reading her private love letters and finally, the smell of lingering perfume in her garments that captivated him before they even met.  To wrap this up, \"Laura\" should be compulsory viewing for Hollywood's current money men, though most of them would walk out after five minutes...\"Where's the HOOK, no explosions, no teen market, no tie-ins...no nothin'!\"",

The screenplay is loaded with so many wonderfully cynical zingers that you start to wonder if Oscar Wilde was actually alive and living in Hollywood in the 40's!  Director Otto Preminger keeps everything moving speedily and smoothly along in the swanky settings of elite Manhattan.  Gene Tierney, one of the great beauties of the decade, is elegant and beguiling in the title role.  A young Vincent Price , with thick wavy hair and a surprisingly athletic-looking build is cast (to say the least) against type as a gigolo, and Dame Judith Anderson is great as his keeper.  I thought she really nailed  her last big scene with Tierney with some brilliant underplaying. Clifton Webb makes an indelible impression as Bitch Supreme Waldo Lydecker (a name you'll never forget).  Only Dana Andrews disappointed me - likeable and competent, but a more charismatic actor could have been used.  Anyway, this is one of the greats: don't miss it!",

The fact that people are narrating these stories keeps making me question the validity of the stories. It's a hard-boiled Agatha Christie mystery with the stone faced detective.

And anyone who crosses his path had better watch out.Seen through his cynical eyes, every one of the sophisticated phonies who infested Laura's life is guilty -- guilty just for knowing her and not keeping her out of harm's way. They try to put on a show of seeming dismayed at her murder, but the dogged gumshoe won't believe a word.

He just seems to be a bitchy runt playing a bitchy runt. Perhaps they thought the lines they provided for him were transgessive, cutting and witty as say... Oscar Wilde might write, but standing around berating people in scene after scene is not as entertaining as they think. Wilde had pithy insight, Webb has only invective. You end up wondering \"What on earth does Laura see in this ass?\" Skip this and watch George Sanders tear up the scenery as Lord Harry in Picture of Dorian Grey; he's a treat to watch as he heaps contempt on society, because no matter how horrible his remarks are, he's always entertaining. Waldo is a cut-rate Lord Harry. Even the sociopathic words that come out of Jimmy Stewart's mouth in Rope provide more entertainment than this. Adding to the confusion is that Waldo is a mincing little runt, and a pain in the ass from his first moment. And he's the one who turns out also to be the psychotic killer. Mmm... biiiiiiig surprise. (< sarcasm) He's the most obvious culprit. This isn't very satisfying. Giant plothole: if he can bring a shotgun to Laura's without detection, why does he need to leave it behind?Why do we have to look at Webb's withered little body is his tub? Why do I have to be given a mental image of this 80-pound dork naked, getting out of his tub? Why would you ever put his partially unclothed body on film? Why would the ass ever agree to it?

Yet, under its elegant facade of debutantes and high-society fashion is a world of ravenous jealousy, deceptive passions, intriguing blackmail, and faux murder. The film pits gruff police detective, Mark McPhereson (Dana Andrews) against smug and cultured columnist, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb). McPherson has been assigned to investigate the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney in her best role), a handsome woman who seemingly had no enemies in life. Through a series of interviews conducted with potential suspects, McPherson builds his profile of the dead girl \u0096 all the while falling under the spell of her striking portrait. But the puzzle unravels when the murder victim materializes in a bizarre twist of fate that forces McPhereson to re-think his entire case.Preminger's direction is flawless \u0096 effortlessly moving from near humorous moments in the dynamic clash of wills between McPherson and Lydecker, to haunting segments of full bodied thrills involving the strangely surreal heroine of the piece. Dame Judith Anderson turns in a stellar performance as the diabolical socialite with an agenda; Ann Treadwell, while Vincent Price's oily performance as gigolo, Shelby Carpenter is nothing short of sublime. David Raksin's lush theme has since entered our collective consciousness and movie going heritage.Fox's DVD exhibits a superb transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with exceptional tonality and attention to fine detail. The picture is generally sharp and pleasing on the eyes. Blacks are very rich, deep and solid. Whites are on the whole clean. Occasionally one will detect a note of edge enhancement and the odd age related artifact, but these are bare quibbling on an otherwise flawless presentation. The audio is mono and very nicely balanced. A hint of background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes, but again, for a film element that is pushing 70 years, there's really nothing to complain about. This DVD comes with well deserved extras; including two Biography specials \u0096 one on Gene Tierney, the other on Vincent Price; deleted scenes, a superlative audio commentary by David Raskin, Rudy Behlmer and Jeanine Basinger, and the film's original theatrical trailer.

MacPherson into what really happened to Laura before she finally left,via shotgun blast to the head, the scene!***MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*** Halfway into the movie Det.MacPherson who's become as obsessed with a dead Laura Hunt as Waldo Lydcker was with a live one gets the shock of his life with Laura, or her ghost, coming back from the grave. This changes the entire movie plot in that if it wasn't Laura who was murdered then who was! It's then that Laura's \"murderer\" starts to trip himself up in realizing that his mission in life by blowing Laura away had completely failed! What really ticked the guy off was that the now as beautiful as ever Laura was in fact the one person who could expose him. Not in her murder but the person whom he mistakenly murdered, thinking that she was Laura, in her place: Fashion model Diane Redfern!The films shocking climax has Det. MacPherson finally realize who Laura's or really Diane's killer really was by him giving himself away in his openly hostel attitude towards the New York City policeman in MacPherson trying to take Laura away from him. It was a dangerous long shot of a chance but Det. MacPherson had planted the murder weapon that the killer offed Diane with where he had originally hid it! All it took to prove who he is was for the killer to retrieve the shotgun but that also put Laura's, in who's apartment the murder weapon was hidden, life in danger as well! That's if McPherson and his fellow cops didn't get there in time to prevent him from murdering her!P.S The movies haunting theme song \"Laura\" that was written by David Raskin and put into the movie on it's director Otto Preminger's strong insistence over the first choice the top honchos at 20th Century wanted Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\".",

It has the black-and-white cinematography, the witty dialogue, the cool, suave-talking villains, the detective (points for not being too cynical), the compulsive smoking. But it never struck me as special. It's got twists and turns, but it's no more complicated that the usual byzantine plots of film noirs. In the end it's just a well-written, well-acted, well-directed movie. That's enough for me.Detective Mark McPherson is called in to investigate the murder of socialite Laura Hunt. He starts rounding up the suspects quickly: famous newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, who can ruin people with his witty writing; Shelby Carpenter, Laura's fianc\u00e9e; Mrs. Ann Treadwell, who was in love with Carpenter.Most of the action takes place at Laura's apartment: suspects come in and out at their own will, drink her own liquor, especially McPherson when he's on duty; talk about the past and possible motives. Meanwhile McPherson becomes interested in Laura's portrait so much that Lydecker makes a lovely necrophiliac joke (pretty good for a 1945 movie), and the movie could have become really interesting and unique if they had gone this creepy route. Unfortunately the screenwriters prefer to dazzle the audience with a twist which The Third Man later stole, and the movie became ordinary again.Clifton Webb is the center of this movie: he plays a witty, poisonous bastard and deserved the nomination. In the end everyone is to commend here: Vincent Price is great, of course; Gene Tierney is not as pretty as her photographs would lead one to assume, but she can act; and Dana Andrews manages not to be too dull as a cop devoid of any interesting trait.Laura is a pretty good movie, quite watchable and entertaining, and many scenes and lines will stay in the mind long after the movie is over.",

The setup to this one along with its flashbacks got me thoroughly interested, and there is an intriguing surprise about halfway through. Unfortunately all of what follows in the second half doesn't really hang together as the film throws improbable red herrings our way and has several plot holes. There's also a distinct lack of passion in all of these relationships, or at best you might say it's understated because of the Production Code. The cast and the glamorous feel of the production are the reasons to watch this one, and it seems emblematic of the era in Hollywood.My favorite line was from Judith Anderson, who plays Laura's aunt that has the hots for Price, explaining why he's better for her thusly:\n\"Because I can afford him and understand him. He's no good, but he's what I want. I'm not a nice person, Laura. Neither is he. He knows I know he's just what he is. He also knows that I don't care. We belong together because we're both weak and can't seem to help it. That's why I know he's capable of murder. He's like me.\"",

With little to do other than look hauntingly enigmatic Gene Tierney scores heavily in the eponymous role and probably never equalled it again despite several notable At Bats.

Enjoyable and entertaining adaptation of Vera Caspary's novel has nevertheless been overpraised throughout the years--it isn't so much a film-noir as it is a glossy, cushy whodunit (and one with only a whisper of mystery). Gene Tierney is alarmingly subdued as Laura; even when portraying her character as an ambitious working girl in the flashbacks, Tierney has faraway eyes and a faraway voice that hold no conviction, no passion. Much better are the men in the cast, particularly Dana Andrews as the cop who calls women \"dames\" (it's really Andrews' movie). Otto Preminger directs with a sure, steady hand, and the dialogue by screenwriters Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt is witty and brittle, but there's not much surprise in the finale-there are too few suspects. **1/2 from ****",

            "review_title": "Not really noir, but old chestnut of a murder mystery suspense thriller still holds our interest",
            "content": "Don't ask me why Laura, Otto Preminger's adaptation of Vera Caspary's 1943 novel of the same name, is considered film noir. Most noirs are darkly lit, but this one is kind of bright and pretty much a conventional murder mystery/thriller to boot. It's very talky featuring few exterior scenes--which on initial viewing might lead one to conclude that this was based entirely on a stage play.\nThe film begins with Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigating the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), a successful advertising executive. Andrews can do little with the McPherson role as the character is a straight-laced macho guy who oddly falls in love with the woman whose murder he is investigating. The first person he interviews is Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), the acerbic newspaper columnist/critic who narrates how he met Laura in a flashback.\nWebb, who hadn't acted in films since 1930 (14 years before), steals the show as Lydecker, an obviously closeted homosexual, but only hinted at due to the year the film was made (1944). There's been quite a bit of discussion as to why a gay person would become so obsessed with a woman since his sexual orientation appears to be directed toward the same sex. Lydecker's obsession however, really isn't sexual-it's more about control and when he loses his grip on Laura (whose career he successfully promoted), all his resentments rise to the surface.\nThe flashback at the beginning actually is the weakest part of the film as it goes on for too long and little seems to be happening in earnest. It does establish the shock all of Laura's friends and associates experience upon hearing about her murder-and it sets up the startling plot twist that makes the film so interesting. And that of course is that since the murder victim was shot in the face, was at Laura's home and dressed in Laura's bathrobe, it was assumed that of course it was Laura. But we soon discover that Laura is very much alive. It's Lydecker who's most shocked when he sees his former charge in the flesh, alive and kicking-he actually ends up fainting (eventually we realize this is a red herring to throw us off track about his character)!\nTo keep us guessing, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), Laura's on and off again fianc\u00e9, is another character whose sexuality is in question (why Laura falls for him at all is certainly questionable too but perhaps she's eventually so repulsed by Lydecker's obsessive behavior, that she perceives him as \"welcome relief\").Meanwhile there's also Laura's socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell, who also has some of the best lines in the film, as she exclaims her love for Shelby (\"We belong together because we're both weak and can't seem to help it. That's why I know he's capable of murder; he's like me.\")\nEventually the true murder victim is identified as a model who had a job working for Laura's advertising firm. The film is not realistic as more recent police procedurals are (for example McPherson allows Lydecker to accompany him during his round of interviews). SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. In the end, the caustic bon vivant, Lydecker, reveals his true colors when he sneaks back into Laura's apartment, and tries to do her in a second time. A series of police bullets prevents him from accomplishing the dastardly deed.\nTierney as Laura is serviceable in another \"straight man\" role just like Andrews is as McPherson. But it's really the \"tag team\" of Webb and Price who provide the film's color. They, along with the engaging murder mystery, will keep a modern audience as interested as one that first saw the film, when it opened just as World War II was about to end.",

Webb chooses her dresses and her hair style to give her the power image she needs to rocket to the top of the advertising business.The whole gimmick in this film is that Laura (Tierney) is thought to have been murdered but it was someone else who received a two barrels of bird shot to the face causing this mixup.. this person was also in Laura's apartment and wearing her negligee and shoes. Laura was out of town. Unfortunately the story is pretty simple minded with the denouement being in my opinion a hole in the plot. The queen (Webb) did the murder as he didn't want to lose Tierney to someone who wanted to marry her (Vincent Price). Webb then hid the shot gun in an antique clock in the apartment.Why would he do that?! since he was able to bring it into the building undetected why not leave with it?? Besides he had several days to retrieve it as well. And of course it indicates the police were clueless in their search techniques.RECOMMEND for the score and a look at a social setting (1944) when the US was still truly a great country--unfortunately it is all shot on a set so you can't see NYC as it was then.

The blocking that he came up with, not to mention camera angles, were things that were passe in 1913, when D.W. Griffith came out with THE MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY. This dreck is NOT film-noir.

Everyone not only Likes Laura, they are Infatuated with Her almost as if She were of a Different Realm or is Casting a Spell. She Rarely seems Intelligent or Charming, just Mesmerizing.When the Detective Whips Out His Toy Baseball Game the Contrivance is Consummated with this Clumsy and Hammy Display from the Director that just doesn't work. Laura is a One Dimensional \"Witch\" that is Stunning but Shallow and Her Portrait has about as much Personality. Waldo's Asexuality is a Key Quirk that Helps the Film Create some of its Attraction and it is as much His Film as Laura's. Vincent Price and Judith Anderson do Their Part to Help Elevate the Plain Direction from the Plainest of Directors.",

            "review_title": "Overrated Noir",
            "content": "In the early 40s a new sub-genre of crime films began to emerge in America. The sub- genre I am of course talking about is Noir films. These films were characterized by several, and yet vague, similarities. (Hard boiled police detectives/private eyes, Femme Fatales, \"Whodunit\" style mysteries.) And one of the earliest films to come out of the new Noir sub- genre was Otto Preminger's Laura.Laura begins with opening narration that tells us that the title character (played by Gene Tierney.) has been murdered. And the film then follows Detective Lt. Mark McPherson (played by Dana Andrews.) as he goes around interrogating Laura's friends and acquaintances trying to figure out who did it and why. As can be expected of all noir films, Laura takes several unexpected, and sometimes unnecessary, twists and turns. Many of the characters turn out to be very different from what they at first appeared to be. And among all of this Detective McPherson starts to fall in love with the deceased Laura. The story for Laura, like most noir films, is by itself pretty interesting and intriguing. But unfortunately it is for the most part ruined by the films weak dialogue and performances. I wouldn't call any of the dialogue or performances bad, but they're not good either. It all seems so stiff and forced, so many things in the film that don't make sense and just happen for convenience, for example in the beginning when detective Mark McPherson lets another suspect tag along with him as he interrogates other suspects, that doesn't make any sense, no detective would let another suspect tag along with him as he interrogates other suspects. And there is almost no chemistry between any of the actors, even the ones that are supposed to be in love. In fact you almost start to wonder if anybody really cares about anything, in the film, especially McPherson. Who, for the first half of the film, does basically nothing in solving the case, and doesn't really do much more in the second half.But hey, even though the acting and writing are just meh. Maybe the film makes up for by having that classic gorgeous noir aesthetic? Well not really. Laura doesn't have a lot going on stylistically, the cinematography is alright, nothing game-changing, but it has some nicely lit shoots. (It is worth mentioning that Laura won the Oscar for best cinematography, which I think is most likely undeserved.) And the soundtrack is completely forgettable, not one part ever rose above passable. The production design is typical for Hollywood films of the time and is just functional. And yet even with lackluster dialogue, acting, cinematography, production design and soundtrack, Laura is still considered a classic today.I can reasonably understand why the film was so liked at the time but today, it seems so dated and dull. The film isn't even that culturally significant. Several amazing Noir films came out before Laura, like The Maltese Falcon. And as far as I can tell Laura didn't bring anything new or innovative to the Noir genre, and noir films would have developed just fine without it. And after reading several reviews that highly praised Laura, I still don't have any idea why it's considered to be so great. But for whatever reason Laura is praised as a masterpiece of American cinema. I've already said it won the Oscar for best cinematography, but it was also nominated for four others including best director. Laura was added to Roger Ebert's Great Movies in 2002. And Laura came in 73rd place on AFI's (American film institute) top 100 thrilling American films, coming ahead of films like Blade Runner, The Third Man, and Blue Velvet. And 4th on AFI's top ten mystery films. And in 1999 it was selected by the Library of Congress to be preserved in the U.S. National Film Registry. So for whatever reason people seem to really like Laura, and I, for whatever reason, can not get into it. However. I would still recommend that you watch it, because who knows you might enjoy more than me. Even though I would argue that the film is for the most part pretty bland. 6.2/10",

Then again, with photography directors of the caliber of Joseph LaShelle and the uncredited Lucien Ballard, it just could not go wrong.Perhaps best of all - the acting. Handsome Dana Andrews had a distinguished career but he was never better, not even in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES. He is the hardboiled, committed detective McPherson who becomes obsessed with the Laura Hunt case, and specifically with the dead Laura.Then, Clifton Webb. I cannot understand how Webb did not get the supporting role Oscar for his portrayal of Waldo Lydecker. In 1945, that Oscar went to Barry Fitzgerald in a forgettable role in an equally forgettable movie called GOING MY WAY.Although Tierney and Andrews are also first class, Webb steals the show as the completely self-absorbed, cold and calculating Lydecker, who has a larger than life vision of his own merits. He is refined evil incarnate in the shape of Waldo Lydecker, also obsessed with Laura but for different reasons, his diction simultaneously something to savor and repel.Vincent Price has one of his best roles outside of horror movies; Judith Anderson is superb. Her short conversation with Laura about how she could kill adds an unsuspected dimension to her seemingly easy-going and sweet character; and, finally, gorgeous Gene Tierney in her most memorable role, absolutely to die for yet with very earthly and even selfish interests.Otto Preminger's direction is impeccable throughout, including a neat finale which must have impressed even the great master, Alfred Hitchcock.Superlative screenplay, as close to flawless as the cinema has had.The interiors are classy but almost overladen with ornament, just as most characters populating this movie are burdened with many layers of conscious and not so conscious sins. In contrast, the physical settings of McPherson's police station interrogation room are Spartan, almost. Albeit blinded by his obsession over Laura Hunt, McPherson is the driving light that removes all dark corners and uncovers the murderer.I have watched Laura many times, and always I come away looking forward to watching it again.I wish I could award it more than 10/10. It deserves more. It is one of my Top 10 all-time favorites.",

            "content": "This is a classic example of perfect film noir, which, no doubt, helped the 40s and early 50s establish other movies in the same category. \"Laura\" ranks right up there with \"The Maltese Falcon\", \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Woman In The Window\". The casting could not have be more impeccable, the sets, cinematography, and costumes more exquisite, and the music and direction more superb.The story begins with the viciously cutting and sarcastic Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb, making his sound debut), recounting and recalling the late Laura Hunt (the enigmatically lovely Gene Tierney), and his relationship with her, as told to Lt. Mark McPherson (the darkly handsome Dana Andrews, perfect casting) the detective investigating what appears to be Laura's tragic murder. We see the heroine through Waldo's eyes at first, presenting her as he wants her to be seen. Her fianc\u00e9e, the weak but charming gigolo Shelby Carpenter (a young and very tall Vincent Price) and his benefactress, Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson), are also interviewed and questioned by the increasingly infatuated policeman, who finds himself becoming obsessed with the victim, all the while trying to find the culprit. He all but moves into her beautifully decorated apartment, goes through her belongings and stares longingly at the painted portrait of her that hangs over the mantle. The scene where he rifles through the top drawer of her dresser leaves so much to the imagination. You can feel his loving desire for her in every expression that crosses his hardened but sensitive face. But, as true noir form, things are not always what they seem. Laura is in fact, alive, and the woman killed in her apartment is one of the models who worked for her advertising agency. The circumstances surrounding the crime and the vast array of possible suspects make it a perplexing puzzle for McPherson, who now has to deal with his growing love for the seemingly unobtainable \"dame\". He has to stop at nothing to discover the truth, while danger lurks in the shadows once again.This movie is just a masterpiece of film-making, no questions asked. The score, by composer David Raksin, is as famous and haunting now as it was then. The \"Laura Theme\" can still be found on CD today. Otto Preminger, originally the film's producer, replaced director Rouben Mamoulian, in one of those wonderful circumstances that has often made entertainment. Supposedly, there are original sequences that were cut and unused, giving the film almost legendary status.The sad fact that so many of these older movies have never been released on video or DVD, has underscored that Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney made a wonderful screen team - they appeared in \"Tobacco Road\", \"Belle Star\" (both 1941), were teamed as husband in wife in \"The Iron Curtain\" (1948), and were reunited with Preminger in the stylish film noir, \"Where The Sidewalk Ends\" (1950), which was finally released on DVD in December 2005. The three other films, sadly have never seen video release, as for DVD, that remains in question. Andrews, a shamefully underrated actor, is best remember for this role, but he also gave memorable performances in \"The Ox-Bow Incident\" opposite Henry Fonda, \"Boomerang\", \"Beyond A Reasonable Doubt\", \"The Curse of the Demon\", \"The Purple Heart\", and the classic, \"The Best Years Of Our Lives\".This film has recently been released on DVD, with a deleted scene, an extended version of the film, the theatrical trailer and two different commentaries. Enjoy the romantic suspense all over again! See if you can get the theme song out of your head.",

            "content": "Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney (a man with a woman's name, and a woman with a man's) star as the romantic leads in this Preminger-directed noir, a precursor by seven years of the same team's \"Where The Sidewalk Ends\".  The beautiful Laura (Tierney in a succession of preposterously floppy hats) has been murdered.  Who dunnit?     A workmanlike B-movie, \"Laura\" contains more than its share of good things.  Sets of house interiors are quite remarkable, and the library set is classic noir.  A young Vincent Price is impressive in the straight role of Shelby Carpenter, prime suspect (this film was made, after all, several years before he started doing his irony thing).  few films-noirs could resist a shot of the Manhattan skyline, and this one is no exception.  Time is telescoped and inverted cleverly in this story of distorted recollection. Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) is rather bizarrely introduced to the viewer sitting in his bathtub, and he dries and dresses in an impossibly short time.  Similar narrative tricks are played in the meal with McPherson (Dana Andrews' character).  The best of these effects is the \"Brighton Rock\" style speech, played to great effect once the identity of the killer is known. The business with Waldo and the grandfather clock is positively Hitchcockian.     \"This is beginning to assume fabulous aspects,\" comments Waldo, and indeed some ingredients of the film are far-fetched and clumsily handled. Would a murder suspect EVER be allowed to sit in on the police interviews of other suspects?  We are told that \"when a dame gets killed, she doesn't worry about how she looks\", a philosophy which seems to extend to supporting actors corpsing on-camera.  Poor Vincent Price is left with absolutely nothing to do or say during a very long take.  Would a 22-year-old working girl own a palatial apartment like this?  Would a cop investigating a murder make himself at home on the dead girl's property?  Or handle evidence (Diane Redfern's dress and the shotgun) so casually?  Would he serve breakfast to a murder suspect?  The arrest is overly dramatic, and the punching of the prisoner a little too much, even for 1944.     However, even with its myriad implausibilities, \"Laura\" works.  It is an absorbing piece of entertainment which draws the viewer into its own unique imagined space.  A film which can do that must be a success.",

            "content": "I originally came to this film without any knowledge of it beyond having read that it was an exceptional film--and given that LAURA is at heart a noir mystery, that was perhaps for the best. So, if you prefer to skip the commentary and approach the film untainted, I give my recommendation now: see it immediately.Based on the popular novel by Vera Caspery, LAURA begins as a mystery pure and simple: Laura Hunt, a beautiful and successful young woman, has been found dead in her elegant New York apartment, murdered by a shotgun blast to the head. Tough and rough Detective Mark McPherson is assigned to investigate--and slowly, as he delves into her world of high society, gossip columns, business success, and personal glamour he becomes romantically obsessed with the victim. Much of the story is told via flashback as McPherson interviews Laura's friends and acquaintances: the waspish Waldo Lyedecker, an acid-tongued columnist who \"discovered\" Laura; her aunt Ann Treadwell, who envied Laura; her fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter, who depended upon Laura. The device is extremely effective, and lures the viewer into the same fascination with Laura that Detective McPherson experiences.The cast is extraordinary. Although generally admired more for beauty than acting ability, Gene Tierney delivers a first-rate performance as as Laura, seen early in the film in flashback; she is a remarkably attractive woman, and she plays with a perfect mix of coolness and innocence. While I have never much admired Dana Andrews, he is perfectly cast as the street-common detective who is gradually consumed by obsession with Laura. But the real standouts here are Clifton Webb as the poisonously witty Waldo Lydecker, the powerful Judith Anderson (best remembered as Mrs. Danvers in REBECCA) as Laura's aunt, and Vincent Price as Laura's weakling fianc\u00e9. The script is a pearl beyond price, running at a rapid pace and shot through with some of the most memorable dialogue (most going to Clifton Webb) in Hollywood history. Everything about the film strikes precisely the right chord: the cinematography that shifts between hard and soft, the subtle camera movements, the mysterious and memorable theme song, and the cast itself. A truly fascinating film that can be enjoyed again and again; dead or alive, LAURA remains as captivating today as she was a half-century ago. Strongly, strongly recommended.Gary F.

That was the only part that seemed phony to me. But the movie was intensely intriguing. I loved Clifton Webb's hot tub (in the 40s arreddy) and wept for his obvious obsession with this little intriguing, manipulative woman. I didn't consider her an honest woman because I've known too many of this type in business: using whomever she can. She pretends to be completely innocent of rudeness or abrasiveness when she interrupts Clifton Webb's luncheon, and it is completely illogical for him to pursue her. The fact that his (latent or not) homosexuality is completely hidden and never mentioned is just another sign of the 40s. Wonder how it would be played today.To see Vincent Price playing a gigolo was hilarious, and I expected him to suck the blood out of someone's neck at any moment instead of placing a hickey on it. The wonderful naivet\u00e9 of the 40s, when no one needed a search warrant was great and now that we have the Patriot Act, no one needs a search warrant anymore...so we've come full circle but for far less innocent reasons.Dana Andrews has certainly a lot of on screen chemistry, even if some of his gestures (e.g., rubbing his eyes when Laura shows up alive) are too melodramatic. The writing is as good as \"Mad Men\" but just a little more dated.There are as many twists in this movie as you'll see in any, and we now know what a misogynist Otto Preminger was, so the devilish lines by both women are easy to believe.Gene Tierney is glowing and conveys a wonderful charm. Knowing her problems with mental illness gave her that vulnerability that we love from Marily Monroe for the same reasons. See this movie for the twists, and get the DVD with some interesting notes on how it was shot. I really enjoyed the DVD commentary but wish there could have been more information on and from the writers. To me, the script is the most important part of movie...at least the dialogue among the players. But it's a mystery here.

The portrait is of the title character played by the lovely Gene Tierney. As the camera zooms in on the portrait and David Raksin's theme fills in the background, all the classic noir elements come into play. Dana's narration takes us through his every move and thought as he struts around with his tilted hat interviewing suspects. Who would have hated Gene so much they would kill her - or was it a crime of passion?There's Clifton Webb, her dear friend, Vincent Price, her fianc\u00e9, and Judith Anderson, her aunt. Are they telling Dana the truth, or will he have to look incredibly handsome with his stern, \"I'm thinking\" expression and read between the lines?And does Gene Tierney even have that much of a part? She plays the dead girl! Don't worry. If you're a fan of her beautiful face and enchanting expressions, you won't be disappointed. There are plenty of flashbacks to keep you happy. And since Dana becomes so enamored by her portrait, there's plenty of screen time devoted to her.There's a lot to like about this movie. There's the haunting theme, later made into a hit song, that won a Hot Toasty Rag award in 1944. It's Clifton Webb's film debut, and features a rare Vincent Price performance before his horror film franchise took over.

While it's been widely known for Gene Tierney's looks, there's so much more. One of the key features is the Academy Award-winning cinematography. Rarely has camerawork functioned as a character in a movie, but they use it to exquisite effect here.With Tierney's performance, and support from Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb, Judith Anderson and Vincent Price (betcha didn't know that he starred in serious movies before becoming a horror star), plus a clever plot, this is one movie that no cinephile can afford to miss. If you see only one movie this coming year, definitely make it \"Laura\".",

Basically Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the death of Laura Hunt, found dead on her apartment floor. He is fascinated by her portrait painting, and he is building a mental picture of what happened from all the suspects he interviews. Suspects who knew Laura including snobby journalist Waldo Lydecker (Oscar nominated Clifton Webb), and her playboy fianc\u00e9e Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price). Along the way McPherson is helped a woman who looks exactly like Laura (Gene Tierney) from the painting, but with many men, including those McPherson interviews, loving her who would want to kill her? This woman, who is actually the real Laura Hunt (revealed later on) seems to be casting a spell over McPherson, and with quite a few revelations his investigation may need rethinking. Also starring Judith Anderson as Mrs. Ann Treadwell. Being a film noir I was expecting to see quite a few of the conventions, I'm not sure if Laura is a Femme Fatale, but Tierney is a very good female lead, with Andrews and Price as good support, it is a good moody classic. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 7 on 100 Years of Film Scores, and it was number 73 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!",

Dana Andrews is spot on as the detective investigating the 'murder' of Laura.What throws the whole film off for me is the casting of the very fey Clifton Webb as the villain. Nastiness aside, Waldo Lydecker is way too light in his loafers to be a murderer. I have seen Webb in movies in which he was suited, so this is not a disparagement of his acting talent. To me, he is badly miscast in this piece.And for my money, Tierney's appearance is too little and too late. The only characters that stick in my mind are the Andrews' cop, idly playing with his little toy baseball game. And Vincent Price is amusing as the kept man of Judith Anderson.I would go so far as to say that 'Laura' is disengaging film noir, where Preminger's 'Anatomy of a Murder' is brilliant. I have watched 'Anatomy' three times, and I would watch it again. The ambiguity of the characters is amazing. The movie's end makes it clear to me that Gazzara and Remick are a kinky, twisted pair who took Jimmy Stewart and the whole justice system for a ride, but there is nothing explicit about their guilt. The movie smacks of reality to me and 'Laura' leaves a curious falseness by the film's end.That 'Laura' sits on most people's favorite film noir lists is a puzzle to me, but movies are so subjective that I won't quibble with someone else's 'treasures'.",

            "content": "Like many other people, \"Laura\" is one of my favorite films. Otto Preminger directed a dream cast - Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb, Vincent Price, and Judith Anderson in the classic story of a detective and a portrait he can't forget. And who could - it's Gene Tierney in the portrait in the role for which she is best remembered.Tierney is Laura, a beautiful and desirable career gal found dead, shot in the face beyond recognition when she opened her apartment door to admit - whom? That's why Dana Andrews is there, and he keeps returning to gaze at the portrait.There are a few suspects - her mentor, Waldo Lydecker (Webb) who wants her for himself (even though he seems quite obviously gay, he doesn't want to share her); Shelby Carpenter, Laura's beau, who wants to marry Laura but might be losing her; and Ann, an older woman in love with Shelby. For those who have never seen \"Laura,\" it's full of surprises. Unfortunately, it's a famous story by now so one of the surprises is ruined. Even so, the end is tremendously exciting.I remember seeing \"Laura\" desecrated in the '70s (I think) when Lee Radziwill played Laura in a TV version - horrific. But nothing can ever dim the movie in the mind of anyone's who's seen it. Wonderful performances, great atmosphere, snappy dialogue: A haunting film, one of the best of the 1940s and one of the great examples of film noir. As Clifton Webb says in the film, \"This is assuming fabulous aspects.\" So does \"Laura.\"",

            "content": "You can summarize the best movies through a combo of two words, \"The Godfather\" is about power and succession, \"Raging Bull\" jealousy and self-destruction and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" greed and paranoia. Following the same outline, \"Laura\" is about obsession and fascination. We get an early hint when the film opens, Laura is dead but Waldo Lydecker's eulogy, used as voice-over narration, less describes the woman she was than the effect her passing had on him. And Laura, whose huge painting portrait thrones over a deserted neatly decorated living room, becomes the subject of curiosity, then interest until it finally blooms into fascination.And the greatest ambassador of this fascination is Waldo Lydecker, a columnist who must have twice Laura's age but is vividly infatuated, not quite with Laura, but an idea of Laura, whom he feels like being the privileged witness. Clifton Webb is simply magnificent in his scene-stealing performance (rightfully earning him an Oscar nomination) and Lydecker is unforgettable as the distinguished gentleman with the quickest wit when it comes to display sarcasm and contempt (every single line he delivers is worth pushing the 'rewind' button). Now, whatever Laura is in reality, the being of Lydecker is the film's greatest asset. I wish I could say the same about Dana Andrews, who plays Detective Mark McPherson, in charge of investigating Laura's murder.I expressed my shock that Andrews didn't get an Oscar=nomination for his heartbreaking performance in \"The Ox-Bow Incident\", but while watching his moody and cigarette-packed impersonation of a detective, I had the strange sensation that Andrews tried to pull a Bogart, a few moments that didn't call for underplaying the emotions, gave him away. Thankfully, Andrews is always surrounded by good company, and when it's not Clifton Webb, Judith Anderson and Vincent Price add their personal touch. Together, they play Laura's aunt and fianc\u00e9, and both are lovers. The aunt doesn't seem too bothered by Shelby's relationship with Laura, she knows her niece enough to know he's not her type. As for Shelby (Vincent Price), he's the only one convinced about Laura's love.So, we have a murder and three suspects, and the investigation emphasizes the rivalry between the two men, one that couldn't ring falser with an effete intellectual past his prime and a spineless opportunist only redeemed by his athletic looks. Both are perfect match for each other, but we're supposed to believe that they'd rather walk in Laura's fringes. There must be something about that Laura\u0085 Lydecker explains how they met, when approached for an ad, he had one nasty word too many and she literally put him in his place. He had no other choice than swallow his pride, accept the offer, knowing that there was more to gain, a second youth for him and a career for her. This was the start of a Pygmalion relationship based on platonic love.But Waldo's jealousy wasn't the benign type. This is a man who can only rely on his intellect and networking to appeal to a woman of Laura's caliber. Shelby covers the usual requirements: tall, strong, dull but Laura is too precious to fall in such an intelligence-insulting trap, if she doesn't know, he does. This is the \"idea\" of Laura that is haunting him. He can't make love with her, but can't let her with men below the level. He destroyed a growing romance with the portrait painter with the power of a venomous critic, like he intended to destroy Shelby, overlooking a new player in the field, McPherson himself, a guy who dares to call women \"dames\" \u0085 but who'll see more in Laura.Now, how can you fall in love with a ghost? This is the recurring theme that drives the first part of the investigation, and the leitmotiv is expressed through the 'haunting theme' that became the film's musical signature. McPherson seems to be under the spell of Laura, and gradually obsessed by her, to the point of fetishism of the least expected sort from such a hard-nosed guy. And the film finds the perfect moment to make the ghost resurrect and we finally discover Laura, and she's as startled about her death news as we are about her living. Now, does she hold up to her reputation? Maybe not, but again, is she aware of her attraction? Maybe, she's the only Femme Fatale \"despite herself\", although there's always a sense of impending doom floating above her inner circle.The film ventures through the romantic alleys but with enough cautiousness to never distract us, it's like Preminger who directed the film, knew Clifton Webb and Vincent Price were the two unsung pillars and kept them as long as possible. It's indeed very bizarre that the leading couple doesn't form the most exciting pair, not in the year of Bogart and Bacall in \"To Have or Have Not\" or MacMurray and Stanwyck in \"Double Indemnity\". But this is a movie about fascination and obsession, and it does a terrific job at showing how fascinated people could be fascinating in their own way, this is why the potential suspects are the most interesting characters. Laura's alleged aura was probably exaggerated, so what? Obsessions can cloud judgment, you know.So, Laura's entrance is preceded by such an extraordinary aura that whatever we expect, we feel let down but the film works like its own alibi, we expect some typical film-noir movie with the tough detective and the cynical femme fatale, and we get \"Laura\", a movie that likes its titular character is preceded by its aura and whatever works, works despite itself\u0085 and maybe behind our astonishment, there's the embryo of fascination, and through our desire to watch it again, a potential obsession. The critic of the New York Times admitted that Gene Tierney didn't quite measure up to the fascination from her little court of worshiping males yet this seemingly flaw might be the key to understand the film's unique appeal.",

Hitchcock's most acclaimed thriller by 1944 was Rebecca (1940) (Please correct me if I am wrong) which seemed to gain a classic status over the years and i firmly agree with it. But this is shocking that some underrated thrillers which actually came out better in every sense of filmmaking didn't even make it to competitive level of those known Classics. This, Laura is a fine example of Murder Mystery Thriller turning into a Film Noir and has got more suspense, twists and sense than all Hitchcock thrillers made till it's release then why the hell it remained unnoticed for years? Laura is great story i must say, it gives time and justice to every character and moment it is drifted into. A detective falls in love with the charming woman whose murder he is investigating finds several devastating facts. Laura was unpredictable for some time which is an impressive thing because i have been through almost all Classic mystery thrillers since 30s. The suspense kept building and at one or two occasions i even doubted the wrong man, gosh it was unexpected and humiliating for me. Performance of Dana Andrew is Splendid. He looks real as detective, he talks like one, he behaves and expresses like the real one. Gene Tierney looks Gorgeous and cute and Clifton Webb & Vincent Price are fantastic. Cinematography is well done, screenplay is as tight as it could get for any murder mystery and the dialogues are quite sober which could have been little more intelligent. Otto Preminger delivers a solid Film noir and by far much better than so called acclaimed classics on contemporary level. I am saying it again, he outscored all Hitchcock thrillers with Laura and i want to see more of his works. Overall, Laura is Great Classic and needs to be known as one.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

We're introduced to Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), an arrogant, effeminate newspaper columnist who claims to have been the only one who really knew Laura. The film opens in Lydecker's New York apartment, where hardboiled detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) waits to meet Lydecker for questioning after Laura's brutal murder. McPherson's other suspects include Laura's fianc\u00e9, Southern playboy Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price); her socialite aunt, Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson); and Bessie Clary (Dorothy Adams), Laura's devoted housekeeper. During the course of the investigation, an obsessed McPherson falls in love with Laura's portrait. One rainy night, the detective falls asleep in her apartment and is awakened by a woman who appears to be Laura herself (Gene Tierney)! Through a series of unexpected twists, the murderer is finally revealed at the film's shocking climax.Whether you are a fan of mystery, crime drama, or romance, \"Laura\" offers something for everyone. The haunting soundtrack, droll dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and tight performances combine to create a film noir masterpiece. Young Gene Tierney is bewitching as Laura, and Dana Andrews (one of my classic Hollywood crushes) plays the quintessential detective whose rugged masculinity sharply contrasts with the homosexual overtones of Webb's character. The true depth of this film can only be fully appreciated after several viewings. Due to its subtle themes and emotional intensity, I would highly recommend \"Laura\" to adult viewers.",

It's quite corny actually; you can't escape its B-movie sensibility and as a murder mystery it's not even that clever. What lifts it is the smart dialogue and the neat acting, (Gene Tierney was never better than as Laura), Preminger's cool, detached direction, (you would think he believed he was directing Chekov) and it looks terrific, (Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for his camera-work), so as an entertainment it certainly works. My worry is that people who ought to know better have elevated it way beyond its station and I'm afraid I, too, have to hold my hands up here. Seeing it for the first time it can smack you in the face; it affords you all the pleasures you associate with good pulp fiction.

Preminger keeps the pace moving right along, plunging the viewer into the complex plot from the first frame.

Lydecker is clearly obsessed with Laura, perhaps even more so than the detective.  It is a witty, realistic performance that Webb pulls off with charm and elegance.  Besides, can you think of any other character who's ever made such a memorable entrance on the screen as Waldo Lydecker sitting naked in his bathtub with a typewriter?",

            "content": "A classic film noir, LAURA went from humble origins to become a career changer for all involved. 20th Century Fox was the studio that owned the short story on which LAURA was based, but they intended it to be no more than a B-movie. Otto Preminger, the producer, felt it had more potential and pushed to have a bigger budget. He hoped to direct it as well, but was prevented from doing so by Fox chief Darryl Zanuck, who loathed the Austrian.The original choice for director was Rouben Mamoulian, but after a week or so with nothing to show for it except unimpressive rushes, Zanuck fired him. With no one else available on such short notice, he grudgingly hired Preminger to take over for Mamoulian. Now that he had the job he wanted, one of Preminger's first decisions was to commission a portrait of Gene Tierney, playing the title role. Dissatisfied with the result, he instead instructed that a photograph of her be enlarged and lightly brushed with paint so that it would look like an authentic portrait.But I would be remiss if I didn't mention the memorable score by composer David Raksin. Preminger preferred to use Duke Ellington's \"Sophisticated Lady\" but, fortunately for everyone, was unable to secure permission. Angered over having Raksin forced on him, Preminger ordered him to come.up with a score within 48 hours or else he'd be fired. As if that stress wasn't enough, at the same time Raksin received a Dear John letter from his girlfriend. Sitting down at his piano, he began to tickle the ivories, and out of his despair \"Laura's Theme\" just poured out of him.Gene Tierney already was a star at Twentieth Century Fox, but the role of Laura Hunt made her immortal, although she remained unhappy all throughout filming. For the role of Lt Mark MacPherson, contract player Dana Andrews correctly sensed that the character was his ticket to the big time. He saw his opportunity at a cocktail party when he turned on the charm to Darryl Zanuck's wife, and casually expressed his interest in the project. Andrews got the part. And a pre-horror Vincent Price also lobbied successfully to play the caddish Shelby Carpenter.But the one cast member who truly benefitted from LAURA was Clifton Webb. A longtime stage actor, Webb hadn't appeared on the screen since the Twenties, but Preminger though he'd be perfect for the role of the waspish Waldo Lydecker, a man with such an off-puttingly high opinion of himself that he's made many enemies from his poison pen. Zanuck argued that Webb was too effeminate for the part until Preminger countered that Lydecker was a Manhattan critic, not a hard-boiled private detective. Zanuck gave in.The plot is fairly straightforward. Laura Hunt, a young advertising executive, was found murdered in her apartment from a shotgun blast to the face. The lead investigator is Lt Mark MacPherson, a laconic detective who made headlines getting injured in the line of duty. He's in the process of questioning Waldo Lydecker, who's busy typing away out his next article while in the bathtub -and I thought Dalton Trumbo was the only one. Lydecker looks on MacPherson with a combination of admiration for his fearlessness and disdain over his playing with a baseball dexterity game.Despite being a person of interest in the murder, Lydecker insists on accompanying MacPherson to question another suspect, Laura's society matron aunt Ann Treadwell. Staying with Ann to avoid the press is Laura's fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter, a Kentucky playboy whose family lost their estate back during the Depression, and he's been leeching off wealthy women ever since. It goes without saying that Lydecker and Carpenter loathe one another and, at one point, nearly came to blows if not for MacPherson's quick intervention.",

Through flashback, we are told the story of how Waldo met Laura before we come back to the present and Mark decides to spend the night at Laura's flat.......something very strange happens next...There is a good cast in this film, with Clifton Webb and Vincent Price stealing the acting honours. We have a story where the 3 male leads - Mark, Waldo and Shelby all fall in love with Laura, although Waldo can't be interested in Laura sexually because he is soooo blatantly gay. His love is a gay love in the same way that Michael Jackson loved Diana Ross or the way in which all homosexuals love Judy Garland in \"The Wizard Of Oz\" or the singer Kylie Minogue.I feel that a wrong decision was made in the use of music (or rather the lack of music) at a poignant moment in the film when Mark falls asleep in Laura's flat, where it needs something to emphasize the dramatic twist that we are seeing. Instead, we have silence and it seems somewhat empty. Another point concerns the narration of the film - once you watch the film you will see what I mean - it doesn't make sense.

This is just one angle of obsessive consideration about why this movie is one of the greatest ever made... this angle: THE TWIN SHOTGUNS, THE TWIN CLOCKS...So let me get this straight. The shotgun is shoved up one or both of Waldo's two priceless clocks. Was it hidden in Waldo's apartment and he carries it to Laura's place, an apartment with two entrances, or did he always leave it in her twin priceless clock just in case? Meanwhile, Shelby thought it was a good idea to put a -- that no country home should be without a -- shotgun above the fireplace mantle, so there are twin shotguns, too. Yes he mounted one of them in Laura's country house which Mark says she'd recently fired, she who left the city after discovering Shelby, her fianc\u00e9e, also shares time with the ad agency model, whenever Laura is not available... so Shelby, knowing Laura is away, at her country house in Connecticut, brings the model, Diane, to Laura's empty and available apartment while Laura is gone. That's a good idea. Laura even tells Mark that it is as if she killed Diane herself.But no... it is Waldo who sees from the street that the light in her apartment is on, sees the two figures in the window, goes up, with the shotgun he'd been carrying during his walk, or no, getting the shotgun from the clock innards where he'd inserted it before bringing it to her place. (?)One way or the other he gets his shotgun, and fires both of its two shotgun barrels into the face of the model, Diane, kind of instantly upon her opening the door to see who on earth was the person knocking on it.No one hears the shots? or even though they do, Waldo has time to wait for Shelby to leave, then go back into the apartment. I guess he re-enters through that back entrance that Laura always keeps open. Perhaps everyone except Waldo is afraid to go in there (it's not an empty apartment building.. he fired shots heard round the world). Waldo shoves the smelly shotgun back up the clock where it rests throughout the movie.There is much inquiry and an unprecedented real-time segment of silent drinking. End scene, Laura is in her bed-sitting room listening to Waldo's broadcast. Waldo walks in (I guess discretely shutting off the radio). She really has had enough of him and his bully pulpit character assassinations and has almost come to resent his inability to accept her interest in helping other men. She waves away his gun so it shoots into the ceiling. Waldo, after being perfectly shot in the chest by someone other than Mark, fires his last shotgun barrel into the face of his priceless clock. Focus on the shattered clock face. THE END... Yes, I want to write the sequel about the relationship between Laura and Mark narrated by Waldo from the grave. With Razor's Edge this movie demonstrates why actors Tierney and Webb make such a great screen couple.Otto Preminger directed this movie as if he was a man, or rather, a person, who knew too much.",

It follows a police detective attempting to solve the brutal murder of a beautiful 20-something advertising executive days before her planned marriage.The film opens with Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) investigating the death of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney), who was shot in the face with a shotgun as she answered the door of her apartment. Hunt has attracted various men, including Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), a 50ish well-known gossip columnist who helped launch Hunt's career. He's pompous and jealous of Hunt's suitors, including an artist who painted a portrait of Hunt that hangs prominently over her fireplace. Hunt's fianc\u00e9e is Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a financially bereft playboy. He has had a long-term relationship with wealthy Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson) and seems involved with one of Hunt's models, Diane Redfern.As McPherson investigates, multiple people seem to be suspects. Suddenly Laura reappears, and it's evident the victim was actually Diane Redfern. The suspects then include Hunt, Lydecker, and Carpenter. Some of the suspects believe one of the others is the actual murderer. McPherson also begins to fall in love with Hunt.There is a final climax in which McPherson identifies the murderer, who makes a last desperate attempt to settle a score.This really is classic film noir. The plot is complex; many suspects have believable motives. This is a fun film to watch, even though McPherson's police work beggars believability as he allows suspects to accompany him as he interrogates other suspects, McPherson drinks an inordinate amount of the \"victim's\" booze as he contemplates her portrait. Finally, he wanders off, leaving the intended victim undefended after identifying the murderer but not immediately arresting the person.",

The film mixes an interesting story, excellent cinematography, solid acting, and characters you're not likely to forget to create a bona fide classic. I'm not an expert, but Laura is certainly one of the best examples of the film noir that I've thus far seen. Most every character in the movie has some tragic flaw. As for the story, I found the mystery of who killed Laura to be secondary to the interaction between the characters. They speak to each other in that wonderful way that only characters in a film noir speak. This is a definite must see that I look forward to revisiting time and time again.While I previously praised the characters in Laura, they also represent the only real weakness I see in the film that keeps me from rating it a 10/10. The characters are a little too exaggerated. Det. Lt. Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is a little to solemn and non-feeling. The gold-digging, but penniless, playboy Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price) is a little too conniving. And, although certainly one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen, Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb) is a little too flamboyant (for lack of a better word). I don't know, but it's possible that these exaggerated characters were part of Preminger's plan. Regardless, the over-the-top characterizations can be a bit distracting.",

Laura actually started out as a play called, \"RING TWICE FOR LORA\" by Vera Caspary in 1939 which she later turned into a novel which was serialized in Collier's magazine where it was discovered by Preminger that bought the rights to become this film and then later it was turned back into a play.The producer Otto Preminger decided to take over directing from Rouben Mamoulian after fighting with Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck over Clifton Webb's casting as Waldo Lydecker and not liking the film Mamoulian had already shot.DANA ANDREWS was born Jan. 1st of 1909 in Collins, Mississippi. He was the son of a Baptist minister, one of 13 children. He attended college in Texas, worked as an accountant for the Gulf Oil company before hitch-hiking to California to become an actor or an opera singer. From the Pasadena Playhouse he went onto make several films including THE WESTERNER, TOBACCO ROAD and BALL OF FIRE. But his early film career took off with his touching performance in THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, then LAURA and BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES made him bigger star. After WWII his films varied in quality and success, highlights include A WALK IN THE SUN, BOOMERANG, FALLEN ANGEL, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS and NIGHT OF THE DEMON. In the early 1960s Dana Andrews stepped forward to admit his career would have had more success but that he wrestled with alcoholism. He eventually whipped alcohol and went on to make public service commercials on television in the 1970s designed to encourage other chronic drinkers to seek professional help. He finally passed away December 17, of 1992 at the age of 81 from complications brought on by Alzheimer's disease. GENE TIERNEY was born in Brooklyn, NY on Nov. 20th of 1920. She came from a rich family, was well educated in Switzerland and was later discovered by director Anatole Litvak at a party. She was briefly pursued by Warner Bros., Columbia & MGM studios before Fox put her under contract for THE RETURN OF FRANK JAMES, HUDSON BAY & TOBACCO ROAD. But they did not know how to best use her skills until Ernst Lubitsch showcased her in HEAVEN CAN WAIT just a year before LAURA. If you enjoy her in this classic seek out THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS or two of her darker films LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN & THE RAZOR'S EDGE. Her private life included an affair with Aly Khan, Tyrone Power & John F. Kennedy, she married designer Oleg Cassini and when her career dried up she even worked at a department store in the Midwest. She occasionally made films for the rest of her life, battled mental illness, married an oil baron and eventually died of emphysema in Houston, Texas at the age of 70 Nov. 6th of 1991. Tierney and Andrews made 5 films together.CLIFTON WEBB was born way back in 1891 in Indianapolis and was a child prodigy making his Carnegie Hall debut in 1900! Webb did it all, sang, danced, acted and even appeared in silent films but his biggest success was on the Broadway stage, that is until he turned 53 in 1944 and Otto Preminger wanted him to play critic and writer Waldo Lydecker. He was so good in this film that his next 15 films were all hits! The film SITTING PRETTY introduced him as Mr. Belvedere, he went down on the original film version of TITANIC and my personal favorite, he was the father of 12 in the original CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN. He died at the age of 74 in 1966 of a heart attack. Laura was Oscar nominated for Best Director, Supporting Actor (Webb), Interiors/Art Direction & Screenplay it won an Academy Award for Joseph LaShelle's black & white Cinematography.

Besides, it was unlikely that lovely Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, the two first billed stars, would be together in a film without ever meeting -\u0096 or falling in love (which was something that their very presence and the posters hinted at). I have a few reserves about the movie in spite of the fact that I liked it and found it quite captivating : 1) It's somewhat too talkative and the \u00abred herring\u00bb regarding Shelby Carpenter's (Vincent Price) possible guilt took too long to be dispelled. 2) I expected Laura's \u00abreturn\u00bb (for the reasons stated above) but the disclosure of the \u00abwho\u00bb and \u00abwhy\u00bb were still very interesting. 3)(A very personal opinion) Clifton Webb is present constantly on the screen during almost the whole first half of the movie - therefore I think it was a bit unfair that he was nominated for a \u00absupporting\u00bb role. Of course, this was very lucky for him since he did win the Oscar for that part \u0096 and this launched his \u00absecond\u00bb and more rewarding film career. 4) \u00abA dream or not a dream : that is the question.\u00bb What happens during the second half could be a dream except that I wouldn't fully buy that because of the huge \u00absense of not having been fulfilled\u00bb it would leave the viewer with : a) It would leaves too many loose ends untied (can anyone imagine what the movie would be like without it's second part \u0096 even if the first half was \u00abexpanded\u00bb to last some 90 minutes ? BUT b) It might explain the fact that Waldo Lydecker - having not died - would be telling the story, in the first place \u0096 UNLESS the beginning narration was quoted from some of the late Lydecker's writings. But this would be an extrapolating supposition... Isn't it obvious that \u00abLaura\u00bb would need too many of these extrapolating suppositions in order to be coherent ? I think so ! This brings me to c) Webb's beginning narration should have been \u00abbalanced\u00bb by an ending narration - one way or another... even if, considering the film as it is, I wouldn't know how this could adequately be done (I am NOT an experienced screenplay writer) d) McPherson's \u00absudden love\u00bb for Laura seems to be... too sudden - even if we all know that love at first sight does happen. But could it be so when triggered by a dead woman \u0096 as a result of seeing her portrait and of listening to what others had to say about her ? e) Lydecker's sexuality is very ambiguous (even though I know that in 1944 homosexuality was, so to say, inexistent in movies and had to be hinted at very obliquely). ****HOW ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT LYDECKER WAS A SEXUALLY IMPOTENT BISEXUAL???**** Whatever might have been his sexual inclinations, his motives for wanting to murder Laura are therefore not only most ambiguous \u0096 but also somewhat incredible : going to such an extreme intention of murdering, is not only a \u00abuseless risk taking\u00bb project but could have been easily avoided. Was Lydecker, the very possessive \u00abmentor\u00bb, really as paranoid as that to commit a murder ? He seemed to be able to function very well in society. It's somewhat incredible that, since in the past, he got rid of Jacoby, the painter with whom Laura was involved, he couldn't break up Laura's affair with Carpenter (described by a reviewer as \u00abdim-witted\u00bb). Why couldn't Lydecker succeed in concocting another efficient and wicked way of getting Laura's new suitor out of the way... ? Unless, of course, using the \u00abexcuse\u00bb of Laura's \u00abbetrayal\u00bb, Lydecker is triggered into having at last a chance of committing a murder - and of getting away with it. I know, I know : with too many \u00abifs\u00bb and suppositions, there wouldn't be a movie - or a completely different one (no wonder that the author on the novel on which the film was based was not satisfied with the result of the adaptation!)! At any rate, fiction has to be somewhat more \u00abbelievable\u00bb even if we all know that movies (as fiction) are often magnificent \u00abillusions\u00bb. After all, we like so much to be \u00abtaken on a ride\u00bb by a good story with a solid construction - not a patched-up one. Alas! in spite of all its undeniable qualities, \u00abLaura\u00bb fails to past the test of logical close scrutiny ! Notice how many scriptwriters have worked on the film : three \u0096 one alone and then two others together. It's usually a bad \u00abomen\u00bb which often gives... patched-up results !",

            "review_title": "takes the typical crime-noir scenario and blends it with great characters to create a unique psychological drama",
            "content": "The crime-noir genre was especially popular with audience members during the 40s and 50s and if you delve into the motion pictures of those two decades, you will find hundreds of examples. One that I think is noteworthy is Pushover from 1954, but mostly because it featured the feature film debut of my favorite actress, Kim Novak, and featured Fred MacMurray as a villain, which I always felt he would be effective as. But while Pushover (1954) was interesting, Otto Preminger's Laura from 1944 is absorbing and powerful.The film's plot takes the typical crime-noir setting (a who-done-it scenario) and blends it with a good atmosphere of great characters and a shocking turning point of a middle. It's based on a bestseller by Vera Caspary, which was about a detective (Dana Andrews) investigating the murder of a woman (Gene Tierney) who before her death, had risen to fame in the city under her friend, a cynical newspaper columnist (Clifton Webb) and a charming playboy (Vincent Price). As he learns about the woman's past, the detective is slowly drawn into her memory and, just as Webb's character coldly notices, he's \"fallen in love with a corpse.\" The reason why Laura is more effective and powerful than most other who-done-its is because it embraces a psychological atmosphere with a well-written screenplay by Jay Dratler and taken care of under director Otto Preminger. The movie does not have very many characters. The credited cast stops after five names. But these five main characters are all that Preminger needs to create a dramatic, witty story that utilizes both style and substance to keep us interested unlike a lot of films today that seem to embrace only one or the other, mostly the former instead of the latter, which is far more important. The characters are well-played. Arguably the key performance is not by leading lady Gene Tierney or even by Dana Andrews, but by Clifton Webb, who when he made Laura, had stepped in front of a motion picture camera for the first time in fourteen years and garnered and Academy Award nomination soon afterward. Webb's character, who was clearly based off of critic Alexander Woollcott, is a human being of two sides. At times, he seems like a very gentle, relatable soul; a charming person whom you cannot find yourself disliking and then in some other scenes can be utterly cold and vicious such as in a scene where he warns off the Gene Tierney character in a flashback that he's engaged in something far more important than her career. When she asks what that is, Webb chillingly responds with: \"My lunch.\" And it's at these moments that you might even find yourself suspecting Webb's character for being the murderer. And there's also Vincent Price, unusually cast as a weak individual, but perhaps also a wise casting choice because his tall stature and creepy mannerisms tend to associate him with our primary suspect. In regards to Dana Andrews, he was also a great casting choice. He had the physical appearance of a worn-down detective and matched the manners of the character just right. And of course, there is the gorgeous Gene Tierney in her most memorable performance, even though she is mostly shown through flashback, we come to understand her and maybe even fall in love with her as Andrews' character is, even though all we know about her is what Webb and Price have to relate.Laura is one of the more unique crime films in the history of cinema and undoubtedly Gene Tierney's most famous film and of course one of Otto Preminger's best works. It does have kind of a sudden way of ending, but it does play itself out very well, keeping us interested not only with the mystery, but the characters and their lives. Those that continue to live, that is.",

            "review_title": "Less Mystery Than Soap Opera",
            "content": "Antiquated interior sets, haughty characters, and overblown dialogue make this \"mystery\" less a compelling whodunit than an old fashion, melodramatic soap opera. The lives of several New York sophisticates are interrupted by a police detective (played by Dana Andrews), investigating the murder of Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Waldo (Clifton Webb), Shelby (Vincent Price), and Ann (Judith Anderson) are three people who knew Laura best. And a big part of the film plots these three people and their relationship to Laura.Excessive dialogue and a lot of time spent in several large rooms are suggestive of a stage play. Some of the dialogue is stilted and wooden, as in this example: \"Did it ever strike you that you're acting very strangely? It's a wonder you don't come here like a suitor, with roses and a box of candy, drugstore candy of course\". Toward the end, a character delivers these pretentious lines: \"And thus, as history has proved, love is eternal; it has been the strongest motivation for human actions throughout centuries; love is stronger than life; it reaches beyond the dark shadow of death\". Oh, please!Overall acting is fine. Performances may seem a tad affecting and artificial, but the actors did well with the dialogue they were given. The film's production design is Victorian, and resembles antiques one would find in some musty old attic. The \"Laura\" theme song is as musty and dreary as the sets. The B&W photography is probably the best element of the film. Lots of shadows and side lighting render a wonderful noir look and feel.\"Laura\" is a low-key story of obsessive love, jealousy, and mistaken identity. The pace is slow; tension is minimal; characters are not sympathetic; acting is good; the lighting is terrific. It's the kind of movie one would watch on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon, when in a sleepy, hibernating mood.",

            "review_title": "Intriguing murder mystery",
            "content": "Laura Hunt is a young, beautiful, hugely successful New York advertising executive. Or rather she was those things. Because as this movie opens Laura is dead. Murdered, a shotgun blast to the face. So who was Laura really? What do we really know about her? Those are intriguing questions. But this movie's big question is of course who killed her? The mystery unfolds with a small handful of suspects and an at times rather peculiar investigation. Along the way we have some flashbacks to help establish who Laura was, how our suspects were connected to her, and why anyone could have possibly wanted to blow this seemingly innocent woman's head off. Because on the surface her murder makes very little sense. As you try to make some sense of it all the movie has some big surprises in store for you.Dana Andrews plays the role of detective Mark McPherson, who in the course of his investigation does some rather unusual things. Things which quite frankly no detective would ever actually do. But we will see he must do these things to move the movie's plot forward. Without this series of contrivances there would be no movie. Rather sloppy plotting it must be said but not so bad as to greatly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. One of McPherson's absurd actions is to allow one of his prime suspects to tag along for interrogations of his other prime suspects. A very contrived way to get all the key players in a room together. That prime suspect is newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker, the man responsible for making Laura who she was. Just ask him, he'll tell you. He loves talking about himself that's for sure. Clifton Webb plays this flamboyant, rather effeminate character. Waldo prances through the movie like a queen but it is apparent that he was quite in love with Laura. Which makes the fact that Laura was about to marry another man quite unacceptable in Waldo's eyes. The man Laura intended to marry is Shelby Carpenter, a not particularly intelligent country bumpkin who somehow finds himself moving in Manhattan's highest social circles. But did Laura really intend to marry Shelby? Waldo would have you believe she was reconsidering the marriage. If Shelby knew that he might certainly have a motive for the murder. Meanwhile Laura's aunt, Ann Treadwell, has a thing for Shelby so maybe she wanted Laura out of the way. And Laura's maid also seemed to have an unusually strong affection for Laura. So there are the suspects. The movie then goes through a series of twists and turns, one of which is a real doozy, before all will finally be revealed.This is an intriguing movie but perhaps not quite as engrossing as it may have been. Even at less than ninety minutes the movie seems a bit slow and labored at times. The fact that some of the key story elements are scarcely believable doesn't help. Andrews does an OK job in playing the movie's detective but the fact that detective does so many frankly stupid things sometimes makes it hard to take the guy seriously. Webb floats through the movie on a cloud, chewing as much scenery as he can swallow. But his performance does make for a memorable character. The problem is that when you see Webb's 50-something Waldo with Gene Tierney's beautiful 20-something Laura the love story doesn't ring true. The oddest of odd couples. Then again while Laura had affection for Waldo she was after all intending to marry another man. So it's apparently unrequited love on Waldo's part. That other man, Shelby, is played by Vincent Price. It's not always easy playing a hapless dunce and that's pretty much what Shelby is. But Price does very well in the role. As the aunt and the maid Judith Anderson and Dorothy Adams respectively have less to do. They're pushed forward as possible suspects but the movie focuses most of its attention on Waldo and Shelby. Laura herself gets a little lost but Tierney certainly holds her own when she gets her opportunities. This is a movie which wants to keep you guessing but it doesn't always succeed in that. It certainly surprises you here and there but by the end there's a creeping sense of inevitability. Most in the audience will probably guess the murderer's identity before the movie's detective does. When we get to that ending we find it's just as contrived as much of what has preceded it. Instead of going out with a bang the movie fizzles out in what is slightly disappointing fashion. This isn't a bad murder mystery but it would be hard to call it a truly great one. It has its intriguing elements but the whole ends up being a little less than the sum of its parts.",

I belive the movie tries to imply that the detective is falling more for Laura as a person( even though we know her looks do help) whe we see that the detective is reading all her diaries/ correspondence and drinking and basically living in Laura's house.

In fact, the performances of both are so wooden that the characters seem like empty vessels. The detective is so dour and emotionless. How he pursues the case is so unrealistic to real detective work that it undermined the whole credibility of the set-up.

Was it controlling, and obviously homosexual, Waldo Lydecker, who is politely rude and discourteous all throughout? (Nearly every one of Waldo's pompously uttered lines is a classic and memorable; my personal favourite is \"I cannot stand these morons any longer. If you don't come with me this instant, I shall run amok.\" Prim and proper, debonair, yet simultaneously viciously insulting. Elegantly insulting. ) Or was Vincent Price's wannabe playboy character, in a strangely over-sized suit, who has barely a dollar to his name, the one who killed her? At one point in time, the cop sits down in a chair in Laura's apartment late at night, and as he doses off, she walks in the door. But is he asleep and dreaming? Plenty of twists and turns, needless to say, and intentional laughs, as we try to figure out who killed her and why, or who wanted to make it appear as though they killed her. Part murder mystery, part romance thriller, part (intentional) comedy, this ludicrous film noir is not as overly complex as some noirs, and slightly more coherent than others, this has a murder mystery backdrop, with intentionally comic dialogue, an obsessive love story (or two)",

When writing about the previously mentioned 1950 film I mentioned that it was particularly nasty but lacked those loveable and quotable lines, watching this I wish it had been just a little bit harder or at least made some sort of sense. This has none of the solid story and logic of the later film.

While the film is running for a mere 88 minutes, this whodunit doesn't waste any time to probe into each suspect's possible motive, all of them has a disreputable side, while Laura, through Waldo's wistful recollection, is the one who is impeccable, then what has she done to deserve a buckshot in the face? After the preliminary procedures, Shelby's suspicion arises, he is a ne'er-do-well philanderer, and Ann's kept man. But an ensuing turn of event impels the whole case into a more complex misery since it is not what we conceive at all, when the real identity of the victim is revealed, the new suspect shifts to Laura herself. Only when McPherson locates the whereabout of the murder weapon on a hunch, the killer's real identity surfaces and another attempt of murder is within the close range. By the way, Webb is rewarded with an Oscar nomination (the first of a total three), as a late bloomer on the silver screen at the age of 55, and it is his first screen appearance since 1925, (as an open homosexual, it is director Preminger's insistence secures him this classic role), his cynic and urbane presentation of a man who owns everything in life but the woman he desires due to his senility, comes incredibly pathetic.It is beyond question that LAURA is Gene Tierney's most memorable role in her not-so- glorious career, however, it is hard to not notice that her acting here sometimes comes close to an impression of blankness, she showcases her conventional beauty, but it is not a film-noir about femme fatale, she never register any evidence of malice and not enough enigma either, maybe because her personal life is in a distress then (just after she delivered a baby girl who is mentally retarded). This is my first Dana Andrews picture, he is a terse, no-bullshiting detective at the top of his game, only knows dames and dolls from the opposite sex, until he sees Laura's portrait, how dreadful is that he falls in love with a corpse, thankfully the movie doesn't go toward that direction. Vincent Price at his early age of 33, forcibly squeezes a certain temperament of a towering tomboy, while Dame Judith Anderson, retreats on the sidelines most of the time, her adeptness only slightly pays off during her t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate scenes with Laura. Otto Preminger's LAURA is the paragon among the film-noir crop, a dedicative alignment of dazzling chiaroscuro and a white-knuckle storytelling with its timeless LAURA THEME composed by David Raksin, it is the whole package for aficionados.",

This is upper-class noir, for sure and slightly the worse for it. The camera here is clearly in love with Tierney, by extension and deliberate inference mimicking her allure to the three men whose skins she gets under. The three male leads couldn't be more different, Andrews' taciturn cop, Price's silver-tongued do-nothing and Clifton Webb's acid intellectual, all played convincingly, even if the latter two hardly seem drawn from life. The ending is somewhat weak, as the mystery of \"whodunit\" is revealed but by then that hardly matters. Preminger creates that other-worldliness of all the best film-noirs, almost but not quite real-life, a sort of heightened reality both in terms of character and place. Clever use too is made of the melody \"Laura's theme\" which emerges and re-emerges throughout the piece in different guises, perhaps reflecting the different facets that Laura herself conveys prism-like to her adoring male admirers. A classy and entertaining film-noir, perhaps just a bit too clean and shiny for my tastes.",

Vincent Price plays Laura's fianc\u00e9e Shelby Carpenter as a case study in smarmy deviousness. By comparison, the main protagonists (Dana Andrews as police lieutenant McPherson and Gene Tierney as Laura Hunt) appear almost pale - which does not mean they are acting poorly. The opposite is true: McPherson's increasing fascination first with Laura's portrait and her life in general, and then with her herself, is captivating to watch. The direction is excellent, and the film is shot in beautiful black and white. For me at least the question of whether 'Laura' is part of the film-noir genre or not is secondary. It is a great, suspenseful film that I enjoyed immensely. Strange that I got to know it only now...",

One of the real strengths of this movie is the unpredictability of the outcome. There are, in fact, lots of people who might have committed this crime, lots of people who had a wide range of motives for committing this crime and lots of interesting interplay between the various suspects, and between the suspects and the police. There's also (without giving too much away) the unexpected plot twist about halfway through the movie, when the \"whodunit\" becomes, at least in part\" a \"whowasitdunto.\" There are some exceptionally good performances in this movie. Andrews I mentioned, and Clifton Webb was entirely convincing as Waldo Lydecker, a rather snooty writer who develops a passionate interest in Laura (Gene Tierney) and a rivalry with Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), who's engaged to Laura. I was especially taken with Price. Having seen him mostly in the 60's horror-type movies that he's best known for, I was impressed by his ability to pull off a straight dramatic role and to do it so well.This is not an exciting, edge of your seat type of story, but it is a very good mystery. When the killer is eventually revealed, it doesn't come as a surprise (because there are reasons to suspect virtually anyone) but there's no particular way to predict who the killer is with any degree of certainty. 8/10",

The atmosphere is there and the movie has other strengths too but it falls flat in other areas. Compared to the other film noirs I have seen, Laura is the least impressive. The major strength in the film comes from the performances of the three main actors. Dana Andrews is perfect as the detective. Vince Price also does a great job. Clifton Webb does a great job as the selfish Waldo. Gene Tierney does a good job as Laura, but out of the performances I have seen from women in film-noirs, she gives the least impressive. Judith Anderson is not much better than okay, I kept seeing Mrs. Danvers in her. The women who played the house keeper was constantly irritating. The dialogue is good, but pales in comparison to the likes of The Big Sleep. The film does contain its twist and turns like any other film-noir, which leads me to my next complaint. The first twist is that Laura is not dead, that was very surprising to me. However, to my surprise I was able to guess who the murderer was. It was no surprise that Waldo was the murderer, the personality of the character gave it away for me. There was no surprise at the end.

Dana Andrews was an excellent choice as the detective Mark McPherson. He plays the nonchalant, cool headed detective very well. Gene Tierney who plays Laura is extremely beautiful in this movie and that is helped by the excellent lighting. Every actor is very well lit by the low key lighting, making the actors faces very bright but leaving everywhere else only moderately lit. The maid had over exaggerated emotions which almost leads you to believe that she killed Laura because she's so crazy.

Laura, played by Gene Tierney, is an amazing femme fatale to our leading man McPherson, played by Dana Andrews. Laura does a very good job at both distracting McPherson and throwing of the case, whether it is by accident or on purpose. However, I did note that despite the fact that it is a noir film, there lighting wasn't as dark and unsettling as one would expect, however, the shadows were still made to be very exaggerated and dark.

But he also narrates the story from the beginning as if he is reflecting upon these events after some passage of time.This film is Lydecker's story; it did not actually happen, or he wouldn't be telling it. Thus, we have all the trappings associated with the 'problem of narrator.' Lydecker is after all, an accomplished writer; the story of Laura (the film) is one of his creations, just as Laura herself -- if she truly exists outside of Lydecker's story -- is one of his creations.The motivation for Lydecker's telling this story is interesting. He was attracted to Laura initially because she opposed his self-absorbed persona. For some reason this attracted him. In the same way Lydecker uses the story of the film to shine himself in an unflattering light. Evidently he achieves some sort of satisfaction from having either an account of his life or a woman oppose him. Perhaps this is the very nature of his character; he shuns the company of others because he is satisfied with himself in solitude; thus, having others outwardly shun him is a reaffirmation of his self-absorbtion and self-sufficiency.Lydecker is in no way heterosexual. As the teller of the film's story, he is surrogate filmmaker. He created Laura, just as a director creates any of his leading ladies, so that his achievement could be shone through her. When someone he deems undesirable takes a liking to his creation and subsequently decides to steal it from him, he becomes defensive.And here we have the connection with McPherson. In his story (the film) Lydecker depicts McPherson as having an infatuation with Laura's image. Lydecker created that image just as he created the story. He's flattering himself here. As surrogate filmmaker he has succeeded in creating an alluring image.A good self-referential piece, but Preminger's visual style has dated badly.",

Laura is another film noir classic that I believe benefited from being shot in black and white, for it gave a story of upper crust New Yorkers the much needed bit of grimness and graininess that it needed to establish proper mood. Gene Tierney is superb as the beautiful young heroine of the film's title, worldly and successful yet slightly naive. Dana Andrews complements this nicely as the hard-boiled but compassionate detective McPherson investigating her murder. Clifton Webb and Vincent Price, in another of his many pre-horror roles as Shelby Carpenter, are excellent as Laura's foppish suitors. \tLaura has it all. Murder, intrigue, double-dealing, plot twists and suspense right up until film's end. Laura begins with Andrews questioning Webb's' character Waldo Lydecker, a cynical but influential newspaper columnist, about young Laura's murder. We learn that both he and high society hanger-on Carpenter both loved Laura and soon McPherson falls in love with her posthumously! Deep into the film we learn it is not Laura after all who was murdered but that a friend of hers was gunned down in error. This gives room for even more plot twists and turns, much to our delight. Although not really a surprise, Laura has an ending which keeps you guessing up until the last few minutes. \tThe painting of Laura so prominently displayed in the film is not a painting at all. Rather, it is a blown up photo of Tierney retouched by paintstrokes.  \tLaura's theme song is hauntingly beautiful and has been done countless times through the years. Laura also took 1944's Academy Award for black and white cinematography. \tCatch this film anyway, anywhere you can. It is a wonderful piece of work, excellent in all respects.",

            "content": "'Laura' is one of those near-perfect films that absolutely entrance the viewer and demand multiple viewings.One of the best examples of the noir genre, watching this film is like slipping into some sort of hallucinogenic dream. Indeed, Gene Tierney's extraordinary beauty as the title character 'Laura' is enough to make anyone believe they are watching something far out of body and mind.Tierney and a distinguished cast fill the roles of 'Laura', yet it's magic lies in the atmosphere director Preminger has created. The lighting, the evocative score, the use of flashback are all masterful. Contributing to the atmosphere is one of the sharpest scripts to be found in the noir genre, and one of the most complicated, yet fascinating plots.Beautiful career girl Laura Hunt (Tierney) has been brutally murdered. But who would want to harm this lovely creature? Detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) thinks there are plenty, and he is determined to snuff out the killer. Is it her loafer fianc\u00e9 Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price, in an early role), her maid Bessie, her aunt Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson, of 'Rebecca' fame) or her guide and benefactor Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb, in a delicious performance)?As he delves deeper into Laura's life, McPherson finds himself faced with an unusual problem. He has fallen in love with the dead woman, aided by the haunting beauty of her portrait that hangs in her apartment. The conflict of interest threatens his investigation, until a shock twist occurs approximately half way into the film.Laura Hunt has often been labelled a femme fatale. Yes, this is a noir, but Miss Hunt is no ordinary dangerous vixen. She has never been anything but helpful and kind, Laura's major sin is that she is too trusting. Indeed, the pain inflicted on Laura has been through no fault of her own, only due to the men who have leached onto her. Waldo's obsession with her interrupts her happiness, Carpenter plays with her feelings by playing with other women. McPherson may be the better prospect, but one must question a man who falls in love with a dead person. Shockingly close to necrophilia, McPherson, who has a notable contempt for \"dames\", perhaps only falls in love with Laura because of the fact that in death she is unreachable. No one, namely herself, can taint his ideal of her.But Laura herself is a very ambiguous character. We see nothing but goodness from her, but is this because others are so entranced by her beauty that they are blinded by any faults? Her maid Bessie is in awe of her, her beauty the thing most remarked upon. Laura's own initial rise is through an association with an older man. Is she a symbol of innocence and loveliness or just an ambitious social climber masked by her incredible beauty? Perfect casting here with Tierney in the lead role. Who better to cast as the impossibly gorgeous Laura than America's most beautiful woman in the 40's? It's a good acting performance, with Gene's talent always being underrated next to her fantastic looks. She is supreme in smoke-filled close-ups. Dana Andrews is in hard-boiled mode, and he's hot. Tierney and Andrews made a number of films together, and were always a fantastic combination. Here, the chemistry and mutual attraction is readily obvious. Webb maybe steals the film as the fussy Lydecker. He gets all the good lines, and then some. Watching him spit out his dialogue with sardonic venom is one of the many delights of viewing 'Laura'.It was a daring trick by Preminger, to have his title character appear to us solely through a portrait. Also, the use of a popular song throughout a film can be tiresome, but the music is often what most people remember about this one. The provocative scene where Andrews goes through Tierney's apartment is sexually-charged and risqu\u00e9. Casually rifling through her drawers as if he owns them and thus owns her,he even caresses her underwear, sprays her perfume and drinks from her cabinet.10/10.",

Certain comedies, Westerns and Historical Costume Period Pieces filled that niche.ODDLY ENOUGH, IT was a Noir crime drama, such as LAURA, that also functioned in that manner. It is indeed ironic that the daily agony, horror and uncertainty of those dark days were relieved by fictional accounts of human atrocities.IN WHAT COULD easily have lapsed into a run of the mill Police Procedural, the concentration on interpersonal relationships, intense characterization and obsessive behavioral patterns by the characters made it into something other. To be sure, the elements of crime and criminals is pervasive throughout; and should be so.IT IS THE close up examination of the list of suspects' inner selves that sets the story in motion. It is a matter of the exploration of what goes on in the depths of the mind's being far more compelling than all of the gunfights, car chases and blood & gore that the studios could throw our way.THESE WERE WELL known facts to Director, Mr. Otto Preminger who together with principal players, Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb and Vincent Price, brought the story and characters to life. with the addition of a wonderfully tense & hauntingly beautiful musical score by David Raskin and dark, shadowy black & white photography added to the mood.WITH THE RELEASE of this film in 1944, the list of outstanding, memorable and highly unique movies grew a little longer.",

To be honest, Laura did not feel like much of a noir to me until the story and lighting gets darker in the final third of the film.We have characteristics of film noir - the unreliable narrator (which is somewhat confusing since he only seems to narrate at the very beginning), a story that focuses on crime - specifically the aftermath of the murder of the titular character - and as I have stated, darkness found towards the conclusion of the film. A lot of the film seems like a boring love triangle drama - make that a love square consisting of Laura, Detective McPherson, the film's brief narrator: Lydecker, and Carpenter. Naturally, each man offers something different to Laura and each has his own flaws. Unfortunately, none of these romances is developed well enough so we never know which one is supposed to be the focus of the story.This conflicting love triangle is one of two stories in the film - the other focusing on the question of who attempted to murder Laura and why. If the film was more devoted to this mystery rather than the underdeveloped romances Laura has with different men, this may have turned out to be a very tense film similar to the repertoire of Hitchcock. Luckily this film is saved from being below decent since its conclusion is tense and to the point. No falling action in this film, leaving it to end on an exciting climax.I plan to revisit this film in the near future to make sure I did not miss something which would make this film great.

Laura is truly an unusual film \u0096 for it is one of the few sub-par film noirs.The genre of film noir is easily one of the greatest American film genres. I cannot imagine the evolution of film to what it is today without it. Laura unfortunately has been stifled with anti-climactic events and startlingly boring dialogue.We really don't understand how MacPherson figures out a thing or two, or why he does the things he does. It's not like he is a noble character, either \u0096 definitely, he does not have the refine that a Bogart character would have. In the end, Laura is probably worth seeing, if you have an hour and a half to spare.\"Dames always pull the switch on you!\" RATING: 5/10",

As the movie opens we hear the first lines of the film which are \"I will never forget the weekend that Laura died.\" and the investigation for Laura's (played by Gene Tierney) murder begins and the detective in charge of the investigation id Lt. Mark McPherson (played by Dana Andrews) who is in Laura's apartment looking for clues to the murder and ends up taking her closest friend Waldo (played by Clifton Webb)along for helping in the investigation although he is a murder suspect. Then both men end up meeting another murder suspect who was Laura's fianc\u00e9e named Shelby Carpenter (played by Vincent Price)and also end up taking him along to help with the investigation. During the movie there was two scenes that I found to be very surprising (besides the final scene) but the scene where detective McPherson is ready to fall asleep on one of Laura's couches and finds out that Laura was alive the entire time of the investigation and the woman who actually murdered was Diane Redfern, which makes the investigation go back to the beginning. Preminger's direction for this film goes along with some of Hitchcock's best films, as well as one of the best film noir type movies ever made. Not only Webb's performance left me with a question, so did the performance of Vincent Price because he said some things that might have been relevant to the murder. The scene in this film that was the most surprising to me was the end scene when Webb goes into Laura's apartment and tried to kill her and found out that he was the villain after all that time of investigation. This is truly one of the best movies ever made.",

The resume of films he directed is so vast and so memorable that it's unfathomable the Academy didn't recognize his work. Long considered one of his best. \"Laura\" has withstood the test of time and garnered many accolades through the years as one of the best film noir out there. Gene Tierney, as always, was just beautiful in this film but it is Dana Andrews and the great Clifton Webb who are the real stars here. Preminger had to fight Zanuck tooth and tong to get Webb but he got him and it is one of Webb's finest and it won him the nomination for Best Supporting Actor. There are few actors who were as adept at playing the villain as Clifton Webb was and he was superb here. I've seen this film dozens of times, just viewed it again on TCM tonight, and it is still as enthralling as it was for me decades ago.

The black and white is divine, proof that lack of color should not be seen as a technical limitation, for to have Laura in color would be to turn it into Candy Land. It would feel so wrong. The performances hold up well; everyone underplays, there's not a sign of caricature or melodramatics to be seen.And the writing is amazing. One of the reasons I tend to stay away from mysteries in fiction is because once you've read through or watched said mystery, it ceases to be interesting. You know who the thief is, you know who the killer is and why, so why revisit? This is not so with Laura. The characters are so interesting and the world is so well-drawn, that you have no problem revisiting, because even though you know who the murderer is, there's always some new detail waiting to be discovered.Just watch it.

Towards the latter half of the film, every scene contains a new hint as to who possibly is and isn't the killer. It doesn't waste it's time with a convoluted story and then untie all of the knots and reveal the master plan of the culprit towards the end, it simply provides clue after clue consistently throughout the movie, and constantly defies your expectations and keeps you changing your mind on who the killer really is.

It also remains as one of the best examples of its periods \"film noir,\" right along with \"The Maltese Falcon\" and a handful of others.But as movies like this one are viewed again, with even more passage of time since they were released - I don't see how one could miss (or fail to enjoy) some aspects which are humorous today.The four leads - Andrews, Tierney, Webb and Price - as well as the primary supporting cast, all were one-dimensional, an aspect of characterizations then. They all performed well as directed, but today you'd wish for some sort of diversity, at least occasionally.While it is a fine mystery, and portrayed as almost the perfect one - you can't help but smile and stifle a laugh when, late in the proceedings, crack detective Andrews says he'd like to \"find the gun.\" Glad he thought of that.And even allowing for his foppish character here (and in other portrayals as well) you imagine Webb's character might need psychotherapy should his tie become an eighth-inch askew, or his ever-present boutonni\u00e8re become even slightly misaligned.As classic films get even older, there become more aspects to enjoy; that is the case here, adding, rather than detracting, with regard to overall enjoyment.",

However, the film is entirely built out of the dialogue and it has little else to offer. All its events are offscreen, even those happening in front of the characters. Fortunately the acting is terrific, particularly Clifton Webb's show-stealing subversive performance, and they're great vehicles for the dense script. The slick cinematography oozes with atmosphere and earned the film a well-deserved Oscar. It just needed a better ratio of show and tell, though perhaps its simply due to its genre. As a result, the film didn't make as big an impression on me as it could've, as engrossing as the film is while I was watching it, but it's only a small missed opportunity as it's still great.8/10",

The young and beautiful Gene Tierney character was put with the decrepit Clifton Webb character who was 30 years her senior. The storyline depicts how he literally took her to the \"right\" hair salon, clothes boutique, restaurants, parties, etc. Then when he could no longer control her, he stalks her and threatens any potential beau she might have. So when she chooses someone else over him, he murders her (or who thinks is her). So it goes to show how long Hollywood has imprinted this mindset of \"grooming\" upon generations of men and vulnerable girls/women. I don't intend to tear down a classic noir film, because Gene Tierney's character ends up with Dana Andrew's character, someone who is closer in age but who does violates all kinds of privacy as he \"falls\" in love with her.",

This might have been enough for a great film but there's more.There is a great cast: Gene Tierney as a successful advertising executive whose inner and outer beauty attract many suitors; Dana Andrews as a tough, stoic, no-nonsense detective; Vincent Price as a smarmy, untrustworthy trust-fund brat; and best of all, Clifton Webb as a well-spoken, acid-tongued newspaper columnist. Webb's character, Waldo Lydecker, could easily be the spiritual brother of George Sanders' Addison DeWitt, the caustic theater critic in \"All About Eve\" released six years after \"Laura\". (It was no surprise to learn that Sanders reprised the Lydecker role in a later television production.)All these great contributions are perfectly co-ordinated by director Otto Preminger whose attention to detail, particularly the camera movements, advance a fine murder mystery to a great thriller. It's enjoyable all way through.RATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Directing by Otto Preminger2) Screenplay by Jay Dratler, Samuel Hoffenstein, Betty Reinhardt, and Ring Lardner (uncredited) - based on the novel by Vera Casparay",

Gene Tierney is so much more relaxed and 'natural' than in such movies such as \"Leave Her To Heaven\" where she comes off being rather stiff. What's surprising is how bland Dana Andrews is. He's so monotone throughout the entire film I was waiting for him to come to life but he didn't. Perhaps that fits in with the film noir genre for tough talking cops. Clifton Webb did a great job as the jealous benefactor yet who can believe he really was in love with Laura? Maybe in love with her finery but not her as a woman. The remainder of the cast is great, especially Judith Anderson who turns in a great performance as a snake in love with Laura's fianc\u00e9.",

            "content": "Back in 1991 when TWIN PEAKS was the hottest thing on television, I read an article in PEOPLE magazine that suggested Laura Palmer might not *really* be dead. The writer slyly pointed out that her name was \"Laura,\" and that \"Laura\" was also the name of a classic movie about a beautiful girl who's presumed dead and how a tough police detective falls madly in love with her when she reappears. Intrigued, I went and bought the movie, and was delighted to find that it was a brilliant work in its own right, but very different from TWIN PEAKS. Laura Palmer in TWIN PEAKS is a small-town prom queen, but Laura in LAURA is a sophisticated young career woman. The extraordinary thing about this movie is that it perfectly capture the sophistication and allure of New York society in the Thirties and Forties, while presenting a love story that has the timeless feel of a fairy tale, while still crafting a suspenseful story of mystery and murder. It's a rare film that can feel cutting edge and contemporary after nearly seventy years! But every time I watch this film I'm stunned by how everyone just assumes Laura can be as ambitious and intelligent as any man -- and compete in the workplace -- and still be stunningly desirable and admired by everyone. MAD MEN was never like this! At the same time, for a cutting edge film LAURA is amazingly timeless. There's something both sensual and dreamlike about the way Laura herself drifts in and out of the story -- just like that haunting melody. At one point the rugged detective tells her \"For a charming, intelligent girl you certainly have managed to surround yourself with a remarkable collection of dopes.\" And it's true. But somehow it makes sense. She's Snow White, Mark MacPherson is her prince, and the rest of the characters are dwarfs!Oh, but that doesn't mean the other characters aren't stunning, or sensual, or captivating. They're only ugly on the inside! Just take a look at young Vincent Price, years away from being a horror king pin, (or a horror clown.) In this movie he's the most mouth watering gigolo you can possibly imagine! I have to say, Shelby Carpenter is one character I loved to hate, even if Price's portrayal is marred by the phoniest southern accent ever. (Vivien Leigh was from England, Vincent Price was from St. Louis. Guess who did the Dixie accent better?) Now take a look at Anne Treadwell, brilliantly portrayed by Dame Judith Anderson. How many times do you see an older woman madly in lust with a comically worthless younger man portrayed with such style, dignity, and quiet sympathy? Anne is one character I absolutely adored, even when (maybe especially when) she's revealing her own private ugliness. \"No, dear,\" she says, calmly discussing the idea of murdering her niece Laura. \"I didn't. But I thought about it.\"I just loved that moment. In fact, I loved every moment of Laura. Everything about this timeless story is classy and convincing . . . except for Clifton Webb's campy caricature of stuck up Waldo Lydecker. The stereotype of the gay man as a silly, supercilious, self-hating phony is probably the only aspect of this film that's dated. And even then, Waldo's acid humor provides much of the film's comic relief.",

            "content": "Laura revolves around the investigation of the recent murder of Laura. There are several suspects and all of them appear to be likely candidates. Even if they didn't commit the murder, you sense they would be capable of it. They all seem comfortable lying about or hiding things and none of them seems to be especially upset about the loss. This is actually pretty disturbing but that's the tone of Laura - it's not meant to be taken too seriously. It's a bit morbid but we can enjoy its mystery and the deplorability of the characters.There are many twists and surprises along the way. They keep the plot moving in unexpected ways. Even if we don't get closer to finding the murderer, we're constantly getting better insights into the characters. Their desires, jealousy, intentions, how they judge each-other.Laura's persona is larger than life. A bit like There's Something About Mary where an aura surrounds her and all these different people are connected to her. Multiple men are drawn to her and want her attention. They talk about the past and recount how they met her and got to know her. Her portait hangs large in her apartment and looks down on everyone.There are a couple of moments in particular that gave me chills. Moments where time seems to stop and you are completely in anticipation of what is about to happen. Without giving anything away, the ending is satisfactory. It could've easily ended in other ways. But it's tense and climactic. It reminds me of many Hitchcock films. Often a crime gets solved and yet there still remains some danger. Perhaps some final twist or just that the killer decides to strike again. Everything comes together in the nick of time and then the movie abruptly ends.I think Vincent Price and Clifton Webb were my favourites in this movie. They compete with each-other. They make stabs at each-other while maintaining a facade of gentlemanliness. Webb asks to goes along with the inspector to see him question the other suspects and is actually allowed to. He's up-tight and gets on everyone's nerves. Price always sounds so concerned and caring but is never really helpful and only really cares about himself.I think that's what makes Laura so enjoyable - that it's unconventional and unpredictable. It's an exception to many rules. It's more about the quirks and flaws of the characters than the murder mystery itself. You could even say it's mocking murder mystery films and plays with our expectations. So in that way it's refreshing. In any case, it works on multiple levels - as a thriller, as a dark look at human nature and as a subtle black comedy.",

            "review_title": "Reality or Dream?",
            "content": "This movie exemplifies the principle that if someone in a movie falls asleep, there is a chance that what follows is a dream. And halfway through this movie, that is exactly what happens. Originally, the dream was to have been made explicit in a final scene that was filmed but eventually cut. That was a wise decision. People tend to feel cheated if they find out at the end of a movie that most of it was a dream. We never minded when \"Alice in Wonderland\" turned out to be a dream at the end, because the events after Alice goes down the rabbit hole are too fantastic to take seriously, and we are charmed by the idea that it was the dream of a little girl with an active imagination. It is for the same reason that we do not mind that most of \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) was just a dream. But when it happens in a movie in which we are taking things seriously, we are irked by a dream ending. The movie \"Woman in the Window\" (1944) has such an ending, and the movie is weaker for it.The first half of \"Laura\" is narrated by Waldo Lydecker. At first, he addresses us in the audience, informing us that Laura has just died and that another one of those police detectives is waiting to talk to him. Later, his narration is addressed to the detective in question, Mark McPherson, as Lydecker tells him about how he met Laura and how they became good friends. Because Lydecker dies at the end of the movie, his narration is problematic. How can he be telling us a story in which he dies in the end? It has been done, of course, notably in \"Sunset Blvd.\" (1950), but we are supposed to be amused by the absurdity of listening to Joe Gillis tell us his story as he lies drowned in a swimming pool. In \"Laura,\" on the other hand, we just might think it was a goof to have the narrator begin a story in which he ends up dead. But if the second half of the film is just a dream, then Lydecker never dies, and his narration only applies to first half of the film, the half that is real. He is not responsible for whatever McPherson dreams after that.In his early discussion with Lydecker, McPherson says that Laura was killed with a shotgun, but no mention is made of what part of her body was shot. Even the second time the shotgun murder is mentioned, when McPherson is interviewing Ann Treadwell, nothing is said in that regard. It is not until almost the end of the movie, when McPherson has discovered the shotgun hidden in the clock, that he mentions that the woman Lydecker thought was Laura was shot in the face with both barrels. This delay in giving us this crucial piece of information is to keep us from becoming suspicious, because whenever someone in a movie supposedly dies, but either the corpse is never found or it has been disfigured beyond recognition, then you can give long odds that the person in question is not really dead. So, if McPherson had said early on that Laura's face had been blown off, we would have guessed that the woman was really someone else. Of course, once Laura returns, right after McPherson has fallen asleep, and we realize that it was another woman who had been shot, we infer that the blast must have disfigured her.Just before McPherson falls asleep in Laura's apartment, he gets a visit from Lydecker, who has found out that the detective has put in a bid for Laura's portrait, and thus realizes that McPherson has fallen in love with her. Lydecker is amused by the incongruous notion of someone as refined as Laura falling for the likes of McPherson, who is low class and crude. He contemptuously asks McPherson if he has ever dreamed that Laura was his wife, indicating how ill-matched they would have been.This is the first reference to dreaming, but not the last. After McPherson figures out that Lydecker is the killer, he tells Laura to forget the whole thing like a bad dream. During his radio broadcast, Lydecker quotes the poet Ernest Dowson, who speaks of life as emerging out of a dream and then closing within a dream.Because McPherson has fallen in love with Laura, his dream is the fulfillment of a wish, the wish that Laura were still alive so that he could possess her. Given this, we don't even know if Laura actually was shot in the face, or whether that was the dream's way of making it possible for some other woman to have been mistaken for her. And because McPherson knows that Lydecker would be his chief rival for Laura's affections, his dream makes him out to be the murderer, who is killed by one of the other detectives.Because the explicit dream ending was cut from the film, the movie presents itself to us as a story about things that actually happen, and that is the way most people experience this movie, at least the first time. But even if we did not know about the original intention of making part of this movie be a dream, we might still come to the conclusion on subsequent viewings that it was indeed a dream, for the reasons given above. In this way we get to enjoy the movie both ways. More importantly, we can regard the second half of the movie as a dream without feeling cheated.",

Not speeding off in a car, and he seldom went to 'the office'. I was intrigued, because most detective movies of this era, the police acted like gangsters & mobs themselves.Another thing that held my interest was to see Vincent Price in a non-horror movie. This movie must've been made in the early stages of Vincent Price's career as he is 4th or 5th in cast list pecking order, depending on whose cast list you are reading, but the movie still dragged.",

That character was based closely on writer and critic Alexander Woolcott, who was not gay (although I'm sure plenty of people in his own time thought he was). His chronic bitterness and gall, vented regularly in his columns, was due to impotence, a sequellae of mumps in his late twenties. Harpo Marx, who probably knew him better than anyone, talks about this in his book. Woolcott gathered around him a large number of extremely attractive women, but wouldn't marry because it wouldn't be fair to the girl. Think about Waldo in this light. Like Woollcott, he's putting his energy into creative pursuits, including his Pygmalionish grooming of Laura. This could explain a lot more of what happened.",

The changes in the plot always throwing the viewer a different twist to the story. Gene Tierney played the character Laura very well. Laura was made out to be a very sweet, angelic, pure woman and just the stories people told about her made the detective fall for her. Even her made wanted to work for her, paid or not because of how sweet Laura was. I also enjoyed the character of the detective, he was calm, collective and a very detailed investigator. The small rectangle toy game the detective carried around was a really good touch to his character.The cinematic elements were incredible. The lighting was just right to make out all of the details, especially in Laura's apartment. The way the light flooded her apartment the first time the detective was in it after opening up the blinds. The dialogue was very well written, the exquisite, but not too much, language fit the characters who spoke what. I loved Waldo's descriptions and the ways he used words, although it did coincide with what he did for a living. His entire character fit and in the end it all made sense that he was the killer. The costumes were very fitting for the characters persona as well. There was so much put into this film that it is hard to describe all the details. Everything was perfectly placed and the characters, and the actors who played them, were spectacular. A definite 10 out 10!",

            "content": "Otto Preminger and Alfred Hitchcock where both transposed from Europe to the US in the 1930s, one the Axis guy, the other the Allied guy. Both were masters of the suspense thriller, but in somewhat different ways. The 40s through 60s were an era of the \"psychoanalytical thriller,\" but Hitchcock always got more carried away with Freudian imagery. Preminger's good and bad guys, in masterworks like \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" also had psychological problems, but just a little grittier and less creepy than Hitch's. Preminger could never have directed \"Psycho,\" and Hitchcock could never have directed \"Laura.\"\"Laura\" is one of Preminger's earlier films, lacking the mastery of \"Angel Face\" and \"Anatomy of a Murder,\" but I still have to give it an 8, as a masterpiece of its film noir genre. A fair comparison would be Hitch's first \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" and I would argue Preminger got good fasta than the Masta.The story is a classic murder mystery, revolving around advertising executive Laura who appears to have been killed a few days before getting married. Suspects abound, from her own fianc\u00e9 who is none to sure whether she would have gone through with the marriage, to the columnist Waldo Lydecker who boosted her career and has protected Laura from lesser men, to a friend who wants to snap Laura's fianc\u00e9 away, and so forth. In keeping with Preminger's theatric tendencies, much of the film takes place in Laura's apartment, where detective McPherson falls in love with a painting of the dead \"dame\" (as Lydecker sarcastically remarks McPherson likes to call women).For starters, the script is exquisitely fine tuned and consistent, a rarity in any modern Hollywood film, but not uncommon in the 40s. It contains a big surprise smack in the middle, when it turns out that the murder victim is a suspect instead. Indeed, through carefully groomed dialogue, character development, and scripting, Preminger keeps you in the dark as to whodunit. All the obvious suspects have their pros and cons. Some seem too smart to do something so stupid, some too stupid to do it, some too scared. Only about 70 minutes into the 88 minute film was I pretty sure whodunit, and even then there was a suspenseful last 2 minutes. In modern films, a happy ending is expected and oh so maudlin. In \"Laura,\" Preminger could have equally well had an all- around tragic ending, but actually a happy ending (for some) worked nicely. Thanks to careful scripting, it's not even too contrived: the hero detective realizes, when he sees his right hand man still at the entrance of Laura's house instead of tailing the murder suspect, that his suspect must have re-entered Laura's apartment instead of leaving the house.The string-heavy Raksin score does its job nicely. Vincent Price shows up in an uncharacteristic role as a foppish never-do-well and Laura's fianc\u00e9. The apartment is soooo overdecorated, as was the custom in those days. Clues abound in hindsight, like clocks that certain people want to recuperate only too eagerly. So do false clues, like cheap bottles of liquor that only certain characters would buy; and of course a famous fainting scene, when a murderer finds his victim alive to his great surprise.It's a great film noir, I like it just as well as \"Maltese Falcon\" or some other highly rated such stories, but not quite as well as Hitch's \"Notorious,\" where the suspense is just ramped up another notch. Although on a 0-10 scale, I give \"Laura\" the same score. You know, 8.0 versus 8.3.",

            "content": "The enthusiasm of the other legions of \"Laura\" fans who precede me in their worship of this 1944 thriller inspire me to offer my own tribute and observations. My apologies for the tag line, it's just so hard to let go of Waldo Lydecker.It's quibbling over trifles, but I don't really see this as a \"film noir.\" Though it has the highly-existential b&w cinematography and the taciturn lone detective, it really doesn't have the downtrodden, rat-in-a-maze claustrophobia and desperation I truly associate with the genre. None of which of course detracts at all from our enjoyment of \"Laura.\" No matter how we classify this highly mannered murder mystery, the best one word description is \"CLASSIC.\" But let's say up front that logically \"Laura\" has a lot of problems. What police detective will question suspects then take them along as he goes to question other suspects? How did the grisly murder get cleaned up in Laura's apartment in time for McPherson (Dana Andrews) to bring Shelby (Vincent Price) and Waldo (Clifton Webb) to an immaculate and stylish crime scene the second night after Laura (Gene Tierney) was (presumably) murdered horribly there? Is it REALLY police standard procedure to call all the associates and suspects to a cocktail party so you can make a big show of the arrest? Of course you just have to ignore these little \"reality-based\" problems and surrender yourself to the conventions of 1940's movie magic, of which \"Laura\" is surely a PRIME example. It's all about entertainment, which \"Laura\" delivers with style.Many have and will continue to praise the cool, elegant beauty of Gene Tierney in her absolute prime-a \"Lorelai\" indeed! But the movie truly belongs to Clifton Webb as Waldo Lydecker, the effete, snobbish & powerful columnist who initially snubs, then worships & sponsors Laura although (as Roger Ebert trenchantly noted) he couldn't possibly be heterosexual. The unique charm of \"Laura\" is in its representation of culture clash--prissy Waldo being made emotionally vulnerable by the gorgeous career gal Laura, then Waldo struggling to keep her in his orbit as his primacy is challenged by the foppish Shelby, then by the \"real Man\" McPherson. All the actors deliver with great brio, though I have to wonder how credible it was even for 1944 audiences to watch Shelby lunge at rival Waldo, kept apart by McPherson, who steps between them then slumps onto Laura's bed to pull out his ball-rolling pocket puzzle to vent his stress. Cue Waldo: \"Will you stop dawdling with that infernal puzzle!\" \"Dawdling!\" \"Dawdling!\" Calling Dr. Freud! You gotta love it! My mom & sister introduced me to \"Laura\" around 2003 via a crummy VCR dub they pulled off of cable TV. Even in that degraded format its qualities were obvious, especially the stunning performance by Clifton Webb as Waldo. A memorable character and an overlooked actor, who is now surely getting some richly deserved postmortem love thanks to the excellent DVD reissues of this film and \"The Razor's Edge\" (also starring Gene Tierney, and also very highly recommended).As other \"Lauratics\" have noted, this is a film that bears multiple viewings. You find something new to appreciate every time you see this, and at 90 minutes, it's an easy commitment to make. If you are not well versed in the conventions of 1940's black & white movies, this (or, OK, \"Casablanca\") are a great place to start. They truly don't get much better. Style over substance! 10 out of 10!",

It had all of the plot twists implicating all of suspects at one point or another only until in the last ten minutes of film was real killer reveled.Laura (Gene Tierney) was a remarkably beautiful woman on the inside as well as on the outside and every man that came in contact with her fell in love with her even the detective (Dana Andrews) investigating her murder. He was mesmerized by her portrait that hung in her apartment, he could not get over her stunning beauty. As the investigation progressed he learned more about his victim and could not seem to get her off his mind. He was falling in love with her image and as silly as it was he could not help it. There something about this woman that captivated him. He spent one night in her apartment drinking and staring at her portrait. Yeah, I know it sounds kind of cheesy and it is but this was 1944, an entire different world back then and moviegoers ate that stuff up. However it is these elements that make movies from Hollywood's golden era so wonderful. There were no special effects to dazzle the audience with in those days they had to rely on good writing, acting and directing all three of those elements were well done here. The sex and violence were implied instead of being displayed on the screen in living color leaving nothing to the imagination like movies of today.I myself have to confess in this world of CSI Crime Scene Investigation where there is plenty of blood and guts displayed on the TV screen each week to give the audience as much realism as possible I found myself critiquing this movie for their lack of it. The woman that was murdered had her head blown off with a shotgun right in her apartment and there as no mess! The next day the police and some of the other characters were tramping around in that apartment and there as no blood splatter, not even a bloody napkin. All of that was left to our imagination but we have become so desensitized by today's \"realism\" that it is hard to not look for the blood and guts. \"Laura\" is a good movie even sixty years later and for someone like me loves classic Hollywood I was surprised I had not seen it before.

            "content": "Laura is one of the great classics of film noir, in its most urban and sophisticated version.The film is the adaptation of a novel by Vera Caspary. It seems that the young writer fought tooth and nail to find someone who would bet on her novel to take it to the movies, to the theater... and surprisingly she only found herself with closed doors, until she found Otto Preminger. Even so, bringing the project to fruition was not easy and required convincing the almighty and suspicious Zanuck, countless versions of the script and the abandonment of Mamoulian as director, so that we can enjoy this jewel of cinema history.In the end, as in so many cases, the film is a compendium of brilliant contributions from all involved, Caspary, Preminger, Zanuck, the writing team, the musician, the photographer Joseph LaShelle, and the extraordinary cast.Zanuck's contribution shows that these producers wanted and knew how to make great movies. Zanuck, who at first clearly opposed to the project (and the director), was decisive not only in the choice of actors and the rest of the team, but also with his involvement in artistic decisions such as outlining the characters, establishing the narrative structure (discarded the successive narration in the first person by three of its protagonists, the narrative structure is notably ambiguous), in the impact of key scenes by eliminating the annoying voice over.Beyond how attractive the characters are, the truth is that none of them is exactly faultless.We have Laura, a young and beautiful designer with enormous ambition. Naturally, Vera Caspary must have put a lot of herself into this story that reveals the difficulties a woman has to achieve the success she deserves. Laura only stands out among her peers when she meets and is sponsored by the famous writer Waldo Landeker. But it's hard to know how sincere her friendship with the talented writer is, or whether it's a self-interested approach to someone who can help her in her professional career. The least that can be said is that her reluctance to undeceive the writer, who thinks he has her secured, sounds suspicious. But her cowardice can at least be justified (sorry at making Waldo see that she will never be in love with him or fear that the sharp pen of the scorned writer will end with a stroke of the pen a position won with years of effort).We have the writer, intelligent, cynically funny and unbearably smug, who takes advantage of the ambitious young woman's dependency to weave a spider's web around her, isolating her from any relationships with younger, more attractive men. Although she can sense that their relationship will never end in wedding bells, it is enough for her to make sure that there can never be another important man in Laura's life.We have Vincent Price as the lazy scoundrel who only pretends to live off his attractiveness to women. Currently all his efforts are aimed at marrying the promising Laura, which does not mean that he still cannot maintain a relationship with his fianc\u00e9e's aunt and with the occasional co-worker.Not to be forgotten is this aunt of Laura's, who finds herself dumped by her lover in favor of her attractive niece and has no intention of letting that happen.And we have the tough and rude detective investigating Laura's death, who falls obsessively in love with this sophisticated character from the upper class, whom he discovers gradually during the investigation. He is fascinated by the life of this woman, her elegant apartment, the refined taste of her objects, her clothes, the appreciative comments of all those who have surrounded her, the (we suppose) noble contents of her letters, and above all the beauty with which a painter and lover has represented in the magnetic painting that dominates the living room of her apartment. The only problem seems to be that...she's dead.The cast is impeccable: Tierney has never been more beautiful and elegant, nor has Dana Andrews been more charismatic. Vincent Price, with his magnificent voice, shows that his talent went far beyond his histrionic and delirious extravagances in the films about Poe's stories, Judith Anderson shows that she was always magnificent, and that moderation and subtlety went as well as the most tragic extremes. But possibly the most memorable performance is that of Clifton Webb, who seems to have been born for the role.It's shot almost entirely indoors, with some of the most spectacular and beautiful black-and-white photography (the film's only Oscar-winning year in which the rather forgettable Going My Way hit), in Preminger's characteristic concise and analytical style.Laura's house is almost a character in the film: its vases, its furniture, the enigmatic clock on the wall and above all the unforgettable portrait of the protagonist.Of course we must highlight the soundtrack, one of the most famous and brilliant in the history of cinema, beyond its famous main theme, which became a classic adapted countless times. The way in which Raskin resolves the long scene of the detective wandering through Laura's apartment is exemplary. With the voice-over eliminated, it is now the music that tells us how the detective has fallen in love with the missing model in the portrait.The film has two important \"surprises\", so you have to be very careful with spoilers. But for this reason, today it is even more fascinating than at the time of its premiere, since the novel is not so well known. One of those \"surprises\" is absolutely magnificent in its conception and in its embodiment on the screen.In short, one of the great masterpieces of classic American cinema.",

            "review_title": "One of the best film noir mysteries ever...",
            "content": "This remains one of my all-time favorite movies. I had read the Caspary novel first, and knew I had to see the movie when it first came out in the late 1940s. (I was in high school and was a life-long avid movie goer.) The film starred two of my favorite actors, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews. I was already an artist who loved fashion, and the wardrobe in this film really impressed me and still does on repeated viewing. Tierney standing there in the white raincoat and that marvelous rain hat was stunning! Bonnie Cashin won much acclaim for her hats for Laura.It is nearly impossible to talk about the plot without committing spoilers so I won't. Just know it is one of the best of film noir mysteries with puzzlers, plenty of drama, and surprises at nearly every turn. The dialogue is witty and revealing and the actors handle it superbly. The haunting musical theme enhanced the romantic drama and later became a major song hit with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. I guess my biggest problem with the story is how Laura, apparently a beautiful, bright, capable girl, could have taken up with so many losers and a such a shallow group of friends.Another problem for me was the casting of Vincent Price as Laura's fianc\u00e9--I could never imagined him as a leading man. He was also Tierney's fianc\u00e9 in a later film, 'Leave her To Heaven', but the role was brief and without romantic scenes. And of course, Clifton Webb is also very obviously a man unlikely to fall for a woman--but if you consider that the much older Waldo was simply controlling and obsessive it works. This film turned out far better than anyone might have supposed, since at least two prominent directors turned it down because they didn't much care for the script. Gene Tierney worried her part would suffer because she wasn't in the film right away and then only as a recollection. The studio first considered Laird Cregar as Waldo, but Preminger said no-- the audience would see him as a villain the moment he appeared because he had played so many villains. Instead, Preminger wanted a middle-aged stage actor who had no movie experience, Clifton Webb, which at the time seemed a chancy choice. But he was perfect and the part made him a star. His waspish tongue and effete delivery did Waldo to a turn. In the book there is a scene where Waldo and Mark go into an antique shop where Waldo admires and wishes to buy a vase. It is not for sale says the shop owner, and somehow before they exit, the vase gets tipped and shatters to the floor. Considering Waldo's pattern of disposing of Laura's men and friends, it is a telling moment. (The moment is not in the film.) He seemed to feel he created her, owned her, taught her all she knew--that is his obsession with the exquisite creature that was Laura. It is easy to see Mark becoming drawn into that fascination as Waldo obssesses. That gorgeous portrait over the fireplace was not actually a painting--it was a photograph which was touched up with oils to look like it was painted. The studio had commissioned a painting, but it didn't satisfy them. After all, much is focused on that portrait, so it had to be right. Once you have seen the film, you may want to read the novel. Oh, and the movie won one Academy Award--not sure what for. Likely the camera work which is evocative film noir.",

            "content": "\"Laura\" really should have been called \"Waldo\". For all its acclaim as a classic, this movie is not great film noir. \"Out of the Past\" is great film noir. \"Laura\" is more noir-lite despite the moody interiors and omnipresent venetian blinds throwing stripes of shadow on various walls. Fans of this movie remember Clifton Webb's character Waldo Lydecker most of all. The other players fade.Viewing \"Laura\" (which is of this review now a 71 year old movie), is more a period piece now in many respects. The titular character played by the lovely Gene Tierney is wooden in the extreme. She's a mannequin, a pretty object, something desired by the bitchy and closeted Waldo Lydecker who lives a self-described lavish lifestyle. Clifton Webb, who was gay in real life (causing Fox president Daryl Zanuck to reject Webb's casting for being \"too effeminate\"), throws verbal acid on anyone who stands between himself and the object he wishes to possess, which is Laura. He doesn't want to own her sexually despite the appearance of his \"love\" for her. During the montage of his relationship with Laura it's revealed that despite spending evenings alone, they only listen to his record collection and discuss the columns he's written. Nothing else. Laura is his Pygmalion. He's a fascinating portrait of the 1940s homosexual in a Cole Porter-NYC mode. He dresses impeccably, has luncheon alone in a tony restaurant, and eviscerates everyone he deems beneath him. He also attempts a sly and unsettling seduction of Dana Andrews in the opening sequence. The look that Andrews gives to the nude (offscreen) Webb as he hands Waldo his robe says it all.Between the viperous Webb and the weirdly weak gigolo played by Vincent Price stands the studly \"real man\", Detective Macpherson, played by a poker-faced Dana Andrews. Twice in the movie Lydercker berates Laura for being attracted to the \"lean, muscular body\" of the detective. It would appear that the one really attracted to the cop is Waldo, he is obsessed with the physical charms of Andrews. Since Waldo cannot \"have\" the detective, he attacks him constantly. He scalds the implacable cop with such bon mots as \"...you think about her, taking her to the Policeman's Ball bringing her roses and chocolates. Drugstore chocolates.\"Clearly, director Otto Preminger knew exactly what he was doing here. He fought and won the battle to cast Webb over Zanuck's objections. Who better to play Waldo than a man who was already living that life, in actuality? Clifton Webb is the most fascinating thing seen here, making the title character the prop she was. Times change, don't they?",

You won't leave this movie not knowing every little detail about everyone involved, its very meticulously crafted. The script is also very well written, almost too intelligent for its own good. It throws out witty punchlines left and right. It can show that not every film noir movie out there has to have physicality, guns drawn and enough cigarette smoke to fill a stadium to be good. While it still contains these tropes they are sparse. Every actor delivers with fervor, exactly how interactions should play out in every film noir is done to perfection here. A film noir study class must have!Now the mystery, the meat of the movie. It keeps the suspense well kept. The viewer is definitely left guessing right till the end. Dana Andrews in fine form leaving no stone unturned. The detail on accounts he provides match the detail given to this movie. Like I said earlier, a meticulously crafted movie. Unfortunately I did figure out the ending before it came, but I feel it was by sheer luck, the script is very good and could have lead anywhere. Vincent Price is brilliant in a role I certainly wasn't used to seeing him do. In fact I didn't realize it was him until the end credits! He has a particular scene in a cabin where he just makes this acting thing look easy. Bravo! Gene Tierney stunning as the true focus of the movie as the titular character, I could go on and on praising the actors and Otto Preminger for the work done here. Its honestly really good.1944 was the year for some of the best film noir movies ever made. Double Indemnity and Woman in the Window among others. Laura no exception.",

I don't find the characters paper-thin as someone else had suggested.

            "content": "Based on the novel by Vera Caspary, \"Laura\" instantly sets the audience's hearts racing as the movie opens up with the alleged murder of Laura Hunt - a charming, sophisticated advertising executive with everything to live for. Think of the movie as Hitchcock meets film noir - simple plot, excellent performances, and plenty of twists and turns. Told in the first part through flashbacks, the movie documents how Laura has affected the lives of three men - one of whom has never actually met her but is investigating her murder.Tierney's understated, cryptic, and cagy performance as Laura is just the ticket for this fine film noir. You just can't quite put your finger on her on what happened to her character, but halfway through the movie, it all seems to make sense. This is the first movie I've seen starring Tierney and she is mesmerising - whenever she's on screen, you can't take your eyes off her. The camera truly loves her. She has that air of mystery that will leave you toying between whether her character had it coming to her or whether she was a victim of her bad taste in men.Webb's sly portrayal of Lydecker, Laura's egocentric mentor, is very entertaining - particularly when he discovers that Laura isn't dead and very much alive. The way he falls to the floor in shock is so staged, you begin to question whether he knows more than he's letting on.Andrews is the chief investigator assigned to solve this crime and plays the part well. He commands the screen just as any detective should, keeping his cards close to his chest as the two other men in Laura's life (Webb and Price) try to implicate each other. Price also does a good job playing the wet blanket hopelessly in love with Laura while Anderson pulls off yet another crafty performance as his keeper (who happens to also be Laura's aunt).All in all, the cast makes this movie what it is - a definitive classic of the 1940s. Tierney's captivating beauty and elegance, Andrews' unwavering determination to get to the bottom of this crime, Webb's blunt one-liners, and finally the Price-Anderson oddball double act, make this movie one you can watch over and over. Highly recommend.",

            "content": "Author Margaret Reines: How can one ignore a film that begins with \"I shall never forget the weekend that Laura died.\" and intriguingly we have a heroine who is dead for the first half of the film. This film has to rank up there with 'The Maltese Falcoln ' and 'Double Indemnity.' for a 40's noir film. The characters are supreme: Gene Tierney - at her most beguiling. Dana Andrews, Vincent Price and Judith Anderson. Each and everyone of them adds something to the film - and together they are a 'tour de force.' The sex - as appropriate for that era - is handled subtly (something today's filmmakers might want to look at): Waldo in the bath when Mark Mcpherson arrives, Laura's very clinging gowns etc - but that is all blown apart when Mark (Dana Andrews) spends some time at her apartment looking at Laura's Picture. Mark's character - usually so controlled - appears to gradually 'come apart' as he looks at Laura's clothes - smells her perfume, reads her letters and looks at her portrait. The camera never leaves Mark for an instant in that scene, and the Laura theme swells and comes to the fore - as if to take over.Ater Mark falls asleep Laura reappears and he gets to know her 'in the flesh.' There are several signals which show that Mark is infatuated with her: The almost imperceptible grin when Laura tells Mark that she is not going to marry Shelby, body language, and later at the station - he leans over her in a peculiar up-close angle when questioning her. and it does seem that Laura responds to Mark. The other main characters are a joy to behold and listen to:Waldo (Clifton Webb - with his acerbic, condescending comments.) When Mark plays with a kids' baseball game he retorts \"Confiscated in a raid on a kindergarten?\" and when he realizes that Mark and Laura are going to be together - and she is leaving him -he retorts that it will be a \"disgustingly earthy relationship.\" Mark is Dana Andrews at his best - and I believe that it was this film which catapulted him to further stardom. He is handsome, well-groomed, dour, sarcastic: (\" A doll in Washington Heights once got a fox fur out of me\"). When Shelby and Waldo look set for a fight - Mark steps between them with \"I wouldn't\" - playing with the game and chewing gum - never missing a beat. He is also amenable to all stratum of society - when Bessie the maid says - \"I was taught to spit on cops when I saw them\" he says - \"Okay spit' wherein she realizes that he will listen to her and softens her approach.The Film reminded me of \"Rebecca\" - wherein - although Rebecca is dead - she informs the entire film - only in 'Laura' the main character is absent for the first half of the film. Judith Anderson was also the housekeeper in 'Rebecca' and it is testament to Judith that she can tackle such a different role to that of Mrs Danvers and so successfully - as Ann Teadwell.'Laura' is full of unrequited love and sexuality. Walso is attracted to Laura but there is not a hint of heterosexuality in him. Shelby loves Laura- Ann loves Shelby - but he doesn't know it. Laura seems a bit distant - in the love department - but we hope she will make it up with Dana off-screen. When he is taking her away for questioning- there is a beautiful shadow of light on her face - making her almost ghost-like in appearance.I believe that part of the success of 'Laura' is due to all this confusion - different loves popping up all over the place, fast dialogue, a detective who is always calling different people to be questioned - and then never charging them . This - along with the stunning score - draws us into the film - and perhaps the confusion - so that the film remains eternal for each viewing. The dialogue is absolutely stunning - thanks in the main to Waldo (Clifton) and reminds me to a degree of \"All about Eve\" in that department - although AAE was double Laura's Length - with more character development. One could say that there is not an extraneous word in 'Laura' - it is quick, and pointed - the film thus needing several viewings for aficionados to absorb. Like all great movies - the fabulous score - written by Riskin after his wife sent him a 'Dear John' letter - elevates the movie to something greater than its parts. Learning about Gene Tierney's life added a touch of poignancy for me . At the start of this review - I mentioned a few noir movies that 'Laura' should stand with but really - 'Laura' stands alone in its greatness .Trivia: Waldo comments twice about Mark's silver shinbone - (sustained in a fight with a gangster) possibly because USA was at war in 1944, and it would have been appropriate for Mark to be 'in service' at that time (if not in the movies!).",

She was truly wonderful in this film, and it appears that anyone would fall in love in just the odd way the Detective Mark had. When he fell in love with her in her home, as she was \"dead,\" the zoom on his face as he was sleeping and then back out made it seem like he was dreaming Laura's return from the dead. The camera effect made it seem like a fairy tale, but when she was confirmed alive it caused it to seem that much cooler.

            "content": "The film was well built with outstanding qualities to match. The overall feel of the movie was centered around a very abnormal and mysterious murder case, which gave it the feeling of suspenseful, dramatic, and passionately driven 1940s' style murder mystery. Through out the movie, the murderer could've honestly been anyone they mentioned in my mind. Biggest reason for that is everyone was love driven, which in that case, made it extremely difficult to have no doubts who the murderer is. Adding into the suspense of the movie. The wardrobe and vocabulary used in the movie really pronounced the time it was based in, the business suits and use of words like \"Dame\".The cinematography was geared towards wide angle shots of everyone in a scene, which showed distinguishing body language and noticeable facial expressions. The use of close up facial shots were only used in a few cases to pronounce overwhelming feeling and expressions characters were feeling at the time. Editing was mainly the same camera angle for a long period of time. To add a certain focus or feeling of transition, the camera would zoom in and out depending on who was involved in the conversation. For example, when Laura and Shelby were talking in the kitchen at a party, the camera zoomed in when the conversation changed to only Laura and Shelby were talking.The movie had a good mix of digetic diaglog and non digetic music. Conversation was the main point of interest throughout the movie, when Mark was talking to someone regarding clues to the case, all focus was on the dialog. In different parts of the movie, non digetic music was used to provide a certain tempo to the actions going on in a scene. For example, at the end of the movie when Waldo tried taking a shot at Laura. The music changed from calm and slow to loud and sporadic, signifying something big is happening.",
