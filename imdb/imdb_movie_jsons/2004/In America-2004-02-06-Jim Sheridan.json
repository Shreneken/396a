They make us see their new world through their eyes. It is magic to them to be in a new city, where they discover new things every day. They are disarming.\nAmerica, the land that receives so many immigrants can be a hostile environment for a lot of people. For Johnny and Sarah, New York is a place full of surprises, as it must be to a lot of people whose dream is to make it there. This film is about their struggle to survive in pursuing a dream that turns out to be a nightmare for them, in many respects.\nPaddy Considine and Samantha Morton make the struggling Irish immigrants very real under the direction of Jim Sheridan, who is supposed to be the Johnny of the story. What they have to deal with in their new home, eventually make them conquer a world that's not kind to them. Nothing is given to them on a silver platter, which is the case with most illegal people in the country, so their tale is very believable and true to the pioneer spirit they have within themselves.It is the fantastic performance of the two Bolger sisters, as the daughters, which brings this film into focus. They have their feet on the ground and they know the ordeal their parents are facing. Their luminous faces and natural endear them to us in a special way. We owe Mr. Sheridan and family a lot for their courage to show us what they went through at their arrival in America.",

            "content": "Johnny (Paddy Considine), Sarah (Samantha Morton), Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) are a catholic Irish family, looking for a better life in America. They lost their beloved son and brother Frankie in an accident, and the family, specially Johnny and Sarah, is traumatized with his death. Johnny tries to find a job as an actor, but he lost his emotions and feelings with the death of Frankie and can not find a job, working as a taxi driver to support his family. Without any money, they move to a junkie building, where they become friend of Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an African painter who has a serious disease, apparently AIDS. Their lives change and Johnny and Sarah learn to face and heal their wounds with the arrival of the baby and the friendship of Mateo. \"In America\" is a magnificent and very positive tale of friendship and survival. The story is very simple and dramatic, but never corny, and the very convincing performance of the cast is amazing and touching. Jim Sheridan was able to direct the six years old Emma Bolger and achieve an outstanding performance in the role of Ariel. Her eleven years old sister, Sarah Bolger, has also a stunning dramatic and key role in the story. I dare to write that two stars are born! Summarizing, \"In America\" is a highly recommended touching, powerful, sensitive, positive and magnificent movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Terra dos Sonhos\" (\"Land of the Dreams\")",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness.  I have no idea what has taken so long for this film to be released.  Director/Producer/Writer Jim Sheridan (\"My Left Foot\", \"In the Name of the Father\" \"The Boxer\") has always been a tremendous filmmaker and with \"In America\" he has become a wonderful story teller.  This semi-autobiographical picture was co-written by Sheridan and his two daughters and is the story of an Irish family's immigration to New York.  I am a fan of Levinson's  \"Avalon\" and Scorsese's \"Gangs of New York\" and I will rank this with both.  It causes what I call \"crossover\".  That is when I no longer feel I am watching a movie, but that I become part of the story.  The characters are no longer actors, but real people.  The writing, directing and acting are all terrific.  Paddy Considine (a Stephen Rea lookalike), Samantha Morton (\"Minority Report\"), Djimon Hounsou (\"Gladiator\") are all exceptional in their roles.  However, this movie belongs to the real-life Bolger sisters, Sarah and Emma, who play Christy and Ariel.  Ariel's innocence and need to believe along with Christy's wisdom-beyond-her-years truly make this film work.  Rarely do child actors carry a movie of significance.  While these two bring joy, laughter, sadness and tears, they never cross the line of overly cute or overly sympathetic. Another odd twist to this film is the importance that Spielberg's \"ET\" plays.  The dream of home and the presence of aliens (drug dealers, etc) in their tenemant tie in nicely.  Their friendship with Mateo (Hounsou) is both bizarre and heartwarming.  This is an extremely emotional ride for the audience, but one well worth taking.",

Jim Sheridan has such a sure hand as a director that even as the story meanders along, and you're not quite sure where things are going, you know HE knows and you end up trusting him and going along for whatever ride he wants to take you on.  The characters and the actors portraying them are so winning, you don't want the movie to end.  You just want to stay with them forever.Every role, right down to the two border guards and the hospital administrator are perfectly cast and performed.  The two sisters playing the daughters are amazing.  But the acting in the film really belongs to Samantha Morton. It really is a high wire act.  In lesser hands this character might have been completely unbelievable.  But her love for her husband and children is so palpable, you completely buy everything she has to go through with them.There were so many chances for cheap sentiment here, but the movie never went there.

The story is primarily told through the eyes of the little girls, and they go through the hard times of adjusting to a new life while learning loss and gain. There is a sense of magic and cultural identity in the film, and this makes it even much more touching when told through the eyes of the little girls who have had their lives turned upside down in the search for a new and better life in America. In some places, it is a little too sweet and magical, but I don't think it ruins the film because it is told through the eyes of the girl, and I am certain that many more immigrant families went through experiences like this and even worse than this. I also thought that the acting by the little girls was done well. It's a sweet film; it's a little sad, and it's magical. It just made me feel all warm inside.

            "content": "Johnny, Sarah and their young daughters Christy and Ariel move to New York from Ireland. With barely any money they find an apartment in a run-down building that is overrun with drug addicts. Johnny, an actor, struggles to get a role and the family eke out an existence. Also hanging over them is the death of their son, Frankie. Then one day the little girls meet and befriend the mysterious, solitary neighbour, Mateo.Written and directed by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot, In The Name Of The Father), the movie is a bitter-sweet experience. The trials and tribulations of an immigrant family struggling to make ends meet, mixed with the recent tragedy in their history and the complexity of the Mateo situation make for an emotional journey. The daughters also provide a sweet, innocent perspective to proceedings.Yet it all feels underdone. The family's situation is not as grittily shown as we imagine it should be. The basic summary of this movie reminded me of another Irish movie, Angela's Ashes, and that was a harrowing journey, where no positive outcomes are assured, making for an incredibly interesting and engaging experience. This movie is too neat and non-confrontational to feel like there are any really negative plot developments ahead.In addition, certain key aspects are not developed very well. We never really get to know Mateo well enough to feel totally engaged by his character. Even the Frankie story, possibly the most emotional aspect to the movie, feels it is in there to demand our emotional energy rather than earn it, and the conclusion to that feels a bit clumsy.Can't fault the performances though. Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton put in solid performances as Johnny and Sarah, as does Djimon Hounsou as Mateo and Sarah and Emma Bolger steal the show as Christy and Ariel.Overall: an interesting, emotional movie but far from perfect.",

            "review_title": "A lot of strengths but they cannot over come the sentimental melodrama at the heart of the film",
            "content": "Although they tell border control that they are on holiday, Johnny, Sarah and their two daughters have immigrated illegally into the US in the early 1980's. They move to New York into a block full of junkies and down-and-outs. With little money and no friends the family face all manner of stresses and strains in their present and from their past \u0096 stresses that threaten the family unit and their future together.The names in this project attracted me to it and I did have high hopes for it. The film itself though is a strange, rather frustratingly mixed affair that is really good in some regards but annoyingly soapy in others. The plot is not really a plot in the traditional sense but more the recollections of moving into the new world told from the perspective of elder daughter Christy. I was fine with this approach and hoped that it would be convincing, engaging, moving and so on. Although you can see everyone working against it, the film cannot avoid the spirit of sentimentality and soapy-drama seeping into the majority of the scenes. This takes away from the grit and reality of the drama and does make it harder to get into because it doesn't engage in the way that the same events may have if they had been delivered with more grit and less of the soapy-inspirational quality.It is a shame that the film cannot shake this off but it is not the fault of the cast who are roundly really good. Considine yet again gives me good reason to respect him as an actor, likewise Morton who works well with him as well as individually. They are really well supported by two very natural and engaging performances from the Bolger sisters; they are \"cute kids\" but not in a way that is cloying or annoying. Hounsou has a strong presence in the film and to his credit he delivers this despite the material handed him \u0096 not because of it. The cast doesn't really have a weakness and one can only imagine what this film would have been if Sheridan had been given people capable of a lot less.Overall then this is a mixed affair. The performances and direction makes it better than it could otherwise have been, but these cannot shake off the sentimentality and soapy feel that much of it has. The end result is a film that has great moments and a story that I really wanted to lose myself in but ultimately was just too melodramatic at its core for all the strengths to totally overcome.",

            "content": "As a parent, although I fortunately have not had the experience, I can understand the unspeakable tragedy of losing a child. In America by Jim Sheridan is a very personal film about coping with loss and slowly coming to terms with it. The film is based on Sheridan's personal experiences and a film in which according to the director \"basically, everything that happens in the film happened\". The story is based on the recollection of Sheridan's two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten (now in their twenties) and is more of a tone poem about childhood than a faithful depiction of real events.Irish \u00e9migr\u00e9s Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) come to America by car from Canada with their two young children, Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger). The film shows the struggles of the family to find work. Johnny, the girls father, is an actor who goes to many auditions without success and their mother Sarah, a teacher, can only find work in an ice cream parlor. The family is forced to live in a squalid tenement in Manhattan filled with junkies, drug dealers, and transvestites. Frankie, the brother who died of a brain tumor is omnipresent in their thoughts and Christy says that he has told her that he will grant her three wishes when she asks.Shame over poverty leads people to do reckless things and one of Christy's wishes has to be expended when her father gambles the rent money in an amusement park. When Halloween comes, the only place they can go trick or treating is in their own rundown building. Here they meet Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), one of the central characters of the film, a huge black man dying of AIDS who provides a bit of magic and emotional support. When Sarah becomes pregnant, they are even more haunted by Frankie's death but the prospect of a new life provides the impetus for them to persevere. In America has its flaws but it is warm, charming, and full of wonder and works on a very personal level to remind us that love, generosity, and even magic can exist in the most unlikely circumstances.",

Each of the family of 4 play their roles perfectly to deliver a gripping, breathtaking and heartwarming film.The film shows the struggles of a poor family dealing with the loss of their son/brother. Showing the struggles of money has been seen in many films before, recently \"the pursuit of happiness\". I think this film delivers it in an accurate way without becoming a sob story.One of the best scenes in the film is when the family are at the fairground, one of the girls asks for an ET teddy which can be won on one of the stalls. This scene is gripping as the father tries to win the ET teddy for his youngest daughter, you can see the pain going through the fathers face as he tries to prove himself to his daughter as the dollars are rushing away from him. It makes quite simply brilliant viewing.I also thought it was great to see the father show his lack of faith in God since losing his son. When the two daughters ask him to kneel and pray, and he refuses. You can see just how much he has lost his faith in God, a great scene.The connection between the father and eldest daughter during the final scene was excellently heartwarming, it showed everything the film was all about in one powerful scene.

The story is told from the point of view of the eldest daughter Christy. The movie starts when the family crosses the American border. What follows is the struggle that comes with starting up a new life as a lower class Irish family.'In America' is a wonderful movie with a touching story and outstanding acting performances. Paddy Considine was the only one who was a bit disappointing, although he wasn't bad at all. Samantha Morton was excellent and very believable as a strong Irish mother. Djimon Hounsou was truly amazing. It's hard to describe how good his acting was! Although his role wasn't that big, he has made quite an impression on me. Personally, I loved the following two scenes the most. First there was the scene were Ariel and Christy tell Mateo about the loss of their brother Frankie. Mateo spontaneously starts crying, but what makes the scene unforgettable is the small white hand of Ariel on the strong black arm of Mateo. Beautiful! The second scene that I loved a lot, was the scene where Johnny comes to Mateo. He tells him a bit about his lost son, tells him about the fact he can't laugh or cry anymore, asks him if he's in love with his wife. The answer of Mateo, he tells him he's in love with anything that lives, is another strong scene with breathtaking acting from Hounsou's part! And then there are the two girls. Charming, heartwarming, very touching and sweet, spontaneous and honest! Both give amazing performances. The stole my heart from the minute I saw them. The funny detail is that they really are two sisters.I don't know anymore how often I have to repeat it, but this movie is a must see for everyone.

Almost everything is telegraphed far in advance (the picture plays like a chapter from \"Movies For Dummies\"). Once we learn that the missing child died after a fall down some stairs, we wait for somebody else to fall down the stairs, just so the two remaining kids can be brave. The movie gleefully pushes ahead with its inconsistencies and unabashed joy of discovery, but it is highly uneven (the lovemaking during the storm is embarrassing, particularly when the child-narrator tells us, \"that's when the baby was conceived\"--thanks, kid). Another maudlin sequence has the children eating at a diner named Heaven (the wife tells the husband, \"the kids are okay, they're in Heaven\").

Striving for a dream involves lot more than merely following the dream and this is what 'In America' is about. It is a semi-autobiographical piece as it is based on director Jim Sheridan's own life experience. Sheridan's storytelling is very personal as we see the film from the elder daughter's point of view. Incidentally, his daughters co-wrote the screenplay. The end product is a heartfelt story of love, friendship, forgiving, surviving and hope. It sounds a bit clich\u00e9d thus one must watch 'In America' to see what I mean (no, it's not a typical drama about coming to America).What further breathes life into the movie are the powerful performances. 'In America' rests on Paddy Considine and he bravely carries the film. It is an outstanding performance and I wonder why it got little recognition while Morton and Hounsou walked away with the accolades. A sublime Samantha Morton gives a beautifully nuanced subtle performance and Djimon Hounsou is phenomenal. These two actors indeed deserved all the recognition they got for their performances. The two child actors deserve special mention as I have hardly been impressed by child actors (who I find annoying on screen most of the time). Sarah Bolger particularly does well as the elder daughter. The supporting cast are all fit for their parts.I loved the way Sheridan portrayed the relationship within the family and their wonderful and unique friendship with Matteo. It is shown in a very intimate and real way. While a lot is happening in the front, Sheridan also shows subtle events in the background. The background score contributes to the moments.

            "content": "Based on the purportedly true story of director Jim Sheridan and Family's immigration to Manhattan from Ireland in the early Eighties. I use the adjective \"purportedly\" because much of *In America* doesn't make any sense. Why does a middle-class Irish family feel the need to sneak into the U.S. from Canada, claiming that they're on holiday? The financial wherewithal and annoying paperwork required to legally immigrate to this country would've posed far less problems to this family than to, say, a family of penniless Mexicans. The entire set-up of this movie is unconvincing.And thus it continues: out-of-work actor Jimmy (Paddy Considine, looking like late-Eighties Gary Oldman and acting like early-Nineties Tim Roth) manages to move himself and his family into a gigantic loft in a bad part of town that is, apparently, rent-free. Even in early-Eighties New York, an apartment that size would be beyond the conjoined means of a waitress and a cab-driver. Setting this unlikely and unfortunately large point aside, the movie dives into utter fantasy when we see Considine, on foot, dragging a battered old air-conditioner behind him on a busy street, incurring the wrath of on-coming traffic. Apparently he does this because he can't lift the machine over a sidewalk curb . . . and yet we later see him carry the damn thing up several flights of stairs to his apartment. Boy, there's nothing prosaic in *In America*: everything is a Very Big Deal, taken to extremes. Mystery-Man Djimon Hounsou, who lives a flight down from the Sheridans, has painted \"KEEP AWAY\" in scary lettering on his door while screaming like a madman 24/7 behind that door. But it turns out that he's an artist who takes an instant liking to the Sheridan girls after they bang insistently on his door for Halloween candy. It also turns out that he has a strange disease (AIDS, natch -- this is the early Eighties, remember, when apparently no one knew what to call it) and is \"in love\" with not only Samantha Morton, but with Considine, their two daughters, and the unborn baby in Morton's womb. Sheesh!I feel sort of uncomfortable knocking a guy's \"true story\", but this whole project smacks of personal revisionism. One is not too surprised to learn that Sheridan's daughters co-wrote the screenplay: Our Story, As We Wanted It To Be (Not Necessarily As It Actually Happened). All of us overlay a mythical patina over our childhood memories, but great artists struggle to scrape it away in order to obtain verisimilitude. *In America* reveals a lot about the Sheridans' taste in art-house cinema (e.g., Fellini) and, for that matter, popular cinema (e.g., Spielberg). The movie mimics, homages, and takes the worst from both of those directors. Unfortunately, it reveals very little about what their own lives were really like, I daresay. The period-setting seems ambivalent: it's supposed to be '82 or '83, but I saw a lot of recent car makes on the street, including some anachronistic SUVs. Most of the story occurs in that weird, Fellini-esquire apartment complex, inhabited by artful graffiti and friendly junkie neighbors, and so we can hardly get a grasp of the New York setting (this movie could take place anywhere, which can hardly be the directors' intention). I'm also not sure what Sheridan means by the movie's title: *In America*. This family does not seem any more dislocated than the other New Yorkers on view here, all of whom appear to leading lives of quiet desperation. Perhaps this is Sheridan's point. If so, it minimizes the uniqueness of his family's story -- again, this would seem antithetical to the director's purposes.The Bolger sisters who play the daughters, however, manage to redeem the movie from utter failure. Their parts seem to have been written from a overly fond, nostalgic point of view: the younger sister is entirely too cute; the older is entirely too wise. But the girls are a delight to watch, anyway. One real moment -- in a movie otherwise stuffed with unreal moments -- occurs when Considine is preparing for an upcoming audition, memorizing a script. The girls, hiding behind a shower curtain, keep sticking their heads out, giggling and pestering him with useless, girlish questions. The scene almost makes the rest of the movie worth watching.Almost. 3 stars out of 10.",

Later, when the family gets the medical bill that's in the 5 digit range, I as a Canadian am appalled that people would leave a country that has free medicare to move to the U.S.A.. If they lived in a country where basic things like child birth are provided by hospitals free of charge, they would not need to rely on magical wishes and voodoo men to save them from poverty.

This story was centered around five Irish immigrants coming into the U.S. illegally and \"finding themselves\" 'In America'.It's not at all absurd of an idea, because I'm sure that this happens every day almost. However, I completely disagreed with the message they were sending in a lot of different areas. First off, they make it seem romantic and exciting sneaking into another country illegally. Secondly, they make the idea of living in a drug infested apartment complex, with criminals and drug dealers, alright and no big deal. As if nothing bad would ever happen to them, or their two young girls.I found the movie boring and quite slow, and although I understand that different people have different tastes in film, I for one found it dry and hard to swallow. It was dull and made very little sense at times. But, if you are looking for a more emotional, and artistic piece in the process, you might like this.

            "content": "There are a number of credibility defying moments in this film, but as you watch, you begin to see them as real, or at least wish they were real. A lot of the spark and magic in the story is provided by real life sisters, Sarah and Emma Bolger, portraying the young daughters of Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) Sullivan, newly arrived immigrants from Ireland via Canada. Though it's a modern day story, the picture's cinematography evokes a somewhat earlier era, perhaps a time when New York City might have been a tad safer and more welcoming, even though you might not get that perspective from the run down apartment building the Sullivans are forced to call home. There's a plaintive quality to the life of the Sullivan Family, as they live in the shadow of a young son's death at the age of two, both parents blaming themselves and each other for what was an unfortunate accident, and even more dismally, the specter of a brain tumor that would have taken it's eventual toll. The presence of their screaming-man neighbor Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) turns out to be a blessing in disguise, as the evolving friendship between him and the Sullivans, particularly the girls, reveals a humanity in people that often remains unseen until we take the trouble to get to know them. The story is loosely built around the idea of Christy's (Sarah Bolger) three wishes granted by her deceased brother Frankie. There's only one moment when I thought the script writers took things a little too far, and that was when Christy stated to her dad that she had been carrying the weight of the family around ever since Frankie died. She may have thought so in the deep recesses of her mind, and maybe even felt that way, but no child of her age would have been capable of expressing such a sentiment in words the way she did. But for me, that's a minor nit-pick, as the over all story is one of quiet reflection and inspiration, and not without an occasional tear to share with the Sullivan family.",

It is the story of an immigrant family coming to live in Manhattan and try to scratch out a better life for themselves.  But it is so much more. \nIt is about loss, not just of a loved one, but losing yourself, as well.  It is about the coming to terms with grief, and being able to move on. It shows you  how a family can not recover, until each individual recovers.It is about the hope and promise of a new life, in a new country.  The struggle to survive and the need to lean on those you love.Jim Sheridan captures all of these feelings in this wonderful movie.  His movies (My Left Foot, The Boxer, In The Name of the Father) are about complex, intelligent, real emotions and people.  He is clearly one of the top directors today, and he is perhaps Britain's best director today.The cast, especially Emma and Sara Bolger are extraordinary, to say the least.This was a wonderful film from start to finish.10 out of 10",

            "content": "\"In America\" is a heartwarming American immigrant tale filled with humor. The wonderful performances by Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton as the parents and the marvelously natural Bolger sisters almost keep one's mind off the problems.  The semi-autobiographical story by Jim Sheridan and his daughters evidently takes place in the '80's, as \"E.T.\" is in release, but there's continuity errors (a radio station plays \"the best hits of the '70's, '80's, and '90's,\" the skyline is absent the World Trade Center).  I thought they'd end up with other Irish immigrants in the Bronx or Woodside, Queens, not Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan. But even there it's surprising to find a Catholic school still staffed by nuns, let alone habit-wearing ones, with no other immigrant students, let alone no other Irish immigrants. \n We're forced to sympathize with the basic premise of the story -- that this family doesn't come to America to Make A Better Life for Our Children Through Hard Work and Sacrifice, but lives in such a dangerous situation so the father can pursue a selfish pipe dream to be a penniless stage actor as they flee a family tragedy. Worse is not one, but two, plot points of what I call Movie Star Disease -- those strange, ominously foreshadowed ailments where otherwise healthy-looking Beautiful People develop life-threatening health crises; one is solved theatrically with deus ex machina. This approach was lamely justified because the story is from the daughters' viewpoint and they are presumed not to understand grown-up issues.  At least they got the extremes of the NYC climate right -- \"We learned a new word - humidity.\" The music by Gavin Friday is surprisingly un-Celtic, including a too-lyrically obvious choice of \"Desperadoes\" for the older girl to sing at a school talent show.",

The problem was that while this film was intended to make me cry I have to shamefully admit that once or twice I actually found myself laughing at the sheer ludicrousness of it all. The desperate Irish family sneaking into America after the loss of their son - in the 1850s I might have believed it, but in 1985...why? How about the hilarious African music that played whenever Mateo appeared on the screen or the fact that this caged animal turned from lion to pussy cat after one knock on his door. And the fact that he was in the far advanced stages of AIDS yet had a strong, musclebound body that features in adverts for growth steroids. And I am not a medical man but I am sure that you can't get a brain tumour from falling down the stairs. I could cope with these absurdities if the film had been redeeming in any way, but the number of needless clich\u00e9s in the film just ruined any hopes it may have had about trying to explore the nature and feelings surrounding the death of a child. Clich\u00e9s like the smiling and cheery black waitress, the tramp with a heart of gold, the heartless hospital clerk clocking up the five figure childbirth bill, the idea of one life ending as another is beginning. At the end the family were even gazing wistfully at the moon. From start to finish this film was farcical.

The story is of an Irish family coping with the loss of one of the children, and trying to make it in the urban Manhattan jungle of the 80s. There are many good things in this film - the freshness of the characters, the humanity that can be found in the garbage of the social and urban environment the characters live, a discrete and sensitive approach in the directing and acting that makes the viewer sympathize with the characters. Acting is good, I especially liked Samantha Morton  is both strong and vulnerable, attractive, as well as decided in protecting her family the way she thinks it's better. I liked less the conventional ending, and the manipulative treatment of the two girls characters. Children are in many cases splendid actors - this is the case here as well - but directors tend to use them as cheap currency to win the viewers hearts, and this type of treatment seldom makes good cinema.

I remember the exact day that you and Dad came out of the theater and were talking about how great this movie was. You kept mentioning it when you were talking about your favorite movies and how it was possibly your favorite movie of all time. While I certainly loved this, I really didn't like it as much as you. Don't get me wrong, it's a classic film! It's just not personally one of the best I've ever seen in my life. I feel bad for not loving it more like you did.I thought that this movie was going to take place in the 1920's. I guess it's because the plot was about immigrants from Europe so I was envisioning it taking place on Ellis Island back in the times where European immigration to this country was all the rage. Instead, I was surprised it was in modern times. Well, they show ET so it's technically taking place in the 1980's, but still a lot more recent than I thought. I was so impressed by the length of this film. It wasn't too long or short. I was surprised they managed to show such an epic story in such a short time! I thought it would go on too long, but the length was perfect! What's great about this movie is just how there's no bullcrap.There's no attempt in the least for this film to be fancy or elaborate. Instead, it works so hard to be as realistic as possible. As the end of the credits say, it is in fact based on a true story and was confirmed by this website. Maybe the reason this really struck me was because it was about this new family moving into an apartment. Well, it's not new for me anymore, but it definitely reminds me of the struggles I've had to deal with. Even last night, I had a dream about going back to our old house. It wasn't a bad dream, it wasn't even anything I've been thinking about lately. It's just well, a dream. I'm happy to have matured and moved on just like this movie.And yeah, it makes me think about having kids too. I still seriously consider that. I think the most intense scene in the whole film is probably when the dad is playing the ET game. You just have absolutely no idea whether he'll win or lose. The great part is how he does win the ET doll and for the rest of the movie, we see that doll in the background. It's the great details like that which make a film great. Everything that goes on is important. I love the little girl as the narrator. There's cam footage, but not that much, so it never becomes annoying.I think the implication at the end is that the guy gives his life to save the baby. It doesn't even explicitly state he dies. I honestly thought it would be the father in that role. Instead, it had a happy ending, well as happy as a realistic film like this can. While it didn't make me as emotional as \"United 93\" or \"Bridge To Terabithia\", it's still a great piece of work. I just love finding out about all the details of their lives, like Halloween, religion, and snow. You'd think this would be Bandit Keith's favorite movie. He said, \"In America!\" all the time! He's a character from a show called \"Yu-Gi-Oh\" made into an Internet parody, Mom. Don't cry, Mom. I'm living my life to the fullest right now and even things can seem bleak, they will get better eventually. Thank you for supporting me in these reviews. I may have more disliked than liked ones, but I still love doing this. ****",

It is not when tragedy strikes that makes us wonder what life is all about, but in this film, how this Irish family of four overcomes tragedy and the support unit they have that makes a family unite in love and wonderment. Theirs is a story where all family members have had their hearts broken, but yet they still believe in magic, and one little girl named Christy, in her three wishes.Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton who play Johnny and Sarah are the parents of two daughters named Christy and Ariel. Their daughters, Christy and Ariel are played by actresses Sarah and Emma Bolger who are sisters in real life. The film opens with this Irish family crossing into the American border via Canada with their car, a station wagon, that holds what little worldly belongings they have. Older sister Christy needs to use the first of her three magic wishes to ensure that the border patrol officers let her family enter the U.S. border on the pretense that they are only here for a vacation.So with Christy's first wish coming true they are allowed by the border patrol officers to drive across the U.S. border with some iconic 1980's Americana songs playing on their car radio and as they witness in wonderment the bright lights of New York's Times Square and life is grand for this Irish immigrant family. With little money and even less furniture and clothes, they settle into a drug infested Hells Kitchen dilapidated apartment building where the pigeons have overtaken their top floor apartment on first site. With a lot of spit and polish Johnny and Sarah try and make their two little girls a new home in New York's Hells Kitchen and overcome the grief of losing their little brother Frankie to too young a death from a fall and a brain tumour. Johnny tries to eke out a living as an actor and driving cab, while Sarah's steady income as an ice cream parlor server at a store appropriately named Heaven helps get them through each months endless bills.A relationship is formed by these two innocent Irish girls Christy and Ariel, with the reclusive and tormented neighbor Mateo who lives below them. Mateo's character is played by the very versatile and dramatic actor Djimon Honsou. His is a life of trying to get through each day by painting on canvas and with a fridge full of medications as he has also ended up in Hells Kitchen with demons tormenting his life. As the two children befriend Mateo, Johnny and Sarah grow to also adore Mateo and so they spend more time with him through the springtime, to the hot summer, to fall, to winter and back to spring they all bury their pain and enjoy each others company with more 1980's iconic Americana music scores by Lovin' Spoonful, Culture Club and The Byrds, brightening up each scene and drawing their films audience closer to these two diverse apartment dwellers who reside in Hells Kitchen carrying their fair share of the world's nightmares in their heads and on their shoulders.This film is inspiring how these two little girls innocence encourages their parents and their new neighbor Mateo, to put aside their past tragedies, overcome their current poverty and health deficiencies and by relying on each other, and with young Christy's two remaining wishes we witness that dreams can come true.Jim Sheridan wrote and directed In America, and the film was a semi- autobiography dedicated to his brother Frankie who died at the age of 10. This a a beautifully written and directed film, that will tug at your heartstrings and will most certainly bring back some of your own childhood memories if for no other reason than the excellent choice of 1970's and 1980's pop music filtering through the film at the right moments.I give the film a strong 9 out of 10 rating.",

            "content": "Rather than a gritty drama about Irish immigrants struggling to make due, Jim Sheridan has turned the downtrodden parts of New York City into the backdrop for a real-life fairy tale in his film \"In America.\"Instead of frightening us with frank confrontations of real-world problems in the form of drug dealers, trouble paying the rent and following one's dreams, the film holds closer to the family's two little girls, presenting events with a sense of wonder and at times a more raw child-like fear rather than true danger. So what seems like a film about an Irish-American family with Irish-American issues is actually a film about a unique family with its own unique issues, namely a ghost of the past that burdens all of them.The Sullivans, Johnny (Paddy Considine), Sarah (Samantha Morton), Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) move to Manhattan in hopes that Johnny can launch his acting career. They move into an apartment in the rough part of town and try to settle in, except from the very beginning it's clear that the family is still grieving the loss of its only son, Frankie, who died of a tumor.Whereas Frankie's death has impacted Johnny and Sarah in real ways, the girls have a unique understand and perspective on their departed brother. Christy, the film's narrator and a brilliant little girl (as both character and actress) asks him to grant her three wishes throughout the course of the film at pivotal moments. Both Bolger girls are quite gifted and they give the film its wholesome and at times even magical tone.Frankie's death is both the spoken and unspoken source of conflict in the film, which otherwise serves as a portrait of American life in one particular time in one particular place. Some scenes provide humor and levity whereas others are more thought-provoking. One such scene takes place at a street carnival where Johnny nearly throws away an entire paycheck on a carnival game in order to win Ariel a stuffed animal version of E.T. That scene almost says it all about this little gem.The most powerful chapter of the film, however, involves Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an African-American artist living downstairs. He's painted \"Keep Away\" on his door and the girls have often heard screaming from inside his apartment, but on Halloween they bravely knock on his door and they form an unusual friendship that has quite emotional results.\"In America\" has a very personal feel to it and that's evidenced by the dedication before the credits to his late brother Frankie (and also given that he collaborated on the script with this siblings). Although not quite what you're expected in terms of dramatics, \"In America\" is moving and an absolute pleasure to watch.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

An Irish family immigrates to America to start a new life after their son dies. The father (Paddy Constantine) wants to become an actor and the mother (Sarah Morton) wants to be a teacher, but, when they arrive in Manhattan, nothing goes their way. The experiences are told from the point of view of their eldest daughter, Christy (Sarah Bolger). They also have a younger daughter, Ariel (Emma Bolger). There are plenty of good moments in the film, but most of it is syrupy and clich\u00e9. It also has some ugly Catholic mythology involved with a fetus that will most likely kill the mother if she doesn't have an abortion. Guess what happens folks? Well, you can guess the basic outcome, but you won't believe how disgusting the film gets with this crap before it ends. The worst part of the film is the role of Djimon Hounsou, who plays an AIDS-ridden Boo Radley in the family's Hell's Kitchen apartment building. Actually, this character starts off pretty well, and I thought he was bringing something decent into this otherwise mediocre film. Then the film goes in the most hideous way it possibly can with this character. The climax is just plain offensive, but Sheridan manages to pile on an even bigger insult to this character in the film's final seconds. How Hounsou and Morton got nominated for Oscars is beyond me. In fact, the only credible performance in the entire film belongs to Sarah Bolger. Last year had an enormous number of break-out performances from juvenile actresses, and Bolger could sit right next to Keisha Castle-Hughes and Evan Rachel Wood, and I would have ranked them above almost any of the other four adult actresses who were nominated for the Best Actress award at this year's Oscar ceremony. The film is almost worth watching based on Bolger's performance (her younger sister ain't bad, either, but her character is such a younger sister clich\u00e9, blurting cutesy, serendipitously philosophical, perfectly timed lines), but, for God's sake, Golden Age Hollywood excelled in this genre.

I knew it was nominated for Oscars and received some critical acclaim but apart from being well acted I'm at something of a loss to understand its popularity and high rating on this site The problem is that the film lacks any real drama . A family sneaks into America and throughout the running time I was expecting bad things to happen . To be truthful I thought I'd be watching something similar to ANGELA'S ASHES where a family trying to start a new life find heart breaking obstacles at every turn . The Irish family seen here do find obstacles but nothing that will destroy their faith in human nature . We see the children befriending a black man who isn't a danger to them etc and because of these charming relationships you find yourself hoping that destiny deals these characters a bad hand if only because that would make for a more dramatic and involving film Certainly this is a film I would recommend for people who appreciate good acting . I don't have to tell everyone that Samantha Morton is the best actress Britain has produced in many years but I'll repeat anyway while Paddy Considine shows what a fine character actor he is . I just wish the story had been a bit more dramatic in order to hold this commentator's attention just a little bit more",

It avoids being overly vulgar or shocking for it's own sake and is that rare bird today, an intelligent family film. Disney wishes they could produce work of such substance. Director Jim Sheridan's vision of Irish immigrants in Hell's Kitchen is fresh, original and avoids the easily drawn New York stereotypes all too often trotted out in other films. Once again, Samantha Morton is luminous, Djimon Hounsou is reliably intense and the two beautiful girls are the touching, vibrant heart of the film. Portrayal of loving family life is no small task in today's cynical world, but this film genuinely succeeds. Sheridan's brief homage to John Ford is an easy reminder that were he alive and working today In America is the kind of film Pappy might make.",

            "review_title": "many fine elements but it never quite comes together",
            "content": "Jim Sheridan's `In America' is so imbued with good feelings and good intentions that it comes as a bit of a surprise that the film as a whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts.The film, written by Jim, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, tells the story of an Irish immigrant family embarking on a new life in Manhattan.   The family consists of Johnny, a wannabe actor; Sarah, his wife; and their two adorable young daughters, Christy, who narrates the film, and Ariel, a sensitive, wise-beyond-her-years little girl, whose wide-eyed wonderment provides the greatest joy of the film.  (Ariel and Christy are played by real life sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger).  As with most immigrant sagas, the family in `In America' experiences a great deal of difficulty adjusting to life in a new land.  Complicating matters further is the fact that they recently lost another child, a young boy whose death from a fall down the stairs may or may not have been the result of Johnny's carelessness.  Some of the film's most moving moments involve the ways in which each of the family members deals with the loss, guilt and regret that comes with such a tragedy.The fifth major character is a mysterious recluse who lives in their tenement, a muscular, taciturn black man whose mystical view of life intrigues the ladies in the family while making Johnny eye him with wary, perhaps overprotective, suspicion.   Mateo is deeply embittered about life (we find out why about halfway through the film), yet is instantly softened the moment he meets these two disarming children one Halloween night.There is much to praise in this film.  The Sheridans bring a warm, heartfelt tone to the work, capturing, with both honesty and compassion, the struggles that immigrant families face no matter what their country of origin.  The family members, despite their difficulties and personal problems, obviously love and care for one another deeply and this quality draws us into their tightly knit unit.  Above all, the movie boasts fine performances from Paddy Consadine as Johnny, Samantha Morton as Sarah, Djimon Hounsou as the mysterious neighbor Mateo and, above all, the Bolger sisters who are as compelling and natural on screen as any child actors could ever possibly be.Yet, despite all these quality elements, what is that, nevertheless, keeps us from giving our heart over fully to `In America'?  I think, at times, the film tries too hard to make its points, often sacrificing grit and believability in a bid to make the audience `feel good' about life. The film is set in 1982, the year in which `'E.T.' - mania' was sweeping the nation, and the Sheridans try to infuse some of the magic from that film into their own through the use of both direct and indirect references to Spielberg's masterpiece (at one point the family goes to see the film, and, later, in a crucial scene about filial devotion, Johnny attempts to win Ariel an E.T. doll at a carnival).  However, unlike `E.T.,' which was an obvious work of fantasy, `In America' wants to have it both ways: it aspires to be a realistic, earthy portrayal of immigrant life in the Big City, yet it also yearns to be a heartwarming fantasy filled with touches of Magic Realism. The mixture simply doesn't jell.  Too often the plotting, in an attempt to bring it all together, feels forced, phony and contrived, relying too heavily on implausible parallel events, while piling on the melodrama and tragedy to ludicrous proportions.  The character of Mateo is also problematic.  Despite Hounsou's fine work in the role, Mateo feels like little more than a plot device employed by the filmmakers to get their points across.  He is never allowed to be a fully developed individual in his own right, but instead emerges as the stereotypical `exotic black man,' replete with all sorts of magical notions and pseudo-spiritual mumbo jumbo. It is simply a given that Mateo is more noble and enlightened than everybody around him, and the movie ends up patronizing him in the process.Any movie that attempts to combine fantasy with reality has set a difficult task for itself.  That `In America' doesn't succeed entirely in the endeavor says more about the unevenness of the execution, perhaps, than the worthiness of the cause.  Thus, while one can enjoy the bits and pieces that make up the film, `In America' itself may leave the audience feeling a bit unsatisfied and frustrated in the long run.  I know it did me.",

            "content": "1. When searching for a comparison to make with the experience of watching this film, the only one that seems appropriate is Rocky. This is a deeply personal story for the author of the screenplay, and as such the emotions are more informed by experience than writing. 2. Those emotions are incredibly carried by the actors. You need only look into Paddy Considine's eyes and see his shame at not providing for his family. Samantha Morton's crazed post-birth breakdown is stunningly authentic. 3. I fell in love with the little girls played by Sarah and Emma Bolger. Their sweet Irish accents and adorable faces aside, the two of them are among the best child performances I've ever seen. Whether it is Ariel's sweet sense of wonder or Christy's balance of the mature and the innocent, the two of them are a wonder to behold. Watching Christy sing is almost heartbreaking in its purity.4. Jim Sheridan knows exactly what to do with the film's most pivotal scenes, particularly the \"game of luck\" at the show ground. Lesser filmmakers (like the directors of Focus) have stuffed the landing on scenes like this, but Sheridan knows exactly how to get the most emotion out of the scene.5. Djimon Hounsou gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. He's introduced as a screaming nutcase who we are to be afraid of, and his brutish appearance does a lot to back that up. But after only one meeting we are able to see who he really is and Mateo's frailty and grief and loneliness pour out.6. I wish we'd seen more of him, however. That and Johnny's struggles with God and his family are among the more undercooked themes. One or two more scenes would have made the film's payoffs a little bit better.7. We see most of the film through Christy's eyes, with this theme of \"three wishes\". The opening narration with the abstract colours and lullaby music conveys superb innocence, and with supreme subtlety we shift. Her closing monologue is one of supreme awareness and maturity and we realise how much she's had to deal with throughout the film. 8. At times it is heartbreaking and at others it will make you smile. In America is a beautiful film that should skyrocket up your watch list.9. I've got two slots left so I'll just say I love Sarah Bolger.10. Still got one point. I love Emma Bolger.",

In Morton's case, it takes more than a bad haircut to make a good performance. I had no idea why she wore her hair that way or what it was supposed to say about her character. She only kept reminding me of Sarah Miles in \"Ryan's Daughter\". As for Djimon Hounsou, Ed Harris did a much more convincing job as a dying PWA in \"The Hours\". Hell, even Tom Hanks was better in \"Philadelphia\".Frankly, I liked Paddy Considine more as the father, although (once again) good acting is more than sweating a lot and wearing a hangdog, whipped-pup expression that is like a sign around your neck saying, \"I am beaten by life.\" Don't even get me started on the cutesy kids chewing up the scenery.And best script? Puh-leez. I gather the story is based in a real-life episode in director Jim Sheridan's life, but the retelling is simply too pat, too neat. I was able to predict at least one line of dialogue before it was even spoken. We know that Mateo (Djimon Hounsou's character) is dying of AIDS before any lesion appears on his body and face, even though the words HIV and AIDS are never spoken. And we know how Johnny Sullivan, the father of the family, is going to pay the whopping $30,000 hospital bill in the final reel. Personally, I found there was nothing in the film to surprise me, touch me or make me care.For me, the only really interesting visuals are those we see when the fictional Sullivans first arrive \"In America\" (more precisely Manhattan and specifically Times Square). And having the elder daughter wield a camcorder was just plain dumb. How much does one of those things cost? The family is down to its last nickel, and the father won't hear of Christy selling her camcorder? I don't think so!If I had liked the film, the caption of this review would have been \"In Acamera\". As it is, this disappointing effort from the director of \"My Left Foot\" merits an entirely different label: Irish stew.",

Let me say, this film was absolutely amazing.  I felt like falling to my knees and weeping for joy as we left the theater.  This film is the story of Jim, his wife and daughters coming to America from Dublin.  It is not the story that I expected of immigrants coming to this country to abuse the system but rather a tale of hard working folks coming here to start over.\nJim was afraid that some of the material may be too heavy.  I disagree. There was more honest, heartfelt joy in this movie than I have ever seen. The acting from all involved was simply superb.  I'm sure most of what you hear about this movie from critics will be focused on the two daughters. Don't get me wrong, these two girls could teach any actor a lesson or two. But the talent does not end with them.  Jim's directing style of telling the actors how he sees the story and then letting them figure out how to show it has never been more successful than in this film.Two scenes in particular struck me as I was immersed in this film. Looking into the actors eyes, it was as if they realized at that moment what a powerful tale they were retelling.  Jim confirmed my notions at the end of the film when he mentioned that both these scenes were filmed as an artistic afterthought once scheduled production was complete.  Of course my two favorite scenes were the ones not part of the real story but I can't be too upset.  Here Jim gives something back to his actors to let them give back to him what this tale meant to them.I believe this will be released mationwide in the states around Thanksgiving.

It might as well have been set anywhere as, apart from a few shots of New York, most of the scenes are all set indoors, like a sitcom. It manages to make the Irish (the parents don't know what Trick or Treating on Halloween is!) and the Americans look stupid. America is apparently full of transvestites, drug addicts, black people, and AIDs victims ... as if we don't have them all in Ireland too. Too little plot and style, a movie that is as irritating as its child protagonists. Some sweet moments and some good acting (particularly from Samantha Morton, who was also excellent in her small but pivtol role in \"Minority Report\") doesn't hold this tripe together. It doesn't even manage to be an effective weepie. Avoid.\nOn the other hand, \"My Life Without Me\", isn't great either. It's certainly much better than \"In America\" (but that wouldn't be hard), it's more stylish, and the whole thing is carried by Sarah Polley's (she was excellent in \"Go\") central performance, and a rather good and very un-glam performance from Deborah Harry, of Blondie fame.

            "content": "Jim Sheridan, writer and director, tells us that this movie, \"In America\", is loosely based on his own family's struggles in America back last century, in the 1980s. I don't know how much of it is fictional but I suspect maybe 75%. The movie opens with Johnny, the dad (Paddy Considine), Sarah, his wife (Samantha Morton), their pre-teen daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger), and the youngest, Ariel (Emma Bolger) in their car, driving from Canada to the USA \"on holiday.\" Truth was, Johnny had no job, was going to New York for an acting job, and they had no plans to leave. Well, things don't work out quite as planned, and this is a story of their struggles. Relationships are strained by the recent death of Johnny and Sarah's son, Frankie, each feeling some responsibility. The other key character is Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an artist who they meet when looking for a place to live. In some respects this is just a \"slice of life\" story, and when it ends we have a better feeling about the family, but all we know is their future is still quite uncertain. The child actors are superb, and the adults also create very believable roles, especially Samantha Morton.Some SPOILERS follow, quit reading if you have not seen the movie. Johnny can't get jobs because he acts from his head, and not from his soul. Even his small daughter cries at one point, \"You aren't my real daddy, I want my daddy back.\" He has not moved on after Frankie's death. Always near broke, Johnny and Sarah get jobs, she in an ice cream parlor, he driving a cab, and they always struggle to make ends meet. We don't find out much about Mateo, but a photograph leads us to believe he came from a wealthy background. But we eventually find he is dying from aids. Against the odds, Sarah gets pregnant again, there are some difficulties, the baby is premature, young Christy gives a transfusion, in dramatic editing, the baby shows health by crying, as Mateo is dying. Johnny's check bounced, the total hospital bill was over $30,000, but it was found paid in full by Mateo. We never learn more about him, or whether this character was based on a real person in the Sheridans' lives.",

There is no real story to speak of, except that of making an effort to get over the loss of a child. But even that is not depicted very well.Furthermore, no parent, especially one who has lost a child before, will let their child enter the house of a madman like Mateo appeared to be. They would not let their children go off by themselves to knock on the doors of junkies to go trick-or-treating.The man dying while the baby lives is pretty much a clich\u00e9. Anyone could have thought of that. The tear-drawing hopefulness and prayers, and the wishes the girl makes are touching but not very creative. The hospital bill suddenly having been paid by Mateo is also a disappointment - it just is too easy a solution.And how come the child and the mother both survived, even though the doctors had clearly said this would not happen? Another case of 'if you want it enough, it will happen'. That is disappointing. Real life is not like that. This made the movie into a feel-good-movie after all.All in all, the movie appears like a wanna-be-extra-special movie, which actually is not that special or creative.

Sometimes New York has been welcoming, often it has been exploitative, frequently it has been cruel.  But the immigrants continue to come.\"In America\" is director Jim Sheridan's semi-autobiographical tale of his family's own assimilation into the bewildering world of the great metropolis.  He has crafted a predictable but deeply moving story reflecting both the tragedy of loss and the attainment of success in a new home.Leaving Ireland after the death of their little boy, Frankie, Johnny, Paddy Considine, and Sarah, Samantha Morton, cross the Canadian border with their two young daughters and the troubling ghost of the deceased child.  Lying that they are tourists, they in fact seek a new life where Johnny can find employment as an actor.  Legality is low on their priorities.If ever a film was stolen at the highest felony level by young actors, it's this one.  Eleven-year-old Christy, armed with a camcorder housing clips of the lost brother, is played by the vibrant and deeply affecting Sarah Bolger.  Her real sister, Emma, is Ariel, aged seven.Although there are Manhattan scenes, most of this film was shot in Dublin. The family finds shelter in a building and apartment so bizarre it could have been the fruits of a collaborative effort by Samuel Beckett and Neil Simon.  The family settles in and Johnny seeks work as an actor.  He can take on dialects and accents intuitively but what he lacks is that fierce emotive power that a performer needs so he gets no roles.  Thankfully he doesn't become a waiter (okay, so he drives a cab).In their building with some nice, some weird and some dangerous neighbors the family adjusts to America and New York.  The girls befriend Mateo, Djimon Hounsou, an artist afflicted with and dying of AIDS.  Their relationship adds meaning to his life and enriches first the girls and then their parents. Yes, again it's children leading adults to insight and maturity but that does happen.  These girls are in turn very funny and achingly endearing.  Christy is wise beyond her years, a state responsive to the silent but persistent demands of catering to parents who acknowledge the loss of their little boy but can not get past grieving and firing largely mutual recriminations.For acting as fine as the Bolger sisters a viewer can suspend a certain demand for credibility (nothing is funnier than seeing the girls bedecked in their Halloween finery standing in front of an outdoor Manhattan market brimming with huge watermelons. :) )The relationship between Mateo and the girls and latterly with the parents benefits all.  Development and resolution are very predictable but these are caring people whose interactions matter.  That makes the film matter from start to end.Morton and Considine are strong actors. Their characters skirt, for a long time, around each other's pain.  Underlying their tough life is a commitment that gets tested.  And Christy is more than a catalyst for resolution, she may well be a major key.Hounsou plays Mateo with passion but, frankly, I have never seen a terminally ill AIDS victim rippling with such sensual power and bulging muscles. He is too much of a stereotype.  End-stage AIDS is dreadful to see and I wish the director had been more forthright in casting Mateo's role.A very fine movie.9/10.",

The core cast of five are superb. The Bolger sisters nearly steal the show. However, the highlight of the movie are Paddy Considine and Djimon Hounsou's performances. Considine is heartbreaking as a dad who has yet to come to grips with his young son who died. He is equal parts lost, distant and filled with rage, but can not find the will to cry over his lost son Frankie. Hounsou is the neighbor downstairs in the tenement where they all live, who befriends the family. The beauty of this film lies in the leisurely pace that it takes in certain sequences of the film. It's simply a mimicking of life and it's pattern that we all live through. Hounsou is filled with rage but he knows the pain of dying because he is in the late stages of AIDS. However, Hounsou's rage is tempered by his understanding and vulnerability being near Johnny and Sarah's family. One climactic scene has Considine and Hounsou almost at blows over some trust issues until Considine's character comes to the realization that Matteo is dying. Afterwards, their friendship blossoms. The winter scene when Considine and Hounsou's characters discuss Frankie is so honest and heartbreaking that it's a revelation that such a simple scene can be so moving in this age of movie-making. The family still is mourning the death of their brother and son but begin to move on, albeit with many bumps in the road. Another terrific plus for the movie is the beautiful and vibrant cinematography. I also really loved the music score. It's sweet and childlike but offers a sense of whimsy. The final scenes are some of the finest I've seen in film. Through Matteo's death and Johnny's oldest daughter he eventually finds a way to cry for his lost son. The way that he gets to that place is a remarkable and clever twist that I think that any of the hardest hearts would succumb to.

There's a scene where a man must throw tennis balls into a box at a fair to win his daughter an E.T. doll. But what is scary about this scene is that the man is putting his entire savings on this game, much to the dismay of even the Fair man. There's a scene when they Trick or Treat at the door of a dying African artist with AIDS. There's a scene where the father of the Irish family must roll an air conditioner all the way through the streets of New York, up the stairs to his apartment, only to have the cool breeze last 15 seconds. There's a scene where the oldest Irish girl sings Desperado and almost brought tears to the eyes of everyone in the house. But i didn't laugh. I didn't cry. My sister thought I was a heartless man. It's hard to cry when you feel like a movie wants you to, thinks that you are supposed to, knows that you are probably going to. This is an intentionally moving movie. But what can I say, it moved me. It may be manipulative, but it's very very good at it.My grade: 8/10(By the way, a film with fantastic performances by everyone!)",

            "content": "`In America' may be the best immigrant movie ever made in the English language: It realistically catches fortune's wheel of triumphs and defeats that all underprivileged aliens must experience before being legitimized in America. As told through the spare voiceover of older daughter, Christie, the story has her accompanying videos from her cheap camcorder and the eye of a director/ humanist, undoubtedly a stand-in for director Jim Sheridan.Sheridan (`My Left Foot') depicts an Irish family of four slipping in to Manhattan through Canada, remembering the loss of a brother through a fall, gaining a fleabag apartment, and preparing for the birth of a new brother. Dad Johnny's difficulty in finding an acting job and his taxing night taxi job leave his wife vulnerable to the attentions of a nearby artist and present him with the risk of losing the affections of his 2 precocious daughters. But the sound track including songs from The Lovin' Spoonful and Byrds does not let the separation from happiness dominate.The children's obsession with `E.T.' underscores their need for a home and acceptance from the other aliens inhabiting the scummy tenement, including drug dealers and beggars. But the black artist Mateo represents the most life-changing occupant of all: A Halloween visit from the girls to his apartment reveals him as tender, not the roaring monster they thought. When he is confronted by dad suspecting him of being in love with his wife, Mateo responds that no, `I love you. I love your wife. And I love your children.' Sheridan has much more planned for this mysterious painter and the family he confronts. When we discover in the closing credits that Sheridan wrote this screenplay with his two daughters in memory of their deceased brother, we can feel the power of autobiography transformed into fiction.I keep thinking of Bergman's `Seventh Seal,' where the Joseph, Mary, and baby type of family ultimately triumphs over adversity.  The father, Jof, is also, by the way, an actor, and Sheridan's Sarah, played by Samantha Morton (a psychic in `Minority Report') looks very much like Bergman's Bibi Andersson. Both directors seem drawn to the magic of survival: Johnny tells Mateo, `I need a miracle.' By the time he experiences in a full moon several visions besides the usual E.T., he gets his miracle.  The other one is this film itself.  See how a director can bypass sentimentality in favor of realism but include magic that can be found only in America.",

            "content": "There is an early moment from In America that is one of the most difficult scenes I have ever watched, firstly for the right reasons, and then for the wrong ones. The Sullivans are enjoying a rare night out at the carnival. Ariel's eyes light up at one of the E.T. plush toy prizes, so of course Johnny must go for it. He sinks the first couple of throws easily, but the vendor plays a tricky (and often cruel) game; double your money for another throw, and get your entire stake back if you get to 7. They are sucked in with the promise of a small reward, and quickly incur such a debt that it would be unthinkable to admit defeat. The Sheridans ensure it is not merely a toy they are playing for; the scene's undercurrent is one of quiet desperation, of a small victory meaning so much more, of a parent's pride under scrutiny. Every miss is agony. The shot compositions do not show the ball, only the mounting despair on Johnny's face. We realise there is much more at stake than simply their life savings. Then they reach their final dollars, and the film commits a fatal sin by invoking Christy's cutesy voice-over, and slowing down the crucial moment of truth, milking every last drop of sentimentality from the throw.This lens of magical childish realism that runs through the film is so potent that it renders almost every threat to the Sullivans a cartoonish episode, a problem to be acknowledged briefly then whisked away. The introduction is sure to signpost how spooky and menacing their new Hell's Kitchen residence is, before allowing the two girls to later yell and bang on doors to their heart's content, and turn the creaky, drug-infused staircases into their own playground. The murky photography does no favours for their first encounter with the summer heat; a brief hurdle. And crucial moments of change and adversity are jarringly offset by the script throwing Emma Bolger into the mix to lighten things up. The fault isn't with her. She's merely playing her busy, six year old self, but the Sheridans insist on directing all the attention to the cheer she produces. Whenever the film winds up in a corner too dark or real, she is there to rescue it with her wide eyes and childish logic. The girls are enrolled into a Catholic school, only to be mocked for their homemade Halloween costumes. Kids can be cruel too, this shows us, but then they never go to school again for the rest of the film. The Irish Catholic roots of the family, which see Johnny struggle through a crisis of faith, are mere wisps. The actors take care with their accents, but where is the rest of their cultural heritage? Where is the sense of displacement in the biggest and busiest city on earth? On their first night, they glide through Time Square with wonder in their eyes, the traffic parting like the red sea for their arrival, the camera shaking with excitement. For an immigrant experience, you could do a whole lot worse. Johnny's real crisis is that the death of his son has left him an emotional shell, and thus his work as an actor suffers. On the opposite end of the spectrum is their mystical neighbour and artist Mateo, who all but summons a demon in his opening appearance. The scene takes place during a thunderstorm; Sarah seduces her husband with a blindfold, and then rides him like a possessed devil (we later find out her heartbreaking motive is to replace her lost Frankie). Downstairs, Djimon Hounsou is whipping up a fury having discovered he has contracted AIDS, flinging his blood onto every surface. Could an African actor pick a worse introduction for their character? His rage approaches something like savagery, leaning hard on vague notions of an othered caricature, his exoticism fetishised. Suffice to say that his role and his gentle interactions with the Sullivan family have little to say about race or prejudice. Mateo isn't even given enough agency to have his Aids storyline be his own, but the result of the incompetence of the American healthcare system (the Sullivan's hospital bill being another symptom of that, both valid concerns but in the wrong film). His 'America' has shunted him into a dark corner, and his only role is to play one half of the hokey birth/death antitheses that ends the film. Oh yes, and let's not forget his convenient wealth that neatly ties all loose ends together. Christy Sullivan narrates and guides the film through the lens of her camcorder, and her curious eye often narrows its stylistic focus: grainy, shaky footage tilted on its head, slow zooms into uncomfortable extreme closeups. And yet for all the cutesy ideals about heavenly wishes and guardian angels, the final result resembles something of an adult's mouthpiece. The merging of the film's sentimentalised version of Manhattan and reality depends on Christy's burgeoning maturity, often having to deliver heavy, sobering lines that speak straight from the screenwriter's mind. Case in point - Johnny begs for \"another chance\" at his audition, only for Christy to gravely sum up: \"But he didn't get another chance\". Another example from Ariel: Johnny's going wacko in his grief but the little girl cuts straight to the heart of the problem, tearfully insisting that her daddy has disappeared and been replaced by another man without a heart or soul. And in the close, Christy, having put up a stoic front for much of the film, finally bursts and admits, \"I've been carrying this family on my back for over a year. He was my brother too. It's not my fault that he's dead.\" Now imagine a film that would have the evidence to back this up, and not treat its children as mouthpieces for larger ideas.",

            "content": "In America's legacy has made it become one of the most critically acclaimed films of the 2000s. Well-known film critic Richard Roeper called it the best of 2003, second best of the decade (only behind The Departed, which was actually a worthy #1), and a timeless work of art equal to Frank Capra. Really? Geez! It was great but certainly not THAT great! I do have some problems with believability and pointers that would have made the movie better. But nonetheless, what the movie has is a terrific immigration drama that everybody will cherish.The movie takes place in 1982 where a poor family moves to Hells Kitchen from Ireland in search of a better life. I guess that the Cold War drove them out and they chose New York for opportunity, but why not elsewhere in the state of New York or Canada? Oh well. The family is still mourning the death of their 5-year-old son Frankie, but the older of the children (played by the real life sisters) prays to Frankie for 3 wishes and will only use them up for special and much-needed times. They move to the ghetto part of Hells Kitchen where they must do all they can to make ends meet.There are some really great moments that will make you melt. The first happens when they go to a carnival and the dad plays a ball-throwing game to win a stuffed doll of ET. ET is a reoccurring motif since he is an alien and the movie is about aliens in America. The dad is willing to give up all their money for that doll. But it is not just about the doll, the scene has so much to offer. A few scenes are almost this strong, but the intention was to make the audience feel as proud as the characters. Director Jim Sheridan succeeds in doing that.Here is my criticism. The family just lost their youngest child, they're dirt-poor, and must adjust to living in a new land unfamiliar to them. I know that the family tries to keep it all together, but they seemed way to calm to hold so much grief in. I have experienced loss, so its not like I don't know what I'm talking about. Losing a loved one (especially children) and money problems are the two hugest factors that break a family apart. There are brief outbursts at the end, but that is where they should have subsided. We see the family struggling, but them getting by so easily wasn't anything huge.My next bit I found wrong was that there didn't seem to be much moments of true victories that could REALLY get the audience glowing. The dad winning the ET doll and a scene near the end are it in terms of true victories. Most of the times the family overcomes an obstacle just puts a little smile on the viewer's face, not a starstruck smile that \"Rocky\" or \"It's a Wonderful Life\" did. The reason the ET scene worked so well was because so much was on the line and we saw him failing and the stakes getting higher and higher. I know that a poor immigrant family holds all on the line, but them getting over it all just seemed too easy for me to get the same reaction from other people.So these two flaws effected the whole movie and prevented me from giving it a perfect score. I know that I just spent most of the time giving it flack, but the movie does have strong suits too. The parents are admirable and the girls are adorable. The girls are what really carry this movie. The whole point of this movie is love these characters and be proud of them. The movie focuses mainly on their ups and how they cope with things that most other families would be torn apart from. The girls believe in magic, and magic is a motif that is played about perfectly. And frankly, \"magic\" is the best word for this film.4/4",

While not a bad film I again must wonder why is it that critics tend to rave about merely, at best, competent films? Yes, most films, books, CDs, etc. are utter crap so I realize the standard retort would be 'you've answered your own query'- yet....still when such an obviously flawed film is boostered and receives Oscar buzz I shake my head. The film was directed by Jim Sheridan, whose best-known prior film was My Left Foot, and is a mish-mash of a film that tries to be many things but fails to be what all films should strive for most- a great film.In many ways it's sort of a modern Angela's Ashes told from a female child's perspective\u0085. The basic problem is the film simply does not know whether it wants to be a realistic slice of New York poverty/tragedy, an uplifting Frank Capran fantasy, or a mystical allegory, so it ends up a middling piece of mush that leaves the viewer wanting more. As for the DVD features- the film and sound were fine, the DVD commentary rather pedestrian though. Sheridan tends to ramble between comments on the film, the 'real' biographical elements that went into the tale, and times when he seems to be speaking just to fill the track. There are deleted scenes, but nothing of any consequence, and an alternate ending that merely consists of a slight twist on the film's use of Christy's camcorder as an all-seeing eye to tell a highly condensed version of the story. Would that Sheridan had concentrated more on what he wanted to tell, rather than how he wanted to tell it, and the film would have succeeded far more than it does. As is, it's one of those films that slightly annoy because, in the hands of a better director, it could have been something as haunting as the couple's dead child is meant to be.",

The only autobiographical part of this film seems to be the fact that his family (Irish probably) came to America, and that they had lost a family member called Frankie (note the dedication at the end of the film). Everything else is just laughable. Someone commented that this looks like a Disney film....I couldn't say it any better. It should've been titled 'How I Wanted My Childhood To Be.....In America'. Then this film would work much better. It is absolute COMEDY to take anything that goes on here seriously...other than the family dealing with Frankie's death; and even THAT was borderline silly. I could imagine the director now coming up with the story to the film: \"In my version, everyone in New York would've loved us (including our crackhead neighbors), people would take us in no questions asked, we'd magically get everything we'd ever need, no matter the risk, because there's nothing in the world like magic lemon drops to help soothe the effects of disease and friendly crackheads to make us feel at home.\" How PATHETIC!!The acting was alright....aside from the two sisters and Mateo, there's nothing to really rave about. If it wasn't for them, 'In America' would be completely unbearable to watch....Ariel was just too cute. As far as my rating, this goes right up there with 'Titanic' and 'American Beauty' as one of THE most overrated films I've ever seen. My girlfriend regretted watching this film, praising the Lord that it has finally ended when it did.That was all the confirmation I needed....'In America' is nothing but overly-melodramatic nonsense.** out of **** stars. (it BARELY gets ** stars for the sisters and Mateo's performances)",

The fact that the presumably illegal immigrant somehow wound up in Manhattan, even if sub-Harlem Manhattanville (supposed to be the Lower East Side?), rather than the usual first stop for Irish Immigrants in The Bronx, suggests the Jim Sheridan more authentic biography is of a cozy bureaucrat/bohemian executive of the Irish Arts Centre invited to America with everything laid on in advance rather than this made up tale of an up against it family man/actor on the make. Typical of the synthetic manipulations necessary to turn biographical significance into entertaining narrative, and also typical of the weaknesses that such compromises produce.

It stars Paddy Considine, Samantha Morton, Sarah Bolger, Emma Bolger and Djimon Hounsou. Music is by Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and cinematography by Declan Quinn.Jim Sheridan draws from personal experiences to play out a tale of an Irish immigrant family, who after a tragic family bereavement, land in New York and try to rebuild a stable family life against all odds.2002 was a cinema year that saw a number of films released that dealt with humanistic themes of grief and loss of faith. Jim Sheridan's In America is up with the best of them. Receiving standing ovations at a number of festival screenings, it's the simplicity and honesty of the production that draws you in and forces you to to stay with it all the way. It's that rare old beast that can make you laugh one minute, only to then have you feeling uneasy in the the next scene as lead characters unfurl hang-ups and spiked emotions.Deftly told through the eyes of the elder Sullivan daughter, Christy (Sarah Bolger), whose three wish story thread enchants greatly, film expertly deals in cross generational grief. Considine's father and Morton's mother are ploughing on through the grief, so burned by it, they are happy to live in Junkie Towers, seemingly oblivious to the perils this can cause their two young daughters. But here's the kicker, the slums of New York hold no fear for the two little darlings, the ignorance is bliss approach is never more evident, and as it happens, it defines the Sullivan family. The grief process and a turn of events come to a head to give us a outcome of some considerable emotional wallop.Undeniably sentimental, it is, however, never cloying. Impeccably performed, especially by the two young Bolger girls, In America has that special something that appeals to those who understand that things in life are sent to test us.

I was able to get through this, and cried when I was supposed to (I'm not that heartless) but I think this film is more targeted for the \"Touched by an Angel\" types out there.Light spoilers follow...The extremely talented Samantha Morton is somewhat squandered here...but her scene staggering around and clutching in a hospital was very powerful. Instead the camera is handed over time and again to the Irish eyes of the Bolger sisters. Literally, we see footage from the elder daughter's 8mm (so a warning to those who are very sensitive to hand-held \"shaky\" shooting.)Many reviews here, and Jim Sheridan himself in the DVD commentary, have extolled the virtues of these young girls as actors and improvisers, but I just don't see it. I mean I attended a neighborhood children's musical recently and there were several performers in there that possessed a similar stage grace (not the majority by any stretch, but still).The omnipresence of video cameras in life as in this film should produce more relaxed and remarkable performers, but by centering a piece in Hell's Kitchen upon the backs of these heavenly pre-teens removes a lot of risk. Sure we wind up seeing junkies, transvestites and a man suffering from AIDS but their renditions all could have snuck onto a film from the 50's for more than a frame or two until being ushered out. Faster than you can say \"E.T. ex machina.\"I issued a \"shaky\" camera warning, I should also issue a \"voice-over\" warning. While I actually often enjoy them, many others don't...and in this instance, I think it helped to reinforce the safety net beneath this film. I wouldn't call it maudlin, it's just that something is missing, despite Sheridan's best efforts to excise as much from a film. The DVD extras do show that he cut wisely, but still we wind up with some pretty tidy checks and balances...and personally I prefer imbalances.Speaking of that, I need to get to my review of \"City of God\" which raises concerns about my predilection for bitterness over the sweetness that this fillum exudes. I must say there's a line at the end that seemed like an alarming lurch for a deeper message...sort of an abnegating one at that. I wonder if that was Sheridan saying that even decades afterwards, grief over a child's death defies any box or video disc or other confining container. Too much promise has passed with that life.5/10Oh and for the more-than-a-few reviewers here who loved the film but \"had\" to take issue with the children being allowed alone across to Heaven...now that's maudlin.

            "content": "If Jim Sheridan's first years in New York were anything like this movie, I want him to adopt me. Nobody in his family is dysfunctional, except in the most sympathetic ways. Johnny hasn't properly grieved for his son, who died of a brain tumor a year ago, but he still manages to be a decent father and loving husband. No brooding, no boozing, no abusing, and not too emotionally distant. The most noticeable effect on him is that he isn't emotional enough to land an acting gig. Even when he has a brief tantrum about his inability to feel, there's too much energy in it to feel genuine.Sarah let go of Frankie a little too quick for Johnny's liking, but she did it to focus on the couple's two living daughters \u0097 an eminently sensible choice, in my opinion. In fact, everything she does is sensible or better. She creatively decorates their tenement apartment (Martha should take some notes), and somehow manages to keep the family well-fed on her wages as a waitress and Johhny's as a cab driver without ever succumbing to the grind of poverty, the stress of parenting, or frustration with Johnny's aspiring actor routine. Her Achilles' heel is to keep her pregnancy going, even though it might be dangerous. How dangerous, you ask? We're never told, except when her doctor warns her that she'll have to be very brave, which she is \u0097 to perfection. Christy, the elder daughter, has turned just the slightest bit aloof since Frankie died and has become the family's videographer. She's engaged enough, though, to be very protective of her younger sister, Ariel, who is cute as a button and displays the simple, extraordinary wisdom that all perfect children do. Miss Manners would love this pair; they don't curse, throw tantrums, make a mess, drive their parents crazy, or get corrupted or harmed in the least by New York or the slum they live in. Christy's late-breaking revelation that she feels burdened since Frankie's death rings false, since there was no evidence for it during the film.And then there's Mateo, the crazy, angry, dying-from-AIDS artist whose heart is melted by Christy's and Ariel's trick or treating. The script is so ham-handed with guardian angel symbolism for his character, he might as well have worn a halo.Even the family's slum seems like Mr. Roger's low-rent neighborhood. The junkies and beggars are well-behaved, to the point where one beggar gives Johnny some food stamps. There's a spotless, well-lit, 24-hour, ice cream parlor within walking distance. The kids aren't don't get mugged or shaken down for their lunch money at school. Maybe that didn't happen at the nice, Catholic school they attend, but apparently, they're not so much as ridiculed for speaking with an accent, since they never come home frowning. Come to think of it, they should be happy, since the school doesn't seem to assign any homework, unless you count the hours Christy practiced (off-camera, of course) for her recital performance of the Eagles' Desperado, an unsubtle appeal to Johnny to start grieving.It shouldn't take much to make an immigrant stories interesting \u0096 showing a culture through new eyes, yada yada. But In America is sanitized, presenting stereotypes, never letting characters develop, and never presenting the real dangers and disappointments a new country and culture presents to immigrants. I sincerely wanted to let In America tug at my heartstrings, but it kept trying to tug too hard and all the way through the movie.",

It's only until way into the movie that it finally dawn on us that rather than specifically a story about immigrants, IA is a family drama that could have happened to any family, immigrated or otherwise. Here is how it goes.After crossing from the Canadian border as vacationers, the family of four settles in a boarding house inhabited mostly by junkies. While father Johnny pursues in frustration his elusive career of an actor and mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) takes odd jobs to keep the family afloat financially, the two little girls, at 11 and 6, seem immune to worries and befriend an intimidating-looking artist Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) the floor below.We follow a fragmented account of these strangers in a strange land until summer comes, bringing unbearable heat. We then witness some comical situations when father hauls home an old air conditioner and finally gets it working only to have the fuse blown for the entire house, causing a threatening uproar from the inhabitants. In their temporary \"exile\", the family gets into a festive mood in an amusement park, culminating in Johnny winning a toy ET for the girls at a game stall, on the verge of losing an entire life's saving. In the height of an ecstatic mood, the family goes home (presumably the neighbour have calmed down), and the couple sends the girl to the ice cream parlour across the street to a reliable neighbour's temporary care. The joyous mood, you see, happens to be the best foreplay, as it can be appreciated that under their living conditions since coming to New York, enjoyment of sex must have been a rare luxury.All the apparently insignificant events have in fact been carefully constructed to lead to this point. Sarah becomes pregnant, a pregnancy that bring to a head a painful memory that the family has been pretending to have forgotten. IA is about the devastating impact of the loss of a family member on the surviving members, not the least of which on the 11-year-old girl. The movie has many wonderfully dramatic moments and the acting is top-notch. Morton was nominated for the Oscar but Charlize Theron was just too strong that year (Monster). Ditto Hounson, losing to Tom Robbins (Mystic River). But he won in \"Independent spirit\". The two girls playing the sisters are real sisters in life, Sarah and Emma Bolgar, and they are just amazing.",

Unless it's \"in\" the Sheridan family's highly distorted memory bank.  The young couple and their two girls are standins for Jim et al., both real and fictional families having lost a little boy named Frankie before coming to live in New York (or \"in\" New York; or in \"New York\") in the early Eighties. But nobody and no place seems real, except for a noble suffering black man of exotic origin, full of money and some disease.  Even he, Mateo (the always impressive Djimon Hounsou), seems more super-real  than real.   Mateo shows the Irish filmmaker's apparent love-hate relationship with African Americans:  they appear both to attract him with their warmth and humanity and to terrify him with their dark mystery and repressed rage.  His vision of Mateo evokes Vachel Lindsay's \"The Congo\" with it's `Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room. . . Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.'  When Mateo befriends Christy and Ariel, you don't know whether he's going to hug them or crush them. If he has AIDS, why is he so robust right up until the end?\nWhy does the whole family come to New York when the father has no job?  How do they find a huge apartment in Manhattan -- in any kind of building - with no money?  How, in these circumstances, can they afford to send their daughters to a Catholic school? How can even the stupidest family go and risk every penny of their rent money on a carnival doll? (An incident out of the corniest old movies, this is one whose manipulativeness is painful to watch.)  These are questions that can't be answered. This movie is simply a candy-coated dream of how it might have been.      `I didn't know it was going to be a tear-jerker,' a viewer observed, walking out, but it's hard to see how it could be anything else.  The boy has died and the parents haven't gotten over it. Their new life - we're told -- is fragile but somehow they survive.  This is the stuff of primitive melodrama. The ten-year-old daughter, Christy (Sarah Bolger, whose own sister plays her younger sibling) says,  `I've been carrying this family on my back ever since Frankie died.' So you have her father (Paddy Considine) and her mother (Samantha Morton) as sad but driven childlike creatures whom this Shakespearean child must keep stable.  That's pathetic. \nConsidine has the tough job of playing an actor who does badly in auditions because he's ceased to feel:  he does it as appealingly as anyone could; but since he's so often frantic, it's hard to see that as not feeling.  Samantha Morton, with a Jean Seeberg crewcut, is as ever very present, though checking in is about all she ever has to do.  There's no faulting the acting: the troubles go deeper.  The little girls are as great together as you'd expect, and Hounsou is monumental in the emblematic role of Mateo.But the movie ends by seeming little more than therapy for the filmmakers; it's obviously all about saying goodbye to their lost boy. It works considerably less well for the audience because Frankie to us is an abstraction, and because the hurdles to be overcome along the way to a stable life all seem contrived.  Most the events of In America are ones that in anyone's life would seem grim and nightmarish; but, being represented in a way that's ungrounded in recognizable reality, they come to seem little more than a self-serving fantasy.  Other writers have amply demonstrated that the movie doesn't achieve or even seek even the most minimal degree of realism in setting or period; and they've pointed out that it's hard to bewail the rude sufferings of a family that appears to live, not `In America,' but in a make-believe candy dream.    Jim Sheridan has excelled at representing experiences outside his own immediate realm.  He should stick to those.",

            "content": "`In America' was praised as one of the most mesmerizing films of 2003. This story about an Irish Immigrant family adjusting to life in 80's in New York was nominated for several illustrious awards. The movie was based on Director Jim Sheridan's similar immigrational experience in the 80's. The Sheridan daughters even co-wrote the screenplay. However, only In America can a mediocre tearjerker flick can immigrate itself to an echelon category. Also, only `In America' can a mediocre film reviewer like myself can write about the overrated exaltation of `In America'  without no hesitation. Ok! Back to `In America'. Paddy Considine & Samantha Morton star as the immigrant parents, Johnny & Sara. However, the fireworks of `In America' was the performances of its supporting players; Sarah & Emma Bolger's work as the inquiring young daughters Christy & Ariel will probably be providing them future child-actor roles `In Hollywood, America' for years to come. Also, the underrated Djimon Hounsou as Mateo, the dying screaming neighbor, cried out to academy voters to eventually nominate him for a Best Supporting Actor nomination; which he was deserving of such an accolade. Director Sheridan does an admirable job of directing but not the level of `The Sher Thing' as the top auteur work of the year. Now, it's not like I am telling everyone In America not to experience this film. `In America' is worth exploring but not to the point of finding artistic liberty & cinematic justice for all. *** Average",

            "content": "I've seen a fair number of movies about people struggling to make ends meet as they come to America, and they often are quite depressing and hard to watch. In America has the added bummer of focusing on a family that is mourning the loss of a child. Yet there's something delightfully joyful about this film. The performances, particularly from the young girls, have a sense of hope and make even these difficult situations seem bearable. I loved seeing this family live their lives, and bring happiness to a home that could be so dreary. Unlike many other stories where we are forced to wallow in the poverty of the characters, and see the pathetic struggle to make ends meet, I never felt that here. We could see that they were having financial troubles, but the movie didn't become focused on that aspect. Now, that's not to say there are no moments of sadness in the movie. In fact, I was crying like a baby multiple times while watching, but that's because I connected with these people first and therefore cared about their heartache.I also have to commend the story-telling techniques used throughout the film. This is one of the rare times that I felt voiceover was not only warranted, but actually improved the story. We get tiny bits of insight when we hear what the older sister is thinking. There is also a scene that was so powerful I told multiple people about it immediately after watching the film. I cannot remember the last time I was so tense in a movie that was not a thriller or horror film of any kind. There was a moment where I literally covered my eyes, because I could not bear to watch. Any time a movie is capable of controlling how I feel to that degree, I have to applaud the film-makers. There were certain aspects of In America that were predictable, like the fact that the neighbor played by Djimon Hounsou is going to have a bigger role in the story, but I didn't find it bothersome that I could see some things coming. In America is a delightful movie, that had me laughing, crying, and anxiously anticipating when I might see it again.",

            "content": "I have heard so many great things about this film from both critics and casual viewers and after watching this I came away realizing that unless you buy into all the so-called mysticisms and positive outlook of the characters your in for a heavy handed story. This film is about an Irish immigrant family that moves to Hells Kitchen in New York City and they are forced to live in a shabby tenement that houses many drug addicts and other deviants. Johnny (Paddy Considine) wants to be an actor and goes on an endless amount of auditions hoping for that big break. His wife Sarah (Samantha Morton) and their two daughters make the best of the rough living conditions and they soon hear the yells of their downstairs neighbor who is an artist and he frequently yells out in anger over his attempts to paint. Christy and Ariel (Sarah and Emma Bolger) are the daughters and they meet Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) while trick and treating and they soon become friends.\n*****SPOILER ALERT*****Mateo learns that this family had suffered the loss of another child a year earlier and Johnny and Sarah carry the guilt around with them that causes emotional strife in their relationship. Sarah gets pregnant again but the doctor tells them that there are complications and the pregnancy could be dangerous to both her and the unborn child. While Sarah is in the hospital Mateo also is entered because he is suffering from a disease that might be AIDS. This film is directed by Jim Sheridan who also made the terrific \"My Left Foot\" and this story is very personal to him. The script was written by him and his daughters and its loosely based on two aspects of Sheridan's life. Being a real Irish immigrant and trying to fit into a new place with unique characters is the first and the second is the fact that Sheridan's brother died when he was ten years old. This film is very well acted and this is a good showcase for Considine. Also continuing her impressive career is Morton who has never given a bad performance and she shows real aggravation towards her husband who personally blames himself for the death of their son. I've heard a lot of praise aimed at the Bolger sisters and even though I admit that they're cute and have screen persona, I was not exactly in awe of their performances. I've seen to many child actors get unwarranted praise for being \"Just a kid\" in a film. I'm going to wait until they get older and then I'll see if they are good enough for my kudos. The big problem I have with this film is how overly sentimental the script is and I never buy into an African character having more wisdom than others. He's Nigerian so we have to assume that Mateo's spiritual beliefs are \"Pearls of wisdom\". I didn't buy it and I also didn't buy the ridiculous ending with Mateo supposedly giving his spirit and life for the baby down the hall fighting for his. I was also bothered by the fact that these parents let they're two daughters go out of the tenement on their own in that god-awful neighborhood. Even immigrants from Ireland know enough to allow this and its hard to swallow some of the decisions that they make. I'm not trying to come across as a cynic or anything but it was difficult to believe some of the plot lines like the three wishes and dialogue that has a ten year old uttering lines like \"I've been carrying this family for a year now\". The pain and guilt that this family carries with them comes across best and we feel for their trauma but the rest of the film will ultimately lie with each individual viewer. Personally, it was a bit much for me.",

I was a bit shocked to see several of the reviewers found it boring or not realistic enough for them.I realize everyone is entitled to their opinions and there are many different frames of reference, but this was sensational movie making. I emphasizes the 'movie making', because this is not a documentary! The writer/director's story is apparently semi-autobiographical and he tells the story as part slice of life, part fable. Maybe his Hell's Kitchen junkies aren't menacing enough, although one is paying back kindness with food stamps one day, and holding a razor to that person's throat the next. He creates a moving character of an angry, dying artist and allows him to be touched by the innocence of children and a loving family, still enduring their pain of a previous tragedy. It does, in fact, transform him into a \"guardian angel\"!! This isn't a camera focused on the workings of a NY slum, but a gut-wrenching and uplifting story that I feel privileged to have watched.That is as glowing as I can get, but still feel obligated to salute the performances of the cast one more time. Every performance is terrific and Samantha Morton's incredibly expressive face is leading toward legend status. She is a treasure. Paddy Constantine was perfect as an emotionally cutoff, grieving parent, giving it his all to not show his melancholy and loss of faith. And those amazing kids!!!! Every line of dialog felt real and unaffected. They were a revelation.This is the kind of movie that restores my faith in movie watching!!",

            "content": "The plight of the immigrant from Ireland is examined in this film, but to an extent that seems romanticized, even in the time period of the 1980s (or so I thought). Overall, the setting was not what I thought an immigrant family that just got into the United States would have. They seemed to have more belongings and expensive things than some Americans even had at the time. The video camera that the eldest daughter carries along with her is not a necessity that immigrants are usually seen with.And the scene where the father risks all the family's money to play a mere child's game at a carnival seemed too ridiculous to believe. Anyone that doesn't have a good income or not one at all doesn't usually play the devil's advocate. That particular incident could have ruined the family, but it didn't seem to matter. I knew, however, that the father wouldn't lose, because if he had, no one would like the film. If the father had lost, the loss of the family's belongings would have been an antagonist, and yet it somewhat was.Some immigrants have come to the United States to bear children, and the fact that the mother and father came to the United States, not with the intention to have a child is to be believed as well. I bring this point up because most immigrants to the United States use the country for the simple purpose of becoming citizens, yet this does not always work. The idea of bearing a child most of the time, backfires on those that do.At the end of the film though, I must say, it was not bad. There was a clear and thought out storyline that I could even follow. The fact that the film was written by a father and his two daughters just brings to light the family connections in the film. Although, there was one instance in which I have to remark, the fact the daughter narrating, telling us what she did, could not have possibly known some of the more mature content going on.

            "content": "I have to admit something right off the bat.  I have always been a fan of Jim Sheridan.  With only four films to his directing credit, his movies have been memorable and award winning.  My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father, The Field and The Boxer are all crafted from Sheridan's writing and direction and all contain Irishman struggling under extraordinary circumstances.Enter Sheridan's latest, and possibly best, film, In America.  In America stars Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine as Sarah and Johnny, two Irish immigrants who, after the tragic death of their son, land in Manhattan with their two children Christy and Ariel (played by Sarah & Emma Bolger), in hopes of capturing the American dream.  Securing the only residence they can, the family moves into a drug infested apartment complex and begin to build a new life.But the American dream does not come easy for those who start with nothing. Sarah takes a job at a local ice cream parlor, and Johnny resorts to driving a cab while visiting various acting auditions for the New York theatre. With money being one of the central challenges, we watch as the family struggles to pay hospital bills and has to make their own costumes for a school Halloween party.  It is Halloween that brings the family some eventual luck as the children go door to door trick or treating and happen upon the apartment of Mateo (played wonderfully by Djimon Hounsou).  Mateo is an artist that is suffering from AIDS, and he befriends they family from upstairs and offers them a love that has been missing since the death of their child. \nThe movie's final chapter is one of great power and emotion.  A central character dies while another is born, and the connection between the two circumstances seems supernaturally magical.  By the time Johnny sheds tears for the first time since the death of Frankie, we are engrossed in a tragic and uplifting story that feels as close as the people next door.\nIn America stands out as one of the best films of 2003 due largely in large part to Jim Sheridan's simplistic filmmaking style.  Sheridan takes non-recognizable, average looking actors, and lets them evolve and peel off layers of their characters within the confines of a heartwarming and loving script.  Infused are the emotional attachments we have with the characters as a result.  A scene at the fair where Johnny ties to win an E.T. doll for his youngest daughter, results in the family fronting the entire months rent money ($200+).  With no musical score to over exaggerate the moment, Sheridan's pulls off this year's most intense moment that involves nothing more than a tennis ball and a well-crafted hole in the wall.   \nAlso refreshing is Sheridan's depiction of the Irish immigrant family. Irish are the most routinely misrepresented ethic group on film, but In America does not resort to such stereotypes.  The movie contains no excessive drinking or public drunkenness, there is no coarse language, and there are no references to the IRA or strong religious affiliations.   All the above make for a true heartwarming and heartbreaking story of a family's struggle to survive and build anew.  A-",

When one realises that , at the time the film was shot, they were 11 and 6 respectively, there can be no doubt whatsoever that Ireland has two megastars in the making.But the story itself is incredibly moving. If nothing else, it is an inspiration to any family that is experiencing tough times. Even though each member of the family is trying to deal with great grief in their own ways, the overall positivity is inspirational. I would suggest that most couples experiencing such outward expressions of each other's traumas would never have made it but, every time one broke, the other was strong and understanding - true, sometimes that was \"for the sake of the girls\" - but, when push came to shove, an incredible love relationship won the day. The professional skills and sensitivities of Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton as Mum and Dad were deeply moving in their portrayals and the wonderful innocence of two little sisters in a seedy part of a scary, strange city is awesome! Where I was feeling (to say the least) trepidation at the unknown, those two kids just go right ahead into the most frightening of challenges and continue to beat on the scary stranger's door until admitted.I have to admit that, right up to the final credits, I was dreading a terribly sad ending and, even though there was, indeed, sadness, it was more than overshadowed by the victorious climax.The only negative aspect of this whole film was the fact that it illustrated, far too graphically for me, what a lousy place America really is where all the hospital seemed to be interested in was money, money, money!

Additionally, the parents move their children into a dangerous, high-crime area, putting the kids at risk, all so the dad can pursue his acting career. And we're supposed to cheer these parents on?  The plot is barely interesting, it was like watching a TV Movie on the Big Screen. Heart-warming my ass.  It's a mystery to me why all these critics are falling over each other to praise this dreck.  Many Irish wait in line and immigrate legally to this country, and don't move into horrible neighborhoods to pursue some pie-in-the-sky romantic dream. Super-dreck.",

I understand that films cannot be completely perfect, and some technical issues may be in, but when a film, which I believe is set in the 1980's, has various ads for products of the new millennium. I've read up on why that happened, and director Jim Sheridan said that they were intentional. If I were to direct a film set in a certain time period, I would certainly just put in a few things like that for fun, but in In America, it ruins the authentic feel of the movie, one that doesn't mess around. As much as I hate to say this on a story based on Sheridan's true life, he seems to direct it too light-heartedly. It's a serious story, and shouldn't be treated like that.Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) have recently moved to New York with their young daughters Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger) from Ireland. With basically no money and low-paying jobs, Johnny and Sarah struggle to make ends meet, while Christy and Ariel see it as a place where anything is possible. In their run-down apartment, they meet a large black man whose bark is worse than his bite named Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who helps them through.Sheridan's directing is really on-and-off. As I mentioned earlier, he was having too much of a good time while directing it, while he should have been more serious. However, he can create tension by using the regular clich\u00e9s, but still keep it tense. It's odd to see a rather comical scene turn into a gripped-to-your-seat tense scene, but there's one scene that does that. While at a carnival, Johnny decides to win an E.T. doll for Ariel. Although Sheridan uses the overused slow motion, that one brief scene takes your emotions and holds them in midair: you really have no clue what will happen.The rest of the story I found interesting enough, but oftentimes it was just like another `struggling immigrant' story. Heartwrenching, yes, but nothing new. As the ads tote, this is Sheridan's most personal film. It's obvious to see that, as the entire family has realistic chemistry with each other. The spirit of a true story is there, and it shows. I could go more into detail on every little aspect of this film, but I will close with this: In America is nowhere near as good as the other critics say, but if you do go in, prepare to be moved.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for some sexuality, drug references, brief violence and language.",

Halloween was already over, All Saints Day was drawing to a close and I knew that Sunday November 2 was going to be All Souls Day. The film is set in New York where an family from Ireland, father, mother and two young girls, move into an apartment block full of drug pushers and transvestites and where they can hear the intermittent screaming of a man. The family have lost a little boy, Frankie, who has died of a brain tumor and the lives of the four survivors are wrapped in an enduring sorrow. On Halloween the girls make friends with the screaming man, a black man called Mateo who gets invited to 'The Halloween Party'. The girls go out to a local cafe and the parents enjoy themselves in sex. Later they find out that there is a child on the way... Enough of that. To go on will only spoil the unraveling of a story that has some of the darkness and some of the enchantment and some of the sadness and the challenge of death that marks the three days of Halloween, All Saints and All Souls. Since losing Frankie, his parents, even though they send the girls to a local Catholic school,seem to have lost their faith in God. However, as the film draws to its superb close, although God makes no obvious comeback, it is clear that St. Paul's great trio of virtues - faith, hope and love - have triumphed as a deeply wounded family finds healing as they celebrate the homecoming of their little baby girl. Her name? Sarah Mateo Sullivan.This is a great film about family life. Yes, there is one intense lovemaking scene but there is nothing in this film for the voyeur. I guess that is why it is rated 12PG by the wise Irish censors who obviously want you to go to see it and to bring your children and / or your grandchildren with you, no matter how young they are!",

Christy and Ariel (Sarah and Emma Bolger) are quite happy in their new home, while father Johnny (Paddy Consadine) and mother Sarah (Samantha Morton) are trying to hide their desperate, frightened selves from their beloved daughters.  As the parents try to make money, and make their daughters happy, Christy and Ariel befriend Mateo, who turns out to be a friendly artist, but might be sick.I wouldn't call this a movie, really, I'd call it a story.  A story about a family and their struggles, the kind of story you read about and start to better understand the hope and courage that lies in ourselves.  The characters aren't characters, they're people, with no need to be \"3-D\" or \"believable\" because they are already one hundred percent real.  Jim Sheridan and his daughters' screenplay is wonderful and effective.Also, the acting.  Like I said, the characters are real, and really, would I say that if it wasn't for the actors truly amazing performances?  Every last one of them does an A+ job, from Consadine to Hounsou, Morton to the Bolger sisters.  I can't be specific about who did better, so I'll just list them all:Paddy Consadine as Johnny, a wonderful performance as the father.  He is so desperate to give his family happiness, and Consadine captures all that in his eyes.  One scene in particular, is when he bets every last dollar on a carnival game, to win his daughter an E.T. doll and have her smile.  It was so well written, and perfectly acted.Samantha Morton as Sarah, the mother (in an Oscar nominated role).  I'm leading a very small parade here, but I wouldn't be upset if she beat Theron for the Oscar, I'd be impressed.  She embodies the spirit and life of her character, you really feel for her, completely.Sarah and Emma Bolger, the two daughters.  If MTV doesn't give them the \"Best Screen Couple\" award, then MTV will finally, officially declare themselves as tasteless idiots.  These aren't children trying to act, they're children acting, something that rarely ever happens.  This is the best child acting I've ever seen, and ranks pretty high on the best acting I've ever seen.  These kids could beat some of the older stars out right now, no joke.Djimon Hounsou as Mateo, my favorite character, and along with \"Gladiator\" and \"Amistad\", his best performance.  Again, I doubt anyone will agree with me, but I really want him to win the Oscar, the guy deserves it.  The terrifying yet lovable Mateo has your eyes glued to him whenever he is on screen, he did so well in his role, so well!  His, Watanabe's and Astin's are the best male supporting performances of the year.So, if you and your family are looking for a heartfelt, fun, beautiful and dramatic movie, see this, see \"In America\", 8.5/10.",

(I actually remember mistakenly showing up in Halloween costume a week before the class party was scheduled - and for someone as self-conscious as I then ...). The only thing that I would cavil about is the use of yet another wise, magical AIDS victim to teach the characters about life. I guess I've just seen it far too much in movies and television. **** SPOILERS END ****This movie's unpredictability (will his acting career take off or not? Will the mother die or not?

That would be the tale that even with nothing you can come to the US (and where else but the grandest of all US cities New York nonetheless), fulfill your dreams and make it.  Problem is while In America has a great cast and great actors; the movements through this picture are hopelessly un-focused and hammered into the viewer as if they haven't figured out this families hardships.  Then we are supposed to believe this dream chasing story in an unrealistic setting.We are first introduced to John and Sarah and their two young daughters Christy and Ariel at a border crossing in the United States.  An officer asks how many children they have and an inconsistency arrives.  Sarah says two, John says three.  It seems the stage is already set for the viewer for a family that has some secrets, but they tell the guards they use to have another child.  Did they lie?While John and Sarah make it to New York the film finally centers on their life to have another child, all the while we are supposed to accept that they can raise two kids in a run down apartment filled with junkies and transvestite prostitutes.  To some degree that would make sense, what other choice does this family have?  But as the story continues Sarah works a no doubt minimum wage job, John looks for a job as an actor unsuccessfully (eventually taking a job as a cab driver), and their huge run down loft apartment still gets paid, has flowing water, and somehow they have money to even paint it.  Never mind that we rarely see the lower lives of the other tenants except when the film requires them to be good natured and live a life of gracious humility towards their Irish neighbors.There is only some degree of bent reality I can take and even this good fortune is even too much for me.  To make things even more annoying the kids are so lucky that besides going to school, they can just wander off on their own to a neighborhood ice cream parlor by themselves.  The family is never hounded by junkies, or a neighbor artist that seems to have a demon complex, screaming in his apartment all night for no apparent reason.  Just so we haven't figured that out, we have to be reminded so cause he paints his door in menacing orange words saying \u0091KEEP AWAY'.  While the daughters enjoy everything even though they have little and are always smiling, it seems that I still couldn't help thinking where child and family services was.If that wasn't bad enough, a particular scene involves a TV showing an excerpt from the movie `The Grapes of Wrath', as if we hadn't already forgotten what John and Sarah were doing down in a supposed hardship that is more teasing than realistic.It's this borderline manipulation that becomes too much for the viewer to take for this film that half way through ends up just trying to hammer the viewer with sadness that we are to accept in this unrealistic setting. Eventually we find out more about the artist downstairs and it seems his pathos is more of a plot device to make the movie move on, as opposed to adding anything of significance to the story.  It becomes too forced and is even proven when John's first real conversation with the artist comes out and we have to hear lines like `I am in love with your anger'.This film really missed the mark.Rating 5 out of 10.",

But, the younger daughter accidentally blurts out that her dad has no job. When the boarder guard gets distracted while admiring the two girls, he smiles, waves them through and says, 'Welcome to America.' Thus begins the modern story of a brave and persevering Irish family trying to 'start over' while carrying the ghost of their late son and brother, Frankie, with them in their minds and spirits. (They all seem profoundly affected by Frankie's recent death.) The four principal characters in the story are Johnny (Paddy Considine), his wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton) and their two daughters, Christy and Ariel (played by real-life sisters, Sarah and Emma Bolger.) The movie's story is told through the eyes and narration of the older daughter, Christy, who constantly carries her camcorder around with her.After the family arrives in NYC, they are forced to live in a virtually unkept building filled with perverts and drug addicts. One of the inhabitants includes the mysterious recluse 'man who screams' and has a KEEP OUT sign on his front door. Sarah takes a job selling ice cream while Johnny searches for employment as an actor and the girls enroll in a Catholic girls' school. As they struggle to survive, they must sell their car and Johnny has to take a night job as a cab driver. The movie is a thesaurus of emotionally moving scenes and subplots, including the quest to get an air conditioner to survive the New York summer heat and the girls' discovery of an American custom: trick-or-treating on Halloween. As the girls go trick-or-treating in their building, they knock persistently on the door of 'the crazy screaming man.' When he finally answers the door, he is angry. But he is soon won over by these wonderful little girls' vulnerability and openness. This is when 'the crazy screaming man,' a black African artist named Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) first enters the movie as a full character. Mateo becomes very close to the family. But, he is also dying of a terminal disease. (We are led to believe that the disease is AIDS).Sarah becomes pregnant, but her pregnancy is difficult and requires even more sacrifice from the family. (She is determined to see it through to the end, no doubt trying to replace their lost child, Frankie.) We\u2014the audience--are now caught up in three simultaneous struggles: that of Sarah to give life to their unborn child; that of Mateo's death; and that of the family to give up the pain of Frankie's recent death.This autobiographical movie is lovingly put together by the Sheridan family. Jim Sheridan directed this film as well as co-writing its Oscar nominated script with his nieces, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan. The movie is dedicated to Frankie, who\u2014according to the IMDb-- died of a brain tumor.",

Both of those value this film far more than the average review written by the IMDB Users.  I agree with both of those reviews and commend them to you to better understand this movie -- before OR preferably after you see it.This film is part fantasy, part semi-autobiographical, part from the parents' point of view, part from their children's.  Considering that a child's remembrance of what life was like \"back when\" does not always agree with the reality remembered by their parents, this movie weaves a tapestry out of all those perspectives. The actors playing all characters do a super job but the woman playing mother is beyond great and those playing the two young daughters surpass even that level.\"In America\" presents some very psychologically true elements -- e.g., that the burden of guilt for the death of a family member is often carried by all family members. But do NOT expect EVERY element to be 100% stark reality. There can be such things as \"external realities\" and, at best, we can only approach comprehending them.  Our more usual reality is \"as we perceived and now remember it.\"  And that's what this movie is about -- interweaving a variety of family memories together in an absolutely charming, deeply touching way.  The result is fully as human and good on its own terms as was Sheridan's \"My Left Foot.\"",

There is one pivotal scene, however, that was kind of spoiled for me because I had read and heard about it in numerous reviews...the way I'd read about it, I thought it was going to be a big surprise, and frankly, I saw it coming from the time Hounsou's character is introduced.  There are lots of clues that this \"revelation\", if you will, is coming.  But maybe I'd just read too much about it.  That's the problem when multiplexes are allowed to dictate which movies come to certain areas.

With two young daughters named Christy and Ariel (Sarah and Emma Bolger, respectively), the family moves into what is nothing more than a crack house. They have little, if any money and Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) are forced into whatever jobs they can find.Since that point, Johnny has closed himself off emotionally. His daughters complain that he does not play with them as much as he used to. Sarah tells him, `You make believe that you're happy for the kids, Johnny.' No easy task, especially when you live in near squalor. But somehow the children and Sarah find resolve in their new home. They meet an artist named Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who at first wants nothing to do with his new neighbors. They soon realize that Mateo is dying of AIDS in which he contracted from a blood transfusion. During this time, Sarah becomes pregnant despite a doctors orders not to. Johnny is against the whole thing and his depression grows. He talks to Mateo about his problems confessing that he cannot laugh or cry. Mateo, loving anything that has life, reminds Johnny that he has to have faith in the worst of circumstances. With Sarah's pregnancy, Mateo's wisdom and the love his daughters, Johnny will have to come to terms with his pain over loosing his son.  `In America' has astonishing performances. The Bolger girls light up every scene that they are in with their childish enthusiasm, hope and naivet\u00e9. Considine (`24 Hour Party People') gives such a moving performance that we are driven to tears in the films finale. Morton, who played one of the pre-cogs in `Minority Report' gives a riveting performance here, as well. We are moved by her hope as she always manages to keep up her spirits for her children. Furthermore, when we see her breakdown in one scene after making love to Johnny, we feel her pain. She says that her dead son had Johnny's eyes and at that moment, she could not bear to look at Johnny.Hounsou (`Amistad') gives one of the best performances of his career. In the scene where he meets Christy and Ariel, they admit to him that their little brother has died. Hounsou's response is to cry. He tells them that he cries for anything that cannot live. Furthermore, his character falls in love with the family. From the audience's perspective, we feel utter sadness and joy for Mateo's character-we admire his strength of will and determination in light of his ailment. `In America' was directed by Jim Sheridan (`My Left Foot') and it has been called him most personal film. As the film ends, the credits read `for Frankie Sheridan,' also the name of the boy who is lost by Johnny and Sarah. I do not know exactly how the film relates to Sheridan, however, it's a beautiful masterpiece that should not be forgotten. ****",

Excellent performances all round turn what could be melodrama into a genuinely moving story.

            "content": "This warm, lovingly-made film from Irish director Jim Sheridan (\"My Left Foot\", \"In The Name Of The Father\") about an Irish family led by parents Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) who immigrate with their two daughters to New York City was also co-written by Sheridan, who based it loosely on his own experiences. The two daughters, Christy and Ariel, are played by incredibly cute real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger. The youngest, Ariel, is playful and inquisitive, while 11 year-old Christy is more quiet and thoughtful. It is Christy who narrates the film, periodically commenting on what's happening, which gives the film the feeling of a novel. The family finds a cheap apartment in a run-down building and the film is essentially about their life adjusting to America and trying to get by, and trying to get over the recent death of a third child, Frankie, from a brain tumor. There is also a Boo Radley type character nicknamed \"the man who screams\", a big, mysterious black man played by Djimon Hounsou (\"Amistad\", \"Gladiator\") who lives a couple flights down and is frequently heard screaming in rage, alone in his apartment. Of course, even if you haven't seen the trailer (or read \"To Kill A Mockingbird\") you know that this man will turn out to be not scary, but a cuddly, misunderstood saint instead. I recognize what a cliche this character is, but I didn't mind, because I liked and sympathized with him, and Hounsou brings him to vivid life. The whole movie is pretty full of cliches, but I really didn't mind, because I just enjoyed the film so much. The acting is terrific by all involved (especially Samantha Morton and the Bolger sisters), it's emotionally satisfying, and full of interesting little details that only someone who struggled as an immigrant himself could tell you. Also, being seen mostly through the eyes of the two little girls, it has a genuine sense of wonder. The scene in the very beginning, where the family first arrive in New York and drive through Times Square is fabulous. And it certainly doesn't hurt that New York is my favorite city in the world.\nThe screenplay slightly falters in a number of places, but \"In America\" is still a very enjoyable film, strengthened by excellent acting, several very moving scenes, a good soundtrack, and a uniquely personal point of view.",

            "content": "**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**\"In America\" gently tells the story of an Irish family that immigrates to New York City, and how they deal with both their past and their future. The family consists of parents Johnny & Sarah (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton), along with their two children, 11-year old Christy and her younger sister Ariel (Sarah and Emma Bolger). The x-factor is Frankie, a brother who died early in childhood, and provider of a powerful emotional thread that is woven through the story. Despite the title and the fact that the subjects of the film are immigrants, the subject matter is about being a family. The main characters could just as easily have been moving from a different state as a different country, although the ethnic uniqueness does allow for few cute moments. This wise decision allows for greater personal connection between the audience and the story. What carries this film is the intimacy of that story. It is an semi-auto-biographical tale penned by director Jim Sheridan (\"The Boxer,\" \"In the Name of the Father\") and his daughters Naomi and Kirsten. This immense personal nature seeps through nearly every frame of the film, as Sheridan's delicate directing hand guides the actors, cameras, and music. This film could easily have lapsed into typical Hollywood melodramatic mush like \"I am Sam,\" but Sheridan knows the story so intimately that he refuses to let it stumble into such drudgery. Instead he keeps the story streamlined by concentrating almost exclusively on the main characters and storylines. He also doesn't allow the camerawork or music to detract or distract. The near lack of a score and minimal wide shots lets the story tell itself. Soaring music and sweeping cameras are great for epic films, but for smaller works like this one, Sheridan takes the proper path of less is more.\nBecause \"In America\" is not an epic film or one featuring star-making roles, the acting doesn't necessarily stand out or blow you away, although both Morton and Djimon Hounsou did receive Oscar nominations. That's not to say that they don't deserve their honors, but I am surprised the Academy had the intelligence to choose them. Morton, paired with the relatively unknown but solid Paddy Considine as the adult portion of the Irish family, echoes her remarkable \"Minority Report\" performance by again speaking little and acting primarily with her face and body language. She has a screen presence that inexplicably lacks a natural magnetism, but still manages to consistently draw attention. Hounsou is finally given a role that features more layers than his physically and emotionally strong characters in films like \"Gladiator\" and \"The Four Feathers,\" and he seizes the opportunity with what may be a star-making portrayal of the mysterious and distraught artist-neighbor Mateo. For a reason that I can't pinpoint, \"In America\" is surprisingly easy to watch, despite the emotional unevenness that tugs you in and out of the picture. At numerous times the film works but doesn't absorb, while other parts are almost shockingly engaging. Many of the early transition scenes are typical of an immigrant picture and fail to add much to the film. But just when you might think the story is slowing, a revelation of a scene takes place. Two moments in particular serve as emotional Rocky Mountains in the midst of the film's rolling hills. The first scene, a one-on-one confrontation at the end of the act two, alters the entire direction of the plot. The second closes out the film at its emotional peak, which will leave many in tears. Unfortunately, those great scenes are not sufficient to tote the entire film to that next level. Some will walk out of \"In America\" extremely affected by its conclusion, while others won't be impacted by it's emotional power, because the film won't overwhelm like \"Mystic River.\" I found myself somewhere between those two extremes, with a slight smile on my face, touched but not overly so. In the end, that's what \"In America\" is: a simple story that achieves moments of poignancy because it is told with such love.Bottom Line: A good intimate and personal story with emotional inconsistencies.  7/10.",

In fact, IN AMERICA offers up a huge slice of Americana both thematically and visually.\nThe story, perhaps more autobiographical than not, nicely, and compactly, offers entertaining asides weaving alongside the main narrative and dramatic path. Often though, and perhaps unfortunately, these asides become more poignant, thus more interesting and memorable, than that of the main tale.\nReal-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger steal the movie completely. Charming and real, these girls represent the humanity of America, whereas their parents represent the American Dream. Christy and Ariel possess innocence and laughter and welcome their new surroundings with a wide-eyed innocence yet have that constant tinge of sorrow that perpetually remains alongside them like the dangerous alleyways of New York itself.The biggest disappointment with the film is the constant use of intermingling film stock with that of videotape, or even worse, having the film camera look into the viewscreen of Christy's always-on camcorder. Yes, this is the way Christy is chronicling her life but the mixing of mediums is not only distracting but also cheapens the dramatic sense of the movie. Sheridan goes out of his way to make a personal - and touching - film. If he just wanted to show home movies, there are other outlets for that.IN AMERICA beautifully shows the timeless mythical side, be it for good or ill, of America, or New York at least, with a superb cast and memorable scenes. At times it goes just as deep as his \"Irish Trilogy\" films. In other points it becomes merely shallow. But isn't that the way life is like, especially... in America?",

            "content": "Over the last several years, if someone said a movie was sentimental, it meant that he didn't like the movie because it was syrupy and artificial. Films such as \"Jerry Maguire,\" \"Pay it Forward,\" \"Ghost,\" \"Titanic\" and \"Cocoon\" all seemed to be made by morons for morons.  It has now gotten to a point where many in this cynical age won't enjoy (or won't admit to enjoying) a sentimental film made well such as \"Forrest Gump\" or any of Frank Capra (I wish I had a nickel for every cynic I have known who thought he was the first to call the great filmmaker \"Crap-ra\").\"In America\" is a sentimental film, but in the best sense of that word. It does not have a \"Pollyanna\" world view that the hardships and trouble we face in life are in any way trivial, but it does make the viewer smile and feel love for the characters in the film, and the human race in general.The movie concerns the adventures of an Irish family who have immigrated to America and settled down in Manhattan after the death of the youngest sibling Frankie.  The survivors--father Johnny (Paddy Considine), mother Sarah (Samantha Morton), 10-year-old Christy (Sarah Bolger) and 6-year-old Ariel (Emma Bolger)--move into a slum east of Harlem, where they have some fairly un-neighborly neighbors, including the solitary and tempramental artist Mateo (Djimon Honsou).The story is told through Christy's video diary entries.  At 10, she is old enough to have no illusions about the world, but is young enough to still see things with a child-like fascination.  Her narration provides the movie with its bittersweet tone.  She can see everyone's motives and is hardly innocent, but at the same time, she is still a kid & can still find enjoyment in simple pleasures such as eating ice cream or painting fairies on her bedroom wall.This movie really belongs to Paddy Considine as Johnny.  He is a struggling actor, who has more love for his family than common sense, and will do anything for them including pulling an air conditioner the wrong way through a busy street or gambling away his life savings so his daughter can win an E.T. doll at the carnival.  But his family can easily see through his cheerful exterior, because he still has not properly mourned his son's passing.  Why the Academy passed him up and gave a nomination to Johnny Depp for doing a bad Keith Richards impersonation, I'll never know.A word should be said here about the source material for the movie. Director Jim Sheridan wrote the screenplay along with daughters Naomi & Kirsten about things that really happened to them in the early 1980's. Because of this, the studio put out a press kit stating that the film is set in the 1980's, and lazy professional film critics repeated this in their reviews.  An astute viewer will note, however, that the film is actually set in modern times, not the Reagan era.  There were no white rappers, mini-camcorders, anti-HIV drug cocktail mixes, crack-houses, or radio stations that played \"hits from the '60's through the '90's\" in 1982. Also, the World Trade Center is notably absent from the Manhattan skyline.The only real flaw in this movie is that Djimon Honsou's character is pretty much irrelevant, seeming to exist only to stretch an otherwise wonderful 90-minute movie into nearly two hours.  Beyond that, this is a heartwarming film without artifice or foolishness about the bonds of family love that will make you smile without being ashamed of yourself. 9/10.",

An excellent Irish director who has his own unique way to create very good movies. As I understand this movie is quite personal to him and dedicated to his family. It's easy to see why. The movie is all about family. It shows what a great influence a family has for its members. What it means to stick together and to climb over all the obstacles life throws on the road. But the most important note the movie points is the power of overcoming a loss of a family member. Very lovely and inspirational movie. It has its tragic and heartfelt scenes which make In America a wonderful movie. Recommended for all the families.Great job by Jim Sheridan because of creating an atmosphere where there is no first-class movie stars, but still cast is one the strongest part of the movie. It shows you the worth of this movie.",

However, this is impossible for three reasons (and it's driving me crazy that no one has said anything about the discrepancies!): First, when the family is arriving in Manhattan in the beginning of the film, the radio says \"classics from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.\" Second, the video camera that the little girl uses is WAY to small to be something you could buy in the early 80s - and it has a flip-out screen! Third, the skyline doesn't show the Trade Center towers. Not to mention that the clothes people wore in the film (and the hairstyles) were totally NOT 1980s. Did anyone else notice these things??Overall, I thought the film was pretty good, but if the director meant for the film to be set in the 80s, he made some serious errors.",

The younger girl (Sarah Bolger) is a little darling as expected but the older girl explodes with emotion in a couple of powerful scenes.Unfortunately the sets and props they work with just don't jive.  It's like the budget wouldn't allow the crew to make a realistic 1982 so they'll just feature E.T. prominently to announce \"Hey! It's 1982!\".  Another commentator here ably points out the anachronisms.  One thing I expect from my movies is to transport me to another time and place.  I was around in 1982.  \"In America\" isn't there.",

You don't have to put the DVD on \"pause\" if you need an ice cream or bathroom break. There are no important scenes or dialog that can't be missed. I did find it amusing how the family drove over from Ireland into the U.S. It was never clear why they left Canada. If you can't make it there, you'll never make it in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. And why would a poor family who needs lots of medical care, want to leave Canada with it's free health care? Unless they used false pretenses to enter that country too, like they did the U.S.A. Johnny lied to the border guards when he told them that his family was entering the U.S. to go on \"holiday\". So much for protecting our borders from illegal aliens. The two little girls were cute and talented, but I found Christy's constant video-taping annoying and distracting. I don't think they even owned a TV set or computer to watch the videos she made. And Samantha Morton's \"Sinead O'Connor\" hairdo made her look like she would never want to have 3 children with a man, let alone try for a fourth. So if you're in the mood for a very light movie with some good scenes of Manhattan, (sort of a throw-back to the cutsie family movies of the early 60's) check out \"In America\". And it's even suitable for the kids.",

It is so captivating that you forget that you are watching a movie and are drawn into the struggles of this family. All of the adults are amazing in these rolls and each suits their part perfectly but the true stars of this movie are the two girls, Sarah and Emma Bolger. Both of these girls are able to play their parts without flaws. They were put in this movie for the sole purpose of providing an innocent point of view to this rough world that they are surrounded with and that they do. As one of the actors said in an interview, children have the ability to find the good in all people. In this movie, they allow the audience to see that an apparently rough character, such as Mateo (who is initially described as \"the man who screams\"), is actually innocent and kind and they also help us to find truth behind many of the main characters. Roger Ebert once said that you know you were watching a great movie if you find something new about it each time you watch it, and each time you watch this movie, you find out more and more about each and everyone of these characters, especially the girls, and each time you fall a little more in love with it.

            "content": "'There's some things you should wish for and some you shouldn't. That's what my little brother Frankie told me. He told me I only had three wishes, and I looked into his eyes, and I don't know why I believed him.' This semi-autobiographical tale of Irish immigrants trying to survive in Hells Kitchen is ultimately frustrating, but has occasional moments of pure cinematic gold. Co-authored by the director, Jim Sheridan, and his two daughters, the screenplay constitutes a composite picture of their combined memories of when the director uprooted his family from Ireland in 1982, after controversy had hit a play he had staged. In addition, interwoven in this work is a tale of grief and mourning taken from a completely different period, and based on the director's father's earlier experiences of losing a child - the director's brother to whom the film is dedicated. The resulting product feels episodic, constructed from disparate scenes, largely from diarised entries from Sheridan's daughters, rather than fixed to a cohesive narrative thread. As such, the content veers from saccharine and sentimental moments of family unity to apparent irrational emotional outbursts devolved of any background for the audience. Sheridan's aim of trying to view the world with a kind of childlike quality works well at times, but the film displays an inconsistency of tone in scenes which are much starker. As instances of the former, there are three pivotal moments where the eldest daughter's belief that her deceased brother has granted her three wishes add poignant charm to the narrative. The first of these occurs at the outset as the family attempt to bluff their entry into the States as mere vacationers at the Canadian border. The next is the most enthralling scene where the father risks all the family savings at a carnival stall in order to save face in order to secure the soft toy his youngest daughter has set her heart on. Finally, there is the final scene, where the last remaining wish is movingly spent to help the father deal with the grief of losing his only son. Another of the film's strengths concerns the scenes narrated by the eldest daughter, presented by means of digital footage from her hand-held camera, thereby highlighting the artistry of cinematographer, Declan Quinn. Finally, there are the capable performances from the majority of the cast. As Sheridan maintains, casting represents 90% of film-making, and in this instance his claim appears well-served. Paddy Considine further establishes his acting credentials with an earnest and convincing portrayal of the father who struggles to safeguard his family once his beliefs have been shaken to the core, and his emotions held in check, by the tragic loss of his young son - this must have resonated with the actor who had lost his own father to cancer just a week before shooting started. The great find here though has to be the Bolger sisters. What is remarkable is that having cast the youngest, Emma, as Ariel, Sheridan was persuaded by the latter to audition, and subsequently cast as Christy, her elder sister waiting in a parked car outside. While her sibling's performance is charming and precocious, it is Sarah Bolger who delivers an amazingly mature performance beyond her years as the insightful chronicler of the family's triumphs and travails. One can never forget her beautiful rendition of the Eagles' 'Desperado', or how steely is her character's retort to her father: 'Don't 'little girl' me. I've been carrying this family on my back for a year.' Although Samantha Morton's performance merits admiration, an Oscar nomination appears exaggerated given the largely passive role she plays, as well as her character's inconsistencies - able to hold her husband responsible for her son's accidental death while comfortable herself to allow her daughters to 'trick or treat' in the apartment block they share with junkies and an apparently crazed neighbour who screams behind a permanently closed door. Even more surprising was the film's other acting nomination for Djimon Honsou's role as the neighbour, and HIV infected Haitian artist, who comes across as nothing more than a convenient narrative device. Despite the equally questionable Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay, the film does contain moments of sheer heart-warming or heart-rending emotional impact, none more so than the closing scene in which the family bid farewell to the dear departed, and which tests anyone's resolve to not shed a tear.",

Plus, she sings beautifully! 6- year old Ariel (Emma Bolger) is just incredibly funny and cute.

Do women die from biological or medical conflicts with the unborn child inside of them?  Yes, sometimes.  and I have no idea what \"zetes\" refers to in his stab at Catholic mythology.  We'd already rented the movie, then I read \"zetes'\" review, and I almost didn't watch it.  Luckily, the movie truly is touching, sweet, and heart-felt-- apparently things that \"zetes\" can't identify with.  And yes, people with AIDS act just like the Mateo character, sometimes-- filled with anger and rage at an unknown enemy, flushing through their blood with full intent to kill.  But a little love and human care can go a long way.  True humanity has an odd way of spreading, infecting even the hardcore drug-dealers and knife-brandishing elements, or the most hardened hearts.  I've better-enjoyed other movies, I'm not saying this movie is as good as its ratings and success, but it is indeed a very good movie, and it carries food for thought, for those who have enough intelligence to ponder, not expecting to be entertained with flashy explosions or action-scenes, but who are willing to be gently challenged to find humanity in the midst of the dredges of society.",

The story is sometimes funny... and many times very sad. The story about the suffering and troubles of an immigrant irish family trying to recover from a horrible loss.

It shows how important children are as actors and how their work deserves to be well credited and appreciated; especially in movies. (Sarah Bolger should of received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress).I wish to thank all the people who participated in bringing this film to life; including director, Jim Sheridan and music by Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer. Seeing In America has been a wonderful experience for me and I will hold it close it my heart forever.In America really shows how much joy children can bring to movies. I think they hold the whole picture together; especially with the little girl singing.I hope the doors continue to open for these children because I feel they've succeeded here.

What is most apparently wondrous about this movie is that the camera isn't there. Too often the camera zones around individuals, all too aware of itself. Not so 'In America'. Its transparency fully envelops viewers into the struggling world of Johnny, Sarah, Christy, Ariel, and of course, -Mateo. Set in New York, a family of four attempts to make ends meet while coping with their emotions as a result of the loss of Frankie, sibling to Christy and Ariel. What results is a truly refreshing set of performances, especially by the two Bolger sisters who play Christy and Ariel. Their innocence is exposed beautifully, and, unlike many child actors today, their performances are neither forced nor irritating. Credit too goes to Samantha Morton, who delivers yet another stellar performance. The  expression on her face whilst lying in the hospital bed (blaming Johnny for Frankie's death) is truly exceptional. Overall, a tremendous movie, and the four words after the picture fades out can only further move you.",

With that, we decided to take in a matinee movie to mourn the end of my vacation days and return to work.  According to the reviews, In America was an excellent movie, so we decided to give it a shot.First off, let me tell you that the acting and direction were excellent. And if the intent of this movie was to create a pointless tale of a couple of losers with two very nice and mature children, they succeeded admirably. But who really wants to waste two hours of their time watching the dull depressing lives of people who create their own problems and can't overcome a tragedy. (Spoiler) The Sullivan's lost one of their three children in Ireland.  You learn that early on and are beaten down with this fact for the entire movie. They don't have the maturity to overcome their loss and seem to harp on it as an excuse to languish endlessly in their morose approach towards the future.  They drag their children around as if they were rag dolls being trolled through emotional mud.If you like pointless suffering and watching people who can't cope with life, this movie is a must to see.

The point of each is to create a plausible world where the hopeful dimension of the human spirit can be explored.I found it useful that the characters were based on real people.  Each of them had their own drives and motivations outside the context of the main point of the storyline.  Fully-formed characters through extensive back-story is a necessity for bringing an audience a truly empathetic experience.

I just had a chance to see it today (I live in Mexico, and it takes an Oscar nomination for a good film to get here), and I was deeply touched by the film. It didn't make me cry, but it came really close. The film came to me. The story really touched me. What I liked the most, is that they mix a harsh reality, with a little bit of magic. They took some really dramatic moments, and adding in what you might call, a happy accident, or a miracle, however you want to interpret it. This film has three Oscar nominations. Best Original Screenplay (Jim Sheridan, and his daughters Naomi and Kirsten) for their subtle, yet touching dialogue, and story. Samantha Morton for Best Actress, in her role as a mother, struggling with her family, trying to get over the death of her son, while looking happy for her daughters. Djimon Honsou for Best Supporting Actor, for his powerful performance as Mateo, the downstairs neighbor. A tortured artist, re-discovered by this family, and brings a miracle (won't go beyond there) to their lives. Paddy Considine also did a great job as a father, who hasn't gotten over the Death of his son, and has lost his feelings. But this film belongs to Emma and Sara Bolger, the little girls. Emma plays Ariel, the younger sister. She's really cute, and her way of looking at everything is special, and her friendship with Mateo is beyond special. Sara plays Christy, the older sister. We're hearing this story from her eyes. She's the backbone of this family, and we see how she struggles with the memory of her brother, but she also has a side of her that believes in magic. She believes her brother gave her three wishes, and she uses them throughout the film. the final shot, when  she's closing her camcorder (she records on it throughout the film) and says she wants to remember her brother as an image in her head, and not on the camera, she says \"Do you see me now?\". Her expression in that scene, stays in your head after you leave, it's just wonderful. Bonus, she has a beautiful singing voice. I almost fell in love with her in this film. She's young and talented, and hope she does more.This film really touches your heart. It's really magical, and not many films do that. In fact, they mention another movie in here that does that, which is E.T. (love that as well). This film recieves all my love.

Even if they did have camcorders such as the one in this movie in 1982, there's no way a poor immigrant family like this would have been able to afford one. If Djimon Hounsou's character could afford to pay a $30,000 hospital bill, why the hell would he have lived in such a crummy apartment? I don't mind suspending my disbelief, but this was a bit much.The other thing that really bugged me about this movie was how Djimon Hounsou's character was dying of AIDS in that annoying movie way. It's the early 80's, and someone says oh, he has a cough and it won't go away and nobody knows what's ailing him. This sin't meant to slander people suffering from AIDS; it just bugs me when characters succumb to the disease this way in a movie set in the early 80's.Still, ET is my favorite movie of all time and I can't really dislike a movie in which ET figures so prominently.

            "content": "`In America' is about a family moving to New York from Ireland after a tragedy in their lives; the death of Frankie, son of Johnny (Paddy Considine) and Sarah (Samantha Morton) and brother of Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger).  They move to America, presumably, to get over the loss, or to forget about it, or just to think about it.The film allows all of them to do all three.  This is a realistic film about grief that allows all its characters space to do their own thing, and consider their situation.  It does not follow the clich\u00e9s of this sub-genre, and works in unexpected ways with unexpected scenes.The most unexpected thing about the film is the way it shows us the girls' point of view.  A film like this would more often concentrate solely on the adults, and any children would merely be background players.  `In America' is narrated by Christy, the ten-year-old daughter (her sister, Ariel, is six).  She believes that Frankie granted her three wishes before he died, which she uses throughout the film, and which come true.  This led me to wonder whether the film was wandering into the fantastic, or whether we are just hearing the girl's memory of the events, as children can tend to remember things as being more spectacular than an adult would remember them.The family moves into an apartment in a  rough part of New York, filled with, as Sarah puts it, \u0091junkies and transvestites.'  Johnny tries to find a job as an actor, while Sarah tries to keep the family's spirits up, or maybe just her own.  The performance by Samantha Morton is excellent; she is playing a character somewhere between a mature adult and an innocent child, and manages to pull off both.  Notice the way she smiles at her family's happiness, and then she stops smiling, as she remembers who is missing.We are introduced to Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), the strange neighbour who paints alone in his apartment and leads to more (I can't think of a better word) magic, especially in the film's climax, which brings the different elements of the film together in a way I found more touching than anything else in the film.There are a lot of very effective scenes.  One features Johnny gambling at a fair ground for an `E.T.' doll (the family go to see it at the cinema, and it has a deep effect on Ariel), his gambling spiralling out of control until we are reminded that, when you gamble too much and win, the feeling is more one of relief than joy.  Another involves Johnny realising that Mateo is hiding something.  Another has Christy prove how mature and brave she is. These are excellent, powerful scenes.Yet, I feel, the film is flawed, and did not have the emotional impact I felt it should have had on me.  The innocent, almost enchanting, perspective of the girls (who give wonderful performances, by the way) is interesting, as is the perspective of the adults.  But these are so different that I felt as if I was watching two different approaches to the material spliced together into a single film.  The film walks the line between a fantasy fairytale about coming to an exciting new land and the reality of family tragedy, and does not succeed in marrying the two as well as it might have. I realise that the difference in view between the children and the parents may well be part of the film's point, and that families are left messed up and divided by tragedy.  Yet some of the scenes in this movie are so different from others that they seem at right angles to each other, and part of the impact is lost. `In America' is directed by Jim Sheridan, who has claimed much of the film's content is based on fact (the film is dedicated to Frankie Sheridan, his brother who died of a brain tumour).  I do not doubt his claim, but I do not look for fact in film, I look for emotions and truth.  The film does have these, but they're not as strong as I would have liked.  I wanted to become more emotionally involved with the characters than I felt I was allowed to be.  I am recommending it though, because it is brave and well made and, more than anything else, for those two girls, whom I think I was most interesting in of all these characters.  I've not seen many films where children are given the chance to show us how they deal with loss.  Perhaps that is what the film should have been concentrating on.  Or perhaps it should have found a better way to let the children's story and the adult's story run parallel. It's a good film, but not the great one that I believe it could have been.*** (out of 5)",

May it be the innocence of two little girls or the parenting skills of the young parents who sneak across the border in desperation, it's a grounded look into the bottomless well of life and dreams. \nThe screenplay by Jim Sheridan is brilliantly handled, clever, honest and able to capture the faults as well as the strengths in its characters. With the story confined to the family of four it never has to reach beyond the measure of it's own private ode. The personal context of `In America' is part of its success. Sheridan shares the writers credit with his two daughters Naomi and Kirsten and also based much of the film around his own experiences of coming to America as well as the loss of his son (also named Frankie), for which the film is dedicated to. Sheridan's relationship with the material also ensures an outstanding development with the characters. Amazingly well directed all the actors show pure strength and maturity with the material, that includes Sarah and Emma Bolger who play the two young sisters Christy and Ariel. There's a definite understanding of everyone's situation and stance on the events but it's good to watch and see how these circumstances unfold and affect the characters individually, one by one. Sheridan works well with the actors and passionately with the story. `In America' has so many agonizing moments and symbolic gestures that it's hard not to relate to this film. As entertainment it's a pleasure to watch from start to finish. I applauded Jim Sheridan and the cast for that but everything came together as one working piece. There's never been a more prominent aspect of our everyday lives than dealing with the grief in our past and looking toward a hopeful future. `In America' is an encouraging film that seems to say ` I wish you well.'4 out of 5",

To be honest I wasn't interested on the film, until it got the nominations, so I went and saw it. I must say, it is probably one of the most beautiful, emotional, affectionate and amazing films I have ever seen. The script is passionate, touching, magnificent and simply ravishing. This film starts when an Irish family arrives to New york, to try to improve their quality of life. They arrive to a crappy and dangerous building, filled with drug addicts, prostitutes and drug dealers, and it is simply lovely, how that environment is simply lit when the two girls arrive. The acting of the girls, is simply amazing. Two different characters, one as a depressed little girl who misses her brother who died a few years ago) and a young, innocent, naive and sweet girl, which likes everybody and brings harmony to the family. Samantha Morton is unbelievable as a hard working mother trying to educate her daughters. But still my favorite character of the film (besides Ariel) is Mateo. Unbelievable performance by Djimon Hounou (spelling), who plays a lonely, friendless and tormented man (with aids) and how his life is simply changes in a fantastic way, when he meets the two girls, and finally protects them from the dark and unjust world. My favorite scene is when the girls say bye to the moon, thinking it is ;Mateo. It broke my heart. Deserved  the award for best actor in a supporting role. Loved this film.

Instead it seemed to me that the director mixed scenes together that where happening at the same time showing different aspects/emotions. That scene showed death winning as Mateo dies and at the same time life winning as the baby lives. The same goes for, one of my favorite scenes, when the baby is conceived. Some people complained that it was 'too much'. I saw it showing the passion and the love the husband and wife had mixed with the anger and rage of Mateo along with the excitement and awe of the girls eating ice cream in the store window during the storm.The movie was amazing in the way it showed most people just going through the motions of living after events that tore apart their lives. Then how with sharing the burdens with each other they over come what was controlling their lives. The only thing that kept the family from completely falling apart was the 2 little girls. I think the father was envious of Mateo because he could cry so easily while he hasn't been able to cry since the death of his son. Telling himself he never wanted to feel that way again but in fact he had stopped living. In the end when he does cry he is letting go and starting to live again. You even see it in the building's tenants, no one comes out except Mateo when the girls are trick or treating but in the end they have a gathering to welcome the baby home.",

Although some of the reviews regarding the sentimentality of this film have painted the work as over dramatic, it is structured in such a way that it works perfectly.  The film aims to pull at the heartstrings.  The film is effective in this endeavor because it does, from the outset, alert the viewer that the narrative is told through a child's point of view.  Ironically, the film is not about the children as much as it is about the father.  The film is meant to move the viewers, and it does not hide this fact.  It is told with a sense of magical wonderment and fairly tale quality.  But after all, this is told through the eyes of a child. Surprisingly, it comes as close as possible to the boundary that separates effective emotional manipulation from sappiness without crossing into the latter categoryOn a personal note.  It has been three or four years since I have cried inresponse to events in my own life.  Thus, I do like movies that are smart enough to affect me without my machismo or cynical defense mechanisms getting in the way.  This movie is one of the few movies I have seen that has induced fullyformed tears (not just a slight wetness to the eyes).  Last year's \"The Pianist,\" \"Good Will Hunting,\" and \"Field of Dreams\" are the only other films that have made me cry.As for some of the criticism noting that New York is not portrayed in a well- defined light, I disagree.  Yes, New York is depicted in a glossy, fantastical manner, but that is appropriate for the way the story is told.  Again, I refer to the fact that the story is told through the eyes of a child.This movie is one of the most well-crafted films of the year.  A feat much more impressive given how difficult it is to correctly pull off a storyline of this sort.  I was shocked how much I appreciated this film.  I have liked all of Sheridan's films, but they are not meant to affect the audience in the same manner. This film is blatantly trying to capture the visceral emotional experience of thecharacters and avoids the strong socio-political undertones of Sheridan's other works.  I don't even see this film as commenting on the experience of immigrants because it is so focused on the way in which this family is coping with the loss of a child.  The ways in which the theme of environmental change are threadedinto the script always parallel and strengthen the driving theme of grief and the psychological ramifications that result.  If you are looking for well-known films that aim to tell what it is like to be an immigrant by means of an emotionally involving story, watch \"Avalon\" and \"The Godfather Part II.\"I seldom recommend films to everyone-- I usually only make recommendationsthat are qualified (i.e.  This film is a good experience for those who enjoy film A, film B, and film C).  Yet, in this instance, I strongly urge everyone to go to this film.  The only films I have seen in the last several years that I would tell everyone to go see without qualification would be \"The ShawshankRedemption\" and \"L.A. Confidential.\"  I am not saying \"In America\" is one of the top five films I have ever seen, but it is masterfully made and accessible to all.",

Husband, wife and two kids are dealing with loss (of home, and other losses) and trying to find a way out of being an unhappy family. The time period of the story is not really clear to me, but it feels like the seventies. The environment seems both harsher and more innocent than now. The girls are sometimes looked after by a lady who works at the diner across the street. The building has its share of junkies, who are mostly (but not always) harmless.The story is told from the point of view of the older daughter, which adds to the innocent, from-another-time feeling. Great performances by all, including Djimon Honsou, as the artist who lives downstairs.",

You're getting involved with a family (parents with two daughters) who just lost their two-year-old son. Each of them finds his or her own way to deal with this great loss. Mother is getting pregnant again, and this time around, her life and the life of the unborn child are in danger.This engaging story is told in a simple way, no manipulations, just pure life. Jim Sheridan admitted that the film is built around a lot of personal experiences of his own and his family - maybe that's way this film is so truthful and touching. Besides, the actors are fantastic, especially the true life sisters who play the family's daughters in the film.\nI've seen quite a lot of movies so far, and so it does not happen very often that a movie really \"moves\" me emotionally.

            "content": "In America reminds that movies with positive themes, albeit with character struggle, can touch the soul just as effectively as those that seek to depress or shock. The movie involves the story of an Irish immigrant family that is reeling from the sudden death of their youngest son. The move to America can be seen both as a search for oppurunity as well as a chance to escape the horror of this tragedy. Solid performances all around, most notably by the little girls, who manage to seem at times wise beyond their years, at at other times to be simply what they are: children. Djimon Honsouu gives an enigmatic, yet powerful performance as the family's troubled, and misunderstood, neighbor. The storyline of Mateo reconnecting with all thats good in life through the little girls is one of the most touching themes I have seen recently. In the hand of a less skilled director than Jim Sheridan, this storyline could earily get lost in sap, however Sheridan keeps it believable and manages to inspire all at the same time. Paddy Constantine also does a fine job playing the role of a father desperately dimmed by the death of his son, yet trying valiantly to be there for his daughters. The last scene in the movie where the family sits on the fire escape, which I won't describe in detail to leave it to the viewer, reminds anyone watching that hope never dies. Definitely recommended for all ages.",

This is certainly true of In America: real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger play Christy and Ariel, the daughters of Irish immigrants who illegally enter the States and settle into a New York tenement. They are a wonderful contrast, with the intimacy and self-enclosure of children who move around a great deal and have only one another for playmates. Ariel is a gregarious, full-cheeked cherub, whose feelings rise without obstacle to the surface. Christy is more guarded, with a vivid imagination and watchful eyes. It is largely through her eyes that the story is told: she carries a red camcorder everywhere and we switch every so often to her jerky hand-held camera. Christy has a no-nonsense intelligence that even her parents recognise: when asked about Halloween trick-or-treating, she says, \"In America you don't ask for things. You demand them.\" The film shows that a family dynamic can generate considerable drama without recourse to external factors. Johnny (Paddy Considine) is an out-of-work actor. His wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton), works in a diner, providing for the family while Johnny attends auditions. There is a fairground scene where his need for self-esteem nearly brings the family to ruin. He wants to win his daughter a toy throwing balls in sideshow alley: if you miss the target, you can only stay in the game by doubling your money. It is excruciating to watch Johnny throw \u0096 and miss. Ultimately he wagers their entire savings. Sarah and Johnny have lost a child, Frankie. He hovers over their home, meaning different things to different members of the family. To Christy, he is an angel who grants wishes. His memory is an emotional blockage for Johnny: it dulls his ability to feel. Sarah is hysterically keen to fill the breach he left behind.These internal dynamics are so absorbing that the melodramatic elements jar. Chief among them is Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), an ill-conceived gay African American artist, used for his tribal connotations (There is a fairly silly scene where drums are intercut with Mateo slashing one of his paintings, an angular totem, and the adult Irish making love on the floor above.) and HIV-related maud. A neighbour tries to mug Johnny in the stairwell: it feels unnecessary, tacked on. Director Jim Sheridan's tries at local colour are also fairly generic: when the family first arrive we cut from scrolling neon signs to the girls waving from the car. (It reminded me of the scene in Pillow Talk where Doris Day and Rock Hudson stroll without moving while club names materialise on a blue screen behind them.) On a fundamental level, though, In America is very true, very funny and very moving.",

Imagine being surprised by good instead of the bad I expected!Two centuries ago a Swedish song said that money grew on trees in America, many of our families came to the U.S. hoping for a better opportunity than they had at home, and this film reminds us all that today's immigrants are also following a hope and a dream of America.",

Here is another story of an earthy looking Irish father and his family arriving quietly in Manhattan with shattered dreams and empty pockets. They fight for survival, but their weapon is not a gun or a fist but love and belief.I missed the movie when it opened in Australia, the preview was intriguing enough but it opened too quiet here and disappeared too soon. Finally when I got the DVD last night and watched it in bed expecting an emotionally charged migrant drama (no violence, for sure).It opened quietly, with the narrating voice of a girl, who is starting to see the world in her own view but there is an overlapped view from an adult who is grown up with the story that she is telling. Observing the situation in silence and distance but anticipated as a writer.There are many heart-warming scenes in the movie, if I am too critical, yes, it is a little too much like a fairy tale, but I wouldn't say it is too many. There are moments in life you would like to erase, but there are moments that you want to keep and remember over and over again, as the camcorder in the movie, to record the memory to keep, but there are memories that need to be buried. (Such as Frankie).There's no real miracles set in the movie, this is story of our time that just has passed and ready to be consumed in a nostalgic way. The real miracle in the movie is simply love and life. The people, who love, care and learning to know that there are things, better let it go. These are the people in the movie, so real and convincing.The story based on Jim Sheridan (the director) and his family's experience, so it is their personal journey. I am sure there is hidden story, needed more courage to tell, but it covered it all, as the snow covers the dirt (as in the movie). Making you slide over the snow and scream with joy, with two beautiful daughters.Maybe we were all rejected once, shattered once, roared once but we know how to believe in tomorrow, and its dreams and hopes. The make believe movie telling that life is a small 'miracle' (as it is). Another story of human victory over the obstacle in life (My left foot, a bigger miracle perhaps. To obtains a Oscar trophy, I guess needed more drama!). If you are feeling wretched and saddened, just take this movie as a'lemon-drop' and believe in magic, and make a wish, maybe one or two might become real one day, if not everyday.",

Bravely, the two take up house in the slummiest of slum apartments but paint and decorate the place to jazz it up for their little girls Christy and Ariel (played by real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger). Jimmy spends his time caring for the children and auditioning for theatre roles in New York City while Sarah works in a diner to make ends meet.The story is told largely through the eyes of Christy, who films everything on her handheld video camcorder (weren't those wildly expensive in the late 80s?). The movie is all about the family coming to terms with the loss of a son/sibling, each in their respective ways, in the magical new healing environment of New York City. Sarah becomes pregnant again, Jimmy and the girls befriend a dying AIDS victim in their apartment building (a shatteringly brilliant performance by Djimon Hounsou).One of the best things about this is the wonderful relationship beteen Jimmy and Sarah, who definitely love each other and have a lot of trust and faith in each other, but who are also really blatantly struggling to deal with Frankie's death. You see them blame themselves and each other over and over, not wanting to admit that it was no one's fault. It's a very gusty portrayal of the real ups and downs of love.The two little girls are absolutely fabulous, sparkling with talent and energy.

When does this movie take place? The props such as the cars in the background, the costuming of the characters and Christie's camcorder suggest that it takes place in the present time but things such as the family going to see E.T. which was out in 1982 and Mateo dying of a strange disease which no one called AIDS suggest that this movie took place in the early 1980's.2. Another thing I could not understand for the life of me was why would a family who seemed to be middle class back in Ireland, (there was some mention of the mother being a teacher and the home they lived in shown back in Ireland seemed much nicer than their apartment in NY) come to America to live in abject poverty in a very dangerous location? It just does not make sense. Why would the father try acting as a career if it meant such a hard and dangerous sacrifice for the rest of his family? 3. The father in the story really irked me. He would take unnecessary risks such as gambling away the rent money to try winning a stuffed E.T. doll worth $30. There was nothing he could really have won but the fact that his family could easily be homeless did not phase him. Why would anyone in their right mind do such a thing? 4. It is alluded to that this family entered the US under the guise that they were on a vacation, how did they get a car then which they owned and how did the parents get work if they were illegal aliens, especially a highly visible job such as an actor?5. How did the dead son Frankie die? Was it from a brain tumor or a head injury from falling down the stairs? When they show a shot of him from Christie's camcorder he looks as if he is being treated with chemotherapy because he has no hair. I'm no medical expert but I find it highly unlikely that chemotherapy can treat a head injury.",

That this is a sad movie comes with the turf. At the very heart of the film is how the older daughter comes to terms with the death of her brother.  She and her sister go through rounds of grieving in what seems to be an otherwise normal childhood.  They express their various phases of bereavement with naive clarity, and startling strength. That a preteen should be the emotional anchor of a family and how, just strikes me ringing straight from life.

Mateo was contrived and over the top, and you had to forget some anachronisms (digital camcorder in the 80's?) but those are details, and life isn't about the details. It's about taking care of your family, and having something that means more to you than yourself, even if you don't feel like you can care about anything anymore. It's about what happens to good people when bad things happen. Sure it had some clich\u00e9 scenes and occurrences, and sure if you thought about it you knew what was happening. But that was what was so amazing. Even though you knew convention was at play, you were never sure what was going to happen next. Jim Sheridan did a brilliant job of taking old structures and making them new by making us care about the people you were watching. And making you realize how fragile they were, and we all are. The clich\u00e9s exist because they are real, and as you watched it all play out you always waited for the other shoe to drop, because you knew in this family it had before. You knew through the ever present Frankie that this was not Hollywood, and that the good guys don't always win and the world isn't just or fair. And yes you will cry, many times in fact during this film. But, as you also learn, that's a good thing.",

In American Beauty, for example, the voice over of Kevin Spacey's character told us the ending, removing much of the tension.  This young narrator had moresense.An Irish family, suffering a horrible loss, takes one last chance to save itself as a family by moving to NYC, so that the father can try to become an actor. The wife, a teacher in Ireland, takes a job in Heaven.  It's an ice cream parlor across the street, and the only job she could find while still keeping at least one good eye on her two girls.  Money is beyond tight.  They live in a creepy loft in a junkie ridden neighborhood.Out of all this effort to survive day to day comes an enriching story about the real importance of family, friends, and trust.  The screaming man downstairs is adying artist, a guardian angel, and a frightening vision if you don't ignore the sign on the door that says \"Go Away.\"See it, if only to hear a pitch perfect version Desperado, out of the mouth of a ten year old.",

It doesn't matter if this is what we call religion, or if it's your culture's way of doing things, or the version of reality that we've all agreed makes up our world, the common thread is that we all believe in it.  So when a group of people who are living together in a building in Manhattan get together to believe that there will be a good outcome for a family among them, and that becomes the reality, it should come as no surprise to us that it comes true.This story is about a young Irish family that finds themselves \"In America\", in both senses of the word.  They illegally immigrate, coming in through Canada, and end up in an upper Manhattan building full of junkies and other destitute souls. This house is both haunted and enchanted for them, revealing the magic that comes from conquering their fears, first about those around them, and then about the lost child of their past. And this is no 'Ellis Island' retrospective, but a modern-day story on every level, based on current situations.The tale takes us through the highs and lows of emotion in this family's struggle, without being smarmy or ridiculous.  The tears come from true sadness and grief, and the laughs come from honest mirth and genuine relief.\nIn the end, the greatest magic is worked, through love between the most unexpected people, and there is good in the world.  Some of that is directly related in the film, with the giving and receiving parties shown in alternation.  Some of that good comes from off-camera, such as the fact that our family's father finally lands a part in a play, where we've seen neither the audition nor the casting of the part.This film was beautifully made, with darkness enveloping the situation of the protagonists, and lightness filling their world as love comes into their lives.I recommend this film, not because it's got feel-good factor, but because it brings to life the struggles of modern New York, and ties together disparate threads to a cohesive storyline.  It's the kind of story I'd want to have be told, if it were mine, and I thank the producers for having gotten this one out so I could see it.",

I don't like cars (I don't have a drivers license and I am thirty years of age) and I don't care for sports. The one stereotypical male activity that I fallen prey to is I have, over the years, become a human bottle. Any pain that I have experienced over the years, I have bottled up and let it twist apart my insides until I can no longer function. Up until this film was released, I had never seen a performance that embodies this male weakness so perfectly like the one Paddy Considine delivers as a broken man in the film 'In America.' His portrayal of a man struggling with the loss of his son is absolutely heartbreaking. Every word, facial gesture, vocal intonation is a carefully crafted display of a man who is so broken and destroyed inside that every time he appeared on screen, an immediate lump would form in my throat. Having experience loss, I not only saw myself but I saw what I wasn't ready to accept. That is the mark of a truly great performance, when the actor is a mirror that you see yourself reflected in. Paddy Considine does this wonderfully. He plays the character like a sad song. A song that is a slow burning builder that you know will reach a crescendo eventually because it gets to a point where it has to reconcile the plain truth that there is nowhere else to go. when this moment happens in the film it is one of the single most heartbreaking moments I have ever seen captured on film.Don't get me wrong, all of the performances in the film are wonderful. Samantha Morton (who has never turned in a bad or mediocre performance), Djimon Hounsou is wonderful and the Bolger sisters show remarkable insight for their age. But it was Paddy Considine's performance as Johnny, a broken man who has to endure the pain of watching his family wait him out while he shuts down, is the real triumph.It was a travesty that he never received a Best Actor Nomination at the 2002 Academy Awards.Every once in a while a film comes along that is both difficult to sit through and at the same time you feel better when you come out the other end of it.",

The Sullivan family has moved to America from Ireland, looking for new beginnings after the tragic loss of their only son, 5- year-old Frankie. Dad Johnny is played with rueful desperation by Paddy Considine. Johnny is an actor but hasn't felt an emotion since Frankie died so drives a cab between auditions. Mom Sarah (Samantha Morton) is an exquisite bit of fairy dust who sparkles in the presence of her daughters while fiercely loving and protecting her little family. The daughters, played by sisters Emma and Sarah Bolger, are simple perfection, understated and authentic and a joy to watch. Djimon Hounsou plays Mateo, a neighbor known as the screaming man. Mateo is an artist who meets the family as his life is ending, and both his life and death open the family to new beginnings. Hounsou as Mateo is passionate and vulnerable, and his every moment on the screen is riveting. Short version: The Sullivans move into a tenement in a rough neighborhood but they are survivors and thrive until Sarah's high-risk pregnancy puts her and the baby in danger. While she is kept in the hospital,(adding significant money concerns), Mateo is dying and the void in Johnny keeps getting larger. Daughter Christy is an old soul who observes so much through the eye of her video camera, and is able to provide for her family in a way Johnny cannot. I've seen the movie at least ten times and am always delighted to catch it again, with the quiet joy of living present in every frame.",

The metaphor is well noted.Without ado, we arrived at the new home, an inner-city apartment block. Again, haven't we all been there at some point starting out. Then the story kicks in from where we are drawn into the life of this family: it's as if we're right there, a fly on the wall, belonging. There were some pigeons, flies, mice, weren't there?Walking out of the theater it occurred, the whole was more than the sum of the parts. I came away with a sense of awe. The characters --I'm certain selected expressly as character actors so as not to involve personality, had risen up from the screen story and stood before us in a mystical transformation of film, sound, and story into testament. This is creative work of the highest caliber.Had I been on casting committee I might have wanted to continue looking for the right mom. But maybe Morton was cast pre-Minority Report.

The always fascinating Samantha Morton is vivid and mesmerizing, Djimon Hounsou is powerful and tender (he's both when he tells one of the little girls that he's an alien \"like ET\"), and the young actresses that play the daughters are both heartbreaking.  Sheridan makes a virtue out of the film's obvious low-budget, giving the film a gritty, cinema-verite look that captures their hardscrabble existence and lends an exhausted urgency to each scene.  The older daughter's constant use of a video camera, along with her voice-over narration also lends a documentary/home movie feel that gives the film an even greater sense of intimacy.  The (perhaps) necessary anachronisms (though set in the mid-1980s, the film uses a lot of present-day elements, such as the camcorder) gives the film a timeless feel - present, yet not present.\nOne critique on this site complained that the film was \"too lighthearted\" for its serious plot, but I found the humor and the irreverence refreshing and a welcome surprise; the filmmaker obviously understands how these immigrants find the will to go on:  there are little joys in even the mostdifficult lives and there are friends to be found in even the meanest streets.",

Only half jokingly, I'd say that I'm not at all sure that the oldest of the two children didn't out do Johnny Depp or Charize Theron in terms of best actors for 2003. The mother in the movie is simply extraordinary.The story is about a family from Ireland making their way in America. The central themes involve working with grief and overcoming hardship. There is a good mixture of comedy and serious drama, with two or three scenes that are very gripping.This is a serious film, so don't go see it or rent it if you are in the mood to see a popular romance or adventure film.

There are a few points I would like to address based on some of the reviews I've seen. \nFirst of all, the film makes it very clear from the beginning that it is told through the eyes and memory of a child.  It seems to me that some of us adults completely lose the ability to see the world that way, which may account for the mixed views on the \"hokiness, magic, and sentimentality\" of the plot.  I think the director clearly remembers what it was like to be a child and to be in a new world.  For example, the three wishes that the narrator/child used to cause effects on the world were believed only by the narrator, and the narrator was a child.  I'm surprised there are some reviewers who literally believed the director wanted us to think that the wishes were real or magical.  If it were not for the fact that the story is told by the oldest daughter, I may not have bought it.  But I did buy it, and it worked for me.The second thing is, I don't think they portray the Matteo (the \"African character\") as having necessarily more wisdom because he was African, but rather a different wisdom.  We don't know much about his background; however, he apparantly is an artist.  Every artist I have ever met tends to have a \"different\" and \"spiritual\" type of wisdom, African or otherwise.  It seemed to me that the family's mother had as much wisdom as Matteo, but it was just of a different nature.And finally, I did not interpret the ending of the film as the director telling us that Matteo is magically giving his spirit and life to the child. One person in our movie group did think that, but the rest of us changed her mind on that.  I believe Sheridan was just interposing the two scenes to show us that with death comes life.  Considering the reaction of the group I was with, Sheridan's intent certainly is not crystal clear here, which is fine.  The movie does ask a lot from its viewers; however, I do not think it is as difficult as some make it out to be.  I certainly did not have significant difficulties with it, and I usually have a problem with that sort of thing. This movie does make my top 10 list of 2003.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

We can see it all right there, in front of us, right on our faces, how a married couple should be, should behave, should feel... It's so amazing that it is hard to describe in words: deep love, commitment, respect, belief, truthfulness, compassion, understanding, passion, physical attraction, family in first place, having hope and dreams together, need of the other, and much much more. And when you live in a home with so many good and truthful feelings, you will be a great kid, you will be a great brother or sister, a great son or daughter, a great person... Wow, I had never seen all of these so well in my whole life. It amazed me very, very much. I didn't have this when I was a kid, and, unfortunately, I didn't give this to my kid either. I will recommend this movie to everyone I know, not just as entertainment, but also as a life's lesson -- one of the best lessons anyone can have. Better have this lesson before it's too late. Wonderful movie!!!",

            "content": "`In America' is a stunningly rich movie full of life and meaning.  The story line, about a family with alternative views of life in America, leads that wonderfully through the process of development of converging views that weave the fabric of the family and their lives. This motion picture is something really special and is added to my list of top ten movies released in 2003.  `In America' has received some very nice critical acclaim from the industry and recently won the Critic's Choice award for writing. That particular award generally sets the standard for Oscar winners, he is also nominated by the foreign press for best screenplay at the Golden Globes.`In America' has a tender yet rough look at a family initially at loss. It truly evaluates the priorities within a family while recognizing anguish, loss and sorrow.  Even new beginnings are not without their trials and tribulations. Set in NYC this re-birth in America is sullied with the reality of poverty, crime and drugs. No simple solutions follow these illegal Irish immigrants. In fact, to say this family is cursed would be accurate yet a sliver of hope hangs on the lips of these young girls who believe in the family.  The Bolger sisters are superbly cast and they generate a warm yet harried atmosphere.Besides the death of a child, this cinematic masterpiece explores the unspoken connection and conflict within this family, as they move into a rough area of what appears to be the Bronx-like burrow.  Sheridan examines these lives through a camera lens that allows incredible character development, creating an emotional roller coaster ride within the plot. My eyes welled up multiple times during this film. Each of these players is so real, and so magnificent that the emotional connection to their unspoken plight is magnified.  The sorrow reminds me of other great movies like `Iris' and `In the Bedroom'.   The strength of innocence is showcased through the interaction of these young girls with the often-strange neighbor Djimon Hounsou (Amistad).  As his antagonistic role takes center stage, it is done so seamlessly that one almost misses how his role in the story evolves into one of the most crucial elements of the film.  The pace of action back and forth is reminiscent of soccer play, and the content of the scene communication the soul of the entire story in microcosm. It's yes another instance of the film's triumphant accomplishment of portraying much about life and its rewards.Through the impressive display of master filmmakers and talent exhibited the mastery of their crafts, `In America' doesn't lose sight of its mission to teach us about life and its rewards.  This film isn't a lot of fun, or an action entertainment picture. It is, however, an incredibly well told story that connects despair with hope, life with death, that emotions can't help but to be touched. These strangers from a foreign land teach us about ourselves as an amazing family who faces one adversity after another with patience, understanding of immutable laws of being human and faith in one another. `In America' is a film not to be missed for the lessons about life and humanity that make this film a work of art.",

Well it does and it doesn't, and if Jim Sheridan wins, the Academy will be sending a strong message to the more traditional 3 act screenplay that dominates the American screen.Seen through the eyes of a 10 year old girl, In America shows the struggle of actor dad as he tries to get a gig in New York, and how the Irish family (including mom and younger sister) deal with the backstory loss of a younger sibling and eventually the artist living downstairs.Lots of great dialog and acting is top notch. Unfortunately I did not have much emotional attachment to anyone except the little girls, and much of the adult struggles and character development, especially Dad's, are really central to the story arc. This makes much of the film rather cheesy in spots, especially with the use of a simultaneous birth and death (oh...come on...this is MAJOR mozzarella!).Stick through to the end, its worth it. The film does have merit, in the sense that it justifies an art form that is becoming increasingly irrelevant (that being cinema and television). Yes, the make-believe we call the movies does have a purpose, which is to help us deal with all of the painful stuff, especially loss.",

To begin with, the fact that the main point of view is that of a little girl (\"don't little girl me!\", I can hear her!), must be kept in mind. Therefore we have to accept some inconsistencies or magical components: how comes that Mateo, a devil-like character, is nearly a saint? But to me the most amazing thing is the way magic and tragedy go hand in hand. It is a film of transformations: Mateo evolves from being a devil figure to an angel; of big questions such as What is love? Do we really know how to love? Are those little girls as innocent as they may seem to be? The movie is a celebration of life through death: the father only learns to live when he accepts that Frankie is dead. It is a celebration of innocence: the father will be happy when he accepts that he can look at the sky and see the spirits of his loved ones. Probably that is connected to the Catholic faith in which the girls are brought up: Jesuschrist believed that everybody had to be like little babies, that is naive, candid... in order to be saved. Probably that's the underlying message: be innocent. P.S.: Being a non-English-speaking person, the word \"youse\" (they use it as a plural of \"you\" -does it really exist?) was interesting.",

While children are honest about their feelings, their interpretations of events may not always be true or real, and even the main character, the narrator, Christy, tells us at the end, \"when you return to reality . . . .\" Some previous comments, about the children running around NYC alone, ring true, and also jumped spark a fear and wonder about the parent's ability, until I kept reminding myself that one central \"character of the film\" is E.T., a movie that came out in 1982, twenty years before this movie. As a parent who had a 12 year old son in '82, I remember that while airport security was tightening down [the Cuban hijacks of the '70s], he was allowed more freedom than my two children who were born later in the 1980s and grew up under the shadow of child abductions of the 90s. Though the film has a somewhat contemporary feel to it and I reacted to the unabashed freedom of the children, I did keep reminding myself of that time when such freedom was commonplace. It did not prevent me, after the first several reminders, from enjoying the film.Good films, like all good literature, are circular in nature [one of the best being \"Holes\" with even its title giving us that circular image]. A good \"circular\" film is where everything presented to us--events, thought, ideas, etc--all come back in the end connected, and if really well done, tied neatly into a translucent ribbon, one we are vaguely aware of but are not forced to see. This film does that; everything presented, viewed, is important and comes to full circle. Another good example of this is in the film, \"Signs.\"But as well written as a story/film maybe, if the acting is not up to the same level, it can fail. Here, the acting is superb! from all the children to all the adults, from those with big parts to those minor but pivotal characters. Ariel and Christy, the daughters and sisters in real life, gave excellent performances, with Christy's rendition of \"Desperado,\" and all the many Ariel soliloquies as standouts. Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine as the parents gave great performances, with all sorts of shading and nuances of real parenting and marriage, while Djimon Hounsou was thoroughly frightening at first and then became one of the most beautiful souls, and man, ever. Jim and Naomi Sheridan, who co-wrote the script with Jim directing, have done an excellent job in giving us a story, their story, while not exact 'true' story/details, it is their personal tale of life and all its moments of up and downs, wishes and dreams, and the ugly truth of reality-that sometimes, can be reflected back as beauty simply through the joy of a moonlit night.",

            "content": "In America (2002) Director: Jim SheridanThe screen turns black.  Then yellow.  Then an image of the American flag waving over an unknown business emerges.  Narration begins, and it's a young girls voice - specifically that of Sarah Bolger, who plays Christy and carries only three acting credits to her name, but goes on to give an overwhelmingly emotional performance during IN AMERICA.  Her counterpart, Emma Bolger (Ariel), who happens to be her sister on and off the screen, pulls off her character with a genuine innocence that comes natural only to a six year old.  The parents, played by Paddy Considine (as Johnny) and Samantha Morton (as Sarah), are emotional basket cases whose guilt of a slain child hangs over their heads.Within the first ten minutes of the movie you see this young, Irish family moving into a junkie infested apartment building, located in Manhattan. You feel the giddiness of being a child in a new place, as well as the pressure of being an adult with rent to pay.Amidst the difficulties this family encounters, there is always a victory. Most family hardship situations in films I've encountered recently are lacking the ability to create a relation with the viewer - but this film really connects to you at a deeper level.  Everyone has seen their dad try to solve a problem only to find something was wrong with the resolution. This film is all heart.*SPOILER*Another aspect I found interesting was the connection to Steven Spielberg's ET.  It begins with a family viewing of the movie, after which Ariel is weeping about ET having to go home.`Why does ET have to go home?' she whines. `He went to heaven, it's the same thing.' or something to that effect, was the reply. `No, it's not the same at all.' she concludes in a whimper, reminiscent of a wounded puppy.As they exit the theater, and walk into a street occupied by a carnival, Ariel notices an ET doll at one of the scam booths and insists her father win it for her.  Johnny pushes and pushes and stretches his money to the very last cent, in order to provide his daughter with her beloved ET. And he does.  This, in and of itself, is a message screaming 'This dad will do whatever it takes for his family.'  But that's obvious, no?  It is also synonymous to their present situation, the longing for missed things and familiar places, the people around them that seem so (no pun intended) alien.Another character enters the plot.  Mateo, played by the talented Amistad star Djimon Hounsou, is also a resident in their building.  A screamer, an artist, and a victim of an unnamed (but predictably AIDS) virus, his character is meshed from a self-ostracized freak, to a more than welcome part of the extended family.  In the height of the movie he falls sick and tells the young Ariel he is an alien `just like ET' and that his skin can't handle the weather on Earth.  To be honest, I am STILL contemplating the meaning of this.  Ariel makes mention of him returning home like ET, and he tells her that where he is going could be called home.Even more, his departure from the film makes way for the entrance of a new born baby.  Through a hard birth, Sarah becomes delusional and accuses Johnny of being the reason their latter son died.  Although this evokes emotion in him, he cannot bring himself to cry.  The state of her brings me to tears at even this moment, almost 6 hours after I viewed the film.  At the closing of the film, they have finished celebrating the baby's birth and are outside.  Johnny and Christy convince Ariel that Mateo is riding a bicycle across the moon and waving goodbye to her as he promised.  As they begin to shout goodbye to him, the father realizes that they are also shouting goodbye to their deceased brother.  During a heart wrenching few minutes, Christy makes her dad say goodbye to him too, causing him to cry - and enabling him to finally let go.  The movie closes with another touching message from Christy.  One that is to touching even to reveal.The script for this movie was written by Sheridan as well as his daughters. The insight into the characters is magnificent and so truthful it chills you to the bone.  The actors chosen are wonderful as well, in their ability to make you feel like you're right there with them.  Your heart bleeds for them - and understandably so.  Further, the technical shooting of the film was so amazingly 'not there'.  In a good way.  A way that allowed you to step through the screen.  Perfectly un-Hollywood.I would give this film 11 stars if I could.  It was that great. Comparable to the vulnerability you felt while viewing WHALE RIDER.  This is a must see, and if you miss it in the theater than make sure you rent it.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.",

They take their neighbors as innocent until proven guilty (isn't that supposed to be the American way?),and the scene with the desperate junkie adds a bit of realism.\nThe bit about the hospital bill points to the plight of illegal immigrants who may not have access to social services that others in similar financial circumstances can access.

I'm assuming the action took place in 1982 since the family went to see E.T. in the movie theaters), I cringed at many scenes:ANACHRONISM #1: Girl child telling the story is carrying a camcorder throughout, yet she's from an impoverished Irish family who just came to America.  Where would she find one?  Forget her class and immigrant status, where in 1982 would there even be a camcorder! We're talking about 1982, right?  The Apple Computer commercial hasn't even debuted yet, and we've got a poor immigrant child carrying around a camcorder?!?!ANACHRONISM #2: Times Square was NOT looking like THAT in 1982. Before all those wide screen razzle dazzle images, there were junkies and hookers and a bunch of XXX theaters, way before porn went to home theater.ANACHRONISM #3: The music soundtrack for this is just WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! First of all, if our director really wanted to establish this as an eighties nostalgia movie, he should have chosen music from the period. Just a simple replacement would have worked.  Instead of playing the 60s' song, \"Do You Believe in Magic,\" while they're driving through Times Square, what about Michael Jackson's \"Human Nature\"? (oops, can't honor Michael nowadays, but still . . . I know this song came out a year after 1982 but at least we would have figured, \"okay, this movie takes place in the 80s.\"  And if Michael doesn't work, what about Tears for Fears'\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\"?).  And, during the hospital/labor scene, instead of playing another 60s song, \"To Everything Thing There is a Season,\" why not use the Police's \"Every Breath You Take\" (considering that the preemie baby had to struggle to live and that Matteo was struggling to die, this sure would have been appropriate), or even Cyndi Lauper's \"Time After Time\"?ANACHRONISM #4: White boy in taxicab who can \"rap\"?  Are you kidding me? 1982 - hip hop was still underground in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens; it had not even crossed the bridge over to Manhattan (let alone the rest of the country and the world)!  The only \"white boy\" who'd be able to rap at this time is one who was living in one of the other boroughs named above, and it's unlikely he'd be taking a cab in Manhattan.In other words, Jim Sheridan is a 60s baby boomer, pretending to know something about growing up in the 80s, when clearly he doesn't by his anachronistic music choice.  So why didn't he just leave the action in the present day?Oh, of course, to establish that the black man is dying of a \"mysterious\" disease called AIDS, which was only mysterious in the early 80s?Gimme a Break!  (And no, I'm not referring to that early 80s sitcom!)But, apart from these flaws, it was an enjoyable little film, but nothing to reward come Oscar time (it's up for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actress).",

Sarah playing Christy and Emma playing Ariel. These girls are definitely a budding irish talent and believe that is hard to come by here in such a small little country.Samantha Morton plays Sarah, mother and wife, who in the film gets pregnant. Her role as an Irish immigrant won her a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars, her second Oscar nomination to date.Paddy Considine plays the father and husband. He is a struggling actor who is still trying to get over his son's death.Djimon Hounsou plays a man who is dying of AIDS and seems scar but when the children go trick and treating he makes friends with the girl's family.I was able to relate to the story as I am Irish and am around the same age as the girl in the film and my brother died when he was a baby. 10 out of 10.",

It really evokes the gritty magic of New York and how it looks the first time you see it...warts and all...all of the actors are very good, but the two little girls in particular are spectacular. Their leap in faith in coming to America is paralleled by the leaps of faith they make every day living in a terrible neighborhood with pimps, junkies and whores...and yet the kids being kids mostly see it as an adventure. Absolutely disarming and beautiful. The visual film work is very nice, and I liked the use of the hand held cameras in the film, alternating between the 35 mm film and the video. The sacrifices that these folks make to achieve their dream and escape their past is very inspiring, and is probably shared by most other immigrants.",

It's just like the asinine title on this week's Newsweek, \"Who Really Killed Jesus Christ?\"  The point of the movie, as well as the point of Jesus Christ, is that if we don't learn how to love and how to forgive we will go through life as vampires, the living dead, numb and cold.  No wonder no one ever sees the miracles happening all around us, they're too distracted by analyzing the minutiae, i.e. Janet Jackson's boob.  If you want to scour something for imperfections, look into your own heart!!!  The movie was superb!  Grief has many faces that you can only know after you've been in it's grip.",

The film portrays the difficulties that Johnny(Paddy Considine) and Sarah(Samantha Morton) come across while making their living in America, especially after the death of their 5 yr old son Frankie. The film revolves around their eldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) video capturing striking moments of their living in her camcorder. The lead characters have done a wonderful job, and referring to Ariel(Emma Bolger) it made me wonder how a 5 or 6 yr old girl can do such an outstanding performance in acting. Overall, A good narrative with wonderful acting, involving complex emotions sums it up for 'In America'. P.S : Christy's image is still in my mind. (You'll know it after you watch the movie)",

In reality, it was very depressing to watch the struggle of this unfortunate family. I was unable to continue watching, as I just felt so terrible for the family....Living in abject poverty in a place no child should even be allowed to visit. The struggle exhausted me.My husband did finish the movie and said that it is an excellent film and he was moved by the generosity of the characters, especially Mateo. This is not an uplifting comedy, by any stretch. It's actually a real tear-jerker. But it was a well-done film.",

            "content": "The most moving point of the film for me occurred during the final crawler where I realized just how autobiographical this film was. Brother and sister Sheridan wrote the screenplay about their own experiences as children. This knowledge made the personal choices of the characters, real and understandable. I suspect that Sheridan's real mother and father would have made the choices we witnessed in the movie. But these same personal choices made watching the film a bit difficult for me. I had trouble liking these characters when they foolishly gambled their rent money and their family's future on a kewpie doll. Or, when they let their little girls trick-or-treat unsupervised in a flop house peopled with junkies and muggers. Or when they sent their girls off to the streets of Brooklyn unsupervised at night in a torrential downpour to get ice cream. Or when the mother allowed herself to have an intimate (but not physical) friendship with a handsome young artist while her husband worked, driving cab -- this shouldn't, but so often can lead to marital difficulties and I think it put at risk, the mother-father relationship which supports a family. The movie deals with the loss of their son -- a baby boy -- who has died by the time the movie starts. We are told that he fell down the stairs. I found myself thinking that, with their parental style, it may actually have been a preventable death. This distrust, even dislike, of this couple made is difficult for me to fully enjoy this drama as it unfolded. True, the movie tells a very real story in very real way (except for one scene where the 12- year-old says a very un-12-yr-old thing when she says, \"I'm carrying this family\") But, being realistic may not be enough for this viewer. I need to be able to identify with, or root for, my protagonists. In this movie I found myself sometimes fearful for, sometimes pitying and sometimes shocked by this innocent, hapless family as they struggled nobly but sometimes carelessly against the difficulties of life.",

            "content": "I saw this film at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival in January - and have been awaiting its release ever since. I agree with James McNally - excellent story, with the exception of going a bit Hollywood with Djimon Hounsou's B story (no offense to Djimon, his acting is great). Prior to this I'd not been familiar with Paddy Considine, but his performance is so powerfully emotional, I'm not likely to forget him. The carnival scene - unforgettable. Samantha Morton in her best performance. And the Bolger sisters, truly a joy to watch on screen.  In my opinion, this is Jim Sheridan's best film, a semi-autobiographical treasure. Visually stunning, emotionally charged, simple and straight to the heart. With all of the blockbuster brouhaha this year, it's refreshing to see this honest, compelling, and comparatively small film rise to the occasion. If there remains any sense of rewarding true brilliance in film, In America will be acknowledged by the Academy. (forgot to mention - excellent score, too.)",

Simple watching the movie, without the E.T. reference, makes it obvious that the movie takes place in the nineties, or even in 2002 or so when (get this) E.T. was RE-RELEASED! wow, wouldn't that make sense? The poor little girl has a camcorder, obviously she never would have owned one in 1982. Never once does this movie allude to the eighties (aside from the E.T reference, which i addressed above) and obviously missing were the world trade center towers from the manhattan skyline. Sheridan, being a thorough and sophisticated director, would have taken the time to create them digitally had the movie been set in the eighties. denying this movie validity by nit-picking (and with no good reason) gives Sheridan little credit for his masterpiece.

            "content": "I really enjoyed Jim Sheridan's other films MY LEFT FOOT and IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, so I was looking forward to this film, based loosely on his own immigrant experiences.  Yet I found it mawkish, painfully sentimental, and, oddly enough, unbelievable.  Perhaps he was too close to the material and to its characters; I think we all like to romantisize our own lives, and unfortunately he goes overboard.  Interestingly, the script is co written by his two daughters, which leads to other problems I'll mention later.Right away, I have a huge problem with the fact that the film never tells us why the family has to come to America in the first place!   They know no one there, have little money, and no opportunities awaiting them.  How bad was their situation in Ireland?  How do their friends and family feel about their leaving?  We never know. The only real reason given is that the father has a desire to be a stage actor on Broadway.  If this is the only reason, then the dad is a real self centered jerk, who literally risks the life of his family(his two daughters are only 8 and 10 years old)by forcing them to live in a dangerous neighborhood, just so he can  follow his selfish dream.  Why doesn't he go on alone, and then send for his family when he had enough money to afford a better place?  Once again, we never know.It gets worse:  in a scene that's painfull to watch, the father decides to impress his family by winning an ET doll at a fair. This eventually leads to him risking the family's rent money.  Are you kidding me?  What kind of father runs the risk of putting his children on the street just to win some cheap stupid doll?  The fact that the mother hands over the rent money with very little protest says little for her too. Yet this film wants us to like these parents!Another problem I had with the film is the depiction of the two little girls; I already mentioned that the script is co written by Sheridan and his two daughters Naomi and Kirsten.  Unfortunately they seem to have fallen into the trap of portraying themselves as the kind of children that they WISH they were, rather than how real children are. So the movie has two painfully adorable moppets who are almost always cheerful and happy, who are wise beyond their years(\"I want my real daddy\" says the youngest to her father, in a moment of mind numbing sappiness), never whine, almost never complain, make their father breakfast in the morning, and basically act as real as the kids from your average sit com.  Late in the film, the ten year old asserts that she has been holding the family up for years.  Sheridan obviously wants the audience to laugh and cheer at this line, except that he has given no evidence of it to be true.  How exactly is this young child holding up the family?  I don't see it.I have other problems with the film that I don't have time to go into, but I will say that someone looking for an good film about the immigrant experience should check Elia Kazan's AMERICA AMERICA, or EL NORTE, or even THE JOY LUCK CLUB.  Pass on this one.",

Samantha Morton, Paddy Considine, Djimon Honsou and  (YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE THESE ARE ACTORS) --- Sarah and Emma Bolger, have made their charactors so real that you'll simply get swept away in their story.
