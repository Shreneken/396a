            "content": "The competitive world of street dancing is explored through the eyes of two best friends, played by Marques Houston and Omarion. As the leaders of a hot local dance crew, they are challenged to a competition that causes a rift in their friendship, but if they're going to win at \"The Big Bounce\" they will have to put their dispute aside and work together.You Got Served has some great dance spots but not much in terms of plot or originality. The makers of You Got Served only had one thing on their mind and that was to wow its audience with its dancing. They succeeded at making the dancing really good but failed to make a good movie. If you watch it just to check out the dancing and ignore everything else then you will enjoy it. But if you notice how bad the acting is or how stupid the story is then you will hate it. The dancing sequences are done extremely well and the movie gets a ten on that part but for everything else it gets a three.The acting was decent enough for this type of movie but it could have been a lot better. The plot was stupid and it was tied together with the dance sequences. I think so many people hated this movie because of the story not making a lot of sense. While I didn't really like the film, I'll admit that the rating of 1.8 is too low for the movie. It was a bad movie but it wasn't that bad. Chris Strokes does a good job at directing the dance sequences but he can't tell a story at all. He would randomly move from scene to scene and none of them would really make sense. I heard they're going to make a sequel so hopefully they will work a little harder on the script. Though if they did make one, I probably wouldn't watch it. In the end, unless you're into dancing, this film is worth skipping. Rating 4/10",

            "content": "Elgin and David are best friends and the leaders of the best dance crew in the area. Their dominance is threatened when a crew from another area challenges them to a battle for the stake of $5k \u0096 a challenge that they accept. However when the crew are betrayed by one of their own and the challengers simply steal all their moves before they can perform, the bet is lost. David and Elgin suffer further strife when David lets Elgin down when it comes to business \u0096 putting them in debt to the local gangster. They are forced to put their differences behind them as a major dance competition is put on that offers them the prestige and money to get out of their situations.Having a close friend with a black teenage daughter I have a vague knowledge of bands like IMX and B2K; and I know who manages them as well \u0096 none other than Chris Stokes, writer and director of this promotional video. I say promotional video because this is not a film, not in anything but the most basic use of the word. The plot is a very obvious series of dance battles backed up by some very simple plotting that almost totally fails to engage. What the film does do though is deliver some very good dance scenes which are enjoyable so long as you like that sort of thing. For me the atmosphere, skill and music involved in these scenes almost made it worth seeing \u0096 almost.Sadly the bits between the dance moves are just awful. The basic story is not the biggest problem, it is the manner that it is delivered. Stokes' script is nothing but a collection of black clich\u00e9s all speaking in heavy ebonics. I will give you the fact that some people do talk like this but here it just lazy writing \u0096 rather than writing characters he simply creates clich\u00e9s to make the audience accept them. Having a black ex-wife I have seen a fair collection of 'black' movies from America and happily not all of them are as lazy as this but far too many simply trade in these street-talking, thug-loving clich\u00e9s. Last week in The Times was an article about black exploitation films from the 70's get re-releases, I do not think that they need a release because these exploitation films have just been replaced by the modern black comedy. I'm sure I'll be shouted down for this but when I see something that stereotypes race I must call it \u0096 whether it is a film that is deliberately racist or lazy. Given the all black cast then I cannot call this racist but it is certainly lazy and simplistic. As director Stokes also shows himself to be totally lacking in his own imagination \u0096 witness the jump-zoom technique that he overuses, that's been done everywhere and it's a sad indictment of his vision that it seems to be the only trick in his bag.With only clich\u00e9s and 'thug attitude' to work with it is no surprise that the performances are bad \u0096 a fact not helped by the cast is populated by people who seem unable to deliver any dialogue with any degree of natural sense. I wish I was so na\u00efve that I thought that the presence of Omarion, Houston and Lil' Fizz was down to their talent rather than Stokes' involvement in the film. Omarion is one big black clich\u00e9 and he seems to think that making a charming character involves just flashing a smile and saying 'y'know' lots. Houston avoids the clich\u00e9s a bit better but only has two modes \u0096 one mode is him brooding around like someone just stole his last forty and the other mode is clich\u00e9d street-smart mode. Suffice to say, neither can act. You know you're in the sh*t when it comes to your cast when Steve Harley is your big name guest star \u0096 a fact that highlights the film's values. The rest of the cast are just like the support cast of any music video \u0096 pretty boys and girls. I'm not complaining because I thought Freeman was cute and minor appearance from music video regulars McCall and Rodrigues were hot. Likewise I'm sure teenage girls will go mad for the buff male cast too \u0096 but lets not call them actors just because they are reading lines off cards.Overall this film is worth seeing if you like the 'clowning' type of dancing that this film trades on or if you like hip hop (the cynical side of me thinks that the 30 second snippets of songs is designed to sell the soundtrack), however this is not a film in any way, shape or form. The story is rubbish and if you can't see how it is going to end after 15 minutes then you are a muppet. The script creates clich\u00e9s rather than characters and relies on staples of black movies to get by (shootings, dealing, b*tches and basketball) and uses lazy ebonics in place of dialogue.The casting is simply self-promotion of Stokes' boy bands and none (and I mean none) of the cast actually act here \u0096 some of the delivery was amazingly bad. However, for the dancing and hip hop I consider it worth watching (even if it is only really a long music promo), but if you don't like this type of music then you will find this to be one of the most vacuous 90 minutes of your life.",

Actually, it is close to being funny, but right before you are about to laugh at how dumb it is, you are more repulsed by how bad it is. Then there is the acting, or lack thereof. I just love the way all of the \"performers\" pose and \"front\" for the camera. They look so moronic! I guess what you want to know, is this film so bad that it is good? No, it is so bad that it is horrible.Oh yeah, the story is about crews that challenge each other to \"dance-offs.\" Really, it is.",

            "content": "\"You Got Served\" is a movie that was aimed solely at the youth market. There is no obvious good reason for this middle aged guy to watch it....except that I take pleasure in watching the film on IMDB's ever-changing \"Bottom 100\" list. And, it seems that \"You Got Served\" is now on the list...and I have to see it and review it! So be forewarned...I am not the target audience for a hiphop dancing movie, that's for sure!Before I get to the review, I also think it's important to point out that although a lot of folks obviously hate this film, it DID do incredibly well at the box office. It earned back about eight times what it cost to make (this only counts US receipts) and even hit #1 at the box office! So, although there are some haters, the filmmakers probably were laughing all the way to the bank!So is the film any good and does it deserve to be on the IMDB list? Well, the answer is no and no. It's not a particularly good movie, at least in some ways. And, it does not deserve to be on such an infamous list. First, what I liked. Although I think there was too much dancing, to the point where I felt a bit numb, the hiphop dancing was incredible and very well choreographed. While I don't like the music, I found myself enjoying the athleticism of these dancers. You cannot totally hate a movie with this much energy and talent. What I didn't like was the plot...especially Elgin. Liking this jerk and caring about him to too tough and the character seemed unreal...and since he made up so much of the plot, I found myself longing for the next dance number! Additionally, at times the film appeared to want to look and sound tough...though I couldn't help but feel everyone was too well coiffed, too scripted and too much like actors instead of street-smart kids. Overall, worth seeing once just for the dancing...and a film not nearly as bad as I'd assumed.By the way, sadly, Michael Taliferro (Emerald--that REALLY tough guy) died of a stroke only two years after making this film. He was 44 years old.",

            "content": "The only person who is \"served\" by this film, is the person watching it. That's right... you get served a steaming pile of bad movie.  Let me go on the record by explicitly stating: Chris Stokes is an absolutely appalling writer.  Just the fact that he thought his horrific script was worth turning into movie, strongly suggests to me that Mr. Stokes is suffering from some sort of mental deficiency.  Seek medical attention ASAP.To be honest, I rented this movie because it's enjoying the dubious pleasure of languishing at #1 on IMDB's Bottom 100.  My goal in life, as it were, is to watch all of the Bottom 100 movies.  While this movie is certainly feculent, it still can't touch the majesty & power of such classics as Troll II, Eeegah, The Blade Master, Manos: Hands of Fate, Deathstalker III, etc, etc.  It comes close, but I wouldn't rate this movie any worse than 75th on the Bottom 100.Let's detail some weak points of the script, shall we?(* spoilers * -- as if it's possible to spoil this movie)* The two main characters (David & Elgin) are \"forced\" into selling some sort of contraband to make ends meet.  This is strange since they both enjoy the luxury of living in upper middle class homes, with, what appears to be, a good family environment.  Ostensibly they have more than enough time to, you know, get a job -- since all they do, all day, is play basketball, talk on cell phones, and dance.* Mr. Stokes really enjoys introducing plot lines and then summarily ignoring them.  What about the girl trying to get into Princeton?  What about the dancer who switches crews?  Whatever happened to him?* Lil' Kim, near the \"climax\" of this donkey-show, informs the two competing crews that they're going to have a \"dance off\" for the right to appear in her next video.  There's one little twist: this particular dance engagement is going to feature \"no rules\" -- it's going to be \"straight street\".  My buddies and I found the \"no rules\" dancing to be eerily similar (if not exactly identical) to the \"rules\" dancing.  What, exactly, are you allowed to do in a \"no rules\" dance competition, that you can't in a \"rules\" competition?* The dancers depicted in this movie display a remarkable ability to engage in choreographed routines w/o prior rehearsal or practice.  Pretty cool, eh?* Mr. Rad (Steve Harvey) hires an off-duty policeman to protect the participants of his nightly \"dance battles\".  I wonder what the policeman thought of all the illegal gambling going on?  Mr. Stokes, sagely, decides to ignore this problem.I'll stop here.  Basically, the only person who would/could enjoy this movie is a teenager, with a sub-human IQ, who watches 8+ hours of MTV a day. Admittedly, some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, but you see pretty much everything you're going to see (dancing wise) within the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie.Bad movie score: 6/10  Good movie score: 2/10.",

In this movie, he had maybe 5 lines, all of them not funny. We would believe that he, as a dance off judge, has more power than the apparent bad ass \"gansta\" boss. The dancing looked good. I commend the people in the movie for their talent, but the movie stank. Like an old septic system. The acting was substandard at best, the direction poor, timing lousy and the characters were 2 dimensional.

            "content": "You Got Served (2004) has some of the best dancing sequences ever choreographed. They are so energetic, with the rap music pumping in the background. The problem is the film needs a better screenplay.The movie tells the story of two friends, Elgin and David (Marques Houston, and Omarion), who are leaders of the best dance crew in street dancing. They battle other dancers for both money and respect. But another popular group of dancers defeats them in one round after a member betrays them, and joins the other gang, although it is not clearly explained why. And Elgin and David's friendship is put to the test, when David begins dating Elgin's sister, Liyah (Jennifer Freeman).There is even a subplot about a younger dance member, who gets an early grave, though I felt he, nor his death added nothing new to the story, except to inspire the heroes to name their group after the kid's street name.Writer/Director Christopher B. Stokes simply cannot write, nor direct. I doubt this film even had a screenplay. Stokes relies on clich\u00e9s to keep the film at a full movie length. There's the obligatory white rapper wannabes being considered as the enemies, and there's the overprotective brother who looks after his sister.\"You Got Served\" is not the worst movie of the year, but it will make my personal bottom list of 2004. Forget the dialogue, forget the plot, and just enjoy the energetic dancing. Or better yet, don't waste your time with this one.",

After i saw it i start to watch the other movies of that kind with a \"different eye\". The dancers are awesome and the choreographs great! The music in it also! I cant understand why this movie is so underrated. OK the scenario about competitions is a lil bit \"clishe\" but even if it is i really liked this movie. It is not a love story again like always the strong part of it like the most movies of this kind. It is about music, and the passion of dancing! And the battles seemed too real to be fake that could make you wanter. Then i saw an interview of \"David\" who said: It was so real the whole thing in that dance ring that everyone wanted to battle and win for real, even when we knew the winner from before. And it seems exactly like that to a viewer who watches it. If you like hip hop music and dancing... Then you got to see \"You Got Served\" for sure! I have seen it about 9-10 times. I can see it more in the future. Trust me, it worths it. The most realistic and awesome hip hop dance movie ever.",

            "review_title": "What would Wagner think?",
            "content": "\"Wait, you don't mean Richard Wagner, I hope!?\" The guy who wrote Tannhauser, Lohengrin, and Ring Cycle (Rheingold, Valkyrie, some forgettable romp after Valkyrie, and Gotterdammerung)? Yes, sorry, but I do mean THAT Richard Wagner. What would he think of films today? He never lived to see the medium rise to its full glory; but by today's cinematic standards, if he wanted to do one, what could stop him? Imagine him writing scripts, composing film scores, and perhaps producing and directing. With his lofty imagination and desire to fuse drama and music with meaningful tact, his films would be unparalleled!\"But Wagner has nothing to do with this tawdry excuse of a 'movie'! What's the point?\" Well, while watching this, I remembered recently reading a short parody of The Valkyrie that attempts to summarize the opera's complex story. It was quite funny, but if I didn't know the opera's music and lacked firsthand knowledge of plot points, the humor would have been lost. This \"movie\" felt much like a short, watered-down, and generally hilarious parody of an otherwise memorable opera. The only problem is that You Got Served is not based on a memorable opera... or anything else! It is very much its own film, and yet the film has this urgent need to feel complete.Chris Stokes, a band-manager-turned-filmmaker as is the current zeitgeist, writes and directs this laughable exercise in movie-making. I bet he comes from the music video tradition, since the \"movie\" exploits fast cuts, faster girls, jarring edits (EDIT: The editing in this film was atrocious!), and loud music, all for the sake of promoting a musical act. I hope this experience teaches him that films and music videos do not equate. Films are longer and require much more care.He didn't think his screenplay through. Its numerous faults include blatant stereotypes, poor exposition (more than once did I see the need for several scenes to be condensed; plot holes were abundant), repetition (Stokes greatly wants to remind us that our protagonists owe money), deus ex machina (Grandma has some backup cash; forgettable friend learns about a major dance contest; \"Mr. Rad\" getting our \"heroes\" out of a fine mess with some gang), trite dialog (I could swear that, at one point, it looked as though Steve Harvey badly wanted to say a comeback to some comment made to him, but NOOOOO! The script apparently had other plans!), the sacrificial lamb (in the form of \"Lil' Saint\". Telling.), and the obligatory \"romance\" (the film's two resident lovebirds are no Tristan and Isolde, let me tell 'ya).Nor did he think his casting through. Musical acts don't necessarily make actors. (Mariah Carey paid dearly for not understanding this.) Not one the young \"actors\" in this film showed any conviction in their roles. The film exemplifies two types of bad acting: One coming from good actors muddled in bad roles (Harvey and a few of the token adults fit this) and another coming from bad actors relishing in awful roles (which this film has in spades).Boy, did I get served! This is required viewing if you want to learn how NOT to make a film. Wagner would be ashamed of such a hackneyed fusion of \"music\" and \"drama.\" If he was alive to see this... thing, he would never stop vomiting. Honestly, his oral discharges would be far more entertaining than this act of cinematic terrorism.",

This movie had me laughing beginning to end, and just when you think it can't get any more ridiculous, it does. The movie starts with a 1-2 punch of stupidity. Everyone is at a crowded warehouse with a boxing ring. But they're not fighting; they're dancing. And they're serious. If that isn't funny enough, it is followed by \"the kitchen scene.\" Ben Stiller wishes he could have dialogue this awkward. I was in pieces by this point. But as the plot thickens, it only gets better. We meet Lil' Saint, who is about 8 years old and probably curses more than anybody else in the movie. And then dies in a drive-by? I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a child's death than when I heard, \"Lil' Saint got shot! He was ridin' with Lanky and Bug, and some dude sprayed the car!\" We get a glimpse of the hard-knock (aka middle class) life that forces L and D to move drugs just so their family can buy them a new outfit every day. After they get served by the upper-middle class OC kids and D leaves L hangin' so he can mac it with L's sister, they learn that their new crews can win $50,000 if they serve every other crew in LA. (See, 50 G's split among 10 crew members is enough to change their lives.) Which leaves them with one obvious thing to do: the Rocky montage. And keep in mind: THEY ARE SERIOUS. On the Big Day, the dance-off ends in a tie between L's crew and the OC crew, so Lil' Kim lets them settle it the way she likes it: \"straight hood.\" The movie climaxes with the chant of \"Served, Served, Served\" and I have nearly pi$$ed my pants laughing. I recommend that everybody download You Got Served. You will be quoting it for weeks. The only question I have is how they ever got Steve Harvey to do this movie.",

But still, I have no trouble giving this film the triple B grade. Bad Beyond Belief.Our protagonist of the movie is 'David', a character who doesn't work, doesn't go to school, and spends his days on the basketball court and his nights doing errands for his criminal boss. Not your perfect son-in-law, obviously. Still, young, beautiful and brainy (she wants to be a doctor) Liyah falls for him (why we will never know), but too bad as she is the sister of David's best friend, Elgin.One day, while David takes his new girlfriend to a classy restaurant (McDondalds, that is), Elgin is beaten up by some punks, losing the business of his criminal boss. 'El' blames 'D' for messing it up apparently, and the guys are enemies until the big dancing finale.Oops, didn't I mention that? This movie is about dancing, people. Our guys are in the best LA dancing crew, until rich snotty and mean white kid Wade and his gang comes in and claims their spot. Well, until that finale, that is.A lot has been said about the racism in this movie, and although all the bad guys do seem to be white kids, I didn't think much of it. Except in the end, when Lil' Kim makes clear she wants the black group in her video. Quite disgusting, that scene.So, how bad is it? It starts out with a good dancing sequence, but then goes down hill a long long time. The script and directing are that of a 10 year old, the acting hurt my eyes, while my ears got a beating from the 'slang' the cast used. The most irritating person in the movie though is 'La La', an MTV presenter (apparently), who's giving us all the 'ya alls' and 'dopeness' we can handle (and more!). A horror to watch really.Although not a complete waste (thanks to some cool dancing moves), I can do no other thing than to end with: you got served, 'You Got Served'. There, I always wanted to say that. 2/10.",

They are offered by an O C crew to battle off; a five thousand dollar battle. when they lose the fight they need to figure out how to get out of debt. Growing on their problems is the courier service they do for Emerald. They transport hot goods to drop points, but when one of the bags gets stolen, they are in further debt; owing Emerald.The story is very simple; it doesn't really get any simpler, but it never mattered when Chris Stokes wrote the script, it probably didn't take him long to write it, as there's endless dancing. We are constantly seeing dancing and it glosses over the paper thin story and plot holes, and very bad acting. It looks like they just wandered off the streets and gave them ten minutes of acting lessons. Plus all the characters are clich\u00e9d, stumbling from one predictable situation to the next. Emerald though was missing a white cat for him to stroke; he was so cartoonish and never seemed serious; he was like the fat cat, but without any claws or menace.Though the dancing is high energy and moves fast, but if you are constantly seeing it, its just one music video basically, not a film. If the dancing was cut down a lot and worked more of thickening the story up, it would have been a lot better and enjoyable. There is such little character development and no underlying stories.God if you want a 90 min joke, you have your movie. I got served for just watching this. The shame.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.I think there are a few well defined types of film. You can enter a film for various reasons, and one type is there to provide you with a template of what you would like to be like. You go to these films not so much for an experience, but an anti-experience; you want to identify in a way that reinforces your identity.If the movie is too ambitious, or too much work to watch, you cannot feel superior enough to adopt it as the brand that you belong to. Naturally, kids are one target for this sort of thing, but they are not alone: check out nearly all sports films, most `date' movies, and of course traditional porn.These movies always have `good parts,' where you get the brand, and deliberately bad filler that you can guffaw over and generally feel superior about. Its all about branding and brand acceptance.In this case, whether you like this is a matter of whether you by the brand, because this dance style is as authentic as urban sports attire.But you already knew that.I'll go to ANY dance movie. That's because since `Red Shoes' the dancing eye of the camera has been part of the engagement with the dancers. The very best such films use a camera that is a coherent part of the dance. `Dogtown' did this, if you'll allow me to say that skating is urban dance.So I was eager to see how this fellow waterbug handled it - he is supposed to be `genuine' himself. Urban music is overtly unsophisticated, regular in 4/4 rhythm and mundane in harmonics. Its appeal - like the porn brand - is the rest, where energy and local in** (very local to the beat, what musicians call rubato) give us appeal.The camera does two things: switch between high and low (knee level), and do so more or less to the beat. Two cameras are used on all the dances except the last where four are present. I was pretty disappointed because there really is an art to hiphop and there are cinematic tools Stokes could have used: rhythm in the camera, time shifts (like the back and forth or turntable scratching), emphasis on body parts other than faces and knees. None of this. So it stabs the brand in the back. Stokes is off with his phone turned down when the brothers really needed him to be there.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

If you enjoy the kind of dancing featured in this film, I'd recommend buying it & skipping all the dire plot & acting. Or just not buy it all. I object to this film being rated, as there isn't a score low enough.",

Now I liked Stomp the Yard, but I knew what to expect from You Got Served, it's been panned as one of the worst films of all time. But I had a bad attitude seeing this film, but you know what? I'm alright with this film. I'm not saying that it's good, but is it awful? No, I'm kinda in the gray area of this film where I don't love it, I don't hate it, I just think it's an alright film. I think people are just freaking out about it because naturally any film that has Lil' Kim or K-Fed in the titles, I mean, come on, it's insulting to our intelligence. But the acting wasn't horrendous, I was expecting so much worse, but it was believable enough to watch. The story is typical and predictable, but once again, it's tolerable, this is movie that I'm not sure so many people should just jump to hate.David and Elgin are in a dance group together and they are the champions of their city. But when they are challenged by Wade, another group and they find out that one of their boys, Sonny, just spied on them and gave all their moves to Wade. They loose to them, but one night when El needs David for a job, David is out with El's sister and El gets beat up very badly. El ad David are on a non-speaking term, but when a little friend of their's is killed, they must pull together once again for the big dance contest up against Wade once again.Like I said, this isn't a bad movie, You Got Served is just an alright film, I think it's watchable. I think people just jump so quickly on these movies because of it's theme, I also hate rap, I hate the rap society, I think it's disgusting how many sheep there are out there who try to act so \"real\" and \"down with the hood\", but You Got Served doesn't rub it in your face so much. I would recommend Stomp the Yard over this, but this is a watchable film, it's not too bad.3/10",

            "content": "I like watching people dance well and I like some R'n'B and Hip Hop music, but where films involving elements of dancing are concerned, acting and a good script are also the key to a good dance-orientated movie. An example of this would be 'Save The Last Dance' starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas. Now that was a relatively good film that combined good choreography with some decent acting, particularly on the part of the two leads. You Got Served, on the other hand, does not have those elements which 'Save The Last Dance' has, as rather whereas the dance moves were flashy and quite impressive to watch, the acting, dialogue and performances are, in contrast, painstakingly dreadful. Clearly, this film is and was produced and aimed at a young, black audience, but even still it doesn't excuse the somewhat 'laughable' acting and bad dialogue that accompanies this mess. This film was cringing to watch and the predictability of the plot and narrative underlines this. Two guys square off against each other, one has a crush on a girl, two guys go into battle, the guy gets the girl, they all live happily ever after, the end. Typical. There was nothing different in this film that we haven't remotely seen before attempted in many other films of this type. Btw, that girl that was in that Damon Wayans sitcom, 'My Wife and Kids' is in this flick, but she is nothing more than eye candy for the guys and with very little in the way of dialogue to work with. It would've been understandable if this was a pure out and out music vid, but as a film, You've Got Served, other than the dance moves, has rarely any redeeming features worth shouting about from the rooftops. I only saw this film on DVD out of interest to see whether it was worth the money (I didn't buy it btw)- and yet it was one of the most awful movies I have watched. I am glad I watched it because if I hadn't watched it and said it was awful, then I would've judged the film based on what others have negatively said alone. Usually with bad films, you'd give up at the half way point, but I watched and stuck with You've Got Served' in its entirety, hoping in the belief that the movie would get better but it didn't. There were moments where i'd end up laughing because even though this is supposed to be a drama and a serious film with some light moments thrown in, I couldn't help but chuckle at times at how bad this was. The dance moves save this movie from me giving this a lowly one star, but nevertheless with the film and the performances itself, they couldn't dance its way to a 8 or 9 star rating, never mind out of a brown paper bag. For die-hard fans of B2K and hip hop dance-based movies only.",

Everybody who hasn't seen it....go see it. It'll be worth your time and money! After watching You Got Served It made me realize the EVEN MORE talent that B2K had and Marques Houston as well..I think this movie was cool. It was more than I expected although to be honest the movie made me cry, mad, and happy on different parts of the movie. This was an awesome movie that I will  I will show this movie to my children. A movie to not regret also one of my favorites. The movie You Got Served was a excellent movie in my opinion. All of the people did wonderfully. The dancing was great Omarion Grandberry was great.

            "content": "I didn't expect much from a movie starring the 'boyz' from B2K, but I never expected it to be THIS bad! To even classify this as a movie is complete and utter shame. The movie features one of (if not THE) worst scripts ever written. The dialogue is a disaster, sounding as if they decided to put every single 'thug' catchphrase in one movie. The plot literally makes From Justin to Kelly look superior. You can actually see the forced motivation each character exhuberates in each scene, and certain scenes are either missing or just left out for the sake of being one big hollow road.The story is centered around some 'hoodlums' who decide to enter a dance competition to both win money and keep their own pride. It's Bring It On meets Boyz 'n' Da Hood! You just don't mix those two movies.... ever! So now we have a very predictable problem: The group members argue and eventually split up, thus having trouble practicing for the big finale. Well suddenly, with minimal practice, they get out on the stage and perform a 'thug' cheerleading dance that wows the whole crowd. Well I suppose if you forgive and forget you can learn a routine in about a day or so! It's complete tripe! The acting is without a doubt one of the worst I've ever seen. The white 'thug' almost made me tear up from laughing as he delivers what's supposed to be a tough and gangster performance. Give me a break, it's like watching Bill Gates scaring 50 Cent.From beginning to end, the movie almost makes an attempt at being bad. The director gets together a bunch of wannabe dancers and shoots from every angle possible. Then literally splices all the pieces together to make one remarkably disjointed scene after another. Some scenes look as though they don't even belong in the movie. For example, when Omarion (I think that's who it is) feels sad and goes out in the rain, dancing to (wow) a Black Eyed Peas song. It was like watching one of his music videos, only thrown into a perfectly bad movie. Sympathy grows (?) as he and his best friend both dance in a montage that would make Eisenstein sick to his stomach, jumping from one shot to another as if they lost track of time and decided to film it any way possible.Once the movie is done, it leaves you with absolutely no feeling. You walk out of the room or theater or airplane even? asking yourself what the point of that 1.5 hour music video was. I'll admit some of the dance moves were pretty impressive, but who cares? It's a movie, not a Michael Jackson reunion.The movie is what I'd call the biggest rip off in the history of cinema, stealing scenes from movies such as Bring it On, Every gangster movie ever made, and dare I say even Shawshank Redemption (see: the rain scene). It almost makes you wonder how someone can pull off such a horrible job.I'd give it 0/10 but since IMDb forbids it, I'll have to give it a 1... Much more than it deserves.",

I think true b-boys will like this film because someone is actually making a film on them. I think fake b-boys will hate this film because everything in this film is a power move, and for some reason, people who think of themselves as \"true\" artists want to keep it \"real\" (\"You can't just do power moves all day when you battle, you would receive no style or innovation points!!!\") If you're too serious, you won't like it and you should just not get served at all.

Fair enough, unless you like dancing you would i'm sure rather endure a couple of hours of severe torture, because that is what this film will probably be to you! On the other hand if you are a fan of dancing, particular break-dancing, hip-hop, popping & locking etc then the dance sequences and soundtrack will certainly somewhat erase from your mind the lack of any real storyline or believability to the movie. Let's start with the acting so my comment can only get better; to be the blunt the acting isn't just bad it's actually almost too cringe for words. The storyline seems to have gone into hibernation also along with any believable acting. So if it is a film with great acting in it you're after this really is not a good choice! As far as dancing goes, this movie certainly has its fair share of impressive dance sequences, serving up a whole load of innovative, unique and fresh hip-hop moves. If you are going to watch this movie for its merits as a dance movie (like i did) then you will not be disappointed as they are truly amazing in terms of choreography, the attack of the routines, the originality of some of the moves and sequences and also the effortless execution of them. The soundtrack is also pretty heavy with a couple of really good tracks that make you want to get up and dance such as \"Take It To The Floor\" and some really nice ballads like \"Out The Hood\". As a film looking from a non-dancer perspective this film does quite frankly suck but as a dancer looking at the film in terms of its dancing - in that respect the film is almost in a league of its own.",

I really do miss the golden age of movies since they didn't rely so heavily on sex, adult language, etc. They relied more on story and character development rather than overdose on special effects and corny dialog. Don't take this the wrong way; I love today's films such as The Matrix, Training Day, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, and Batman Begins, as well as others, but I feel many of them are rushed and not developed enough. Today's audiences want more than special effects and action, they want a more coherent plot and character development.

What matters is connecting dance sequence A to dance sequence B.  If they wanted to make a fantastic piece of cinema, they would've hired actors, not B2K.  You can't grade a movie like this on the same scale as other movies.  Is \"You Got Served\" gonna be on par with \"Lord of the Rings\", or \"Lost in Translation\", or any other movie released in the past year?  No, and it's not trying to be.  It has the focus where it counts, on the dancing, the sub-plots aren't important at all.  It has just enough plot to distinguish it from Darren's Dance Grooves, which is all it needs.Go see You Got Served if you like hip-hop or dancing.  Don't go see it if you're an overly judgmental, frequent cinema patron.You Got Served gets a 7/10 for a good dance battle movie, nothing more.",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner!  After staggering out of Torque last week, I was left wondering if things could get any worse.  They just did!  'You Got Served' is absolutely horrid- it barely resembles a movie. Movies tell a story; this was more like script Mad-Libs.If you haven't seen the trailers for this, count yourselves fortunate. The story is supposed to be about two friends, Elgin and David, who are in a competitive dance 'crew' who strut their stuff at a nightclub for cash prizes.  After many disjointed plot points utilizing lust at first sight relationships, a clich\u00e9 drug dealer, and the token 'drive-by', they enter a dance competition for $10,000 and a part in Lil Kim's new music video.Writer/ Director Chris Stokes (director of that all time classic 'House Party 4') should be hanging his head in shame.  In the place of actors he cast many members of the hip-hop group B2K; Omarion (as David), Raz B, J Boog, and Lil' Fizz (my spell-check is having a fit).  Ironically, a movie where one might say the theme is about sticking with your friends, the group has already broken up before the film has even been released.The dialogue and the way it was delivered was so bad that at times I was honestly wondering if this was supposed to be a farce and if it's supposed to be this bad.  I can only guess that people might enjoy this for the dancing.  There were, however, enough pelvic thrusts and crotch grabs in the first five minutes to make even Michael Jackson blush.The dance scenes as well as a few basketball scenes stand out as being very poorly shot.  With numerous jump cuts (where a camera cuts and the action from the next frame doesn't match up with the previous one) and many other cinematography errors one learns in Filmmaking 101, it's as hard to watch as it is to listen to. Every film has fans somewhere, so I suppose this one will as well.  I can't help but feel slightly dumber after wasting my time on this one.  I got served stupidity.  The only thing that is keeping this from getting the lowest 1/10 award is that it did make me laugh- at how pathetic it was.  I figure a 1/10 should make me cry at how pathetic it is.  A dismal 2/10 for 'You Got Served'.",

I am still holding out for a film that focuses on the culture without the hokey plots. The documentaries Style Wars, Rhyme and Reason, and Scratch are huge steps in that direction. If in the inevitable sequel they can just stick to the dancing and keep the clich\u00e9s to a minimum I may go see it at the movies instead of waiting for the DVD.The dancing however is a lot of fun and the finale is something to see. Regarding the DVD edition of the film, there are some pretty informative extras about the making of the film and an audio/video commentary which is a lot of fun as well. In this commentary we get to see members of the cast and crew as they watch the film which is displayed in a smaller window in the lower left hand corner. Fun stuff.I know the voters at large gave this a 1.6, but I don't think that is accurate. I am not saying this is West Side Story, but it is definitely better than 1.6. I gave it a 6 (an average based on a 10 for the dancing and a 3 for the story).",

Sure the plot was bad but this movie was in no way suppose to compete with Harry Potter. OK here's the movie plot... young dancers compete to win a dance contest, in the mean time they deal with teenage problems. This is a \"young teen movie\" not made for critical adults who are obviously to selfish to see if kids might like it. Guess what people, the movie was not made for you...

It was more a music video than anything. The story focuses on two poor black boys whose names I've forgotten who are so poor that they are forced to deliver drugs for the local mob boss.  They make their other money by competing in \"street\" dancing competitions, and they are \"the s---\".Now, some flaws come up in this plot...If you are so poor, you might want to make some money by getting a real jobIf you are so poor, its just a teensy weensy bit unrealistic that you have the newest cell phones hanging from your beltOther stuff happens...one boy takes the other boy's sister out, the other boy gets beaten up (in a sequence so stupid...well, Looney Toons have better effects), etc etc.  It's not really worth talking about.

That doesn't make sense right? Of course not and neither does your rebuttal to those that hate this movie so shut up! And now......the review.The whole thing is about two kids whose dance crew is challenged by some preppy wanna-be-black suburbanites who steal the crew's moves thanks to a treacherous friend named Sonny. Omarion and Marques's character fall out over Omarion dating Marques's sister and things get more problematic from then on. The acting is atrocious and the dance moves might be cool at first but get pretty mundane after a while. Omarion as well as Marques Houston cant act. Lil Kim looks like recovering heroine junkie and the attractive Jennifer Freeman(My Wife and Kids) is whiter than Jenny McCarthy. You can tell this was a vanity project for the suspiciously effeminate Chris Stokes. And it still bombed! If you're into a movie all about dancing then go right ahead but if you're looking for something more than a dull dance film with heavily edited dance scenes look elsewhere.

Don't think I didn't peel over laughing as some of the most horribly executed lines in cinema were delivered. Don't think I didn't almost pass out from laughter during the \"I'm-so-upset-I-must-dance-out-all-my-pain-in-the-rain\" montage. And don't think I didn't find it just a little bit hilarious when Wade Robson popped in at the end to deliver a laundry list of all the famous people he's worked for. I did. I did all those things.But I also realized that the main point of this movie wasn't to deliver Oscar-caliber acting performances that would move people to tears and have them fondly remembering Marques Houston's portrayal of Elgin for many years to come. I think what many people fail to remember upon seeing this movie is this: You Got Served is a DANCE MOVIE. So let's break that down: It is a MOVIE about DANCE. Simple enough. Look at the movie There's Something About Mary. That is a comedic movie. Given that categorization, one could safely assume that the point of the movie is to be comedic, which it was. The acting was also decent, so all around, it's a good flick.Now let's go back to You Got Served. Since it was a dance movie, it would also be safe to assume that the point of this movie was to portray dance. Did You Got Served do that? Oh yes, it did. The dance in that movie is phenomenal. The choreography is completely on point and innovative. Many of the extras in that movie are real life Los Angeles dancers and b-boys and b-girls. Take a look at the extras on the DVD. It shows how the opening sequence of the movie was shot- it was all in one take. They take you from camera to camera to camera while everyone just dances. It's phenomenal. And it's a true cinematic achievement in dance.Now am I saying that this excuses the shoddy acting jobs done by the actors in this movie? Of course not. The lines were laughable. The dialog was predictable. And you could see the ending an hour before it came. But I'm also saying that if you went into the movie You Got Served expecting a gritty expose on the underground dance scene with riveting performances, you came at the movie completely the wrong way. The way to watch this movie is as a dancer or just as someone who appreciates good dance. If you watch You Got Served with that in mind, I guarantee it will become a more enjoyable film than if you just rag on the acting.",

Now before I go any further I have to say that the moves were SICK. At the end of the movie the 'Matrix' move had me out of my seat.Now if they didn't say or do anything else through the whole 90 minutes of movie it just may have been 'almost OK'. But the so-called 'acting' was about on par with the so-called 'plot' - undeniably the worst I've ever seen. There is no explanation for about half the plot points, some of the worst dialog I have ever heard, no type of character development and no believable chemistry in the romance. It's like The two new 'Star Wars' movies. I could believe that George Lucas wrote and directed it, except there aren't enough digital characters.Meagan, Meagan, Meagan.... I reeeeeally hope that D.E.B.S. is good because along with 'Biker Boyz' and 'Ride or Die' you have been in my three worst movies this year....There are 2 reasons why I wasted time and money watching this movie:As a kid I loved 'Breakin' and I thought that this movie would have that kind of fun and energy. Also South Park dedicated a whole episode to ripping this film and I didn't believe that it could possibly be that bad.... Trey and Matt I was soooo wrong.Don't waste your time or money with this movie. Go find yourself a Missy Elliott video or three and you'll get the same dancing satisfaction without the nasty aftertaste.",

I'd give it a 9 out of 10 for the dancing parts, and a 3 out of 10 for the rest of the movie (believe it or not, the acting is not the absolute worst I've ever seen) so a happy average of 6 (in my \"break dancing fan\" opinion) is suitable.Conclusion: watch only if you like break dancing.",

There are so many points during this movie where you will be yelling at the TV & reaching for the remote because you won't be able to believe what you just saw.

Omarion is an excellent artist, but I think he should stick to his music and dance.In all honesty, a young child and think 'wow, they got skill', but even that young child would struggle to complement anything else.To sum it up, I will say the good points about this movie are the dance moves. The bad points are everything else! Waste of time, don't watch it, just check the trailer for the dance, and go on youtube!",

            "content": "Hip-hop has given us many things: bad music, appalling fashion, ridiculous names. But all of these crimes against humanity pale into insignificance when compared to You Got Served, a film so uniformly atrocious that it made me wish for nuclear war; we're a vile species and deserve to be exterminated with extreme prejudice \u0096 \"You got served, planet Earth! Pwned!\" For what it's worth (and it's worth less than nothing), You Got Served is about a couple of friends who want to win a dance competition. They want to open a recording studio or something with the money. But of course they have to dance to fulfil their dreams.Sweet Jeebus, is the dancing bad (and by bad I don't mean good). Kind of imagine the video to \"It's Like That\", only it's taken seriously and it goes on for ninety minutes \u0096 I've calculated that watching people in tracksuits spinning on their heads, grabbing their privates and spazzing like they've got Parkinson's is entertaining for approximately three seconds.I guess we're meant to be glad that these kids are settling their differences on the dance floor instead of, er, in da hood, but personally I'd have more respect for these kids if they were car-jackers and crack smokers. After all, gangsters are scum, but dancers are far worse. But I still can't get over the 'dance-offs'. Settling your differences by doing the robot may appear flamboyant, but instead it's merely retarded. (The old guy who runs these dance-offs actually makes this quote: \"Don't come up in here with all that disrespect\u0085 We settle it on the floor like men.\" With parent figures like that, no wonder these kids are adrift in an ocean of idiocy.) But mentioning gangsters reminds me that the film does indeed touch upon criminality. You see, our two heroes have to do some courier work so that they can raise money to make expensive bets (five grand in one case) on their dance competitions. Oh, the humanity! Damn The Man! You see what society does to dancers who just want to make a quick, off-hand five thousand dollar bet; it forces them into crime! But to be fair, one of the characters does scrounge a grand off of his grandmother. Wha-wha-what?!? Yeah, that's right, this mental-midget tells his grandmother that he needs a grand for a dance competition\u0085and she gives it to him! What planet are they living on? (And more importantly, can granny give me a grand too? I want use it as a stake in a circle-jerk.) But what makes me laugh the most about the film is the middle class obsession \u0096 the kids have very nice homes \u0096 with 'street'. Yeah, dance-offs are how they settle things downtown. Yeah, down there they settle their differences with effeminate dance routines. Honestly, do any of these characters believe a word they say? I mean, Lil' Kim pops up to judge the final dance-off, the one that will give the winners fifty grand and a chance to star in her latest video, and she practically orgasms when one of the crews (crews!) suggests that they take the final dance-off to the streets. \"Streets? Now you're talking. Alright everybody, we've decided to take it to the streets!\" Except they're in a studio and they're on MTV. And then a couple of seconds later there's this exchange: \"Y'all tear this mother up. I want you to get grimy and dirty. Straight street.\" \"How street d'you want us to get?\" \"You know how I like it, baby. Straight hood.\" Chinese babies with special needs speak more sense. But to cap it off, Lil' Kim then says, \"May the dopest crew win.\" May the dopest crew win? I think those are going to be my final words. Those are going to be the words I speak on my deathbed. I'm going to be lying there, dying of cancer of the rectum, and I'm going to turn to my family, and with disgust in my eyes and incredulity in my voice, utter, \"May the dopest crew win?\"But there are other linguistic horrors. \"Hey, y'all were off the chain tonight\", \"Y'all suckers just make sure you're there by sundown\" (Sundown?!? I feel like Larry David. \"By sundown? Is the posse going to come and get me?\"), \"You suckas got served\" and, best of all in my eyes, \"Go home and stop acting like a ho!\" And that's someone talking to their sister! Oh, and the same bloke says \"Don't disrespect me\" while grabbing his sister by the hair. Remember, this is one of the good guys! Oh, someone nuke this planet quick...",

Once you've read them both, put them in the correct order.1) One evening, they decided to put together the concept for their movie. They would have actors from two pop music groups to pose as gangsters, both with a dream of making it big in the dance/hip hop scene. They would cast the actors into two rival groups that would eventually double cross each other and fight until they reach a grand climax in the final contest between the two, where eventually, all is happy and the two bury the hatchet and ride off into the sunset. They believed that this would make a spectacular Summer movie and would gain approval from the public and it's target audience and be a sure-fire hit at the box office.2) A group of money hungry, corporate tossers, led by a clueless imbecile named Chris Stokes, decided to go completely out of their depth and try to make a summer blockbuster, after hitting about 20 shots of LSD.OK, Was your answer 2-1? Correct. You see, You Got Served is the sort of film that will be waiting for you down in the pits of hell. Satan will even give you a comfy chair and widescreen TV, as sitting on a bed of hot coals would be too much of a pleasant distraction.The only defence I'll have of this vile, pop marketed, hateful garbage is that it didn't deserve to top Manos the Hands Of Fate at number one when it did. Even after 40 years, Manos has no parallel in terms of badness. But it's still an awful movie that deserves the panning it received.Don't watch this film.",

It helped to start a trend around the U.S.  But as far as plot line goes...  I saw it the other day; and although the dancing was good, the plot was totally predictable.  The same goes for Flashdance.  Although people still have a connection with that movie.  They are constantly doing the \"where are they now\" segments for that movie.  And even though we know a dance double, and a man did almost all of Jennifer Beals' dancing moves, the movie remains popular to this day.  The same thing goes for Dirty Dancing.  The critics HATED that movie.  They thought the plot was formula and the only good parts were the dancing segments.  But people still love that movie.  In fact, I bought it a month ago, because at the time it came out,I was a sophomore in high school. For some reason we connected with that movie.  The plot IS formula, but we love it anyway.  \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\"  COME ON!!  But the dancing in that movie was something no one had seen before, and inspired a dance troop who toured throughout the U.S., just to dance to the music.  I see You Got Served in the same light.  Yes, the plot was formula, but the dancing was incredible.  My husband and I were falling out of our seats in awe.  We went to see it at 10:00 on a Monday night, and we were the only one's there... which was a good thing.  We were vocally commenting on the dance moves....\"WHOA\", \"OH MY GOD\", and \"DID YOU SEE THAT???\"  We couldn't help ourselves.  So, on this basis, I rated the film an 8.  It is no LOTR or Mystic River, but I would like to see Orlando or Kevin Bacon do some of those moves. Which brings to mind.... I should add Footloose to that list of \"Formula dance movies which we love\". :-)  Alisa",

Everyone has something to say about the overall story. People complain about lame action movies in the same way. Most of Jackie Chan, Jean Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal movies don't have a great storyline. But the story sets enough of a backdrop so what you came for; the action, will unfold. Its the same way with You Got Served. If you want to watch a movie where the dancing and the storyline were put together better, watch Stomp the Yard. The same dance choreographer, Dave Scott, worked on both films. Well, there is my two cents. I hope you decided to pick this up at Walmart or rent it at Blockbuster. I'm tired of people hating on this film simple because thestory lacked beef. The movie accomplished what it set out to do: update the urban dance genre.

Over an hour of my life was gone.\nThis movie is a decent attempt at a breakdancing movie (which doesn't say much) but falls short of other films in this genre. It features no plot and less than mediocore dance sequences. The problem with the dance sequences is the fact that they all lack originality. I was hoping to see dance sequences like the classic Michael 'Boogaloo Shrimp' Chambers broom sequence.Breakdancing films in the past have been enjoyable and full of laughs and great dance sequences from start to finish. The director of this movie, clearly did not recognize the golden breakdancing movie that started it all: Breakin'. With an all star cast (Lucinda Dickey, Adolfo 'Shabba-Doo' Quinones, Michael 'Boogaloo Shrimp' Chambers, Phineas Newborn III, Ice-T and even a guest appearance by Jeanne Claude Van Damme) and a riveting plot, Breakin' is a good recommendation for any fan of the breakdancing genre. See it instead of You Got Served if its not too late. Breakin' also featured rebellious dancers who wore Pink Floyd hats.Breakin' 2, even without Jeanne Claude Van Damme as an extra, is also a fantastic choice as its story (A developer tries to bulldoze a community recreation center. The local breakdancers try to stop it) is even better than that of its prequel. You'll Laugh, and cry as it (to me) was the most touching movie I have ever seen.You Got Served, does lack most of what Breakin' has, but the most disturbing part of it was the lack of Danny Trejo. Danny Trejo has appeared in movies such as Con Air and Desert heat, and would be ideal to play the parts of Vick or Rashaan.In conclusion, with an only partially charged Boogaloo, this movie is only watchable to a diehard fan of the genre.",

In this film, a popular LA dance crew from the \u0091hood is challenged to a $5,000 showdown by a rival crew from, of all places, Orange County.  Add to this a dash of gang violence, a dollop of puppy-love romance and an MTV-sponsored competition finale and you have the makings of a pretty standard youth-must-be-served flick.  A movie like `You Got Served' clearly exists for its dance sequences and little else.  The choreography is fine, I guess, but without an interesting story to effectively tie the routines together, even the dancing becomes tedious after awhile.  If you can look beyond the dull story and amateurish acting, you may enjoy `You Got Served.'  Otherwise, it's a loser's bet all the way.",

It's alright and because some of the mose electrifying and entertaining dance scenes ever it's pretty good.  The only time the film runs into problems is when they stop dancing which is quite a bit. The film sports very few few believable performances and some down out horrid ones. The dialogue is uninspired and uninteresting. And the thin plot is layered with cliched but conceivable melodrama. The film is about a group of poor boys in a dance gang whom decide to battle an opposing rich gang from another neighborhood for a sum of 50,000 dollars and the chance to appear in a Lil Kim video. And thats essetially it besides some pitfalls along the way including betrayal, family, death, etc. The usual ingredients in an urban set film. It's so weird how this type of film fits a certain genre and they just try to roll with it. Instead of inducing realism or creativity it in the end becomes contrived and just plain played out. But the film is by no means horrible. It is entertaining and almost suceeds at what it sets out to accomplish. Theres no real suprises here but overall it remains above average refusing to settle into the unwatchable dreck that they've released in the past. Just next time around some creativity and believability would be greatly appreciated.",

Look at Save The Last Dance, along the same plot, best friends break up, drive by's etc. The wost acting in this was by the character Wade and his patsy boy, but all the others were decent, and where else are you going to see Lil Kim in as much clothing as she was wearing ha-ha.

            "content": "This is a film with bad acting, stupid plot, terrible camera work, and is clearly just a promotional tool for these \"actors.\" And yet, it is amazing. AMAZING. AM. AZ. ING. Of course, I'm lying. But the movie has a few amusing reasons to watch.For an example of the acting and camera work chops on display in this film, look no farther than the scene with David and his girlfriend at a diner. She has an extended monologue, but the camera repeatedly cuts to David reacting to her. Instead of simply shooting the shot so it could have the semblance of an actual conversation, we are given about ten reaction shots of David not saying anything. And I mean that in the literal and figurative way, since he does not speak and translates nothing through his \"acting.\" The dancing scenes were pretty funny to me, but I don't give a sh*t about group dancing. Maybe they were really good. All I know is that I couldn't tell which dance group was better until the crowd applauded for them at the end of the competitions. And I could only tell then because Steve Harvey would tell us who got the louder applause. There is a character in the movie that is supposed to be a total dance master, but doesn't compete anymore, because he's all about the \"art.\" Now, of course, he has to dance at some point to show off how awesome he is... but I honestly could not tell him apart from any of the other dancers.I also liked the frequent references to doing things \"street.\" Whenever a dance was allowed to be \"street,\" or no-holds-barred, it looked a lot like all the rest of the dance routines. I guess \"street\" means \"heavily choreographed.\" Or maybe \"street\" is referring to the language in the movie. There are several moments where a character makes a pretty lame remark and everyone on the set reacts like the speaker was on Def Comedy Jam. The phrase \"oh, snap!\" would be fitting in most of these cases.What would have made this movie better would have been legitimate actors. Just imagine what this movie would be like if you replaced B2K with members of Kenneth Branaugh's Shakespeare films. Sure, the movie would have still been bad and had a dumb plot, but you would have gotten to see Denzel Washington and Keaunu Reeves doing MTV dance moves. And Jeremy Irons could play Steve Harvey's character! That would have been awesome!",

Jennifer Freeman and Marques Houston and Steve Harvey are the only half decent actors in this.Why oh why does Lil Kim have to be in this film? She frightens me so much.

People who are on the internet judge this by it's poor attempt at an inspirational plot, bad acting and corny clich\u00e9 dialog. The casual teenage group really enjoy this because they do not look closely for it's many flaws but instead pay close attention to it's \"in your face\" (Well what it tries anyway) attitude and the way these street wise locals can bust-A-move. This tends to fool them and makes the story seem more realistic and more interesting then it really is. Grossing less than 50,000,000 smackers in theaters worldwide this film would have been a bomb if it had a higher budget than the pitiful 12,000,000 it went on.Basic story, A couple of homies with their own high profile underground dance group find themselves in situation when their hustled out of $5,000 after a former member of their group betrays them. Already long time delivery boys of a black mob lord their friendship takes a turn when one of them accidentally blows off the other while out with his sister. Forcing to deliver the goods himself he is mugged and stripped of all of it. Now the rest of the group and some friends must try to get these two tight to win a \"big bounce\" competition for $50,000.Don't be fooled by what some people say, the dancing can be extremely entertaining. As said above the story, characterization, acting and dialog tries to fit in with all the hip hop attitude and just ruins itself on that note. It doesn't deserve the abuse it has received but just don't expect something too intelligent.",

Instead, it is directed to black teens and pre-teens and the filmmakers tried to put as many positive messages as possible into the movie.The characters explicitly say on the screen: don't cuss, train hard, go to school, don't put your hands on the girl, don't get involved with crime... etc etc. One poster complained about the violence--but come on! It's an extremely watered-down picture of life in the 'hood. I would rate this movie a PG, not even a PG-13. While the plot line is a knockoff from 8-mile, its closer comparison is Sesame Street! If you are a movie buff, it's easy to dislike the film, but movies like this should be made, and I am all too happy to see it do well at the box office.",

But me and my friend wanted to see what all the hype was about, after this got the #1 spot on the worst 100 list. Is it the worst movie of all time? No. Is it a bad movie? Absolutely. The film starts with a long dance scene and takes a while to get to any dialouge. All the dance moves are similar, and all seem extremely, for lack of a better word, ''flamboyant''. The camera work is nauseating, most of the shots were awful, and a lot of the time the camera just spun around, giving me a headache. There are a few good acting performances, but they were out shined by the razzie worthy acting, that the majority of the cast gave, in particular Christopher Jones, the leader of the O.C. crew, who's performance is so awful that it isn't even laughable, and is just downright annoying. The awful screenplay, done by the films director, Christopher B. Stokes, must have been a pain to spell check since every other word is, ''dat'', ''dis'', or ''y'all''. Stoke's characters are incredibly shallow, so it's hard to feel any emotion for anyone in the film, when Lil Saint was shot to death, I laughed out loud. All the characters are disgraces to their respected (our previously respected) races. The films only redeeming quality is, that it is funny for all the wrong reasons. If you and you're friends are looking for some good laughs, I would recommend this as a rental. I give it a 4/10.",

Just watch the dancing a boy you will be impressed it is bad ass! A friend of mine got it on DVD because, as a dancer, he wanted to see what it was made of. He is the most critical person of films and as you could expect he ripped the acting and directing to shreds (too right!) but the dancing, ah, his jaw was dropped! I totally agree with him. I now turn to my vote. Imagine, if you will, that the film is split like so; 1)acting, directing, editing and lighting (5) 2)Dancing and soundtrack (5) There we are half marks (for the dancing in case you weren't sure). Frankly id much prefer to think that the voting was all for the dancing and forget that anything else even figured then it would get a 9. If you are a fan of hip hop and break dancing, body popping, krumping etc then you will love the dancing. If only they had cut out all the other stuff it would be great. Thank God its on DVD cause now i can skip to the good scenes and not want to hide my self with shame wasting time watching what can only be described as a less than immature production. Next time just go to LA and film real crews on the streets (the acting will probably be better).",

So, they have to do to a type of \"Bring It On\" competion for a 50,000 dollar prize. In the middle of this they producers thought they had to throw in some BS that had to make us try and feel sorry for the characters. And some how, don't ask me how, all their problems dissapear and... well you know how it goes. The acting is terrible. It seems to me, even the title needs some work. And the dialouge is real deep to like, \"You suckas got seved\", and \"We gotta win, I'm tellin you man, we gotta for my mama\". And that's about as deep as it gets. Don't waste your money on this, please I am begging you. Rent \"Drumline\", because it is a hell of a lot better. Sorry guys, but hott dancing can't even save this film.1/5",

In this day and age, the acting vehicles used by music entertainers to break into the acting business are less than satisfactory i.e. Britney Spears in \"Crossroads\" or Lance Bass in \"On the Line.\"Already I knew the plot, as well as the acting, would be shoddy. I waited until my friends went to see \"You Got Served\" before seeing the flick myself. According to them, the dancing was amazing and \"Wade,\" the evil white rich kid, was hot and that his hotness was enforced by his cocky attitude and lack of screen time. By dancing more than he spoke Wade endeared himself to them, unlike Omarion, whose hot dance moves were overshadowed by his awful acting and atrocious kissing skills. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film but I'm sure my enjoyment was thanks in part to my low expectations. If you watch this movie only expecting to see amazing dance routines, you'll probably enjoy it too. My friends and I just watched it again on DVD and fast forwarded through the entire thing, only stopping when Wade spoke and for the dance routines. As a movie \"You Got Served\" is subpar, but if you were in the mood to see some amazing dance movies then you should give this movie a shot.Just fast forward through the acting and you'll be fine.",

I'm not a man found weeping, in a widow's arms or in the bleakest of situations among the social safety of isolation, but tears of happiness were willingly elicited from my long-dormant tear ducts and flowed gracefully down my tender cheeks to the tip of my chin without feeling as though I needed to wipe away the evidence in shame. Strange feelings stirred within me, and like a lonely watchman guiding them up the dreary, rust-stained steps of a lighthouse with his bright oil lantern, these feelings unfurled and sprang up to the top like a thousand butterflies fleeting their cocoons, gasping for air and awaiting the various pleasures and freedoms of their new life.

The dancing is beyond keen and is entertaining in itself.I'd like to think of \"You Got Served\" as more this era's \"Breakin\" than \"Body Rock\".

The acting in the movie was BAD.However, you kept bringing up that this and that is so clich\u00e9d but fail to realize that it's all apart of a lot of some people's everyday life. Yes, there are kids who really sell drugs to get by and kids who speak a lot of Ebonics and kids who get killed just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Also, I don't know exactly what you're trying to get at when you say \"clowning type of dancing\" because just like any other top of dance, hip hop and break dancing is and art form. Besides the stars in the movie they brought truly talented kids from off of the streets. Like most people i know(including myself) the kids from the movies don't need dance lessons they are born with the talent of the level of dance they do. I bet you couldn't do what they do what they did.I didn't agree with what you said about Steve Harvey being the \"big guest star\" . You said it like it was a joke and I actually think he was the best actor out of the whole movie . The movie was made to appeal to younger audiences and fans of b2k. Even though I agree with some of the things you said, i don't look at the movie as a piece of exploitation to the black race. The acting in the movie was bad but the plot is real life and happens everyday. Just because you were married to a black woman does not mean you know everything about the culture and just because you live another life that you may think is better does not give you the right to criticize someone else's because you haven't lived that experience and wouldn't know why their life may be the way it is. I do appreciate you trying to defend something you thought was wrong and had to do with race. Chris Stokes wasn't lazy in writing he just didn't know what he was doing because he is just a Manager not a Producer like he tried to be.

            "content": "After reading some reviews about this movie I was in no way planning to go and pay to see it, however one of my friends had it on DVD so I decided to borrow it and see for myself. What I found was a very thin plot and some terrible acting but some incredible dancing thrown in at times. I'm sure it was only the dancing that kept me watching all the way to the end and actually enjoying it and for this reason I gave it a 5 out of 10. For the most part it did not matter about the poor acting and script because this film (I'm sure) was made purely to entertain people and the dancing definitely did that. However, when there was supposed to be some serious/emotional acting, I found it almost unbearable to watch.Comparing this film to \"Honey\", which was also mainly about dancing, although the plot and acting in Honey wasn't amazing, it was much better than in You Got Served. This is why Honey received higher ratings overall although the dancing in YGS was actually better (in my opinion). Basically if you start to watch this movie with the mindset that it will be entertaining if you like to watch hiphop dancing but not expecting a high level of acting or a good script, you will enjoy it a lot more than if you are expecting an emotional and moving piece of drama.Overall - average",

I just had a problem with the plot. One more time, inner city kids are struggling to get \"out\" (of Baldwin Hills ?!?!?) and their only opportunity is through dancing, with a little drug trafficking on the side. None of these guys worked or went to school during the course of the movie. All they did was dance, move drugs, or play basketball; nice play on stereotypes! This movie had a lot of aggressive energy that was somewhat unnecessary and values I wouldn't subscribe to in my family, but, I'd watch it again though because the dancing is HOT!",

Well, yes, the acting was atrocious. But you have to give them credit for focusing on the dancing, of which they did an awesome job. For everyone who said the dancing sucked, I would like to see them try the routines that those people in the movie were pulling off so easily. Dancing, especially the hip-hop break dancing stuff they were doing, takes hours of practice and a great amount of effort. It is their job to make it look easy, because it really isn't.

You know how you can watch a good movie and notice something new to like about it every time? That's exactly how this movie is, except replace the words \"new to like\" with \"that doesn't make sense\". It's almost as if the screenwriters sat down with the expressed purpose of audience confusion.David is old enough to drive a car? His high school-aged girlfriend is actually a nurse who's going to college? One of his guy friends calls and he answers like it's a phone sex hotline?An added bonus was Marques Houston on MTV Cribs, he had the movie's poster framed in his living room. Pausing by it mid-tour, Marques looked up with deep, Raging Bullesque reverence, and said, \"...and this is the film I was a part of, You Got Served.\"All of this makes the movie near unwatchable, but that's the genius of it, because it's so bad that it's good.

The story is rushed and a lot happens in a short period of time which at times makes it a little confusing. However the one good thing in this film is the battles, some of which are not fully choreographed, but all of which make you want to be there in the crowd watching them happen. In the final part of the movie Lil Kim, Wade Robson and Lala make cameo appearances which do little to add to the quality of acting, but make Omarion and Marques Houston's acting look good.In short don't rent or buy this movie for the script, but do buy it for the dance sequences.

That's what you call an awful dance movie.You got Served, served its main purpose which is to show \"dancing\", just like it is. A person does not go and watch a dance movie expecting for an Oscar Awarding masterpiece. Yes, it is possible to do that, but if the dance movie is of a \"lighter\" kind, JUST CHILL AND ENJOY WILL YOU. Quit being so uptight.If you don't like dancing, that's your problem.

In an action movie there'll be a simple story to justify the shooting/violence/martial arts/whatever, in this movie the story justifies the dancing.If you are going to watch this movie, do so only for the dancing. Even though the dance scenes make up a relatively small portion of the movie, the quality is beyond doubt. After you've seen the dancing in this movie there's a good chance you'll find yourself trying to copy as many moves as you can. Acrobatics, popping, locking, \"robotics\", it's all there.Rent or buy this movie on DVD so you can skip from dance scene to dance scene because that's the only way to enjoy this movie. Watch the scenes, get inspired and start dancing!

The performances were nothing short of amazing and comprised of pure skill! How can so many be missing that? I've seen a lot of pure crap in my days and this movie simply does not compare. Sure some of the acting could've been better. But what movie doesn't have room for improvement? And okay the story line wasn't perfect. But there are few that are. I'm sorry but I have to give it at least 1.5-2 stars. I can't stop watching it. And there are a few scenes that I have to rewind and watch multiple times just because they are that good. Come on guys\u0085focus on the dancing!!! I think you should watch it again! AND I can't wait for the next one to come out (please have Oscar and Marty in it :) ).",

Everyone was so intense and into this movie it was great. the movie had everyone after it, talking about starting crews and wanting to hold battles. It probably sounds corny but not many movies move whole audiences to want to do something. You had a whole theater of girls boo at the screen when David (Played by Omarion) Kissed Liyah. That's classic. i thought it was really cute & you guys are over analyzing it. It was intended to entertain the audience and it sure as hell entertained everyone at 9:45 on 86st in NYC. It sold out 4 showings that i know of. so take what you will with this review. Thanks!",

Marques Houston ( best friend of main character) did an okay job being that he has previously acted on the sister sister sitcom and he has more experience.  But to sum this up the dances were nothin like i have ever seen before andi'ma good dancer.  Very creative, very energetic and professional.  I recommend this movie to old, and young, Old skool, and nu skool dancers.  This was so good i gotta go see it again.  It's a classic, definitely a buy on DVD.",

Now i think we need to start a petition to get Corey Haim back in the film business. His role as Joseph In u got served was extra satisfying. Now some people might say that an asteroid will never hit earth however i disagreee, mortal kombat is a great game however donkey kong is nowhere near as good. No i didnt i spelled liking correct tony. tony is such an idiot. tony say hi. HI im gay and my name is tony. hahah tony said he was gay. No i dint. really then i must of said that u said i was gay.

He looked so good in that movie. Another person who looked good in that movie was LIL FIZZ! He sounded and looked cute. Raz B also looked okay in the movie, but to tell the truth the only good part about that movie, was the dancing. The worse part was that first kiss Omarion gave to Jennifer Freeman.

The choreography are just breathtaking and the dancers are really good. We can see the battle on different angles which makes a really nice effect and gives the choreography a lot of punch. Plus, acting is actually not bad at all, but again, it's not a movie based on the acting either. I'm a dancer myself and i really think that it's a masterpiece in Hip Hop dancing.",

The cinematic references contained in this movie are ridiculous...Purely off the chain, as it were. The obvious connection to West Side Story stands out, but the films The Godfather, Amadeus, Seven Samurai, and of course the classic Bring it On are not forgotten. The acting in this movie was clearly superb. Clearly. And the script unbelievable. UNbelievable. I felt enthralled from beginning to end, from the introduction of the characters to the characters' strategic uses of the phrase 'Tonight, YOU got served'.Also, the connections between this movie and the wonderful television program 'Sister, Sister' are unbelievable in scope. First, Jackee Harry appeared in both productions, though her role in 'Sister, Sister' was much more revealing of her acting talents. Her smaller role in 'Served' took a backseat to Marques Houston's grade-A performance as Elgin, troubled teen and part- time 'server'. In short, this film will deliver. You will NOT be disappointed.

Let's give credit where credit is due though. The dancing one word......amazing. But that is where it ends. Watching this movie made me feel like I was taking a sightseeing tour with an ADD tourguide. One word for the writer of this movie......Ridlin. I hear it does wonders for your concentration. The plot had so many holes in it I wondered if Mr. Stokes kept forgetting that he was writing a movie. The main reason I watched the film is because I had heard that was unlike any other dance film out there. I mean come on how many other films have their actors dancing in the rain and water? Well let's see Flashdance, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, etc... And this movie had inner struggles for the characters just like EVERY other dancing movie. Warning spoilers ahead (Trust me, read the spoilers bypass the movie it will be a better use of your time). What I can't understand is how Elgin's sister got into Princeton yet she couldn't afford to go. Isn't her older brother the one that just came up with 5 grand to enter a dance challenge that they lost anyway? I mean come on, he doesn't even have a job. Except for dealing what I suppose are drugs (but we are not sure since Stokes never fully explained it) for a biggie wanna-be. And what about 'LiL' Saint. He gets killed while he is riding around with his friends and their car gets sprayed. The boy is like 8 years old. What 8 year old hangs around with kids old enough to have a car? Basically they just killed off a kid so they would have some reason for El and David to get back together to win the competition. Cause I could see no other reason for the two to ever remain friends. Call me crazy but if my friend leaves me high and dry and I get the snot beat out of me it would take more than dance competition for me to forgive him.All in all I will give this movie a 2 out of 10. Personally I would have rathered Mr. Stokes skipped the plot and just made a 2 hr music video because the dancing and the music is the only thing that helped this movie.",

The plot was lame, the storyline was bad, the direction was awful, and the acting was probably the worst I have seen.I was particularly disappointed with the extremely wooden acting by Jennifer Freeman who usually does a great job as the older daughter Claire Kyle in \"My Wife And Kids\". In \"You Got Served\" she looked extremely uncomfortable playing the role of Liyah. It seems she is much better at playing a clean cut daughter of a suburban upper-middle class family, than the daughter of a working class single parent.However there is ONE reason why I would still go and buy this movie on DVD - the dance scenes. The choreography was off the hook. At the end of the movie, although we were totally bagging the film out ... my friends and I were pumped up enough to want to go find a club to have a dance battle in.I think I'd give the movie 1/5, and the choreography 5/5",

I can't say that it was one of 2004's best movies,but anyways it is worth seeing it.\"You Got Served\" it's a teen movie,perfect to see in a Friday afternoon with your friends,just before going to disco because it makes you wanna move your body in the club.It has all:good soundtrack(M.O.P.-Ante Up is wild),killer dance moves,interesting characters(Lil'Kim,the B2K,Wade Robson)so all in all,i consider it being if not a good movie,at least a pleasant and nice movie.So,to everybody who hasn't see it yet and hears from everybody it's a bad movie,watch,you won't regret it.",

            "content": "OK, so we get the point...it was a bad movie. But I think y'all just a lil too harsh. The acting was indeed the worst I've seen, but some of the things I've seen y'all say are just uncalled for. The dancing is not repetitive(sp). It's just the style they use that may seem like you continuously see it. But seriously, the dancing was hot. And to the person who trashed the statue thing, that was one of the best moves of the movie. It was not stupid. I bet if you were in a dance contest you wouldn't have even thought of coming up with that. Once again I'll say, the acting was straight up horrible. I could've come up with that plot. Heck, my ten year old sister could have. I'll even say my eight year old cousin. I can't stand Christopher B. Stokes anyway and this movie didn't help me like him anymore in any kind of way. I agree about everything you've said as far as the acting and the movie itself is involved, but the dancing was excellent. I'd give this movie a 2 just because of the dancing. In short, if you are not a dancer, you will not appreciate this movie. If you don't like B2K, you will not appreciate this movie. If you don't have a high tolerance for bad acting just to see the dancing, you will not appreciate this movie. My advice to those who are still curious, but not willing to spend money on even renting the movie, find someone with a bootleg, fast forward through the acting and just watch the dancing. That's the best part of the movie.",

The talent of these dancers is just amazing not like any old Joe bog. Anybody who says they are not good must not understand the art of dance. Street dancing is one of the greatest forms of dancing.The bad guy in the movie is an example of a typical robber. The crew would have been devastated to find that their moves and been stolen and to be led in by one of their members. This is a great movie for all to see.An inspiration to all dancers young and old.",

I see this movie all the time and it still gets me excited. And for all those haters out there that said this movie was awful, don't listen to them. They are just mad that they can't dance like that. Also, this movie does have a plot. Its just that some people are so ignorant and snobby, that they can't see it. I bet if this movie hadn't had all the \"gangster\" people in it and had the \"hillbillies\" instead, people wouldn't say it was bad. But those are just haters.

You Got Served, is like many said, a movie about cool music and dancing. But it DOES have a meaning to it. You Got Served inspires you to go out and try a new hobby. You Got Served is great for relaxation. Most of all, You Got Served is a heartwarming movie about FRIENDSHIP. The story tells about a group of friends who share a same hobby (dance battling) and how they pull through hardships of living in the ghettos of California. The first difficulty comes with Sonny's betrayal, which puts a breach in their friendship. This loss of a friend causes them to do bad in the battle and lose $5k to Wade's Crew. Then David fails to meet Elgin about Emerald's drug run. Elgin ends up getting jumped and the two become upset at each other. Meanwhile, Wade's Crew is out winning battles, while the two separated friends go through hardships of their own. In the end, friendship pulls through and David and Elgin succeed in achieving their goals. How many times has friendship been underrated in our daily life? This movie teaches us to appreciate our friends, because if you don't, then you'll regret it when you lose them (RIP Lil'Saint). All of you who rated You Got Served a 1 need to go back and understand the true meaning behind the movie. FRIENDSHIP.",

They should make a U Got Served 2 and add more drama between Wayne and add more less drama between Omarion and Houston. In You Got Served 2, they should add more tough moves to make the audience in aw. They should Get Krump in the movie also, because this is a new dance move. They should add Tight Eyes as the krumper and add him in David and Ele's crew to beat Wayne's crew.",

By the way in the first dance in the film David(omari,B2K) does a back-flip against sum1 else's chest.that wasn't choreographed,Omari was filming and he did that back flip and everyone ran off set because it was so amazing. so to everyone that thinks it is crap obviously doesn't like dancing,and doesn't enjoy hip-hop films,if you think the acting crap maybe you think that because there is a type of acting which is used in hip-hop films where they are not anything like Naomi Watts(the ring),Lindsay Lohan(mean girls) Hilary duff(Cinderella story)",

It has its niche in Hollywood and i think just because of the heavy slang and pop culture this movie gets its bad rap.

Obviously if there are black celebrities in the movie there are going to be dialogue maybe you wouldn't necessarily come across, and the dancing isn't going to be that off 'top of the pops'.

Plus, I am surprised because they are still under contract with me. I love all of you and all of the fans out there. Please pray for B2K.\" The statement is actually longer than this, but the line about the contract creeps in at the end, a detail that, oh dear, must have slipped the minds of his erstwhile son-like clients. (Omarion, for his part, has retreated from initial upset at the walk-out, telling MTV News he'd like to \"get back together\" with the others, following his solo projects, because \"I think people would enjoy it.\") The tumult has certainly been immense for the famously enthusiastic B2K fans.

            "content": "In seeing a poor review of this movie that i felt did not give it justice at all, i was compelled to write my own. It's no classic but if you're into Hip Hop music and appreciate dancing of any sort you'll find this movie entertaining to say the least! The plot is basic but the great soundtrack and amazing dancing make up for that big time! There are no Oscar winning performances but keep in mind the stars of this movie are primarily singers/dancers and the dancing is meant to be the star of this show. It's a teen movie but still creative and unique in it's own right. If you liked the movie \"Honey\" starring Jessica Alba this movie is a must see! It's got the same vibe.. the same attitude.. and it's all about the dancing. It may even inspire you to take up dancing lessons.. or at least buy the soundtrack and dance in your bedroom to your own style.",
