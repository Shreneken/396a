            "content": "Here are my hastily-prepared excuses: I promised my daughter I'd baby-sit for her son from 11 AM to 4 PM. It was cool and overcast and rain was predicted. I didn't want to go to a park... and after lunch, when I mentioned \"Superbabies,\" the deal was struck!Background: My grandson fell in love with superheroes this year, and he has been alternately garbed as Spiderman and Superman, as well as a pirate complete with eye patch and skull-and-crossbones hat. His favorite possession is his plastic sword! Yesterday, going to the movie, he asked me if I could get him a parrot to sit on his shoulder! He loved the movie and gave it two \"thumbs up\" (both his)! So, if you have an almost four-year-old, it might work for you. Otherwise, forget it. I paid $10.50 for both of us (one senior and one child) and slept through this movie.",

            "content": "I was expecting this movie to be bad, and it was even worse than I expected. I have seen some truly terrible movies in my time like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and any of the Friedburg-Seltzer movies. But Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 brings the phrase \"terrible movie\" to a new level. And believe me, that is being kind about this piece of garbage. I am truly not surprised that it is in the bottom 100, it deserves to be there. That is how bad it is, and it highly deserved the 4 Razzie nominations it received. If you thought the first movie was bad, and it was, this is even worse. Sorry if I sound harsh, but I am trying to be honest.The dialogue was absolutely excruciating. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a six year old. It completely lacked sophistication and humour. And guess how many times I laughed during this movie? You guessed right, not even once! The plot was lazy, uninspired and clumsy. The idea of a media mogul wanting to dominate the world? How many times has this being done before? Loads, and much better might I add. The direction was sluggish and never reached its focus. Even worse than the dialogue, direction and plot were the fight sequences. How tedious were they? Very, not to mention very inappropriate, even for a family movie.The performances from the entire cast were exceedingly poor. Jon Voight has pulled off some good performances in the past. However, I truly think he was held at gunpoint to star in this mess. And he gives the worst performance of his entire career here, acquiring a simply dreadful German accent that has to be among the worst ever accents in film history. It was worse than his accent in Anaconda, honestly there were times when I couldn't understand what he was saying. The other performers weren't that much better either, Scott Baio especially was wasted. And the child performers were misguided, they just couldn't do anything with the script. And I do apologise here, but I don't think babies trying to behave like adults is cute or funny in the slightest.Even the camera work was next to abysmal, nothing more than flat and rushed. Shame really, because there was one or two nice bits of scenery. In fact, the only real half decent element of this this otherwise abysmal film was the music, and even that was forgettable at best. All in all, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was nothing more than a piece of garbage, that was the low point of Jon Voight's acting career. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again, just call Jon Voight. Yeah, the same Jon Voight who won an Academy Award as best actor in 1978 for \"Coming Home.\" The star of \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Catch-22\" and \"Conrack\" -- you know, Angelina Jolie's dad.Why bother Mr. Voight? Well, considering that he's lending his name to \"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2,\" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.In case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in \"SuperBabies,\" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in, instead of \"Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid\" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first \"Anaconda\" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows, then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original \"Baby Geniuses.\" Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner, it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel, of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.So here he is, ladies and gentlemen, outfitted with not one, but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane, a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made, insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly, Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry, Leo and Myles Fitzgerald, who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case, and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming, it's \"a small fry with a big attitude\" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as \"Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?\" and \"Never send a man to do a boy's job.\"Kahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler, in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections, too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg, the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town, or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that \"every child has power -- all you have to do is believe,\" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.There are other four SuperBabies, too, and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons, this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel, where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown), Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead), Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).Watching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel, as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed, and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin, who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.As was the case with \"Baby Geniuses,\" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If \"SuperBabies\" is marginally better than the excruciating \"Geniuses\" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.By the way, Voight's next project is called \"The Karate Dog,\" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex, Pat Morita and Chevy Chase, who'll provide \"the voice of Cho-Cho,\" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really, the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks.",

            "review_title": "I'd rather gargle with hydrochloric acid than see a \"Baby Geniuses 3\"!",
            "content": "Okay, the first movie from this series \"Baby Geniuses\" was so poorly received that reviewers were beside themselves castigating the film. It currently is ranked #73 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Yet, astoundingly, the film led to this even worse sequel--\"Baby Geniuses 2\"! This sort of sequel is a prime example how some people in Hollywood just need to get real jobs...or at least stop doing LSD! Unlike the first horrible piece of garbage that is \"Baby Geniuses\", this film manages to be significantly worse for several important reasons: 1. It is totally unoriginal. While \"Baby Geniuses\" was dumb, it was somewhat original and perhaps the film makers naively thought the film would sell. Here, however, they knew they were producing a giant stinky diaper of a film from the onset--following the horrible drubbing the first film received--and yet they STILL made it!2. \"Baby Geniuses 2\" has some of the absolute worst computer work I've seen in a recent film. The babies are horribly dubbed as their computer generated lip movements didn't match--and in some cases looked really creepy.3. Jon Voight managed to do a much, much worse job as the villain compared to the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner in the original. That took LOTS of effort! Lots and lots and lots of effort!4. A ninja baby! While one of the babies in the original film did some karate here and there, here we have an honest-to-goodness ninja baby--complete with ninja mask and insanely ridiculous wire-fu stunts.5. Two words about the second film that say it all...SCOTT BAIO! 6. Even more pop culture references that no child would understand. Considering that 99.9% of the people who actually wanted to see the film were children, this is a serious problem.7. The @&*$ kids talk and talk and make commentary on EVERYTHING. It's like going to a movie with an annoying kid sitting next to you who thinks he's the host of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and talks throughout--but in reality, he is just an obnoxious child who won't shut up. PLEASE shut up!!! SHUT UP!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!! 8. Gadgets! Unlike the first film, this one gives the ninja kid all kinds of super gadgets, such as a car like the Batmobile that spouts flames out the back, a James Bond-like mini-copter and Dick Tracy communication devices.9. The ninja baby has his own version of the Bat Cave--complete with holograms and Willie Wonka-like accessories.10. In many ways, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" is like the first film merged with \"Spy Kids 2\"--another bad kids film. It manages to combine the worst qualities of each! 11. The ninja kid is a Buddhist with super-powers. As a result, now nearly 1 billion Buddhists worldwide also hate this film. Instead of offending this religion, they should have attacked a fringe cult like the Movementarians.12. A romance between two teenagers that just seemed a bit creepy. Seeing two teens kiss who look a lot younger than their actual age made me feel a bit queasy. My 19 year-old said she felt the same.13. For the cost of \"Baby Geniuses 2\", they could have funded ten independent films...or more. While this isn't a huge budget film, it cost a lot of money for the special effects. What a sad waste.14. Towards the end of the film, several babies sprout super-powers. One is like Superman and can fly, one shoots magic arrows, one is a giant bouncy ball (how that can come in handy against the villains is anyone's guess) and one is \"Brain Boy\" (whatever that means).15. The last 10 minutes...oh, does it suck! No, it Mega-sucks! 16. The end of the film rips off Bogie from \"Casablanca\"--what sorry sacrilege.Overall, this is truly a horrible film. While there might be films that look crappier or have worse production values, the fact that this one DOES have a decent budget and production values yet is this thoroughly horrible makes this an amazing film. Clearly, it deserves to be on IMDb's infamous list! At one point, one of the babies make a comment that would be the perfect description of this sequel--\"Oh no, I'm feeling nauseous again\".",

But what I did not like was, too much time in baby world, lack of character introductory, the four babies in-film are supposedly supporting roles, due to them being sidekicks of Kahuna.

This film is not campy or cheesy bad, it's just plain boring bad - the worst kind of cinematic experience.I guess my reason for writing a review of a movie this bad several years after its release is this - Parents, if you're looking for family-safe entertainment, you can do better than this type of film. Your kids are smarter than this. If they're young enough not to mind sitting through this film, then they are too young to enjoy any kind of movie anyways. For family-safe entertainment you can never go wrong with just about anything made by Pixar. Pixar knows how to make films that use CGI to accentuate already good plots and interesting characters, not as a substitute for them.As for this film, it makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane. 20 years from now if there is a \"Mystery Science 4000\" to replace the now defunct MST3K, I'm sure this film will be one of the featured objects of ridicule... if the poor robots can stand the torment of sitting through it.",

The so-called plot revolves around some evil media mogul named Biscane(played by Jon Voight)with some wacky scheme revolving around mind control on kids through the TV screen. The baby \"geniuses headed by Kahuna plan to take on Biscane and cheesy hijinks ensue. The plot is horrible and the acting is just as bad. Scott Baio should have bowed out gracefully since Charles In Charge went off the air but no he chose to be here. Jon Voight usually shines even when he is in a bad movie but here he hams it up like its going out of style. Plus Jon Voight being in this movie shows you how far some actors are willing to go for a pay check. I mean doesn't he and Christopher Walken have enough pride to not star in the trash films they starred in? The jokes are why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road corny but it seems that the director believes that a crappy jokes are funny when it comes from toddlers. WRONG! Crappy jokes are still crappy jokes even if it comes from children. What kind of milk you drinkin? Who wrote this script? the writers of Howard The Duck? If you like this movie you are the moronic target audience. This movie is bad enough to make a kid cry and as a matter of fact, I let my niece watch it and she was bored to tears. No, I'm not being mean-spirited, this movie is not even so bad its good. Its so bad its terrible. Only a shill could recommend this atrocity to celluloid. Jon Voight should fire his agent and Scott Baio should quit while people still have fond memories of him. Two Thumbs WAAAAAYYYYYYY down!",

Sure I went to an after party, but only to call a cab which didn't show up for over an hour. It was not pretty at home today.  My punishment- take my 5 year old daughter to see this dreck.\n Bob Clark is almost in the Ed Wood category with his body of work. Although, I must admit I really liked \"A Christmas Story\".  But this film was truly one of the worst films I've ever sat through.  What was Jon Voight thinking when he accepted this role.  Surely it couldn't have been purely financial.  The guy has had a lot of paydays over the years.  \nThere were a few young couples in the audience without their kids too.  Man, that freaked me out.  They didn't even walk out.  That's scary.  They can vote.  No wonder Bush is our president.  I wonder what they did last weekend.  Go to the Yu-Gi-Oh movie.  That's what I'm betting on.  It's a scary world out there.Oh and even worse, the ending set up a sequel.

I had to sit through this garbage while watching some kids one day, and I knew this movie wasn't good when even the kids lost interest a few minutes in. There are movies where the kids get into the action, they cheer on the good guys, or they involve themselves into the movie. Not this one. Superbabies entertained none of the kids, and left me wondering how this movie ever left the boardroom where the script was written. The movie did solve one question that had been burning inside of me for a while: Where has Scott Baio been? Here, he plays a father of one of the babies and director of a new daycare center that may or may not be integral in the plot to take over the world by the diabolical Biscane (Jon Voight). I can understand Baio being in this movie, he hasn't really been in demand of late. But when I see Voight perform in this movie, I wonder to myself \"Why?\" He's done some good work of late, notably in Holes and National Treasure, and then he plays some sort of super villain with a bad German accent who is derailed by 2 year-olds. He'll bounce back, he has to. The babies in the movie, who are supposed to be the stars, looks freaky to me. The voices do not sync up with the movie lips at all. I think the characters in South Park have better synchronization than these babies. And the movie is not funny either. Again, I go to the kids, where I noticed none of them laughed at all. Instead, they all wanted to read, or draw, or take a nap, or do their laundry. Anything to escape this movie.",

I suggest IMDb add zero to the rating system for seriously unwatchable movies such as this one.Superbabies has made a thing of filming some toddlers, then adding poorly synced voice-over to make them \"talk\". Turns out, this is not inherently funny, in fact, it's mostly annoying. To not just make a movie about a couple of babies having a nonsense conversation, they make the toddlers do things, by the use of some pretty lackluster special effects, not bad enough to be funny and not good enough to be believable, just bad.\u00a0And what do the film makers do with these walking, talking babies? They have them be the main characters of the most annoyingly anti-funny, excruciatingly inane action comedy I have ever seen. Example 1: The \"evil henchmen\" (my heroes) have cornered the main character, but instead of shooting him (and ending the movie early), they engage him in stupid comedy fist fight. Example 2: When the \"good guys\" (the villains in my book) manage to steel the CD of doom (or whatever) from the evil mastermind, they don't just destroy it (and end the movie), instead they have another \"comedy\" fight over it. Unfunny slapstick action starring babies, repeated in ad nauseum seems to be the recipe for this entire film.I actually felt slightly sick while seeing this movie, I implore you, don't make the same mistake I did, see any other movie than this one, heck it could even be another movie off the bottom 100 list.",

Taking a copy of the DVD, setting it on fire, smashing it with a hammer, and throwing the pieces left over into a volcano is less than the true fate this movie deserves. I can call it any name I want to. In the end though it will defeat me with just how awful it is. If you got the strongest critics in the world together to watch five minutes of this they would rip their own eyes out in two. Well I should stop talking about how bad it is and get into what makes it bad. First off the acting just awful. Even John Voight an Oscar winner delivers one of the worst performances in movie history. Everyone simply makes me sick. The worst ones are the voice actors for the babies. They give by far the most annoying performance ever put to film. You could take Jar-Jar, the live-action Italian Pinnochio, everyone from Troll 2, everyone from Manos, and Eddie Murphy in 98% of every movie he is in together and it wouldn't be as bad. They have voices that make nails on a chalkboard sound like Motzart. They sound like they are the kids of whoever possessed Regan in The Exorcist. (Exorcist 2 never happened) Then we have the effects. They are pitiful. They are just so bland and lousy that it refuses to be comprehended. When you get to this colorful secret lair later in the film it feels so lifeless for some reason. Action scenes are more about annoying as hell puns in this movie then a sense of actual fighting that feels like fighting. It leaves you yawning at how boring it is. I know that it is supposed to be kid friendly, but Spy Kids has more tension than you and it wasn't even trying to be suspenseful. Fighting is so bland in this movie that it feels more fun to watch people throw punches at the air. Also the effects on the babies mouths is simply atrocious. Then we get to the real reason why this movie fails. The story is a joke. A deaf blind monkey that is drunk, high, and born with no legs or arms could right something better than this. Four babies work with superbaby to stop a man from taking over the world. If you haven't slit your wrists yet you are really strong. As for dialogue it is mostly made up of this. Annoying baby conversations, moron adults, moron villains, 16 year old exposition about babies. Kill me please!!!! The director of this died in a car accident after this. As you can tell by this movie it was most likely karma or intoxication after a day of shooting. (Yes I am aware that he made A Christmas Story, but that does not make up for this) This movie aims low, crashes, and burns to death. It is a movie that was shot on 30 million, but it looks like it was shot on 300,000. It is so bad that even if you want to bash y0ourself don't watch it. I wasn't that mean on movies before this. If a movie was bad I would say it was bad. Now after this I see in awfulvision. When I see a movie that is really bad I force its head in the dirt and watch it die slowly.

Biscane plans to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the minds of everyone in the world, using the television to broadcast a children's programme with seemingly microscopic orders and commands.

It's 0 on a lot of the review aggregators on the Internet and that's basically what I believe. I saw this on HBO in 7th grade and laughed at some of the scenes, but as I got older, I was like, \"Why in the hell did Bob Clark make this?\" You wanna know why? He couldn't make another \"Porky's\" or \"A Christmas Story\" because for one thing, we love those films! He wants to go back to his She-Man days of the 1960s! Did he just pick up some retard's script and say, \"That's an Oscar-winning film?\" Probably. Mac and Me is better than this piece of crap and so is Leonard Part 6! Those are classics compared to this! Ishtar is better and should win all of the Oscars! Save us from this hell! Score: 0/10!",

I hate how they combined actual events, like war in Germany, in this movie's story. Did the writers actually believe this would get better ratings if people saw something from \"The Great Escape\" in this movie except with babies as prisoners? Maybe they thought people would say, \"Awww, how cute. A baby as a prisoner.\" Rugrats is definitely better than this. And it was just stupid how babies surpass adults in knowledge and intellect while they still crap their diapers and cry. And I forget, wasn't there a bad guy who wanted to take away nap-time? Really stupid. If they're \"super babies\" then they don't need naps. The writers probably over-exaggerated and thought that they should combine every important element of a genius but still have silly baby characteristics. I wonder if they saw the Justice League and said, \"How about the Justice League as babies? Ingenious!\" I even remember someone saying they WANTED to see this movie and all I could think was that they had to have been completely dumb. This movie couldn't have been made any worse.",

As a one time Oscar winner this is a pretty steep drop for Voight. Next step down is porn . Voight plays a Nazi type character with brain washing on his mind and to do this he goes to a Daycare(?) center run by Chachy(Scott Baio) One of the babies lives in a funky cave situated behind the Hollywood sign that is filled with junk left over from SpyKids 3 . The first BG made like a nickel throughout its theatrical run this one will probably do the same it has tax write-off written all over it.

Beneath the plot lie morals and lessons that can apply to all. I don't want to give away any spoilers but it should be noted that the ending is not to be missed! I bought the DVD to watch with my son not expecting much and I was blown away. The cinematography is such that it actually appears that the babies are talking! As if that were not enough, the special effects put you right in the action as if you were one of the baby geniuses fighting the evil forces of Kane (Voight)!

Whoever gave this stinker the greenlight should be hung, drawn, and quartered, or hog-tied, pushed down, into, some snake water. Some of you may remember a pleasant scene in Baby geniuses, wherein a Baby wearing a tux knocks out a hobo who requests some change. The homeless schmutz, who lands in a toilet stall, closes his eyes, as if unconscious, and then decides to open them, as though he didn't realize that the film was still rolling. Well, no surprise! Baby Geniuses 2 contains equally bad, if not worse material, such as a baby who fires cupid's arrows to create love between evil corporate goonies, or a baby in a beachball, who bounces from one end of a room to another, without any physical harm, nor mental damage. Of course, a terrible movie would be nothing without its star, and who better to create this horrible steaming pile than Jon Voight, aka Angelina Jolie's father, of Midnight Cowboy fame. I seriously can't imagine who even came up with the storyline for this movie without bursting out with a combination of laughter and indigestion. 1 star is too gracious for this movie. Maybe just maybe Jon Voight might be able to pull his act together before they decide to make a Baby Geniuses 3: The diaper that rash'd New York.",

To be honest, it's actually better than the first in the fact that it doesn't have a dated 90's feel to it, and the bad, corny jokes are... at least a bit better, even though there's even more than the first.Quick overview of the plot: Old man wants to run brainwashing TV station but a bunch of babies stop him. That bit of a plot alone is so mind- numbing; but in all truth, the true demographic [4-8 year olds] don't go for detail. To make up for it, adult jokes are dispersed cringingly.With a 20 million dollar budget, half-baked special effects are thrown everywhere, tinted with mediocre lip-syncing. They started work on this movie in 1999, and for five years of time, the visuals of this movie look like the byproduct of a crayon-eating toddler, mixed with delicious oversaturated colours and eye-bleeding contrasts. The sets are ridiculous, the way it's shot is messy, and it feels more like if a Spy Kids movie were done even more horribly wrong than they were.I'm giving this a 4 because it could use something closer to the first, and it's not as terrible as a Friedberg-Seltzer movie or the like.",

The contrast was pretty startling, and demonstrated the huge difference between a commercially produced, large budget disaster like this and quirky, extremely low budget, foreign oddities like the kind featured on MST3K. Those low budget gems, for the most part anyway, had some creative spark behind them that went wildly awry. Stuff like \"Monster A-Go-Go\" was put together by small groups of people who at least cared about what they were putting together but had no idea how.Having said that, Superbabies is a whole different animal. It's coldly calculated to appeal to 5 year olds and somehow still misses the mark. I know kids don't mind disjointed action as long as it's flashy and fast paced, but there's too much going on here that makes absolutely no sense. There's this really creepy, drawn out back-story about how the King Baby, Kahuna, is actually an old man trapped in a child's body. Not only is it disconcerting and weird, but I can't imagine a small child following all the labored exposition getting us there.In fact, the babies themselves don't really do anything. They just stand around in diapers while Kahuna and the adults bray like jackasses and make fools of themselves in the most irritating ways possible. Like Jon Voight, who can't even be bothered with a passable accent. Anyone remember the MST episode \"Angels Revenge\"? Where Jim Backus was playing a right-wing militant and you didn't believe it for a second while he puttered around, painfully phoning it in with a look of horrified embarrassment? That's Jon Voight in this film. He produced the first one for some God-unknown reason, and I guess he felt compelled to try and salvage this one.All that said, it's pretty fascinating how poor this is. Everything looks so lazy and sloppy, like everyone just shrugged and said \"screw it, it's Baby Geniuses for Christ's sake, who cares?\" The Bubble Baby in the orange ball suit has a particularly horrendous CGI effect he's plastered into toward the end that had us all crying out in outrage over how lame and lazy it was.

And the target audience was us kids so why would they care. But i still do get that nostlagic feeling when thinking of that rewatch, but it would be better.I think that if the story had more realism and more emotion. It would feel alot better, like if maybe the adults were just normal adult but not the stupid ones in the movie, then it could in someway convey the message about egoism and adulthood. And if they added a tiny bit of serious moments and ,maybe not make the adults the main antagonist, maybe it would be better.But here's how it succeded, it feels likemi'm reapeating the above paragraph but hear me. It s a great movie and i thinknits trying to tell us about being an adult, and how being a kid rocks so the comedic point of view was great because it showed how life as a k7d rocks and how adults are kind of a bit dumb, but the main problem is the exaggeration. And also making a movie that can be a bit more memorable and more nostalgic could make it better.In coclusion, the movie is not entirely the worst movie, if you were kid when watching it then you would fell a bit of nostalgia, and not just this fun fuzzy feeling but also conveying a message on egoism and child abuse, but the big problem is the exaggeration and the way the adults are protrayed.",

            "content": "When I uttered the words, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" to man in the box office at the movie theaters I had a certain sense of shame and embarrassment. The only reason I went was because we had a group of about 15 film majors that thought it would be funny to all go see the late-night showing of this movie. We were right! From the second we saw the flashback to 1962 Berlin, Germany we knew this was going to be sooooo ridiculous that there wouldn't be any problem finding stuff to laugh at. The dialogue and the \"concept\" of this movie are so prepostorous that I contemplated dropping my major in film once it was over because I thought that if this movie could make it to the big screen, then Hollywood is truly dead. I understand, this is suppose to be a kid's movie.Doesn't work as that even! There was actually a few young children in the theater and they were crying after about 15 min. into it. There's too many special effects and loud fight scenes to make it enjoyable for a child. Plus, even a baby can probably tell how much crap this is. One of the funniest moments was during a part where they're pulling a mini-van into the head baby's secret lair behind the Hollywood sign...I know, that's enough to be funny....but if you look in the upper left hand corner in the screen you can CLEARLY see a crew member just messing around behind a bush. That's how poor quality this is. Well, that's all I'm going to waste my time saying about this movie. If you have a group of friends who want to just laugh they're butts off for 2 hours (way toooo long), then be brave and go see Baby Geniuses 2, it'll be an experience you unfortunately will never forget.",

Of course there has only been one movie that I have never been able to conquer, for fear of my personal well being.That movie is \"Baby Geniuses\".The movie is unflinchingly bad, and it showed what happens when washed up actors (in that case, Christopher Lloyd, Kathleen Turner, Peter MacNicol, etc.) get another shot at immortality. The story revolved around a baby that was really hardcore super smart, and his twin who revolt with other babies and try to destroy the corporation run by Lloyd and Turner. They win, hallelujah.Of course, we're not talking about that movie, we're talking about the ACTUAL SEQUEL \"Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2\".How this thing got green lit, I have no idea. This must be how Satan works his way into our minds.This movie continues the trend of having washed up actors in starring roles, and this year's line-up might just be better than the other. In the blue corner, we have Jon Voight, a perpetually useful actor known for his useless roles (see Anaconda), and in the red corner we have SCOTT BAIO. Three words: Charles In Charge. That's all that I have to say.For a kid's film , this lacks imaginative ideas. For an adult film, this lacks actors, a story, a plot, a writer, and for that matter, reason.Avoid this movie like the black plague.",

Running babies, midgets in baby masks doing gymnastics, hastily constructed special effects, Kathleen Turner... all of the usual suspects of low brow American film productions were truly alive and well in the original, and they chaotically collided with one another marvelously, creating an absolutely spectacular display of undeniable crapulence and hilarity. I have to admit, I was quite excited to hear that baby geniuses had defied the will of every film critic in the country and been granted funding to create a sequel. My excitement only grew when I heard that none other than Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel would have key roles, AND a flying car along with a neo nazi would play critical roles in this sequel. Certainly, I thought, there way no way this film wouldn't supplant Hercules in New York as my favorite bad movie of all time... but somehow it just didn't work out. Honestly, I'm not sure what to say about the film itself or the experience I had watching it. It's not that they decided to pay some attention to detail in this film, as the babies on the movie poster in no way resemble the babies that are actually in the movie. It's also not an issue of the babies not doing enough karate, because they definitely still do that... uggh, it's just so frustrating. I can't figure it out. I bought this movie on Sunday, and I've spent the last two days trying to figure out if this movie wasn't quite bad enough to be \"so bad it's funny,\" or if this movie surpassed the \"so bad it's funny\" phase and somehow crossed back over into a realm in which it's so dreadfully horrendous that it has no comedic value whatsoever. Either way, I'm sincerely disappointed in this film, and I guarantee you, whether you be a parent who actually wants to find a good film for their kids, or a college student who just needs something mindless to wash away the pain of your newest hangover, you'll be disappointed as well if you pick up this wretched flick.",

The movie starts out with a baby telling a story about a famous baby (that looks about 5 or 6 years old) named Kahuna rescuing children from East Germany. We then are introduced to Jon Voight's character Bill Biscane, and I gotta hand it to him, he actually had to try really hard to act this poorly. Basically after 40 years, Biscane has went from being a communist agent to owning a media empire. How that happens, I don't know, but its not worth going on about it. Apparently Biscane's master plan is to use satellites to broadcast mind-control to the population. Don't worry, it's a lot dumber than it sounds.The whole first act is pretty hard to watch, especially with the bad CGI on the babies mouths. The movie then slows down and just becomes just a regular bad kids movie. Nothing special, surprising, or really entertaining about it. They try to make the whole back story with Kahuna emotional, but because I really don't care or like him, it doesn't leave really any impact on anything really. Then in the final act of the film, it goes back to being unwatchable, with bad dialogue, pointless action( if you wanna call it that), and not to forget, a really stupid premise. Oh and the big reveal at the end on who Biscane is couldn't have been more predictable even if they tried.There's nothing to this movie but bad characters, bad storyline, bad dialogue, and really bad one-liners. Its actually amazing that this movie even exists, seeing how the first Baby Geniuses had a reputation for being among the worst films ever. I guess everyone thought that if they tried really hard, they could make an even worse movie. Overall though, I don't really think it is deserving of the \"Worst Movie Ever\" label. Don't get me wrong, It's bad and I hated every minute of it, but it could have been worse. It could have been a lot worse.",

This film has an evil TV mogul (Jon Voight) trying to understand and breakdown baby talk but his evil goons have a major problem with a Rambo type baby. Yeah, that's the plot or something like it. The first BABY GENIUSES movie was pretty bad but I gave the filmmakers credit for at least trying to do something original even if the story itself was a bit too creepy to actually work. This film here is just a really bad rehash of a bad story that didn't work in the first place so there wasn't anywhere to go but down and this thing here really crashes. I'm really not sure what the filmmakers were going for but you'd think their target audience would be children yet every bit of the story here would be way too confusing and boring for kids. Even worse is that the baby stuff is so uneven with everything else in the film that it would be impossible for the adults to get anything out of it either. I'm really not sure why they'd want to alienate children and especially since they're the ones this was made for. The story makes very little sense but I guess this here is to be expected. The performances really aren't much better with Voight and Scott Baio isn't much better. SUPERBABIES: BABY GENIUSES 2 is a very bad movie but with that said I don't think I'd call it one of the worst ever, which is where it's reputation is at.

(Stan's brother from the first film owns the center but is busy saving children overseas.) The Bobbins are preparing for the arrival of Mr. Biscane, who, at this point in the film, is an internationally recognized advocate of children and orphans. Biscane has chosen the Bobbins' upscale L.A. day care to premier his new television show for kids. Stan hopes the exposure will turn the day care into a nationally known brand, \"the McDonald's of day care.\" Biscane has other ideas.As the Bobbinses work themselves into a high-stress lather over the near visit, four smart babies:Archie, Finkleman, Rosita and Alex sit talking to one another in a play area. To the ordinary watcher, it looks as if they're just talking baby talk. But Jean becomes convinced that they're actually having a conversation. And she's right: Archie is telling the other toddlers about the legend of Kahuna, a 7-year-old \u00fcberspy who prevented the evil Nazi-like commander Kane's plot to enslave orphaned East German children.The other babies dismiss Archie's tall tale. But they soon discover that Kahuna is no legend when he comes to their rescue\u2014which they desperately need after getting unwittingly dragged into Biscane's malevolent sights\u2014tricked out with all the requisite Bond-like hardware, including a snazzy rocket-powered three-wheeler. Along the way, Kahuna empowers the babies to believe in themselves, revealing each one's superpower!.This movie is so great .I still do not know why it is heavily underrated.

His fights scene were a personal highlight of the movie for myself, however it must be said that when he originally fought Kahuna (superbaby) it was the latter that really shone through, and produced an Oscar/Emmy winning performance. Kahuna, despite obviously being a child, somehow managed to look like a midget stuntman throughout his fight scenes, which was a classy and well thought out touch. It must be mentioned that we appreciated, on a professional level, the Three Stooges reference and were pretty much blown away by the obscure Popeye reference to Popeye. Still on Kahuna, his superpowers were up there with other really good superheroes like Batman and/or Iron Man. His superpowers were as follows: fighting, glowing green, driving a small little persons car, pilot, floating on a bean bag, meditating and being about 5 or 6 forever. Oh and his dashing good looks and nursery charms. Do you know fans what was out of this world, and maybe any other world? The CGI and special effects thereof in this film. Amazingly the production team managed to make it look like the babies were actually saying these really funny one liners like \"Can a brother get some water?\" (We get that satire) As huge fans of computers, we really enjoyed the babies frequent use of the MSN Kids operating system, and would like to petition for its return to all new computers from this point onwards. Loved the cameo of the Whoopster Whoopi Goldberg. It was like she wasn't there and was actually at home the whole time, but we obviously know she wasn't. Ha. However, it must be said that the blistering appearance of the Grammy winning superstar making Florida band O-Town was something to behold for generations past and present. Those guys brought it, and we loved it. Loved it. In conclusion, this film was below average. That guy from Diagnosis Murder wasn't very good. The plot was a bit weird. The pacing was off, and almost strange. So, we have had to dock several points accordingly. As a result, we have been forced to give it a 9.0 out of 10.0. Two thumbs up.

            "content": "This movie is everything wrong with America. but there is something brilliant about that. it fails on every single level, effects, acting, score, editing, direction, lighting, background, and sets. But if you look at it, this film was obviously made by adults, to sell this as a summer forgettable to young young YOUNG children. but it becomes more than that. its a movie that shows how we can deceive the youth into taking whatever garbage we shovel them (a very obvious hint to religion and how we have destroyed our natural resources leaving the next generation hopeless.)its a movie that teaches us that the American public can forgive racial stereotyping if everything else around it is that terrible. it really shows how mediocre we are as a society. although i liked dissecting this movie to its core, its still quite possibly the worst movie ever made and sitting through it will scar you as much as a 90 hour rerun of two girls one cup. but other than that. check it out. illegally download it. don't support the film makers. but do check it out.",

            "content": "Many people only see the surface of this movie. They see the funny jokes and the excellent action scenes and well thought out plot, but there is so much more to this movie. Our hero, Kahuna, is eventually revealed to be the brother of the villain, Kane. This is truly symbolic of the close bond between the light and the dark, good and evil. It also humanizes each of the characters and shows how easily they could have turned out differently. The story of how Kahuna got his powers is also an intricately beautiful tale. Kane was trying to get the superpowers for himself but the vial containing the experimental liquid fell out of his hands and instead Kahuna drank some of it. In his attempt to become powerful, fate decided that Kane was not fit for the great responsibility and instead bequeathed it to Kahuna. Was fate wrong? What if Kane had the powers? He would never have been so bitter about Kahuna being special instead of him. He would never have taken all those children and been a Nazi. Kahuna would have been normal, but did he ever want anything else? Kahuna never asked for the powers, they were given to him. Maybe if only fate had allowed Kane to become super instead of Kahuna then none of this would have happened. Fate and Destiny are omnipotent and yet they often make mistakes. Thats what this movie is really trying to teach us.",

The movie is also great quality springing from best direction----to best cinematography. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great movies...It's a masterpiece to say the least...All I can say is....Give Scott Baio the Oscar*.....NOW! I loved every minute of this joyful, yet tear jerking event....John Voight hits all the right notes! Masterpiece....I bow down to the worlds greatest movie ever!",

The movie had epic scenes of puking on people walking down the street, potty breaks, potty mishaps, potty explosions, potty potty, and potty diaper poop. If you little boys want to learn how to unload a ton watch this piece of crap?? wat?? wat?? i mean incredible motion picture today. Why don't people enjoy SuperBabies? Is it the lack of killing? Our world has enough killing. We should learn to enjoy the art of poo and pee and it's many \"contraptions.\"",

It follows the story of main character, baby Christopher, as he crawls away from home, driven out by his alcoholic and abusive twin sister Jennie and takes up a life of organized crime. That's right, this film can be compared to 'The Godfather', and if I am to do so, I must say that it is indeed precisely 3146 times better.A film like this only comes around once in a life time. This is our Charlie Chaplin. The Magnum Opus of this generation. At the risk of starting a religious war, the director of this film, Bob Clark, should not only be appointed as pope, but also receive the title of God, 3 Nobel peace prizes, and also a butler space monkey. He makes Jesus look like Hitler.That is really all that needs to be said. In conclusion, Jesus is worse than Hitler.",

The plot makes no sense and there's nothing holding the movie together, it's like the director made it terrible on purpose just to torture whoever sees it. Don't see the movie, even if you just want to make fun of it, it's just way too terrible. If I had the option of choking myself to death and watching this movie again I would choke myself to death. We honestly only got through forty-five minutes of the movie before turning it off, but just those forty-five minutes have scared me for life.",

The story is so deep it just brings you into this world the movie has made, every time I re watch this masterpiece I am always shocked at little things that I missed before. The specials effects where also amazing, the way the babies talk are extremely realistic and the fights are some of the most epic I have ever seen. If you have not seen this go see it now! It's too bad I can only give this film a 10/10 since I think its a 11/10. There are films that push the limits and blow your mind and this is one of them!",

            "content": "I viewed this film on television, a French language version, over the Christmas(2007)Holidays while visiting in Alma Quebec, Canada (region of Lac St-Jean). I missed the opening credits and had no idea who had directed this 'delightful' work. Before long I was guessing this wee treat to be the work of Bob Clark, and am now delighted to learn that he is indeed the director. Few of those watching with me spoke English, and even though this film is very \"American\" in every aspect, everything seemed to work for this audience, who truly enjoyed all that was offered. Bob's work, in my opinion, from Black Christmas to the present had occasionally been 'uneven'(although come to think of it, what director has not, at times, been 'uneven' over a career) I think A Christmas Story is his best work, a film I enjoyed immensely. However, Super Babies is a darn fine match and Bob is able to capture the essentials required in childhood adventure - something in it for kids of all ages. I'll miss him, and I will never forget the \"little boy\" in him. DMR",

This film has everything, the first time i saw it I cried at how beautiful it was. All the characters have such depth and meaning into them especially characters like brain boy and bouncing boy who steal the show. Don't let me get started on the visual effects as not eve Avatar can top this masterpiece, this film looks so good I'm am appalled that it is not even out on Blu-ray! Overall this film is for everyone, the jokes are hilarious, the action scenes are nail-biting and the polish of this family adventure is perfectly executed. Superbabies: Baiy Geniuses 2 is definitely not one to miss!!!",
