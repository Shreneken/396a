            "content": "SpoilersTaking France by storm this summer, Les choristes purportedly led to a surge in applications to join choirs all over the country. The magic is unquestionably in the music, but I'll come to that later.The success of Les choristes as a film (with or without the divine music) lies in its not trying to be anything more than what it is, a simple tale that opens up to you instead of manipulating you. You'll find neither heart-breaking poignancy nor rousing heroism. Within the short duration of a school term or two he spent with the somewhat notorious boarding school, teacher and musician Clement Mathieu had his modest ambition fulfilled, of having a choir sing the music he wrote, then moved along to a continuously modest life of teaching and music. Talented prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pierre Morhange did achieve fame and success, but we have essentially been spared laboured scenes of Titanic struggles or exuberant jubilation. To ensure that I'm not misleading towards the other extreme, let me hasten to add that Les choristes does touch our hearts. It does this gently, sensibly.But in the end, it's the music. Purely the celestial beauty of the music alone will brings tears to the appreciative audiences' eyes. The story is touching. The character are likable. But the ultimate magic is the choir and boy soprano Jean-Baptiste Maunier chosen from two thousand auditions. Such a magical choice.",

            "content": "The excellent film \"The Choir\" takes us back to a France of the past where the director Christophe Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval place their story about a school for problem children.In a way, we have seen similar situations where a good teacher is the catalyst for turning around a group of unruly students into good and productive young men and women. Mathieu Clement, is such a man. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. M. Clement has a keen sense of how to deal with the students; instead of the hard line approach the principal, Rachin, insists in dealing with them, he has other ways to make them change.The music created by the film director, M. Barratier, and Bruno Coulais, gives the film the right tone. We also hear a song by Rameau, \"La Nuit\", which is sung with such sweetness that it disarms us and get us into the right mood for enjoying \"The Choir\" even more.The film owes a great deal to Gerard Jugnot, who plays the kind teacher who sees possibilities among all these kids. His take on Mathiew Clement is the right one, because the children see in him someone that is the opposite of the other teachers and the mean principal. As the director of the school, Francois Berleand does a good job in portraying this egotistical man who can't see what his own cruelty is doing to the young people in his charge.The children are as sweet as one expects them to be. Especially Jean Baptiste Maunier, who plays the young Pierre Morhange. Also an angelic Maxence Perrin enchants the viewer as the young orphan Pepinot. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's mother well.This film is music to the ears of viewers, young and old.",

            "content": "There's an air of romance surrounding wayward boys, particularly in the French tradition, where they tend to be poetic as well as mischievous. In \"The Chorus,\" Christophe Barratier draws on this tradition and adds some lovely vocal sounds. \"The Chorus\" is about an \"internat\" or reform school where a new principal who writes music tames his young charges, some naughty, some just abandoned, by teaching them to sing in a boys' chorus. The school director, Rachin (sounds like Nurse Ratched), Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and (of Jacquot's \"The School of Flesh\"), is a prissy sadist who preaches a philosophy of instant punishment for all real or imagined wrongdoing (\"action-reaction\"); but when the new principal, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot) shows up with a soft approach to his classes and his supervisory duties, he finds allies among the faculty and staff.\"The Chorus\" advances the frequently screened theory that delinquent kids are better charmed than chastened; that if you can find a positive activity they excel in, the misbehavior will die out.Barratier has had good success with his young actors. The most important boy is the \"t\u00eate d'ange\" (head of an angel), tall, fair-haired Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier), who's often in trouble and refuses to join the choir, till Mathieu catches him singing by himself and discovers his star soloist. Morhange's voice possesses not only a rich natural musicality but the haunting purity only boy sopranos have. Morhange has the most attractive mother, and Mathieu's success in encouraging the boy's singing makes the pudgy, bald man fantasize romance with her -- thus incidentally clearing himself of the suspicion of pedophilia that tends to haunt any all-boys school setting. Mathieu's romantic dream is futile, and he humbly fades away at the story's end, like some Gallic pied piper of boy soprano-dom.\"The Chorus\" takes place in post-war France and its topic and look establish immediate links with a bevy of seminal French films. Wayward French boys turn up in boarding schools that are places of both repression and refuge, as you can see in Jean Vigo's school revolution in \"Zero for Conduct\" (1933). The beloved textbook of the French bad-boy tradition is Alain-Fournier's \"Le Grand Meaulnes\" (The Wanderer), which was notably filmed by Jean-Pierre Albicocco in 1967. The tradition becomes more autobiographical in Truffaut's 1959 400 Blows, which introduced the director's alter ego, Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud; and in Malle's moving and long-contemplated memoir of a boarding school in wartime, \"Au Revoir les Enfants\" (1987). Jean Cocteau mythologized a bad-boy idol who haunted him all his life in the Darg\u00e9los of \"Les Enfants Terribles\" (1950), made into yet another classic film by Jean-Pierre Melville. This whole idea has remaining traces in the feral youth Gaspard Ulliel plays in Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's recent \"Strayed.\" \"The Chorus,\" it is true, is a relatively conventional entry; except for adding music, it rides upon, rather than transcends, the tradition. But it's a warm story with much charm and little pretension.Barratier himself is a talented musician who, like Mathieu, has drifted into other things. A trained classical guitarist, he won several international competitions after studying at the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale de Musique in Paris, and played professionally for several years. But in 1991 he joined Galat\u00e9e films to train under his uncle, the renowned actor, producer and writer Jacques Perrin -- who bookends \"The Chorus\" as a Morhange who has grown up into a famous classical conductor. For the next decade Barratier was an associate producer and collaborated with Perrin on \"Children of Lumi\u00e8re,\" \"Microcosmos,\" \"Himalaya\" and \"Winged Migration.\" Now he has turned his hand to fiction and directed his own film, with success. There is a risk of preciosity and sweetness, mostly avoided by the dryness of both Mathieu and Rachin as characters, as well as the surviving wickedness of the boys, especially an arch bad-boy, Mondain (Gr\u00e9gory Gatignol). The point of view is Mathieu's and the mature Morhange's, so the film doesn't go as deep into the boys' psyches as it goes into their voice boxes.The director is well connected. He's the son of film actress Eva Simonet and besides his uncle his grandparents were also theater people. The Chorus was top box office in France after its release in March 2004. The French critical reception was pretty mixed, and the film's been reviled by some in the United States as (in one writer's words) \"unbelievably inane, saccharine, and derivative\"; \"all smooth, nutrient-free clich\u00e9s.\" Even thumbs-up king Roger Ebert didn't like it: \"this feels more like a Hollywood wannabe than a French film,\" he wrote. \"Where's the quirkiness, the nuance, the deeper levels?\" But it's really a cleanly made, simple, humanistic, and satisfying little film with far less pandering than its critics claim, and whether we like it or not, it's the French Best Foreign Oscar entry, and the little chorus is likely to perform \" Vois sur ton chemin\" on Awards night (if their voices haven't changed). The relatively minimal mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and the period setting link it more with its classic film antecedents than with the overproduced \"Very Long Engagement\" (Jeunet's film's Oscar nominations are for d\u00e9cor and photography). Derivative and conventionally themed? Yes. Barratier has acknowledged \"The Chorus's\" inspiration in an earlier film, \"La Cage aux Rossignols\" (The Nightingales' Cage, 1945), which has the same premise -- and anyone can name a long list of movies about teachers who charm their wayward flock. None of them feels -- or sounds -- quite like this movie, though. And the boys do their own singing: the \"t\u00eate d'ange\" really has the \"voix d'ange.\" American reviewers, missing the nuances, plug Les Choristes into \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" or \"Dead Poets Society\" and find it stereotypically schmaltzy. The gentler French critics don't see those crude comparisons and are able to call it \"un beau film\" and find in it a satisfying example of \"cin\u00e9ma populaire.\" We can too if we open up to it.",

At the end of the semester I ran \"The Chorus\" for all of my students and the response was astounding. A French film with subtitles that kept the rehearsal room totally silent for two days of classes. Fantastic.I sincerely hope this fine film is given an honest opportunity to succeed in the U.S. We don't need a Disney remake in English with updated pop songs. This charming import is the real deal.As a teacher I always trust the sometimes brutal honesty that high school students express about films and music.

The principal of the school,is a detestable man who abuses students and teachers equally. You've seen the plot before, of course, and some of the characters are \"stock\" sorts. But the acting of the lead, the teacher who \"saves\" the students by luring them into singing, is portrayed charmingly by Gerard Jugnot. Mostly bald, a bit stocky and no beauty, he is nonetheless disarming. The boy soprano, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, has a wonderful voice, and the chorus is splendid. Particularly fine was the score, almost entirely original, by Bruno Colais. I was looking for something inspiring on this bitter cold inaugural day in the U.S. Les Choristes made my spirit soar and reaffirmed that kindness, generosity of self and the gift of music still have the power to change people's lives.",

Of course, the music is wonderful, and the part of Pierre Mohange (jean-Baptiste Maunier) is beautifully played.

I think he's an great actor as he can convey a lot of emotions, from laughter to sincere emotion.

            "content": "This is a marvelous ode to classic music , to childhood plenty of innocence , friendship , cooperation , curiosity and comradeship . Being inspired by the film La Cage Aux Rossignols (1945). It revolves around the widely successful orchestra conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) , who reminisces about his childhood inspirations when he and his former classmate P\u00e9pinot (Didier Flamand) read the diary of their old music teacher Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot , thanks to this box-office film he earned the title of the highest-paid French player in 2004, overtaking Jean Reno , Jean Dujardin , Vincent Perez and G\u00e9rard Depardieu). Set in 1948, in the post-war season at rural \u00a8Fond De L'Etang Internat\u00a8 , there arrives a watcher as well as professor of music , Clement Mathieu , as he becomes the supervisor at a boarding school for the rehabilitation for minors . What he discovers disconcerts him , as the current situation is repressive with a stiff-upper-lip Principal (Francois Berland) who ruthlessly punishes some rebel kiddies . This troubled ragbag of lop-sided children is unwittingly awaiting an empathetic patron who believes in transformation through the conductor's baton rather than the cane executed by the headmaster . As Clement becomes into an enlightened Samaritan pedagogue with hopes for their hearts . While , a young Morhange is the badly behaved son of single mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and Clement brightens up the school and assembles a choir , leading to the discovery of Morhange's musical and physical talents and a transformation in the children . Through the power of song , Clement tries to turn the students . And Clement's ditzy fancy for one boy's mother stretches the plot .French cinema has a great ability in dealing with films about childhood , with interesting and thought-provoking messages that are a clear example of an allegory of notorious values , such as friendship , honor , philanthropy , collaboration and mistreating denounce . This is an splendid ode to childhood , a nostalgic trip to the past in which we become children along half and hour , where everything was discovered , in which the songs and chorus were serious things . Sincere in its sentimentality , it is cutely optimist that believes in the redemption as metaphor of the golden heart . It's a kid's movie but its strength lies in its universal character , not a story just for kids , it's for everyone . This entertaining film displays a colorful as well as evocative cinematography as well as a wonderful musical score . Boarding school movies hit a peak with \u00a8Jean Vigo's Zero De Conduite\u00a8, \u00a8Lindsay Anderson's If\u00a8 and \u00a8Truffaut's 400's blows\u00a8 , but this French box office takes its enjoyable inspiration from a different tradition , the motivational piety , goodness and mirth of \u00a8Goodbye Mr Chips\u00a8 and its wake . Awesome acting by Gerard Jugnot -also co-producer- as a decorous , self-minded chorus conductor , not instantly set for the unabashed hostility his students show him . Support cast is frankly magnificent with the acting more self-contained than the constantly swelling soundtrack , as the following actors shine : Kad Merad , Jacques Perrin , Francois Berland , Didier Flamand , and the child angel face Jean-Baptiste Maunier who was the soloist of Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc , and other actual boys choir soloists . Principal photography by Jean-Jacques Bouhon , Dominique Gentil , Carlo Varini took place on location at the Ch\u00e2teau De Ravel in Puy-De-D\u00f4me . Using foam and salt as artificial snow and green leaves were removed from the grounds , since the beginning of the movie was filmed in the summer, but set in the Winter . As it was filmed in the middle of summer which was hard for the actors to wear winter clothes . A model of the boarding school featured in the film at a miniature railway museum in Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Chalaronne and fog machines were also used around the castle . It features a sensitive soundtrack , which was composed by Bruno Coulais and performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Deyan Pavlov and the choir Les Petits Chanteurs De Saint-Marc , as the producers chose to hire real boys choir soloist . It displays heartwarming , sentimental choral performances in general , the Chorus translates into a strong , albeit repetitive album.The motion picture was well directed by Christophe Barratier (L'outsider , Par\u00eds, Par\u00eds , War of the buttons) who gives an approach exquisite and original ; in fact , this was the #1 movie at the French box office , with more than 8.6 million admissions . It is a great portrait about unfortunate post-war orphans , appointed to children as well as adults .",

Les Choristes invites our understanding of their sensibility, sensitivity, and the ease with which they are treated badly -- in fact, have always been treated badly by institutions, educators and parents. The importance of fathers in their lives and their great need for a surrogate if the natural fathers are missing are beautifully explored in this film. The screenplay and its realization on screen are very effective in showing how the difficult combination of giving boys strong direction and tenderness and finding a way to their hearts can be accomplished. This film helps us understand how the same human creature can be hard and sullen one moment and sweetly spiritual the next, inaccessible one minute and needy the next.

            "content": "To the best of my knowledge Gerard Jugnot is completely unknown in England despite having acted in some 76 films, written 14 and directed 9. He was part of a group named Splendid who began in the cafe-theatres of Paris in the eighties and a fair percentage - Thierry Thermitte, Josiane Blasko are two names that will be familiar to both English and American audiences - have gone on to carve out successful movie and/or theater careers. Ironically, the second lead in The Choristes, Francois Berleand has appeared in several films that were seen outside France but the irony is that he could get a job tomorrow as a Richard Dreyfus look-alike and it was, of course, Dreyfus who starred in Mr.Holland's Opus, the film to which the Choristes is destined to be compared if not measured against. Currently this entry is making a lot of noise at the French Box Office and deservedly so if anybody asks you. Jugnot strikes just the right note (not really sorry about that) as the new teacher on the block in a school for hard cases but unlike Richard Dadier (or, Glenn Ford, whichever is the greater) his attempts to reach the kids via music is NOT abortive. For those who can't resist footnotes to other movies this one also has a touch of the Cinema Paradisos inasmuch as it begins with the death of a mentor and a now Internationally successful artist (for movie director read conductor) reminisces about his childhood and the influence upon it of said mentor. In a perfect world this movie WILL be shown in England and/or America and a great many more mavens will know what the cognoscenti have known for years, that Jugnot can make it even without the Paycock. 9/10",

The kids are angry and the atmosphere of the school oppressive. The new guy doesn't have all the answers, but he is decent and the kids slowly respond to this. In addition, he adores music and decides to channel the kids' energy into a chorus. Unfortunately, throughout his stay at the school, the headmaster does a lot to try to undo the good that is done and he seems to genuinely hate the children. Despite this, the teacher and the kids seem to overcome this atmosphere of tension through their music. The music, by the way, is exquisite.

However, the former deals with the devil which is pretty disturbing while the latter the angels that touches the viewers' heart and soul. It blows in new fresh air into the cinema world.People may associate the film with the 1945 production \"La cage aux rossignols\". Yet, \"Au revoir les enfants\", \"La gloire de mon p\u00e8re\", \"Le ch\u00e2teau de ma mere\", \"Nuovo cinema Paradiso\" and the literature namely \"Le Petit Chose\" by Alphonse Daudet and the hugely popular series of Ren\u00e9 Goscinny's \"Le Petit Nicolas\" were rushing into my head when the film rolled on. They all share a number of common features: younger carefree days, reminiscence, scenic countryside, pastoral living etc, they are all ingredients of French fresh (salad) movie, warm, humane and unforgettable. The genre is perpetually popular and it is ever-lasting. Strangely the subject matter though is related to \"To Sir, with Love\", \"Mr. Holland's Opus\", they didn't come up to my mind immediately.French people are capable of producing movies or books with nostalgic ideas, the power again captures the world's heart. A country with long history or brilliant history provides much space for artists, France is one of them. Perhaps the French have no incentive to push forward like the Brits or Americans or they are pessimistic about the future or they lack funds, many the French artists (of various art form) keep looking into history for inspiration. Many French global blockbusters are filmed in nostalgic background setting, \"Am\u00e9lie\" is the one in the 50s or early 60s. Cruelly truthful is if we compare the development (in most areas) of the developed nations on the west and east Atlantic coasts, the UK and the USA are exactly more advanced.Pierre, P\u00e9pinot, Le Querrec, spectacled Boniface and all the other children form not only a choir but an angelic choir. The boys' angelic voices has resounded inside my head for pretty long time. The angels rekindle Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu's abandoned hope on music and hope again falls onto these young souls. On top of it, he is the unsung hero on the making of the world famous conductor Pierre Morhange. Mondain, apparently sexually harassed, is not a incurable boy but a boy in his quest for love. Mathieu wants to carry out his \"experiment\" on him. And the young boy knows the class tutor is a kind and reasonable teacher. His smile to Mathieu before he is pulled away by the police tells it all.Mathieu believes in moral education (or educating children in love) which is entirely different from iron-handed Rachin's hard-line pedagogical conviction and administration. Should time be given, Mondain would find his way out from the excruciating self-destruction. Just a side thought: Hong Kong educators should have more thought on dealing with \"problem students\", from time to time what these young people need is a tender light guiding them onto a path which they can have satisfaction and security.

This beautiful feel-good story is disclosed in a perfect pace, with great performances of the cast, and with a wonderful surprising twist practically in the last scene as if it were a fairy-tale. The songs are adorable and I recommend this movie to viewers that like a simple, touching and very real story. My last advice is to keep a handkerchief close to you for the last heartbreaking scene. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"A Voz do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\" (\"The Voice of the Heart\")",

It's an inspirational story of a music teacher who ends up at a boarding school for unruly boys as he teaches them the enjoyment of singing to their hearts' content. There's also a somewhat sadistic principal this teacher has to deal with as well as the single mom of one of the boys. I'll stop there and just say this was quite touching and a bit funny at times (some of the crude language on the part of the kids did partly put me off but I know from experience how cruel they can be). And it's wrapped around a present-day sequence of two of those boys reminiscing about this teacher who inspired them. So that's a high recommendation for Les choristes.",

            "content": "By getting nominated for Academy Awards in both the Foreign Language Film and Best Song categories, Les Choristes (The Chorus) made a rare (for a European film) double impression at the 2004 Oscars. This sentimental tale follows the arrival of a new teacher at a remote boys school in 1949 France (the war is a largely unspoken but ghostly presence). With disciplinary problems rampant, and the policies of the old-fashioned headmaster not helping, Monsieur Mathieu decides to introduce choral singing as a way to bridge the gap with his students. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out where this will go, although the movie uses its atmospheric location and lush vocal arrangements well. Bald, dumpy Gerard Jugnot provides a refreshingly offbeat hero (though securely in the traditions of the My Most Memorable Teacher movie); he's sort of a younger Philippe Noiret. Director Christophe Barratier works in the winsome-cute mode that makes a certain kind of French movie into an overly sweet Bone Bone, although at least this Bone Bone sings.",

            "content": "This film takes place in the mid-twentieth century, in a French reformatory for children who are orphans or who have had legal problems. The story is quite clich\u00e9, but it's extremely effective for the film, and it works wonderfully: it's a teacher's flashback passage through that reformatory. He immediately sensed the climate of repression and anger experienced in the institution, and fueled by the brutal methods of the leadership. Disagreeing with this, he began to educate the children in his own way, eventually forming a small choir that helped at least some of the young people escape delinquency.The film is very good and one of those excellent French films that is lost due to the lack of millionaire publicity and greater interest in European cinema. It's a familiar and friendly film, with uplifting moral messages and great music. Music works not only as a language to express feelings and communicate, but also as a therapy for the accumulated anger and frustrations of that group of children.The film's cast is headed by G\u00e9rard Jugnot, an actor I didn't know yet, even though the face is familiar to me, and I really enjoyed seeing here. Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and gave life to the villain, the unfriendly and rude director of the institution, but he does a very good job and steals our attention whenever he shows up. The character lived at school with his wife and kids, but I felt this was a hook for a sub-plot that never came to anything concrete. Kad Merad and Jean-Paul Bonnaire also proved to be good additions to the cast.Technically, the film is a gem of quality at a low price. Without the spectacularity and resources of the American film industry, this film offers us exquisite cinematography, with excellent colors and good camera work, an intelligent use of light and shadow, and magnificent and well-chosen sets. But it is in the soundtrack and in the use of children's voices that the film really acquires magic, especially for classical music lovers, as is my case. A note of praise also for the use of period props and costumes, which help the film to fit in well with the period portrayed.",

            "content": "\"The enchanting calm of your mystery...Is there anything more beautiful than a dream? Is there any truth sweeter than hope? \" Les Choristes, known by American audiences as The Chorus, is an exceptional French film directed by Christophe Barratier. It was nominated for the 2005 Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, but ended up losing to Spanish film Mar Adentro. The beautiful song, \u00a8Look to Your Path, \u00a8 was also nominated. Les Choristes may have went home empty handed, but the film did garnish a lot of critical appraisal, and rightfully so. It is a well told story, with interesting characters, and an inspirational message. I'm not very big on comparisons, but I just couldn't help finding several similarities between this film and 1989's Dead Poets Society. The storyline is pretty similar although this film is much more lighthearted and uplifting. I was a huge fan of that movie and it is one of my all time favorites so the comparison is a good one. Gerard Jugnot might not be Robin Williams, but his performance was still remarkable, and his character is worthy of being imitated by every professor or person who works with children around the world. We must never forget the influence or words our teaching can have in young minds and it is our duty to bring out the best in them in order to make this place a better world. Les Choristes is a wonderful small film with a powerful message, strong performances, and a great musical score. The screenplay was adapted by Barratier himself from the 1945 French film La Cage aux rossignols. The story does move along at an excellent pace and you are hooked from the very beginning with this interesting film. I loved every second of it.The movie centers around a teacher named Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) who arrives at a boarding school named Fond de l'Etang in a small French town during the late 1940's. This is no regular school, the students here are known for being troublemakers, and the headmaster Rachin (Francois Berleand) runs the place with a very steady hand. Rachin believes in the law of \u00a8action-reaction, \u00a8 which means that for every rebellious action by a student, he will receive an equal reaction (some sort of severe punishment). He believes that nothing good can come out of these kids and that they can only be controlled by fear. Rachin's other assistants seem to go along at first with this method of teaching, but Clement has a different view. As soon as Clement arrives at the school he begins trying to teach the kids with a different method and opposes this \u00a8action-reaction\u00a8 rule. Clement sees the good in these kids and understands it is only a matter of polishing their talents and believing in them. Clement himself is in the middle of searching for meaning in his life, a failed musician, he finds himself teaching these kids, and in doing so he discovers his true calling. He begins writing his own music and discovers that the kids can interpret it for him by forming a school chorus. One of his students, Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) is very talented, and despite being rebellious Clement finds a way to get him involved in music and makes him passionate about it.Of course there is more to the story than just this. It is told in one flashback as one of the student's reads Clement's journal in voice over so the narration is from the professor's point of view, but we also have a love story and other smaller plots unfolding before us. The story is very powerful, inspirational, and emotional. The characters are all very interesting and well developed. The performances are all very great, despite the fact that Jean-Baptiste wasn't actually an actor but a choir boy. I think this was a plus for the movie because he had a great voice and the music was just touching. Gerard Jugnot was great in the lead role and Francois Berleand was the sort of villain this movie needed. We should always see the good in people and not expect the worst from them, especially from kids who are just discovering the world and realizing their own talents. I loved the musical score in this film as well, the songs were all beautiful. The movie moves at a very fast paced and it is less than 100 minutes long. You won't regret this great film and I absolutely recommend it. Without a doubt it was one of the best films of 2004.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

            "review_title": "A Choral Music Teacher's review (with SPOILERS - be forewarned!)",
            "content": "As a certified choral music teacher, I want to add my $.02 regarding this film.I, personally, very much enjoyed it. It illustrated extremely well the positive effects of music in students' lives (discipline problems minimizing, self-confidence rising, and just making a child happy to find an activity they enjoy pursuing). Watching Mathieu conduct the first set of choral warm-ups as well as teaching Morhange proper posture made me smile, as these are familiar teaching tools to choral directors.What made this different from a film like \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is that the movie didn't end with a large concert attended by an audience of supportive,crying parents/students in honor of Mr. Mathieu. In \"The Chorus,\" Mr. Mathieu was fired from his job and went on to teach music privately for the remainder of his life. The cheesy, typical American style which would have the film end with a swelling orchestral score as the aforementioned concert audience stand to cheer/cry with joy would certainly evoke an immediate emotional response. However, this is an example of Hollywood being Hollywood. It's impossible to NOT get emotional when Mr. Holland hears his orchestral composition performed for the first time at a retirement concert in his honor. Hell, I got verklempt seeing that. But, sadly, it simply doesn't happen that way. \"The Chorus\" illustrates this well with it's unpretentious take on the life of a struggling musician trying to make it as a teacher. The following is what happens to a large majority of vocal music professionals with big aspirations - they end up teaching full/part-time in a college/university setting, a school system, or give private lessons in a very humble manner, occasionally finding a chance to compose a small work for a local event and/or sing in a local opera/choir/musical/etc., without any fanfare. Those who DO go on to perform professionally almost ALWAYS say, \"Well, I wouldn't be able to do this without working as a teacher/professor. That's where all professional singers start.\" These people teach for years, often touching the lives of students in countless numbers of ways, then retire to live a simple, quiet life. He/she will get a 'Thank You' from a few students and maybe some parents, but beyond that, not much else. For most, as they look back on their careers, they are generally happy to have had opportunities to teach young people the magic of music as well as feel that magic themselves as the occasional performer/composer.Music teachers can also identify with some situations in this film. Who could forget when Mondain was hauled away and Mathieu leans out the window and says, \"...but he was my only baritone.\" As much as Mathieu despised this ill-behaved hellion, he was, in fact, his only baritone for the choir, leaving Mathieu somewhat disappointed when he left.Also, the attitude regarding music in the eyes of some school administrators (i.e. Mr. Rachin in the case of the film) should not be foreign to many music educators. The music program is deemed completely unimportant and unnecessary UNTIL it is noticed as a success and a delight - only then does the administrator praise and announce his 100% support for the music program - and, of course, claim the program as his brainchild.I wish I could show this in a classroom. There are, however, a few crude scenes which make this impossible.The only reason why I gave this a 9 out of 10 is that the 'action' began to slow a bit towards the last 1/3 of the film. I found myself losing focus as the month of May rolled around in the film.To comment on what another member said regarding the music skills coming about too fast. Do remember that this film takes place over several months, with progress not seen until the Spring. This is not atypical and not unusual at all. With an inspiring, determined teacher, and daily rehearsals with implementations/consistent enforcing of 'good singing habits' (all of which the boys had in the film), true quality can be seen over a span of a few months. The progress of the boys singing skills in the film was, therefore NOT so unrealistic.In my opinion, every music educator should see this film - especially if one is in the choral music field. It is inspirational without being pretentious and, well shmaltzy. It's a much more true-to-life portrayal of the ups and downs of a music teacher with hopes of something bigger. Those not in the music field who are perhaps used to over-the-top portrayals such as \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" may not find themselves giving the film a standing ovation.",

            "content": "LES CHORISTES (THE CHORUS) is director Christophe Berratier's first foray into the realm of full-length films and his adaptation of the 1945 film LA CAGE AUX ROSSINGNOLS written by Georges Chaperot and Ren\u00e9 Wheeler serves to introduce his talents as a master storyteller well. This tale of how music can alter the lives of even most renegade of boys is warm, sensitive, and satisfying on every level.The story opens with the reunion of two men who were classmates at Fond de l'Etang, a boarding school for troubled boys in France in 1949. Pepinot (Didier Flammand) arrives at the door of consummate symphony conductor Pierre Morhange (Jacques Perrin) with a journal written by their beloved teacher Clement Mathieu, now dead, and the two read the journal, recalling their shared childhood experiences at Fond de l'Etang.1949 and the Fond de l'Etang is a dreary jail-like, rundown place run by the cruel disciplinarian headmaster Rachin (Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and). Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot) is an older, bald, failed musician who seeks employment as a prefect in the school and immediately is forced to confront the rigors of the school's harsh discipline with the still flagrantly wild boys. Mathieu slowly wins the confidence of his boys by standing up to the cruel Rachin and when he is near his wits' end as to how to transform his class, he hears a boy sing and decides to use his musical talent to change these boys' lives. Two of the chief problem children are the angry but vocally gifted Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) and Leclerc (Th\u00e9odul Carr\u00e9-Cassaigne) and Mathieu coaxes them into the inner circle of his newly developing chorus. The other child who is without talent but for whom Mathieu empathizes when the child waits every Saturday for someone to claim him at the gates is Pepinot (Maxence Perrin) who Mathieu assigns as his assistant chorus master! Through a series of incidents including the cruelty of Rachin, the appearance of Violette Morhange (Pierre's poor working mother who cannot afford to feed him), the success of the chorus in the eyes of the Countess (Carol Weiss) who acts as benefactor to the school, and some evil doings of the more difficult children, Mathieu's Chorus becomes a symbol for how problem children can bond in mutual need to the enrichment music provides. Rachin cannot tolerate Mathieu's success and fires him without allowing him to say a farewell to his beloved choristers. The manner in which this is portrayed is most touching and spiritually enriching and serves to resolve the mystery of Mathieu's departure to the adult Morhange and Pepinot as they finish the journal.Simple story, told before, but superbly acted and performed. The music is by Jean-Philippe Rameau with original songs by director Barratier and Bruno Coulais, all beautifully sung by Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc with young actor Jean-Baptiste Maunier singing his own solos. The cinematography is in the capable hands of Jean-Jacques Bouhon, Dominique Gentil, and Carlo Varini. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended little jewel of a film! Grady Harp",

            "content": "\"The Chorus\" has something special that miraculously cuts straight to your heart, whatever it is doesn't belong to our cynical days. But the 'miraculously' word is less a praise than a simple recognition of value. \"Amelie\" for instance, is a far superior film in my opinion because at least, it had the merit to be original, something that cruelly lacks in \"The Chorus\". I almost blame myself for being so familiar with \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\", \"Blackboard Jungle\", \"To Sir With Love\" or \"Dead Poets Society\", the theme of the schoolteacher struggling with rebellious pupils and then helping them to find a meaning to their lives is so old that I wonder how Christophe Barratier got away with this from the French critics' circle. Roger Ebert was less magnanimous in his review.I reckon Ebert was about to convince me, just before I started to question my criticism. After all, even the most unoriginal plot can make a creative and surprising film. Moreover, Barratier, the director never denied that the film was an adaptation of a forgotten 1945 classic named \"A Cage of Nightingales\", which basically uses the same plot. Christophe Barratier was so touched by the story that he felt it deserved to be known by the 2000's audience. And thankfully, he didn't kill off the charm by setting the film in a more recent context, and consequently being very careful about the use of this or that minority not to inspire the same kind of negative reactions \"Amelie\" faced. \"The Chorus\" is a film set in the France of 1949, a totally different country who was still healing its wounds from WWII. And in the France of 2004, as it often happens in this country so thirsty of intellectual discussions, the film opened the door to an unexpected wave of nostalgia towards these days where discipline and authority was the daily bread of pupils, whose childhood took its full meaning because it was not spoiled yet by technology. Kids had to learn about respect, yes, but they had the freedom to play with what was at their hands without TV, without the Internet. Tougher times but so much more appealing, and maybe that's why parents and kids both loved the film, and why it became a subject of many social debates highlighting the reality that discipline and authority were still relevant today.\"The Chorus\" was a phenomenon, released at a time where the audience was probably tired of having so many French thrillers emulating American films with a certain level of violence and spectacular scenes that didn't fool anyone. It touched a sensitive chord in France, then Europe and even across the Atlantic, because of the universality of its subject. We all had a teacher who inspired us, and the film is a tribute to this optimism that inhabits childhood, this idea that anything is possible, and that it is never too late to find a meaning to your life. Still, the 'miraculously' word is not about the elements I just described, it's something more than that, something transported by a series of unreadable signs translated by the most beautiful and universal human language. That is the real secret of \"The Chorus\": the music. It's so magnificently composed and written that it succeeds precisely where others cinematic elements don't. Indeed, the same story with the same actors, director and characters wouldn't have such a great phenomenon without that music. I can't describe how the melody of \"Look to your Path\" affected me, and the people in the theater. That's the power of the film, as it brilliantly embodies the magical power of Music, this capability to let yourself escape from your condition, and open the windows of your heart to an infinite road made of dreams, projects and inspirations \u0085 the film is about hope, optimism, life and this is what the music, hence \"The Chorus\" is about.The music works as an antidote to all the cold intellectual approach that would point its finger on the unoriginality of the plot. Yes, we know that Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot), the underdog and not pleasant-looking music teacher will succeed, yes, the way the kids turn from average singers to a talented choir, flirts sometimes with cinematic fantasy. Yes, we know what will happen to Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier). But it's like the film embodies itself the touching naivety of childhood incarnated by the cute little face of P\u00e9pineau when he says he doesn't know any song, with his nose cutely moving. Okay, we wise guys, have seen many films like this, but how about the others, how about kids? Should our cinematic knowledge always undermine our appreciation? Should we always blame a film for being manipulative even if it manipulates us to something undeniably positive?So, I'll give it a 9, not because of the predictability of the plot, but just for some little flaws in the writing that could have been avoided. How couldn't the older Morhange remember the name of the man who changed his life, for the best? Why trying to depict these kids as incarnation of the devils where they are not (after all, Mr. Chips' kids were not all bratty)? Why making such a despicable character out of Rachin, the headmaster, especially after depicting him in a lighter way just before? The movie needed an unlikable bossy civil servant but not an evil man. And last but not least, in the farewell scene, why didn't Mathieu take all the sheets that went sent to him? There are many interrogations left but these ones still bug me whenever I watch \"The Chorus\".Still, it's indeed one of the most memorable films of the 2000's, that anyone from any country would love, English, American, French? Forget about it, the movie speaks the most universal language, I mean \u0085 it sings it.",

I defy anyone not to have a tear running down their cheek at some stage of this film. It tugs at the heart strings and is uplifting at the same time. In particular the two final scenes warrant special attention and acclaim. The view of tiny little hands all saying their own farewell is one of the most moving scenes I have seen in any movie. Les Choristes truly deserves wide acclaim and the sacrifice made by Gerard Jugnot in helping finance the film is a credit to his belief in this script and a reward for delivering such a wonderful family film.This film restores a balance to humanity and highlights the dignity of ordinary human beings and the hope we all have for happiness and to leave our mark on the world.",

This film about a recently-hired school supervisor, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, at a French reform school for boys in 1949 is one more entry in the exceptional teacher genre. For many of us the appeal of these films is that we have had such a teacher in our lives.The school, named Fond de l'Etang (literally \"bottom of the pond\"), houses an impressive collection of rowdy boys, some orphaned or otherwise scarred by the war. The headmaster is a harsh disciplinarian whereas Cl\u00e9meant is more gentle and reasoned in his approach. About all you need to know about the story is that, in this particular case, the inspiring teacher accomplishes his noteworthy achievements by way of forming a choir. Not all is sweetness as there is one rather incorrigible boy, Mondain (Gr\u00e9gory Gatignol, who establishes a truly scary presence) introduced into the mix. It is interesting to compare this movie with \"Blackboard Jungle\" where Glenn Ford faces a somewhat similar situation. The gritty realism of \"Blackboard Jungle\" is in stark contrast to what we see in \"Les Choristes,\" leaving one to puzzle about how a Hollywood film from 1955 has more depth than a French film from 2004.Jacques Perrin adds some nice touches in his brief appearances - he does a particularly fine job as an orchestra conductor in an early scene.

This beautiful masterpiece is one of my favourite films of ALL TIME.Before this film, I didn't really cry much in films, but now, I blub in almost everything! It's almost as though it awakened a sentimental part of me, as silly as that sounds.Gerard Jugnot is quite simply outstanding in his role as Clement Mathieu, but every single actor in this is totally splendid.You don't need me to tell you the story, no doubt by now, but the final scene where the boys cannot greet Mathieu when he is fired, and so throw paper plane letters out of the window to the beautiful song, \"Cerf-Volant\"... is one of the most moving scenes ever. I cried like a tiny child!I couldn't recommend this film more. Coming from a 14 year old girl who is into trendy/sexy films, you can trust me that this is not some frumpy, rubbish, old-fashioned snore-fest. It's quite simply amazing. GO AND WATCH IT, NOW! =D",

The main character is not a charismatic, handsome type but he carries the story and he should have got an Oscar as should the score. Cannot finish without mentioning the young actor who played Morhange-he has a haunting, beautiful face (the face of an angel they say in the film) and a terrific voice.

And if you have 2 brain cells to rub together, you probably knew this long before you read this far. The only reason I'm making this point is in case you were expecting something a little more gritty like the excellent \"Dead Poets Society\" (which, if you haven't yet seen, you must immediately flog yourself with a wet baton before seeing, pronto).\"The Chorus\" dives boldly into disturbing territory right at the outset with a scene containing some blood and another reference to suicide. My criticism is, instead of maintaining this malevolent air of drama (which would seem fitting of a corrupt 1940s reform school, every bit as formidable as the asylum in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"), the story instead flips into Disney territory. The dangerous juveniles who initially terrified us are instantly transformed into eager songbirds, reducing the initial drama to little more than a comedic gimmick. The story unfolds to reveal that the conflict of the story rests entirely upon the cartoonish villain, the headmaster.I felt that was the film's only letdown because the story seemed ripe to explore the complex transformation of criminals to chorusboys through the magic of music. While this did occur, it happened so suddenly that I felt like half the movie had been chopped. But if you can take this shift in stride, you'll have a great time. The kids are cute, and the music is uplifting. The presentation focuses more on comedy than hard hitting drama, so you can sit back, breathe easy and enjoy the ride.Personally I would've liked to see a bit more of a challenge in converting these juvenile delinquents, like maybe Antonio Banderas converting a bunch of NYC street thugs to twinkle toes dancers in \"Take the Lead\", or Robin Williams in the aforementioned \"Dead Poets Society\" struggling to draw the ultra conservative schoolboys out of their shells. To me, that is the draw of a story like this, but here the drama was more focused on the headmaster's antagonism. It might have worked better if the evil headmaster weren't shown to be such a bumbling fool who secretly throws paper airplanes around his room whilst standing on his desk. For that role, NOBODY comes close to Mr. Warfield in Jerry Lewis' \"Nutty Professor\".But enough with the comparisons, you're saying. Is this a good movie or a bad one? It's good, very good. So don't hesitate to watch it if you're in the mood for a nostalgic retrospective to bygone days of questionable education systems. \"The Chorus\" is a nice film for anyone who isn't subconsciously comparing it to every troubled youth flick since \"The 400 Blows\". Dammit there I go again.",

This is the premise of The Chorus (Les Choristes), a skillfully acted but by-the-numbers effort that fails to deliver any real emotional substance.Mathieu discovers that some of the boys can sing very well, especially troublemaker Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maunier) whose boy soprano voice has a purity that is almost angelic. The teacher pursues a relationship with Pierre's mother Violette (Marie Bunel) and encourages her to visit the school more often, but she falls in love with an engineer without considering Mathieu as a potential father for her son.The teacher molds the delinquent boys into a heavenly choir (without a great deal of trial and error) and develops a positive relationship with most of them that demonstrates the redemptive power of music and further frustrates the surly headmaster. Although I did find The Chorus entertaining and truly enjoyed some gorgeous music, most of the characters are well-worn stereotypes and the film does not explore any possibilities beyond its tried and true formula.",

Brilliantly crafted, absorbing tale of the transformative power of choral music and a resourceful teacher to achieve civility within the confines of a dreadful state lockup school for deviant and unwanted boys.The story is told in a long flashback, when a reunion occurs between two men who were in the school together a half century earlier. As their story is recounted, we first meet Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), a short, balding, failed musician who in middle age has no other prospects than to take a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, run by a sadistic martinet, Rachin (Francois Berleand), who treats his faculty as viciously as the students.The ensuing plot conceit is a familiar one: the steadfast Mathieu gradually wins over the insolent, anarchical kids through music and kindness, as he introduces a choir program to brighten the otherwise dull, steady diet of the three \"R's\" and the punishments meted out by Rachin.This little gem has been a surprise hit, wildly popular both in France and internationally. The choral numbers are sublime, performed by an established French boys' choir, whose soprano soloist, Jean-Baptiste Maunier, sings flawlessly and acts the role of young Pierre Morhange, a central figure among the youths here.The film is a remake of a 1945 movie, \"La Cage aux rossignols\" \u0096 \"A Cage of Nightingales.\" First time writer-director Christophe Barratier was himself a musician: beginning musical studies at age 7, he also sang in a boys' choir, and later studied at the Paris Conservatory. He is the nephew of Jacques Perrin, the well-known actor and film producer (\"Microcosmos,\" \"Himalaya,\" \"Winged Migration\"), who here plays the adult Pierre Morhange, now an internationally known conductor, one of the two men who meet at the start of this film to reflect on their experiences long ago.The story is not far fetched. I have personally known of situations in which participation in choral music turned around the lives of troubled teenagers. Amid so many films reflecting indifference, destitution and violence in our world, this one comes to us like a wondrous breath of fresh air. (In French). My rating: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 04/16/05).

On garde l'ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 des rossignols, qui sont des oiseaux qui chantent beaucoup et bien , mais qui sont aussi des objets de pi\u00e8tre qualit\u00e9, et des gens sans aucune originalit\u00e9, bref des individus rejet\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, marginalis\u00e9s dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, bref du rebus social. Mais on quitte cette image d'enfants vus comme du rebus social. C'est l'institution et son nom qui nous plonge au plus profond de la mis\u00e8re humaine pour des enfants, le fonds de l'\u00e9tang, la boue, la fange, bref le rien du tout.Les dialogues sont parfois fort ressemblants quand ils ne sont pas identiques. Mais on change l'empaquetage de l'histoire pour quitter le m\u00e9lodrame pr\u00e9-hollywoodien. Simplement deux anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de cette institution pour enfants difficiles, sans famille ou rejet\u00e9s par leurs familles, se rencontrent un soir, ou peu importe quand, le petit qui ne chantait pas car il attendait le retour de son p\u00e8re de la guerre ou il \u00e9tait mort mais l'enfant ne voulait pas le croire, d'une part. On a chang\u00e9 de p\u00e9riode. On a quitt\u00e9 l'avant-guerre pour passer \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-guerre, probablement juste apr\u00e8s la guerre. On n'\u00e9tait plus dans l'absence totale de r\u00e9forme d'un syst\u00e8me napol\u00e9onien caduc et absurde, mais dans une p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 on parlait beaucoup de r\u00e9forme avec le Plan Langevin-Wallon qui sera magistralement abandonn\u00e9 d\u00e8s que les communistes seront vir\u00e9s du gouvernement en 1947. Le film est revu et corrig\u00e9 dans cette perspective de ce mot d'ordre \"Tous capables\" si g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et vrai fondamentalement mais \u00e0 condition que l'on accepte que chacun ne sera capable que de r\u00e9ussir dans ce qu'il voudra faire. Tous capables de r\u00e9ussir mais pas aux m\u00eames choses. M\u00eame le d\u00e9linquant qui met le feu au ch\u00e2teau est capable de r\u00e9ussir, r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 fuir la justice, r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 br\u00fbler cette \u00e9cole, r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 \u00eatre l'exploiteur des faibles et l'enquiquineur diabolique des ceusses qui ont un tant soit peu d'autorit\u00e9 sur lui, ou qui croient en avoir.Ici on prouve le principe p\u00e9dagogique premier de Langevin-Wallon en faisant chanter tous les enfants de cette \u00e9cole, et pourtant un ne chante pas et est l'assistant muet du chef de choeur, et un autre ne chante pas non plus et est le pupitre du ma\u00eetre de choeur. Serait-ce que tous ne sont pas capables de chanter, et je ne dis pas de chanter juste?Le film est bien fait et essaie de montrer comment l'autorit\u00e9 se conquiert par le respect et la justice et non par le principe absurde action-r\u00e9action de tous les apprentis fascistes. Et c'est la fin qui est le plus marquant changement. Ce pauvre pion qui n'est qu'un rat\u00e9 social car il ne sait pas se valoriser dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, disparait de l'\u00e9cole et pourtant il \u00e9crit son aventure l\u00e0 tout en vivotant en donnant des le\u00e7ons de musique. Le petit gar\u00e7on qui ne chantait pas dans la chorale fuit l'\u00e9cole avec le pion le jour de son licenciement, une fin humoristiquement impossible puisque cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la loi fran\u00e7aise la plus simple au moins un enl\u00e8vement sinon un d\u00e9tournement de mineur. Mais c'est ce petit gar\u00e7on qui a pass\u00e9 toute sa vie avec ce pion qui l'a sauv\u00e9 de l'enfer, et c'est lui qui vient voir le chanteur superbe qui a fait toute une carri\u00e8re avec une voix d'ange, un contret\u00e9nor quand il avait 10 ou 12 ans, et qui pourtant a comme tous les autres oubli\u00e9 le pion, car les enfants oublient facilement leurs moments de bonheur en s'enfermant dans leurs moments de malheur. Et si avec le temps on oublie le malheur, on en oublie de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on le bonheur. C'est triste, mais souvent dans une vie il y a ce moment magique et impr\u00e9vu, parfaitement inattendu, qui fait revenir le pass\u00e9 et alors le bonheur refait surface, si avec le temps pass\u00e9, on a su prendre le contr\u00f4le du malheur et on a su le faire taire.C'est ainsi que le petit qui ne chantait pas, P\u00e9pinot, ram\u00e8ne la voix d'ange, Pierre Morhange, \u00e0 ce pass\u00e9 avec le long m\u00e9moire du pion, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, qu'il a \u00e9crit avec l'aide de P\u00e9pinot et pour que ce P\u00e9pinot aille le remettre \u00e0 Pierre Morhange quand lui, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, aurait disparu de l'histoire, s'entend de cette vie de m\u00e9diocrit\u00e9 reconnue et impos\u00e9e pour les seule avantages d'une \u00e9lite tout aussi m\u00e9diocre mais qui a la bonne chaise l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il faut et quand il le faut.Regardez les deux films dans le bon ordre, La Cage aux Rossignols d'abord et les Choristes ensuite.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",

            "content": "From France comes a Christophe Barratier film named Les Choristes; or 'The Choir' as well as 'The Chorus' as it has been transcribed for British and American audiences, it would seem. The film is an uplifting tale, a realistic look at several pretty desperate situations for all parties involved, in a French boarding school a few years after The Second World War. The film looks at the struggles in life for several people of varying ages and roles, be they headmaster attempting to run the school; a male teacher whom arrives and is thus unacquainted and initially nervous before he attempts to bring his own ideas to the curriculum as well as several children themselves, all of whom are varying in their temperament and attitudes The Choir manages to spread its focus around these parties but uses the character of Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (Jugnot) as a central focus or viewpoint as the events and world around him unfolds. The film is, theoretically, one long flashback induced by an elderly man in the present day named P\u00e9pinot who went to said school with Pierre Morhange, someone who has since become a conductor of quite some considerable note. The story is unfolded through Mathieu's journal, something P\u00e9pinot has come into possession with.It would seem a lot of people complain about the giving away of Morhange being this world famous conductor, quite literally, in the very first few minutes. The idea is, following on from where Mathieu brings musical classes to everyone at the school's attention, we know that he must've done enough to inspire a very young boy to go on and become the conductor he is. I don't think it acts as too much of a bad thing and I think that, once the entering of the man's journal and the flashback proceeds, a different lead has taken the mantle and the film is, essentially, more of a study of one man and his quest to get this choir class set up and how he will overcome diversity as well as the problems he encounters. I will point at Carlito's Way (or most any other neo-noir in which the anti-hero should or would usually 'get' his comeuppance for living the life he did) which shows the lead of that film shot at point blank range in the first thirty seconds or so. What follows is a flashback; a tale about the tribulations and actual journey of how one gets to that point.On this basis, The Choir worked for me. I found Mathieu's story riveting and never overly sentimental or melodramatic as he just tried to inspire, educate and generally do what he wanted to do in the hope others may find it equally as fascinating and/or enjoyable. I am not a teacher myself but is this not what every teacher of any subject at any level just generally tries to do? When Mathieu initially arrives, the film balances its tone of light comedy and effective drama while establishing the sort of character Mathieu is and what lies ahead. There is a scene where a child is guilty of whatever offence and since no one knows who did it, Mathieu must pick a boy at random to be punished as he does not know any of them. He is reluctant but must go through with the situation; regretful when he sees the seemingly harmless boy he's selected for punishment and later apologetic. The school means business, the children can sometimes step out of line but Mathieu will not be moved or change his ways for either.Initially, the children are something to fear. Their shouts and running echoes eerily through the corridors and the nasty results of a practical joke still remain on one member of staff thus preparing our lead for what awaits him but little do any of them know at the time of what changes will occur once initial contact is made. As a character, Mathieu is in a natural position of control as a teacher over the children but is more understanding as a super-egotistical element of the school, offering to introduce his own classes complete with content against the wishes of other staff. He himself answers to the headmaster named Rachin (Berl\u00e9and), an individual who believes, and consequently has everyone else believe, that 'action, reaction' is the best form of education; a sort of 'solve violence with violence' ideation so that if they step out of line, you give them a good smack and hope they don't do it again.But what Mathieu sees is that they need something to exercise their minds; a common interest he can perhaps implant within them that brings them all together and, somehow, enables everyone to just have something in common with everyone else \u0096 that thing is singing. It breeds a common ground between teacher and pupil, something everyone can do in tandem and at once. Despite some snotty reactions, The Choir is worth the time for anyone searching out an engaging film that looks at triumph over incorrect beliefs as an individual tries to bring their own ideas to the plate and construct interests set at a time in which the very nation of France was in a state of disorientation and rebuilding themselves.",

There are no beautiful actors, no gaudy stunts, a few childish \"problem\" children, a bald teacher, plus clean and simple music, trickling stories, not fierce tears and laughter, clumsy edges and corners of the gentle file...... Clement mathew, a country teacher with a passion for music, was appointed to a re-education school, known as the \"bottom of the pond\", a chaotic and irreverent centre for troubled students. Here the principal teacher fraught, on the face is the line of rigid boring, abuse and corporal punishment is the only communication between teachers and students. The lovely new proctor has no choice but to watch the students play practical jokes, until one day accidentally found the beautiful voice of the child.

The principal actor in that film even had the same name as in Jugnot's film, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu. The DVD issued here has neither French subtitles for Deaf/Hard of hearing French nor foreign language subtitles to attract viewers from other countries .... it's indeed a very strange way to promote a film !!The subject matter has been dealt with before in other films so there is nothing new under the sun ..... that said, the film is very pleasant to watch and we become attached to each of the characters in their own way. Using the \"flashback\" technique, such as in Goodbye Mr Chips, Cinema Paradiso, The BRidges of Madison County and other such films plays on the viewer's heartstrings because at the beginning of the film, all we are about to see is over, finished, part of the (distant) past and we have the nostalgic privilege to re-live that past thanks to the magic of cinema .........The film was made in the Ch\u00e2teau de Ravel, situated in the Auvergne region of Central France, between Clermont Ferrand and Riom in the Puy-de-D\u00f4me department. The Ch\u00e2teau de Ravel now has its own internet site which makes ample reference of cours to Les Choristes.I was glad to have this film on DVD and will be sure to watch it several times more. My only qualms were with the choice of musical numbers - indeed I didn't know any of them - and they may indeed have been composed just for the film. As to the name of the school \"Le Fond de l'Etang\" or the Depths of The Pond, I assume it was chosen to represente \"an out of the way\" or \"lowest of the low\" type school !!Sordid types of schools like these have been seen in other French films, in addition to La Cage aux Rossignols, there is \"Les Diaboliques\", \"Le Diable Au Corps\", and last but not least \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" by Louis Malle.I am not really sure whether the film will have success on a world basis - there is nothing typically French about it - but it does make for good watching and many spectators will be able to relate to it.

One imagines that France will hasten to enter it in the race for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year (2004).\"The Choir\" is undeniably a well-made film. But it is not a great film, nor is it even a memorable film. And it certainly doesn't deserve the golden statuette.\"The Choir\" is a nice film, a wistful bit of misty-eyed, rose-colored sentimentality. But it is farm from original, creative or imaginative.It is, instead, a rehash and a mishmash of images and ideas cribbed from other films. The conflict between a kindly new teacher and a crusty old headmaster has been done to death. There have been other, more hard-hitting films about the cruelty of life in reform schools for wayward or abandoned boys. And there have even been other films about a motley crew whipped into shape and ennobled by art, music or theater.\"The Choir\" simply follows a recipe, blends all these elements, and serves up a tepid broth that is more comfort food than cuisine.The screenplay and characterization make few demands on the cast. This is the sort of thing French actors can do in their sleep. (Perhaps they do.)Even Jacques Perrin's character, Pierre Morhange, is a throwback to an earlier role in his career. In \"Cinema Paradiso\", Perrin played a middle-aged filmmaker mourning the death of a childhood mentor, and celebrating his legacy -- a collection of film clips spliced together. In \"The Choir\", Perrin is a middle-aged symphony conductor who learns that a father figure has passed away, leaving him a legacy of memories set down in writing.Good grief, couldn't the producers of \"The Choir\" show even a little imagination, and at least cast somebody else as the elder Pierre?",

(Including great films, like Truffaut's \"Pocket Change\" and \"400 Blows\" and Louis Malle's \"Au Revoir Les Enfants.\") Out of this national necessity (and the admission of the first-time director) comes this rather nice if not quite great movie, building on the same foundations. A teacher is newly assigned to a country private school for troubled boys. He is secretly a composer, and finds a way to write choral music for the boys, who learn to sing extremely well. And so in the barest most touching way we see the vulnerability and possibility of the boys and the teacher, too. And of course the meanness of the schoolmaster. It's classic great stuff so well done you don't mind the familiar ways it works on you.Well, I have to now say that this movie is a kind of remake of a 1945 French original, \"La cage aux rossignols.\" Even the title (The Cage of Nightengales) shows a poetic brilliance that is somehow just lacking here, but in the 2004 version the production values are higher, and the slightly deadpan quality of the lead (Gerard Jugnot) is compelling. Either way the story, and the simple truth of it, is worth seeing. (By the way, \"The Chorus\" is easily found streaming and on Youtube whereas the 1945 version is hard to find.)Beyond the charming idea of delinquents becoming choirboys (and one of them later a famous conductor, which you learn in the first scene), the movie has a kind of warm confirmation that people can be good, and that appreciation of love, and love itself, always abounds. The last scenes will prove this, if you give this a go.What finally holds this film down to earth is not the acting or the music or the wonderful setting in post-war provincial France. It's the story, which we've seen before, and which oddly takes no new turn at all here. It doesn't mean it's not a good story or a well made movie, not one bit.

And there have been several that use music as the key, from \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" to \"School of Rock\" and \"Music of the Heart,\" some even based on true stories.The marginal originality here is that the focus is on a boys' chorus performing classical music, but I always find those angelic pre-puberty voices more creepily pure than appealing, as they are just so fleeting until their voices change. It is annoying how quickly the sympathetic chorus master molds the kids into perform-ability - there aren't even any rough rehearsals after the amusing scene where the kids reveal the little exposure they've had to any sort of songs.We're even robbed of the impact of the chorus on a key boy because the film is one long flashback.

You would hate or despise him but nevertheless that's what got you into hating his character, his capability to capture our attention is one truly appreciable aspect he had.

            "content": "Despite viewing many Japanese Anime, I cannot consider myself a foreign movie fan. I don't mind watching occasional live-action flicks from places other than America, but most of the time it's hit and miss for me. That said I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much I enjoyed LES CHORISTES (or, as the Miramax DVD release calls it, THE CHORUS). Gently told and beautifully photographed, this drama from first-time director Christophe Barratier struck both an emotional and musical chord with this viewer--in fact it was enough to bring back childhood memories for me. But before I get all sappy, onto the movie itself.Set in 1947 France, LES CHORISTES tells the story of Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, a music composer and teacher who finds himself taking a job at Fond de L'Etang, a run-down boarding school consisting of troubled boys who are either orphans or borderline delinquents. Mathieu, a patient, compassionate fellow, eventually turns the entire school upside down when he communicates with the boys through his special talent of music. Before long, the insubordinate wards are transformed into a melodic chorus, much to the chagrin of the school's cruel and abusive headmaster, M. Rachin, who emphasizes corporal punishment as the method for dealing with misbehavior. Mathieu, on the other hand, has a different --or, if you will, kinder-- method for dealing with rowdy boys. For one thing he does not tell on them and instead sentences them to lighter consequences.Over the course of his continual (albeit forbidden) chorus sessions, Mathieu sees potential in one Pierre Morhange, a surly boy with an absolutely stupendous voice and musical gifts which enables him to become the choir's soloist. But first Mathieu must bring the troubled, quick-tempered kid out of his shell. This task is made less easier when Mathieu develops romantic feelings for Morhange's single mother, Violette; it only earns Mathieu Morhange's wrath. Eventually, however, things work out and Pierre eventually finds a career as a highly successful conductor. This is actually displayed at the beginning of the movie, where we see Morhange, as an elderly man, leading his orchestra, and later, reading through the personal journal of his former music teacher. (The whole story, in case you didn't figure out by now, is told entirely in flashback.) As entertainment, LES CHORISTES is heartfelt and uplifting without being too sappy, but as a story it is especially winning. Okay, so it may not be the most original tale --other movies have reprised many of the themes expressed in this movie countless times-- but director Barratier makes this movie \"sing\" by providing both credibility and real emotion to the characters and their situations. Aside from the numerous moments where we see the boys singing songs Mathieu writes for them, some of my favorite sequences in the movie involved Mathieu gently persuading any troubled boy into confessing their misdeed without reporting them. A subplot involving a boy stealing money from the school, in particular, turns out to be a touching episode, especially when we discover the real culprit and learn that his intentions are to free himself from the unloving walls of the school.Personally, however, this movie struck me as a delightful trip down memory lane. I used to attend a musical summer camp for several years, where I've sung in chorus. The scenes where Mathieu and his boys are performing, in particular, were strong enough to recall that special feeling of inclusion for me during the good ol' days.Speaking for the movie itself, LES CHORISTES is handsomely photographed and well-acted--particularly noteworthy are G\u00e9rard Jugnot as the kindly music teacher, Jean-Baptiste Maunier as the talented but emotionally troubled Pierre, and Maxence Perrin as a sympathetic orphan in search of his father. Naturally, since music is the subject for this movie, one would expect nothing less than the angelic sound of a boys' choir, and LES CHORISTES delivers this in full. Particularly spectacular is the song during a performance for the French countess. It helps, too, that the boys have excellent voices. (By the way, the singers are none other than the professional boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs de Saint-Marc Choir.) Some may argue that LES CHORISTES lacks originality, especially for a film that was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, but for what it is, this is a very moving, touching story, well executed and heartfelt. I recommend it heartily, especially for music lovers and fans of feel-good movies.",

These kids are downright violent, so one would think this fat, balding, middle-aged man would have a lot of difficulty with them. He has a little, but they turn good pretty quick because he's nicer than the average teacher. Plus, he teaches them to sing, which is, you know, what the film is about. Jugnot is fine, and the children aren't bad actors. The music is really the saving grace. This is one of a small handful of foreign films that was also Oscar nominated outside of the Foreign Film category, this one in the Song category, Bruno Calais (who wrote one of my all-time favorite scores for the film Coraline) and director Christophe Barratier for the song \"Vois Sur Ton Chemin.\"",

One person was telling me what I should always know when I'm going to write about a movie, what I should care about, what I should investigate and other things. She was right, in mostly everything she said, but she was harsh on me. Of the people I know, I'm the only one I know who stays watching film credits; but I don't write all of the credits in a piece of paper instantly, you see? \"Les Choristes\" is a film with great spirit, carefully written, directed, composed and edited, that only fails to be great itself because of its trashed argument and its predictable plot line. Taken from the story of an old film written by various screenwriters, director Christophe Barratier and partner Philippe Lopes-Curval adapted the story about a teacher who arrives at a school and somehow changes the students' lives.Professor Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu must be a very well known character in France. It has been the main element of some movies and it is a peculiar person. He is portrayed here by G\u00e9rard Jugnot, probably as respectable now as any other actor who played the character before. Jugnot directed \"Monsieur Batignole\", a movie I never saw but many people talk about.I have explained my little culture about European cinema before, but I'm reading and writer Lopes-Curval has worked in a lot of the films Jugnot has directed. So I figure that the latter one knows the words and the way of writing of the first one by heart, and he speaks with the right tone and look that translate that to the viewer.Jugnot and his professor are the film's attraction; so was Robin Williams in \"Dead Poets Society\" and more recently Kevin Kline in \"The Emperor's Club\" or Julia Roberts in the very feminine \"Mona Lisa Smile\". But\u0085Of the movies mentioned, two were about learning poetry and human qualities, the other one about learning art; \"Les Choristes\" is about learning music.It's just a matter of time before the students who don't like the principal Rachin (a flawless Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and), become fond of Mathieu, the new teacher. And it's also a matter of time before Mathieu discovers that his kids can sing and decides to train them to form a choir (I was watching \"Sister Act 2\" the other day and I recalled the situation).Mathieu used to be a songwriter, so the choir becomes good and they make a presentation in the school, and although the director doesn't approve it, they achieve their goal. However, they don't go to a competition where they can win or loose, because this is a more personal story, and its resolution is personal.The environment is practically one and Barratier makes it beautiful and ugly when he wants to. It's a remarkable fact that Barratier himself also wrote the music and lyrics of the beautiful songs, and that the child actors are members of an existent and, as I heard, very respected choir (probably the best). It's a must see, because of the music mainly, and the rest is up to each individual.",

            "content": "Like Sound of Music and other several films that conquer the audiences' affection by depicting a music teacher transforming their naughty anti-social students into compassionate and happy ones, the Chorus uses spectacular techniques to convey the grandeur hidden in education. Clement Matthieu is indeed the paragon of all teachers, the audience will inevitably fall in love with him as the movie proceeds. As an epitome of all extraordinary reformers, he gradually nurture his students' souls instead of directly contradicting Mr. Haxon for his cruel and senseless abuse. He is the main reason I stared at my broken computer screen with sore sockets and dizzy head for 96 minutes.The film flows with a beautiful spontaneity and pleasant harmony, from the daunting prison gate and a morose little boy staring out of it, to the cruel action-reaction principle, to the terrifying noise and bloody jokes made by the students, the movie successfully created a challenge that make the audience gasp in awe. Then comes the idea of a chorus bringing order to the class and quenching the everlasting riots, with involuting development of P\u00e9pinot, Morhange, Mondain and Le Querrec. The highlight came when Mondain was arrested for stealing, Madame Morhange declared her marriage to an engineer, the duchess's condescending appreciation of the chorus, and the fire accident that induced the heated quarrel with headmaster Haxon. The director meticulously places events of similar tension together to pull the audience deeper into the swamp of entangled interactions between the characters. Unlike those cheap commercial films, the Chorus squeezes our attention tighter and tighter in its grip until the moment the screen blackens out. I signed with satisfaction and refreshment of my soul, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Can't comment on this film without mentioning the music. The director was formally a musician, background music and sound of the choir here is angelic, bleaching my senses with a transcendent pureness and comfort. The film wouldn't be so perfect if the audience aren't paralyzed by the heavenly music. The fluent camera angles and sincerity emitted from dialogues are perfect instrument of this huge symphony. The Chorus definitely deserves being stored in your watch list, and review whenever you feel rejected or exhausted or need of a loving mentor.",

Alas there is nothing in between. Only 25 miles away, is England's neighbour, France, which makes regular masterpieces, of which this is a prime example. It is set in the recent past, the late 40's, and concerns the redemption of a failed musician posted to a rural boy's school for rough kids and orphans. Gradually, and you know he will, he forms a choir from these no-hopers, transforming their lives and his own. It is full of charm, warmth, in the best classical way of film-making. A splendid effort, and rightly belongs in your DVD library. Excellent acting,art direction, confident and intelligent direction (surely big projects will now come his way). The music CD is on the best seller charts throughout Europe and understandably so. The music is different by juxtaposition: you see these poorly dressed scruffy boys, living under a repressive regime, yet singing ditties by Rameau like angels about dreams, oceans, and zephyrs. A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, released at the same time, is a big slick version of quirky Gallic charm, and also excellent, full of crane moves, great cameraman's set ups, and a big-scale version of personal versus macro scale ( a fianc\u00e9e searching for her missing soldier who did not return from the WW1 trenches ) yet between the two, THE CHORUS lingers in the mind with a fondness and a smile.",

Enter Clement Mathieu, (an absolutely remarkable performance by G\u00e9rard Jugnot that had me literally cheering) the school's new Prefect, a lonely, middle aged failed musician who narrates the story through his journal, and life will never be the same. An unlikely Mary Poppins, his effect on the students is life changing as he fights for less punishments and more socially rehabilitative activities for the ruffians in his charge. Eventually, he forms these troubled kids into \"The Chorus\" and the sound of beautiful music brightens the dank halls of Fond de l'Etang, changing the place forever.Inspired by his students, Mathieu's own rehabilitation - a restoration to the world of music, an occurrence of which he never dreamt - is as inspirational as any other aspect of this beautiful tale. He reaches into his soul and begins composing new music. In his journal he writes of how the boys may not understand the depth of what's occurring, but \"inspired by them, I compose, each day, for them.\" There is a sense of realism to \"The Chorus\" which shows not all of these misfits can be saved, and deception, hostility and disrespect, though seemingly diminished, never completely disappear. A potentially down beat ending reinforces that reality, but does not diminish one once of the sense of amazing joy this movie leaves you with. My highest and heartiest recommendation.",

Part of it may have to do with the fact that the music probably made a stronger effect on me in the theater, with a more powerful sound system. Listening to it tonight though just the TV speakers, I found that, while it is beautifully sung by the boys' choir, it is basically all affect with no real substance. Compare it with that of its old American counterpart, the Bing Crosby Christmas class *Going My Way.* Anyone can remember the songs that boys' choir sings, *When you wish on a star* or even the rather bland *Going my way*. None of the music in *Les Choristes* sticks in the memory like that.The acting is certainly first-rate, starting with G\u00e9rard Jugnot, one of my favorite actors. He isn't given a lot to work with here, though. There is no real conflict in his character, nothing for the actor to work with. The school director is uniformly evil, the other characters, even the boys, without three dimensions.It's all very pleasant, certainly, and I was never bored a moment. But it all seems rather obvious. The end is strange, looked at with today's eyes. I couldn't help thinking that today Mathieu would be prosecuted for kidnapping, at the very least, and probably be held in suspicion of child molestation, which is sad and certainly not an issue in this movie. I'd have to go back and watch the beginning of the movie, the frame, again to see if there is any indication of whether Mathieu raised P\u00e9pinot.An enjoyable movie, certainly. There just isn't much to it dramatically.",

We've seen this story too many times. Better told, by Dickens, and even worse, like in \"Devil's backbone/ El espinazo del diablo\" and Mr Holland's Opus.I liked the way it shows the harsh life of this forgotten \"layer\" of society, good for those who idealize \"all things European\" like I do. Yes, the scenery is beautiful. So is Marie Brunel (Violette, Pierre's mum), in a pivotal secondary role. The sexual tension is greatly resolved! Gerard Jugnot IS great as the self-effacing but brilliant school teacher. Rachin, the principal/ headmaster, is quite overdone and erratic, but I'm sure it's the story that sucks. He does very well with a stupid character. His final attack on Clement is well done, I guess it's the only moment I felt I wasn't watching a film for children.The boys are VERY well cast, all of them. From the soloist soprano (what a voice!) to the criminal \"Mondain\" (name! *like Dickens :) ), the curly one, the \"pedestal\", and \"Pepinot\", the cute dreamy one who longs for his parents. The countess is fine too.It has a lot to say about educators in harsh conditions. Things must be much worse now that then, but Clement would make a great child psychologist if he really were an unemployed teacher! This \"action/ reaction\" if of course a caricature of behaviourism. As such, it warns its most fervent practitioners I guess.It's a pity, this film could have been great, the topic is important for it to be treated like a (bad) Disney story. It even deals about child abuse in a great small dialogue in the beginning \"I expect everything bad about people HERE\" is the simple way the prefect/ guard Chabert sums it up. Who also ends up being charmed by Clement, who seems to have a way with everybody.Kim Anehall in Amazon writes greatly about how sometimes education receives the \"rejects\" from other professions, makes an intelligent analogy of Clement's \"rebellion\" to the way the French resistance worked, and describes very well the process it entails for him to win them over. Jeffrey E Ellis' Twain quote in Amazon is great, but could well be called \"spoilers\" too.Din't like this whole \"racconto\" and the fact the adult Pierre is a superstar musician. Found that particularly cheap, \"winners only\", very American in their worse sense. In he beginning Clement doesn't know how to \"stand\" in this fiery military-like regime, his body tells it all. Some jokes demand some knowledge of French history, like his reactions to a Vichy song when he \"auditions\" the boys, or the answer of one kid about Napoleon's death :). The best one belongs to him, of course, when speaking on hell left behind to Rachin. Also towards the same target \"I don't think you love many things\". Overall, forgettable fable.

In the movie the results of this abuse are apparent specially when the school burns down, the name of the orphanage is also a dead give away for the theme of this movie. It is quite obvious that the principal is getting his revenge on society by channeling his anger through the kids.

Second, a sentimental and touching film that doesn't descend into mawkishness or maudlin territory. And third, a simple and predictable plot that still holds your attention because of the charm of the characters.The story is set in post-WW 2 France, with destitute and/or orphaned boys in a harshly run boarding school. There's the usual sadistic headmaster, but the other teachers are far more human. (I wish we had seen more of these teachers, they would have added a great other dimension, and the movie is short enough.) The new \"prefect\" (teaches the kids but also chaperones them in their sleeping quarters) earns the trust and respect of these otherwise troublesome urchins by showing kindness. A musician himself, he finds that he can give them a positive outlet for their energies by forming a choir, at the same time finding an avenue for performing his own compositions.While simple and not very original, the pleasure of this movie is in the execution. The prefect and the various other characters are quite real and multi-dimensional; the bad ones have good qualities, and vice-versa as well. You really sense the despair of being imprisoned in that school for months and years, and the sense of futility which overcomes the staff. The music is haunting and beautiful, including the score and also the choral pieces practiced/performed by the boys.The ending is mostly satisfying, though not all the threads are tied up in the way one expects. The retrospective way of telling the story also adds some interest and poignancy, when you realize who those people were in the first opening scenes.Very strongly recommended and, except for a few vulgarities (which are probably a little less hard-edged in the English subtitles), an excellent family film.",

It's a heart-warming, feel-good yarn with great performances from everyone, but anyone with experience in education is going to have to suspend their disbelief from the ceiling, as newbie teacher M. Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot) effortlessly transitions from getting the tykes to chirp out snippets of naughty ditties to faultlessly harmonising Rameau before the school governors. Somewhere in the middle there, about half an hour of exposition is missing, in which Mathieu has to chuck out recalcitrant brats, knock heads together, and dish out lines. However, as I say, this is wish-fulfilment; we're in an imaginary past that should not be mistaken for today's reality. As fairy-tales go, this is wonderfully put together, and was a sure-fire box-office hit in France, where French womanhood could not fail to fall for all the lads and sing along with their divine music.

It's a small, sensitive and silent movie, not one of the big block-busters and that's what's good about it, because it gives the characters time to develop within the story.

            "content": "\"The Chorus\" takes place in post-war France as boys were placed in boarding schools that were places of both repression and refuge. What I liked most about this film was Clement Mathieu, a failed musician who takes a job as supervisor in the prison-like school, and his attitude towards a group of unfortunate and misunderstood young boys. He treated them with the utmost respect and believed that each one possessed a special gift or talent they could show the world. Two ideas I found interesting were the importance of the children's needs of fathers in their lives is explored in this film. This idea can be easily accepted because of how quickly the children began to have respect for their instructor. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. The children's affection was demonstrated after their instructor was fired by tossing goodbye letters out of the window as he walked away from the school. Another interesting idea was how the colors in the film set the mood for the audience. For example, to allow the feeling of transformation within the school, the color goes from grays, to bold and bright colors towards the end. Not only does this type of detail help set the mood, but also allows the audience to feel as if they were one of students in the film. A couple of things that were particularly French were the food that the children were served, and the principle's (Rachin) attitude of sincerity and outspokenness. The music, which was created by the film director, gives the film the right tone. It has such a sweetness to it that it disarms us and gets us into the right mood for enjoying it even more. The acting was very outstanding, simple, and comical at times, especially from Clement. The children were very sweet, especially the very little Pepinot.The director, Christophe Barratier, began his career as a classical guitarist, winning several international competitions. In 1991 he joined Galatee Films, where he was an associate producer on several movies, including \"Winged Migration (2001). He then directed his first short, Les Tombales (2002). He next wrote, directed and composed the music for his first film \"The Chorus\" (2005).

The first two times were in Germany, where I first viewed it in French, which I do not understand very well, and then in German, which I understand a little bit better. The DVD I purchased did not feature subtitles, so all I could avail myself of was choice of language. This gave me an unusual opportunity to see what the film is able to convey without its dialog. I have since obtained an American copy, and watched the film in French with English subtitles. I was deeply moved. The music alone makes the film precious. The contrasting character of kindly adults (Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu), unkind and uncaring adults (Rachin), good-intentioned adults (La Comtesse) and adults as victims (the older man who is injured by Le Querrec's prank), is well thought out and well brought out. Then there are the children, whose lifestyle and hopes and dreams are well conveyed in the music which Monsieur Mathieu teaches them to sing. It seems that all of the music was written by a 20th century French composer, with the exception of the Baroque composition, La Nuit, of Jean Philippe Rameau. I've read criticism that the boys seem to learn to sing overnight, but would people really like to see twenty minutes worth of really bad singing so that we can hear them going from bad to good? Each time I see the film it brings up a wellspring of emotion in me, with intense feelings of joy and sadness. I feel sorry for anyone who does not feel great emotion from viewing this film.",

Mondain, comes (I think) from a psychiatric or juvenile ward, and so his behaviour is wildly different. In contrast, P\u00e9pinot is a quiet and introverted young boy who is known as the cute one. Also, the chemistry between each of the actors is great, and the boys do a great job at playing boys. Though I am not used to the type of songs they sing, it is undeniably beautiful. I'm not sure about the other children, but Maunier can actually sing (and has pursued a music career since then) and so that was his real voice in the film. It is amazing how well he can sing from such a young age, and Jugnot is excellent at portraying his character's pride and amazement at discovering this hidden gem. His eyes are full of emotion when watching Maunier sing, and it transcends the scene, making the audience feel it too.

            "content": "I saw this film at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Les Choristes is an unabashedly sentimental film that reminded me very much of Italian films Ciao Professore! and especially Cinema Paradiso. It tells the story of a failed musician named Clement Mathieu who finds himself taking a job in desperation as the supervisor of a reform school in 1949. The school is run by an authoritarian tyrant and the students are a bunch of delinquents who taunt him immediately with shouts of \"Baldie!\" and \"Bullet Head!\". Mathieu decides to begin a choir as a sort of project to help with discipline and soon has the respect of the students. He also discovers a boy with a remarkable voice and does his best to encourage this gift while harbouring a crush on the boy's mother. This is not totally original stuff, but the story is told well and the performances are strong, most especially by G\u00e9rard Jugnot as the rumpled and lonely Mathieu. The resemblances to Cinema Paradiso are quite strong. Both films use a flashback structure. In Cinema Paradiso, a famous film director is called home to his village to attend the funeral of his old mentor, the projectionist at the local cinema. In Les Choristes, it's a famous orchestra conductor, called home to bury his mother, but the event triggers a visit from an old school chum who unfolds the tale of their music teacher Mathieu. The film is a \"man behind the man\" tribute to those quiet souls who push others to greatness while often not feeling very successful in their own lives. As someone who studied to be a teacher, I love this kind of story, even if it is not always fashionable in \"serious\" cinema circles. The emotions are real and are helped tremendously by a fabulous musical score and beautiful choral pieces.The director was proud to be presenting the film in Toronto after its huge success in France, where it sold eight million tickets and a million copies of its soundtrack CD. We were also treated to a performance after the screening of two of the songs from the film by another boy's choir, and the standing ovation was almost inevitable.",

We then go back in time to see Clement Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot ) starting work at a remote boarding school for troublesome boys. The headmaster thinks that harsh discipline is the only way to keep control of the school. Naturally the new employee thinks differently and through his own love of music he tries to make the kids lives a bit better.The film is beautifully shot, using the countryside and the old building that serves as the school to give us a feeling of the enclosed world of the boys. The sets and costumes are also excellent in giving us the sense of the era the film is set. The child actors are very good and the script does well to develop a lot of the boy's characters rather than just concentrating on one or two.The ending might be too sweet for some people's liking.

            "content": "Several people observed the plot to be simplistic, the characters to be mostly black-and-white stereotypes, consistency and credibility to be incomplete. Let's give an example: Even though passion and compassion are indeed key points of pedagogy, it is hardly credible that Mathieu might be so overwhelmingly successful while lying all the time. Even though he keeps lying just to protect the children, real children would continue lying at him as well.If you judge the film as a psychological drama, you will indeed find fault. Except Pierre Morhange, hardly any one of the characters experiences any development, and even the change in Pierre's character is neither painted in any detail nor particularly convincing. A drama would require unity of its plot; yet, the film contains several plots only loosely tied to each other: the injury of the caretaker and its consequences, Mathieu's struggle against the director, Mathieu's efforts to help Pierre find himself. No, this is not great drama.All the same, very many people were deeply moved by the film - how can that be? The film is allegorical, and allegory appeals directly to the heart. Mathieu represents Passion (incidentally, for music), Compassion and Tenderness (towards his boys). The effect of passion and compassion is Joy, represented by Pierre near the end of the film. The director represents the opposites: in place of Passion, Rage; in place of Compassion, Callousness; in place of Tenderness, Violence; the consequence is Torment, shown in Mondain. Pierre demonstrates that joy (shown when he first ventures to sing) leads back to passion (when he starts to strive for perfection) and ultimately to compassion (when he becomes thankful towards Mathieu). On the other hand, torment leads back to rage and violence (when Mondain physically attacks the director and sets fire to the school). And what does P\u00e9pinot represent? He doesn't have anything, he hardly knows anything, he does not do anything, but he is always waiting at the gate. That is Hope, and of course it is fulfilled in the end.Allegory does not need development, it is static in essence. Allegory does not need logical consistency for its power, but it depends on simplicity and beauty - and of those two, lots may be found in the film.It is not by coincidence that the whole film is placed in a universe by itself nearly disconnected from all the world we know - or the one our parents knew in 1949. This is indeed how allegory works best: any references to the complications of real life would just distract from the essence to be represented. Thus, for example, the boys sing classical music only - even though real boys of that age would have asked for contemporary music quite soon. Having seen this film, you would not guess that radio and television became mass media long before 1949.Now you probably wonder why i rated the film so low - even though i recognize it as a touching work of art in the field of allegory. Well, allegory was well suited to the state of human mind of the Middle Ages, and its last height came about during the age of Romanticism. In our time, allegory is no more sufficient to describe social or even moral affairs.Besides, the picture is not even flawless as an allegory. For example, i fail to understand why Pierre's mother is mentioned in the plot at all. She has no allegorical meaning, she pollutes the allegory by references to contemporary social reality (a single mother forced to work as a waitress), and - horrors in the context of allegory! - a story is told about her, a plain every-day love story. Perhaps the film-maker feared the general public would deem a film lacking any kind of romance just too boring.Besides, the film sometimes slightly drifts away from allegory towards psychological drama (without convincing in that field, as stated above). The director, as the allegorical figure of Callousness, ought not to enjoy the construction of paper planes, in fact he ought not to enjoy anything; as the allegory of Order and Authority, he ought not to act spontaneously, in particular not to join the boys in the football area after being shot with the football. In reality, even the worst villain may suddenly show passion or joy - but not in allegory.",

            "review_title": "Heartwarming Moments and Soaring Moments: My Discovery of Les Choristes",
            "content": "I was first introduced to Les Choristes in my eighth grade French class. I, an uncultured teenager, groaned at the mention of another subtitled movie. Spending the last period before lunch deciphering a poorly staged foreign film was not an idea I relished. Much to my dismay, the scene set on two elderly men reminiscing about their childhood. Fast forward 35 minutes for me and 50 years into the past of the old men, and I was in love with the romantically hopeless setting and the captivating soundtrack. Les Choristes had proved itself to be a heartwarming (though admittedly unoriginal) film that portrays renewed hope amongst corruption. The film prefaces at a desolate climate at a 'troubled' boys' school post World War II. Rachin (Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and), the bitter headmaster, rules with the overbearing model of \"Action-Reaction\". As the children act out, Rachin quickly and harshly punishes them, squashing any idea of freedom from his corruption. The maltreated boys whittle away in spirit as does their freedom to grow. Enter new supervisor Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu (G\u00e9rard Jugnot), a failed musician, knocking at the gates of the school, Fond De L'Etang (Rock Bottom). Quickly excelling under the tutelage of their 'underground' choir director Mathieu, the boys prove to be of more maturity than the name of their school would ever suggest. Whenever Mathieu suggests change, whether it is in regards to more humane disciplinary action against the wishes of Rachin, earning the respect of his students, or bashfully presenting his affections to a student's single mother, a flicker of fear on his face betrays his emotions. This is where the strength of Jugnot's acting lies. It is not found in large, overblown moments; Jugnot's quality is found in his small smiles of support to his students behind Rachin's back, in his caretaking of a bullied student, and in his softly spoken decisions of punishment and reward for the choir's talented, moody soprano soloist. Though Jugnot plays Matieu with phenomenally subtle emotions, the plot does not prove to be quite so sincere. It's a path well- traveled: An unexperienced teacher implements positive change by taming a group of abandoned students trapped in a corrupt system. Remind anyone else of Mr. Holland's Opus or The Dead Poet's Society? In fact, an old French film called The Cage of Nightingales (1945) served as inspiration for Les Choristes, so any originality that may have been left cannot be claimed by the writer/director, Christophe Barratier. While charming, the idea of a catalytic teacher painstakingly trying to connect to his students soon loses its warm, romantic quality and becomes stale. As a self-proclaimed music connoisseur, my struggle with the plot was soon forgotten with the airy, haunting musical score. Long, moving melodies of the boys' choir are used in perfect succession with the rising and falling hope in the movie. An orchestra-heavy background sounds dreamy in comparison to the unpolished voices of the boys' choir, which only further adds authenticity and playfulness. No knowledge of the French language is needed to enjoy this music, and any flaws with the less than original storyline are enveloped by the stirring score. It's raining as I now finish my review. Against all odds, the sun is still shining through the gloom to create an unexpected atmosphere of both melancholy and joy, much as the boys of Fond De L'Etang do. In this weather, I am reminded of the choir's beautiful, haunting voices, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu's hopeful story, and, most of all, of how a young eighth grade girl was able to look past unoriginality to find an uplifting tale of hope in Les Choristes.",

I obviously wasn't so crazy about it. Let's put it this way: if you can focus on inspiring core values and overlook obvious flaws, you may enjoy this film VERY much, and might also like \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"Mr Holland's Opus.\" If you're looking for a study of three-dimensional characters facing challenging problems in a complex reality, however, skip this and try \"Stand and Deliver\" or even \"The Blackboard Jungle!\" Ca suffit!",

There's nothing new in the story, nothing fresh in the \"mise en scene\", nothing archetypal in the characters. The most sad thing i have seen in this movie is how mediocre is the end resolution when the guardian/music teacher goes away from the Fond D'Etang with the children saying him goodbye. The \"mise en scene\" is so bad that Barratier loose a great opportunity to make this moment very much emotive: the time, the rhythm, the actor direction, everything is wasted. A movie not much better than perhaps hundred more movies premiered last year. It don't deserves the Oscar.(Can somebody believe this movie has get a consideration and not House of Flying Daggers?)",

I had never heard of it, I knew nothing about it, but I picked it up, read the back, and said \"Why not?\" I was very pleasantly surprised In a beautiful remake of the 1945 film \"La Cage aux rossignols,\" it tells a beautiful and inspiring story of a failed, in the dumps musician and out of work prefect, Cl\u00e9ment Mathieu, who comes to work at a school for difficult young boys. The general attitude of the school is \"kill or be killed, but he shares his passion for music with the boys and does his best to help them change their lives for the better. It became apparent that behind their hard exteriors, exactly how human these boys are.It's a very beautiful and touching story, and the ending left me in tears. I whole-heartedly recommend it.",

            "content": "When you look back at typically American films, with big budgets and heavy action scenes to stun and maximise viewing pleasure...they so very often fail. Recently i have been getting into foreign language films from France(Amelie), Italy(Cinema Paradiso) and Korea(Oldboy)and all of them have a lower budget and are less successful financially than your average Bruce Willis shoot'em'up. All the films i have encountered have had higher ratings and in some cases cult followings! What I'm saying is, these films obviously entertain (one of the soul purposes for films) so what is the purpose of the big budget pop corn movie is people are giving these independent and foreign language films a chance and are ....actually enjoying them! 'The Chorus' is a perfect example of this. It may not be the best film for depth and getting your teeth into and analysing but it does deeply entertain, it's an emotional experience for any audience. The acting is superb, very simple, almost slapstick comedy at times, comical timing is excellent by the supervisor (G\u00e9rard Jugnot), the performances of the children are brilliant but the only one who let them was the main boy at times. Well filmed with very appetising visual colours when you go on this journey of transformation of the school, the colour goes from depressing greys, to lively bold colours. The music is light but effective, a bit like the film. A little on the short side also! And all in all it is a brilliant little chapter in French cinema, which I have only just touched the surface of.Highly recommended!",

There are some part will make you laugh.The part that touched me is that touched me is when their music teacher Clement Mathieu left the school.You Don't have to understand French to watch this movie as there are English or Chinese subtitle.-From Jun Kai The show was funny, touching and exciting. Even though we don't know French, there is subtitle which was English. The movie has a good nice soundtracks .. The song they sang almost makes me weep. The acting of the children was amazing. The show was amazing.From Pig ChiaThis movie is about a class of naughty children and their new teacher. This teacher was not like other teachers because he did not want to scold the children. In fact he wanted them to learn music. By learning music, the children will be better. At last he set up a choir but was later told by the principal to leave the school because his choir had disturb most of the other teacher and their lesson. To me this movie is worth to watch because its not like other movies, it is comfortable to watch and relaxes me. Plus, I can learn English by reading the subtitles.From Gentleman93 Whether a person is very bad and behaves badly, he would also have his own dreams. From the film, i learnt that even adults must try to understand and believe what children say. Don't wrong a person when you don't wrong a person when you don't have good evidence.From Zhao Rong",

Actually, I watched this film by chance because I wanted to watch Genesis. However, Genesis stopped the play when I was going to the cinema so, I didn't watch it. I think generally the European films are better than American films because European film have more feelings also, artists and actors don't consider the money. The new generation American films have more visual effect but their purpose of money so, their films are became bad. However, this film's aim is making art. In order words, this film is typical European film. I think everybody should go to this film.",

The characters and the story come so close to each other that you wonder the director of the latter one has done this deliberately. But, I liked both the movies. The Hindi movie is a musical drama. In fact, there is a lot of drama in the movie. The Chorus has made it look like a mature presentation. The effect is really appreciable. You can sit and watch The Chorus and you will remember it for some time if you have not watched the Hindi version. However, for me, watching Mohabbatein earlier did not really help. It was all predictable. The English film is realistic and filled with events that will move you though the Hindi movie is equally moving, it is far from being realistic.",

Unsuccessful and boring plot has been the fate of French cinema for many years now, and they try to spice it up with heartwarming moments on screen but it doesn't really work. The movie has tons of potential to deepen the characters but instead, it uses a half worked romantic failure between a teacher and a parent. Which only works as a time filling section to beat the clock.The movie's bonding between past and present is so vaguely represented that it looks like an another effort time to play time.The music can be light on those thinking they'll see a musical/chorus movie but it is very competent for a family-comedy movie.",
