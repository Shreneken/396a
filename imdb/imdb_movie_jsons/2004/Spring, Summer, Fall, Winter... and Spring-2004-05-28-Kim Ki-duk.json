            "content": "The circle of life is everlasting. We, as busy humans, sometimes miss the opportunity to see it in full effect. The modern day conveniences of life and the hustle and bustle of work sometimes fog our eyes to the constantly moving world. Thankfully we have films like Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter \u0085 and Spring, to help guide us back to our roots. Through each season, director Ki-duk Kim shows us the journey of one young boy as he learns life through the hands and mind of an older monk. Through events that are beyond his control, this young boy learns about love, lust, jealousy, hatred, and eventually rage. He makes choices that ultimately effect his life causing turmoil and distress, yet somehow continually finds his way back to the floating house on the lake where his journey began. It is during his final visit home he learns of his final journey in life. As a new soul is handed to him, he embarks on a final journey using his master's lesson, to pay homage to the life he has lead. When I watched this film the first story that came to mind was that told by Trina Paulus in 'Hope for the Flowers'. It is the story of two caterpillars that embark on a journey into butterflies. Along the way they experience a full range of emotions that are attached to life and death. In the end, they become two of the most beautiful creatures in the world. This is how I viewed this entire film. I felt as if I was watching a young caterpillar (the young boy) experience life and journey along the path to become the beautiful butterfly. The beauty of the scenes and the simplicity of this story not drenched in words only kept this image vibrant. The spiritual themes of this film are present, but not bold. They are not hitting you in the face and forcing you to understand, but instead showing you and demonstrating the power of those willing to believe. This is a quiet film that leaves much up to our imagination. We never leave the valley that surrounds the lake, we never know what year is currently going on outside of the forest, and we are meant to understand that this story could take place anytime. Kim gives us themes that can be used to express any period of time and is especially poignant in today's terror filled world.I loved everything about this film. From the simplicity of the opening doors to introduce each scene to the stunning and hypnotic ending that makes you believe in the human spirit. If you walk away with anything from this film, I hope it is hope. Hope for everything on this planet, and especially a hope for our fellow man. Mistakes are made to learn by. Take these errors and accept them to move closer to the world you have always dreamed about. Be that young boy that is able to transform into the man he desires.See this movie, and feel a warmth like no other. This is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. Amazing!Grade: **** out of ****",

            "content": "In \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring,\" Kim Ki-duk, a South Korean director whose past films were often fueled by violence, does a complete about-face. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. In a tranquil and timeless setting of a temple floating atop a man-made lake in a forest, surrounded by mountain spires that cut the monastery off from worldly concerns, an old monk teaches his young disciple the wisdom of Buddha over the many seasons of their lives.But don't let the movie's mysticism fool you: This South Korean/German production has created festival buzz here. Sony Pictures Classics snapped up the picture in the second week. As it is chosen to be South Korea's entry into the foreign-language film Oscar competition, \"Spring\" should become an art house hit in North America. Set against the background of this floating monastery, the picture's only set, the film follows the lives of a child monk and his master through four different seasons of their lives. Kim infuses these episodes with Buddhist principles, which teach kindness toward all forms of life and the goal of inner peace. Yet the world does intrude into the serene hermitage, bringing with it life's pleasures and sufferings. Under the watchful gaze of an old monk (Oh Young-su), a little boy (Seo Jae-kyung) learns what sorrows his own cruelty can cause. As a teen, the boy (Kim Young-min) experiences the power of love and of lust when a young woman (Ha Yeo-jin) enters his life. Turning his back on the hermitage, he joins the world of man only to return years later, in anger and terror, when his desperate need for possession has turned to murder. Before police can arrest him, his master sees that penitence has cleared his heart and soul of all hatred. In winter, the old monk makes his funeral pyre. Then his disciple, now a mature man (played by the director himself), returns to the sanctuary of his youth. He seeks peace and quiet so he might fulfill his destiny. When a woman brings a male baby to the temple, the monk undertakes a journey of atonement to place a holy statue on a frozen mountaintop. Now he is ready to raise and instruct a new monk. Much of the movie is steeped in Buddhist mysticism. Each of the five episodes features a different animal -- a dog, a rooster, a cat, a snake and finally a turtle. For each season, Kim Ki-duk observes the change of weather and the relationship of man with nature. The film emphasizes the power of meditation and, in the episode concerning the murderer who seeks enlightenment, the need to perform a sutra to cleanse the heart of all jealousy and anger. Kim Ki-duk keeps dialogue to a minimum and actions simple in what is virtually a two-character piece. Humor arrives organically, often resulting in hearty laughs. Backed by a terrific South Korean/German production crew, Kim Ki-duk is in total control of his material, its rhythms and its tone.Spring - Child Monk takes life of animals out of innocenceA child monk ties a stone to a back of fish. Same plight awaits a frog and a snake. The child monk roams the brook in search of the fish and the frog as his punishment allotted by the old monk. Summer - Boy Monk in love learns obsession The monk is now 17 years old. To the lonely hermitage, a girl comes to convalesce. Before long, warm feelings towards the girl sprouts in the boy's heart. Their ripple in the water turns into an act of love.Fall - Young Monk in agony of malice The boy returns to the hermitage in the mountains as a young man in his thirties after committing a murder. The old monk whips him finding the young man attempting suicide in front of the statue of Buddha. Old monk order him to etch the Pranja-parpamitasutra, meanwhile he finds peace in his heart.Winter - Mature Monk in days of enlightenment The monk, now in his full maturity retraces his steps to the abandoned hermitage in the mountains. A woman wearing a veil visits the hermitage with a baby. She leaves her baby behind and runs away. And then spring - Another child monk : cycle of four seasons The old monk living with another child monk is having a peaceful time in the hermitage...the circle of life keeps on. Kim Gi-deok(b) has been known for making films that are involving but often difficult to watch. In his eight previous works, which include ''Som (The Isle),' ''Nappun Namja (Bad Guy)' and most recently ''Haeanson (The Coast Guard),' Kim has taken on such controversial and agonizing topics as the life of a prostitute, the love-hate relationship of a woman and a pimp who kidnaps her, and a soldier slowly going insane. For his new film ''Bom Yorum Kaul Kyoul Kurigo Bom (Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring),' Kim says he tried to change the pace and outlook of his films and show a different side of himself. ''I feel like I've been living my life in a rush, so I wanted to slow down a little and make a movie like this,' Kim said after a press screening.The film traces the life of a Buddhist monk as he goes from being a young orphan to an adult monk. Kim uses the passing of the seasons to parallel the monk's development and his experiences of desire, jealousy and rage.With a small cast, all of ''Spring' takes place in and around a temple on Chusanji Lake located in Mt. Chuwang National Park, North Kyongsang Province. A 30-ton set built specifically for the film, the temple floats like a wayward raft on the lake, accessible only by a small boat.With the construction of the temple and the logistics of filming on water, Kim says there were a lot of people behind the film that made it possible. ''They made something that it seemed could not be done work,' he says.The floating temple was used to show ''the speed in which life can change, the way that one can wake up and find that East has become West and West has become East, that irony of life,' Kim said. ''Spring' also shows Kim making his debut as an actor. Kim portrays the older monk in the film's winter scenes, a role he originally conceived for the veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki or renowned scholar and philosopher Kim Yong-OK. Both were unavailable due to schedule conflicts.After deciding to take on the part himself, Kim made the already physically demanding role, which included meditating in freezing temperatures, even more so. In one scene Kim climbs up a steep mountain with a large stone tied to his waist while carrying a stone statue of a Buddha with both arms, something he admits he wouldn't have asked another actor to do.A devout Catholic _ Kim at one point in his life seriously considered priesthood _ the director says the film in part was driven by his relationship between his own religious values and the culture around him.''All Koreans have lived surrounded by Buddhism and Buddhist culture is the foundation, which we acknowledge and accept,' he says.And though the changing of the seasons in the film is to show the life of one monk, Kim says it reflects the cycle of life in general.''If we were able to remember life's lesson from spring we wouldn't repeat them,' Kim says, ''but like winter which rots away the leaves and freezes over everything, like the seasons' patterns, our patterns in life will make us forget and repeat our past mistakes. ''This is not only a Buddhist idea but one of the facts of life.'",

            "content": "This film is a good example why cinema is called an art - this is not just another movie, but a real piece of art. The pleasure of seeing it belongs to the aesthetics, and it transcends beyond the action and beyond what only happens on screen, or what the characters say and do.It is both a simple and complex story - the story of a life, catching all seasons of development of man: innocence of childhood - so quickly lost unfortunately, mistakes of the young age, tragedies of maturity , and wisdom coming with the old age.The film is filmed at one location of a cut-breathing beauty. Beauty of nature is being maximized by the art of the camera. The soundtrack has little dialog, but the expressiveness of the actors makes the dialog useless. You feel the drama, you do not need to hear the words, and the music says more than words.There are a lot of symbols in this movie, and I probably lost most of them because they belong to the Budhist culture. There are however many other symbols that speak to the European spectator - the cycles of life, the rhythms of nature, the magic figure 4, like the number of seasons of the year, or like the number of parts in classic symphony, the unity of space as in Greek tragedy, and time - one life instead of one day, all give to this creation a wonderful symmetry and equilibrium.Worth seeing, this is a film that will make the delight of anybody who believes like I do that cinema is an art.",

            "content": "I remember when I saw this film on screen last year, I was struck by the rhythm director Kim Ki-Duk used in the film. It's deliberate, too deliberate for most I'd suppose. But like a reading good piece of philosophy, the filmmaker allows the viewer to get as much as they may find in the work. The story is more of a fable than a really conventional narrative- a baby is delivered to the steps of a Buddhist house on a lake, where the boy is raised by a master. He grows up, and falls temptation to the desires of the world. He decides to leave, only to return and find himself again. In the end, as winter comes, things come full circle. Each of the 'seasons' of the film are handled delicately, with the kind of simplicity that may appeal even more to children (the segment of the first 'spring' with the child transcends religion and goes into the basic stance of nature). The scenes of finding lust in 'summer' is not terribly graphic, but it puts the point on what is right and wrong in the customs and traditions of the religion. Then in 'Autumn', there are harsher lessons to be learned, and this also contains the best acting from the old master and the young, angry pupil. And 'Winter' becomes the most meditative of them all, with next to no dialog. Indeed that may be the turn off to most viewers- to say that the film isn't supported by dialog is an under-statement. And its not necessarily documentary realism. What I sensed from the film, and what stuck with me for a few days afterward, was the spiritual attitude behind the style, the confidence that the rhythm had a connection with the subject matter. It's one of the most soulful films to come out of the Eastern world in some time. It's less a traditional drama than a unique experience, for better or worse, really more for the better.",

            "review_title": "SYMBOLISM AND MEANING",
            "content": "At the risk of boring you all senseless here are some observations off the top of my head. THE HUT Representing the self. All the possessions and shelter needed is on the floating hut. When the young man can no longer live at peace and comfort in the hut then bad things transpire. He never commits lustful acts in the hut. When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we are never truly content.\nTHE DOORS The doors by the lakeside and in the hut are symbolic rather than prescriptive. The fact there are no walls means their use is not forced but elected. They represent morality and discipline. Morality is not defined by a higher power but by society and the self. By adopting the constraints the doors engender, self-discipline is attained. As soon as the young man transgresses these self-imposed boundaries, to sneak across to the young woman, then disaster follows. THE DEAD ANIMALS The Master allows the young boy to let the animals die. He does not become an all powerful father figure, cleaning up after him, but allows him to make mistakes and suffer the consequences. Buddhism does not have a higher power but rather promotes self-awareness. THE MILLSTONE AND BUDDHA Represent the twin stones of regret for killing the fish and the snake. What you do unto others, you do unto yourself. He has carried that karma around with him all his life until he transcends them both, carrying them to the top of the hill, near heaven. Here he cuts himself free and attains redemption through struggle. THE MASTER Is a great teacher, but does not lecture. Hardly a word is spoken, but lessons are learned. A good teacher points the way for a student to discover self-evident knowledge for themselves. THE MOTHER The veil, representing guilt and shame are ultimately the cause of her downfall. Hiding from the outside world can bring about ruin.\nTHE YOUNG BOY Both at the beginning and the end, represents us. A good life is attained not by the absence of bad thoughts, but rather by their mastery, so they have no hold over us. We choose our behaviour rather than it choose us. The new boy is not born without sin, but rather must walk his own path to divinity. The same actor playing the young boy show the eternal cycle of the human soul. THE SEASONS The endless cycle of birth, growth and death.",

            "content": "I'm constantly amazed by the appearance of some seemingly off-the-wall piece of art that when you view it evokes a stunning effect. The simplicity of this film, its low-key action and pace, its visual surrealistic beauty, all interact to create an emotional impression that is long-lasting and thought-provoking. Korea has been somewhat slower to enter the international cinematic world and here is a film with actors whose names stir little or no recognition. For myself, who has enjoyed the Korean films I've seen before, it was a delightful surprise. The film itself is a wonderful tapestry of Korean Buddhist culture, with quiet visual beauty, simple moral themes and human passions put into a simple, homespun perspective. The remarkable natural setting which reflects the wide spectrum of Korea's seasons, which range from hot, sticky humid-fraught summers to icy, cold snow-bound winters, become a metaphor of life with unadorned figures, completely human in form. The old monk becomes a witness to the interplay of human qualities, without judgment yet with a complete and quiet moral presence. The foibles of child cruelty is met with a simple retribution which imparts a lasting lesson. Judgment is always withheld and warnings are given simply. The effect of all of this rings long and lasting, much like the impression of a delicate Korean silk print: simple in design with plain brush strokes and stylized representations of nature-- yet, lasting in impression, often to the point of being unforgettable. I buy few videos and DVDs, preferring to see things I really enjoyed again and again. But, I've ordered this one.",

            "review_title": "Perfect Simplicity",
            "content": "Perfect SimplicityMy review of this film should end with those two words. However, the 10 line minimum requirement that IMDb requires of all reviews belies the differences between my world and the world shown to me in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring. I understand why IMDb does not want 1000's of (apparently) useless two-word reviews in their database. However, I would hope that they could make an exception for this film.Perfect: The film is as close to perfect as a film could get. No shot is presented to us, nor a line of dialog uttered that does not make us ponder and understand at the same time. The film is also beautiful. (Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Asian cinema and never tire of the stunning ability of Asian directors to capture beauty on film.) This film exceeds most other Asian films I have seen in the cinematography regard. However, its beauty is surprisingly deceptive. Like most great films, it surpasses the 'cinematography' level of beauty and delves into the beauty of existence through its story. For example, the Old Monk has a different pet during each 'season' of his life. This is not discussed by the characters nor shoved in our face by the director \u0096 as would have been done if Hollywood had done this film. It is merely background we experience and come to understand. Two days after viewing the film, I am still finding new reflections in my mind that encompass the cinematography, the literal story and the underlying context of the film.Simplicity: This film approaches a level of cinematic Haiku. While I don't recall the entire dialog with any specificity, I am sure you could print the script on one page of paper. The amazing part is that while you are watching the film, you don't notice this. Every shot moves the story along. The simplicity of life as shown by the story is reflected in the simplicity of the film. After the film ended, I had a strong urge to move away from civilization and live \u0096 or die \u0096 in peace with nature. I enjoy (and have come to be too dependent upon) modern inventions, so I will stay at home. However, this film will remain in my heart. It does exactly what good story-telling is supposed to do: Take us completely out of our world and put us in another. There is no wonder that this film was selected for so many film festivals.",

            "review_title": "Like Buddhism, this film is best seen with a clear mind and no particular expectations",
            "content": "This is a lovingly made and filmed movie. It's so artistically made and beautiful to look at that this alone is reason to see the film. However, the plot is something many Western viewers probably won't be too thrilled with unless they have a very, very open mind and are willing to see a film with an unusual structure and many odd allegorical elements--sort of like Buddhism, actually. The film consists of many wonderful and amusing moments, but also has many intense and even horrifying moments, so be prepared for an \"emotional roller coaster\".The film is about several seasons that are spread out over many years. The film begins with a little boy who is the apprentice to a monk who lives on a shrine built in the middle of a lake (Spring). It then moves to the boy's early adulthood (Summer), then after the boy has left and committed a horrible crime (Fall), followed by the boy's return to the shrine many years later after his master has committed suicide (Winter) and is then followed by a woman bringing a new apprentice to the shrine (Spring once again). The film is very well made and interesting, but ultimately it may leave you a bit confused and even irritated that, in many ways, the film is as much about redemption and rebirth as it is about death and nothingness. The film is definitely one that will strongly appeal to some and turn others off due to its sad and confusing tone. An odd and strangely beautiful film chock full of religious imagery and oddness. It's definitely worth a look, given that the viewer appreciates international films and is open to non-traditional story-telling.FYI--The DVD said it was rated R for 'strong sexuality', and while there is indeed some nudity, it isn't all that intense (you see a guy's butt while he is making love--nothing else is shown). In fact, possibly more disturbing to kids and teens (and some adults) are some of the very adult themes--such as ritual suicide by fire and murder. While I wouldn't show this to kids, this MIGHT be appropriate for older teens--use your judgment and see it first before showing it to them.",

            "content": "\"While the film deals with Buddhist themes and elements, I made this film without having studied anything about it at all.\" - Kim Ki-dukFilms that leave me feeling spiritually uplifted are often subtle and understated in their evocation of the transcendence of the human spirit. On the other hand, those that \"try\" to impress us about how spiritual they are often fail to achieve their desired goal. Such is the case for Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring, a South Korean film by Kim Ki-duk that works hard at conveying a spiritual experience but comes across as labored and self-conscious. While the shots are beautifully composed, the film offers little more than pre-packaged enlightenment, reiterating the accepted clich\u00e9s about the long and painful process, the uphill battle full of struggle and effort, and so forth.Set in monastery on Jason Pond, an artificial lake in North Kyungsang Province in Korea surrounded by a forest of ancient trees, each season represents a chapter of life and the achievement of a hard-earned lesson. An old monk (Oh Young-Soo) teaches his young charge (Kim Jong-ho) about the value of all sentient beings. After the boy playfully ties a rock to a frog, a snake, and a fish, the old master shows him what it feels like by tying a huge rock to the boy's back while he is sleeping. In the morning, he is told to find the animals and free them or he will have to carry a rock in his heart the rest of his life. Unable to do so, the boy grows up with a burdensome guilt.By the following season, the young monk has become a 17-year old adolescent and is mesmerized when a beautiful teenage girl dressed in blue jeans shows up in his floating paradise, She has been brought by her mother because she is \"sick\" and wants the monks to \"cure\" her. After some time spent in prayer, the old monk tells the mother, \"When she finds peace in her soul, her body will return to health.\" The soul cure is found pretty quickly when the young monk undoes his robe, letting us know that all women need to do to achieve health is to find a man. The old man confuses love with lust and utters such strange teaching as \"lust awakens the desire to possess, and that awakens the intent to murder\". When the girl is sent away following her cure, the boy also leaves the monastery and the film takes a non-Buddhist turn toward obsession and revenge until the cycle comes full circle.\nSpring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring cultivates a mood of serenity but, from the opening moment to the final credits, it struck me as inauthentic. Buddhism is a disciplined system of mental and spiritual development designed to develop compassion and loving-kindness for all beings. Its practices include daily meditation that calms and clears the mind and allows us to gain a clearer sense of who we really are. This does not guarantee that we will never make mistakes but it is not credible to me that a boy raised from birth in the Buddhist tradition would be capable not only of cruelty to animals but to other human beings as well. At the end of the film I felt neither moved, uplifted, or even involved. If enlightenment means to lighten up, the best medicine for this sort of hokum is to laugh gently. After all, this too will pass. There is a cycle to everything -- even bad movies about spirituality.",

This is a film to stay away for those interested in fast action or special effects. No one is going to find them here.  What the viewer will get is a feeling of well being and inner peace. The director seems to be teaching us a lesson in how anyone can achieve  nirvana through self examination, meditation and doing good no matter to whom. Also, how cruelty, be it against a harmless animal, or a human being, will haunt those who transgress throughout life.The acting blends in with the serene beauty of the temple in the middle of the lake, as we watch one season following another, as seen by the amazing cinematography by Dong-hyeon Baek.",

            "content": "'Spring, Summer, Autumn - (or Fall, if you will)- Winter\u0085and Spring' is, as the title should imply, a fable very much in the 'cycle of life' cache, so simply crafted and yet so flowing with gentle complexity at the same time. It works wonders both as an episodic coming of age saga concerning one man's life-long quest for inner peace and balance, and a refreshing type of character study where actions and physical mannerisms are thrust more attention than words; the dialogue here is minimal, yet the two key characters still display a surprising amount of depth - every subtle tear and drop of sweat adds up - and I found myself completely drawn in by it. The background settings are as delightfully picturesque as background settings come, and the movie's pacing is both gradual and thoughtful, while still leaving room for some slight drizzles of drama, and a handful of haunting, even harrowing, moments which capture the rougher side of living, but nothing to detract from the overall calming sensation you're left with. The result is a seriously unique slice of life and inspiration, and hats off to Ki-duk Kim for it.Overall, things are left ambiguous enough for us viewers to draw our own merry conclusions, and so rich in all those little minor details which build up the bigger picture that you could spend hours assessing them right down to the very last shade of blue, and dissecting each and everything for all the symbolism and abstract concepts they might embody. It's one of those flicks that has different meanings to different people, I guess. Personally, I'd be happy enough taking it on its direct face value level - things are what they are, they're there because they're there, and what you're seeing is exactly what you get. Cast all possible symbolism aside and it's still a perfectly effective offering about the trials and triumphs of one man's life. And yes, this particular life's complicated enough without all those itty-bitty extra meanings.The Holy Man's ever-changing assortment of animal companions are probably the best example. We go through the various seasons always with a puppy, chicken, cat, snake or tortoise successively at our sides, and viewers are liable fill up an entire message board debating whether it's the positive or negative aspects of our protagonist they're meant to symbolize - the chicken being lust and brashness, and the puppy being youthful ignorance, the cat being idleness, etc.But really, their exact species, in most cases, is pretty incidental - their reason for being there doesn't need to be anything more complicated than simply to emphasize time and the changes it entails. A different animal with every new 'season' further marks the shift in time since our last visit to the temple. Note also that the snake arrives on the scene exactly as the older man departs (you don't really need to be familiar with Buddhist practices to follow this one, although it might be helpful to know that apparently that is actually an established self-cremating ritual which comes of knowing the exact moment of your death in advance, and not a suicide by any means), and you can take it as a hint that it may well be his reincarnated self (it's lovely BTW to finally find a flick where snakes are represented in a positive frame). In light of that, isn't it also kinda tempting to subscribe to the possibility that the remaining four could also be the reincarnated souls of the temple's former residents, whoever they might be? That notion satisfies me a lot more than that of the chicken just standing in for some hot burning passion, or whatever.Then there's the mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. And that's all she really is - a mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. Her exact identity isn't revealed, and nor does it have to be. And we don't really have any means of working it out either, so why worry about that? It is clear though that she's a desperate person in such dire straits that she's forced to conceal her real identity and depart ways with her son, and we can still feel for her on that.In short, this film is what you make of it, and it more or less goes without saying that it only becomes a complicated puzzle if you make it one.My own personal quest for inner peace still continues but, needless to say, this movie provided me with 103 beautiful minutes of escapism and bliss.",

Its as mawkishly sentimental as any Robert Redford bit. And you can't quite take it as a film made in the Buddhist manner. It isn't at all, not even close.But the manner in which it IS made is wonderful. Its spatial cinema, that rare thing that I comment on from time to time. This has a wonderful setting absolutely wonderful. The entire film is in a temple that floats in a placid lake, sometimes moving. The surrounds are lovely mountains, but that by itself is not enough.And its not just that the place and space is photographed in a rich, lovely manner. Its how the camera seats itself in the temple, so that even when you are in the forest nearby the cliffs and trees form temple walls. Its all about the temple, not the two men portrayed (and circularly merged into one man).Watch how the camera establishes itself first on one of the architectural features as an edge or frame, then moves to an individual. Watch how the filmmaker moves your familiarity with the space into a central feature of the story towards the end. As it happens, the \"script\" of the story is written on the stage of the space (in ink dipped in a cat's tail), and then carved with a knife, then again painted and finally aged into the place itself. Its a masterful cinematic effect. Just masterful and trumps the moral and all else.Watch it for that. It ain't Buddist, but it is transcendent. The parts of the space weigh on you like the stones attached on the outside at the beginning and the inside at the end.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

Despite the simplistic nature of the narrative and the ultra-slow pacing, this is a beautifully shot and thoroughly engrossing movie that had me absolutely captivated at all times.As suggested by the title, the film is split into five parts, each of them exploring a different stage in the life of a youngster apprenticed to a Buddhist who lives in a remote floating temple on a lake. The photography is frequently stunning, bringing the glory of nature and the seasons to life in a way few achieve, and yet the human story is just as compelling.Be warned: this isn't some twee, genteel movie that avoids reality. It's a story that depicts the often ugly sides of human existence, with themes of animal cruelty, lust, and death dealt with quite explicitly. Yet this is what makes it great: it's a film that fully captures the human condition without shying away from the harsh stuff. Needless to say the acting is wonderful, particularly from Young-soo Oh as the elderly monk, as is the film itself.",

The only clue I had was the scene's subtitle: \"Prajnaparamita Sutra \u0096 it helps restore inner peace.\" Those were the words the Old Monk used to describe the sacred teachings that the Young Monk had to carve out as penance for his crime of passion. When I looked up the Prajnaparamita Sutra on the internet, I found out it was known as the Diamond Sutra of the Buddha. The Buddha spoke the wise words in a monastery near Sravasti, saying that \"this sutra should be called the Diamond that cuts through illusion because it has the capacity to cut through illusions and afflictions and bring us to the shore of liberation.\" There are 32 sutras or sections, and the 32 sections are also \"marks\" that are used to meditate on \"the Tathagata\" \u0096 which means \"the suchness of all things (dharmas).\" The meaning of Tathagata is \"does not come from anywhere and does not go anywhere.\" The insight into the truth of the sutras consists in a realization that \"the idea of a self is not an idea, and the ideas of a person, a living being, and a life span are not ideas either.\" A self-realized or awakened \"Buddha\" is called a Buddha because he/she is free of ideas.The \"Buddha\" in the Diamond Sutra is also called the World-Honored One, and his message can be summarized by two axioms: (1) \"Someone who looks for me in form or seeks me in sound is on a mistaken path and cannot see the Tathagata.\" (2) \"All composed things are like a dream, a phantom, a drop of dew, a flash of lightning. That is how to meditate on them, that is how to observe them.\" Now I will have to watch the movie a third time and meditate on the 32 marks that the Old Monk draws with the cat's tail on the floor of the ashram. I will also feel the urge to count and see if there are really 32 marks.",

            "content": "SPOILER: Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumn \u0085and Spring is something of a self conscious art-house film. Possibly Kim Ki-duk is trying to work off his reputation for making movies replete with violent sexual imagery, but he's not fooling anyone. Spring\u0085 contains \u0096 admittedly in a much more restrained form \u0096 most of the themes from his earlier works, The Isle and Bad Guy. Onto this, however, is pasted a hefty dose of Buddhist teaching. Or, from another perspective, an interesting juxtaposition of old and new.Beginning in the Spring of an undefined year close to the present, the film is set on (and I mean, on) an isolated lake. A child acolyte lives out a life of quiet contemplation, punctuated by occasional acts of petty animal cruelty. His master, a monk, observes his young charge with increasing disapproval and orders him to undo his evil or face the consequences in his own life. It soon becomes apparent that he means this in anything but the figurative sense.Moving through the seasons, Kim explores the \"cycle of life\"; with his acolyte experiencing youthful love (or lust), anger, violence and finally acceptance, contrition and peace. The film ends with a new acolyte and a new cycle: implying an endless repetition with subtle variation.Spring\u0085 is not exactly a subtle film, but it is beautifully done. Kim uses silence like few other filmmakers, matching Kurosawa or Bergman at their best. He punctuates these long slow movements with abrupt changes in tempo \u0096 such as the arrival of Yeo. The pace quickens and the mood changes. The courtship of the adolescent boy and girl are some of the gentlest scenes in cinema (though culminating in a suitably Kim-like, energetic coupling).With popular Buddhist and Confucian ideas now so firmly established in cinema (thanks in part to their bastardisation by George Lucas), the ideas in this film aren't exactly going to leave its audience in need of a large glass of perspective and soda (to quote Douglas Adams). Lust leads to possessive urges, which lead to violence; ones violent actions lead on to violence against oneself; peace (and redemption) is found not through approbation, but understanding oneself.I can't quite dispel the notion that The Isle, with its sly humour and darker plot is a better film, or that Spring\u0085 is, if not completely then at least partially, up the bottom of its own artiness. That said, it is a very, very pretty film. Its story is intelligent, if not awe-inspiring, and it is a delightful change of pace from most modern cinema. Most of all, it is probably one of Kim's most accessible films, and I shall certainly be watching it again \u0096 if only to see Oh Yeong-su practising his calligraphic art with the tail of a live cat. 7/10.",

I found the discussion group on this film (see IMDb's Message Board for this film title) VERY helpful in illuminating the symbolism which I partially grasped the first time I saw it and in decoding some Buddhist principles.The setting and the photography that captures it are strikingly beautiful and satisfying. The issues are so universally human that the Buddhist flavor provides an accent and not a barrier.The story recounts the growth of a child into his adulthood and his eventual reclaiming of his roots and meaning. While the film deals with other Buddhist principles and symbolic elements, a central part of it very much reminds me of lines from T.S. Eliot's \"Four Quartets\" which reads (loosely remembered) '...and the aim of all our wandering is to arrive again at the place from which we started ---- and know it for the first time...'As one sees one cycle end and another begin, it made me wonder about how the old monk first got there and what his life was like.Symbolic. Complex. Elegantly simple. Beautiful. Evocative. Haunting. Provocative. Gently touching the universal religious and the profound.10/10 =============(SPOILERS AHEAD) After 2nd time (03Mar2011):Buddhists are against hurting animals. SO why wouldn't a wise monk intervene when the young boy in his care was tying stones to the animals? --BEFORE they died? And be aware that teenagers have hormones that often steer them? The recurring gratuitous punitiveness and pain bothered me: the monk beating the young man's back, the demand to carve all night 100s of characters into the wooden deck, the self-immolation, the pulling the weight up the mountain, the nude torso in winter, etc.As if enduring pain for pain's sake helps anything but masochism or sadism?The film's photography did remain very beautiful to me on the 2nd view.6/10",

            "content": "The movie \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring\" (2003), directed by Ki Duk Kim, is a true masterpiece, that covers philosophical ideas, like life cycle and attachment to things and people. The movie shows different life stages of young monk, who was raised by older one. In all scenes, they live in the temple, which is located in the middle of the lake, surrounded by mountains and fosters. In the first scene (Spring), boy tied a stone to the fish, frog and then to the snake. It is not clearly shown his motivation to do so, and I am not sure that he intentionally wanted to harm them. He was very young, and it is more likely that he did it because he found it interesting and amazing. However, our actions should not harm others' lives. The Buddhist monk saw his action and harshly punished his disciple by tying larger stone to his back. He wanted to give him lesson and said that he should release all animals from the stone, and if someone is dead, then \"you will carry the stone in your heart for the rest of your life\" (m. 16:08). Fish and snake were dead. The facial expression of disciple in these moments was priceless and very emotional. I had the opinion that he might have trauma for life. It was not clear for me, why the teacher did not help these animals; he saw everything and did nothing. I hope he might find other ways to teach him a lesson without harming animals and disciple's psychology.\nIn the second moment (Summer), the disciple meets a young girl and falls in love with her. He decides to go after her and renounces monasticism. His teacher said: \"Lust awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder.\" (m. 47:38). He was right, at the end the disciple murdered her because of her desire to be with another man. This moment illustrates that nothing is forever, the love, desire, feelings, people are all temporary and leave all of us soon.\nIn the third moment (autumn), the disciple flees after murdering and returns to the isolated temple to his Buddhist teacher. The movie in this scenario raises another important question. The Buddhist monk said to his disciple: \"Sometimes we have to let go of things we like. What you like, others will also like!\" (57:34-57:41 m.). We can not affect to the feelings and desires of others. When we want something or someone, our emotions take hold of us, and we stop to think rationally. As a result, the desire will turn into obsession, and in this moment the obsession turned into killing the person, whom he loved. As Buddhist monk assumed, everything is temporary, and we can not control others' desires, and we sometimes can not even control our own desires and emotions. The best way in such cases is to let go of our desires and loved ones, especially when it is not mutual. I do not clearly understand the ending of the episode, when the Buddhist monk decided to commit suicide. I had some assumptions: he wanted to atone because of his poor education to his disciple or maybe he wanted to free his body and everything. Then, he was reincarnated to the snake. Reincarnation is one of the important concepts in Buddhism.\nIn the fourth episode (Winter), the disciple returns to the temple after the jail and again became the monk. He tied the stone and climbed to the top of the mountain with this stone. The possible reason is that he wanted to let go of the guilt, which started in the beginning of his life, when he tied the stones to animals. I think this guilt haunted him all his life up to this moment. In the beginning of this episode, woman left the child in the temple. Monk decided to raise a child as a monk.\nThe next episode, called Spring, is one of the most important episodes in the movie, because it shows the cyclical nature of life. Child repeats the actions of the disciple in the beginning of the movie, but instead of tying stones to the animals, child puts the stones in their mouths. It shows that everything in life repeats. The only thing that we can do is to help others not repeat our mistakes. I am very curious to know how the monk would decide to educate the new disciple. Will he choose the same method as his Buddhist teacher or another method?! We could help others live a decent life. In other cases, as its theme shows, everything will repeat in this life and spring will start again.\nIn this movie, I liked everything: the content, soundtracks, the acting, nature, animals. It was interesting to see some concepts and elements of Buddhism through the life of the disciple. That is why my rating for this movie is 10/10.",

            "content": "This story of the life cycle of a Buddhist monk and an apprentice living in near isolation on a floating pagoda in the middle of a lake is beautifully filmed. The images and music create a distinct mood - the scenes of the apprentice doing T'ai Chi (?) on the snow and ice are poetic. But I had some real problems with the story.First, some technical concerns. Many scenes seemed contrived or not believable. For example, when the old monk ties the stone on the sleeping child, can it be believed that the kid would not wake? Or that he would not notice his new burden sometime during the night? The interior of the pagoda was exceedingly sparse, but no end of things kept coming out of it: ropes, stones, ice chisels, clothes, paints, and so forth. The doorway in the middle of the empty room irritated me every time someone felt obligated to walk through it when walking around it would have been much easier. How did these people earn their living? In thinking about the scene where the apprentice is hanging from the ceiling in a sling on the end of a rope with a candle burning under the support, I wondered just what the mechanics were of arranging that. The old monk seemed pretty weak, too weak to tie the apprentice up and hoist him several feet into the air. And what was supporting the rope from the ceiling? Was there a pulley up there? How was the rope affixed to its ceiling support? Where did that aluminum can come from that the police were shooting at? It was the only item ever to mar the pristine beauty of the lake, and at just the appropriate time. And the old monk was able to flick a stone and hit it on the first try? And he just happened to have a small pebble in his hand right then? Painting all those carved characters with a cat's tail would require a mighty patient cat. And where did all those colored paints come from? The hole that the apprentice chipped into the ice was nowhere big enough for the woman to fall through. And so on.Now that I have run through some of the petty concerns of a literalist, I can move on to what really bothered me about this story. The overall message appears to be that isolating yourself from society is the path to some higher state. Even if that were true, it seems like a selfish goal. Much more challenging and useful is to attain balance in the midst of the chaos that is living in the world. The old monk utters the words, \"Lust awakes the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder,\" as if to express some deep insight. However, it is the rare person who has not experienced lust, but only a tiny percentage of those ever have an intent to kill. These words from the wise man seem patently false. But, in the context of this film the words have a more potentially worrisome significance. Perhaps the import of the words carried such weight for the apprentice that the intimation planted in the mind effected the deed. The lessons meted out by the master seemed exceedingly harsh. If tying a stone to a snake were to kill the snake and the snake were to die, then the kid would have to carry that burden with him for life? What a traumatic thing to say to an innocent kid. If as a kid I had had a super moralist following my every move, as this kid did, I would have gone nuts. I found the sadomasochistic beating to be disturbing and repellent. And what is the deal with the worshiping of icons? I though the sacred was in the mind and not in physical objects? If everybody were to absorb the teachings of the master, then our race would soon die out since sex seems to be avoided at all cost. I have found that an intense day of tedious activity indeed produces exhaustion, as did the apprentice, but it never seemed to be a path to the catharsis and peace that the apprentice experienced after his ordeal. And the master could beckon an empty boat to him or impede the rowing of two vigorous men by force of mind? Give me a break.There is too much Eastern philosophy and mysticism here for this Western viewer.",

Still, it is a beautiful piece of film-making, and it has enough developments to keep your attention despite the simplicity of the setting and the scarcity of characters and dialog.As a symbolic tale, I didn't think it was simple at all. It was about the attempt - the failed attempt - to attain peace and serenity. It showed that no matter how lofty your ideals and no matter how much you isolate yourself from the world, the human condition remains the same. Life on the remote lake ultimately mimicked all the chaos, anguish and meaningless pain and death of the outside world. The monk's faraway place of worship became a lie; an escape; a retreat from the madness that had infected the monk himself as much as everyone else in modern society. A place for atoning for past sins, rather than living some virtuous pious life. A form of therapy rather than a noble pursuit in its own right. A self-inflicted prison, almost.So the film-maker did not endorse any kind of romantic view of the monastic life style; he did not say it was an improvement over an ordinary life style. He said that Buddha may soothe, but he can't heal. While I'm not religious, I do believe that high ideals are capable of changing things for the better, so I'm not sure I can agree, on the symbol plane, with the film-maker's message.7 out of 10.",

The symbolism of the boat is most appealing, although the buddhist spiritual scenes threw me off course at times.

The dialog is sparse, and what there is of it is in Korean with subtitles; there's no gunplay and very little violence; there's simulated coitus but no nudity; things seem to stand for other things but we can't be sure what; and there are elements of spirituality and mysticism in it.Ostensibly, it's a film about a Buddhist master who raises a young boy at an isolated shrine that is occasionally visited by people in need of a religious cure, something like Lourdes but without the least bit of glitz. The old master is kind and he enjoys the boy's presence but he's harsh when he needs to be. When the little boy torments some small wild animals -- a fish, a frog, a snake -- the elder has the boy torment himself in the same way. This early incident, which I found rather touching, sets a pattern for the rest of the story, in which the boy grows up and runs away after a sick young girl finds a cure for herself, murders her, and finally returns to take the master's place. That's the explicable part of the story. There are many incidents and some characters that I can't explain, not being particularly cosmic myself.The photography is exquisite. Every shot is rather like a carefully composed watercolor. The acting on everyone's part is fine, even if most of it is physical instead of verbal. Of special interest is Yeo-jin Ha (it's spelled variously in English). She's of special interest because, well, for one thing her clan name isn't Park or Kim. For another, as the sick young woman who visits the shrine for a cure and winds up having the now post-adolescent monk put the blocks to her, she has the fragile beauty of a tiny porcelain doll. When the young monk teases her, then while draping a quilt over her sleeping body, he inserts his hand under the quilt and tries to feel her up, it's hard not to understand why. (He gets a slap across the face for his sins.)I'll mention another incident that comes out of the blue -- or the pale green or the lavender. The young monk who ran way now returns, mature and angry, having killed his wife for being with another man. The elder monk has him use the murder weapon, a knife, to carve out an astonishingly long number of character on the wooden pier. Two detectives come to arrest the murderer, but the old monk asks them to let the criminal finish carving out the characters, which will take him until the next morning. The cops agree. Near morning, when the killer finally collapses from exhaustion, the two cops, out of curiosity, begin to help the old monk fill in the carvings with paints of varying colors -- and the detectives really are bewitched by the task. Can anyone imagine such a tangent in an American movie? I don't believe in mysticism, angels, jinn, karma, kismet, Madam Blavatsky, or anything much beyond a drab mechanical universe, but I recommend this film highly. I suspect, like the two detectives, like me, you'll be swept up unthinkingly into the enterprise.",

            "content": "[s p o i l e r s]A tiny temple floats rafted on a lake, surrounded by mountains and trees in a gorgeous nature preserve in Korea. A boy is in the care of an austere, calm religious man. The boy is playful and silly, but his play turns wicked. As he and the old man do their daily foraging on nearby land for food, the boy discovers a cruel game: he ties stones to a fish, a frog, and a snake to hamper their movements. The holy man crawls around watching him, saying nothing (the movie has almost no dialogue), instead tying a big stone to the boy's back while he's sleeping. When the boy awakens he tells him: go and find the fish, frog, and snake and set them free, and if any of them have died you will carry that stone in your heart for the rest of your life. The fish and snake have died, and the boy weeps inconsolably. And that is the end of \"Spring.\" `Summer' comes and the boy has become a young man. He succumbs to lust when a beautiful young woman who is sick is brought to the temple to stay. The youth and the girl sneak off frequently to have sex, flopping like fish on the rocks. The priest knows what's going on, but says nothing, till it turns out she has been cured -- by the lovemaking, it seems -- and he says she must leave. He warns his disappointed pupil that lust leads to possessiveness and possessiveness to murder. An abrupt sequence, that: alternatives and subtleties are omitted. The youth's response is to abandon his teacher, sneaking off in the night on the rowboat with a small \u0096 stone -- Buddha statue in a sack on his back. In subsequent seasonal segments we learn that the young man has suffered dire consequences in the world. In the \"Fall\" segment he returns; is taken away and punished; and at the end, in the \"Winter\" segment, returns honed to physical perfection and walks across the frozen lake, ready to replace the priest and take on his own boy pupil, brought by a woman one can only describe as masked in shame. Spring comes again and the cycle starts over.\n\"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring\" (does the title sound catchier in Korean?) has been greeted with such reverence there hasn't always been much analysis, and it's full of puzzles and challenges. First of all, there is the eternal conflict over the relative validity of active and contemplative lives. The boy who's taught not to be cruel to animals by the equally cruel method of having a stone tied to his own back, and who weeps so bitterly when he learns he's caused the fish and snake to die, isn't prepared by his life in the tiny temple to resist lust when the young woman comes to visit. He's told by his holy teacher that lust leads through possessiveness to murder, and after he runs away he indeed murders his wife out of jealousy. Very good for us to see this validation of the guru's causal sequence, but what good were the his teachings or his methods for the boy turned into a man, if he returns to the lake filled with rage and pursued by police detectives? Could it be that the teacher can't really teach; that the peaceful Buddhist retreat, which is all an invention by the Christian-trained (not Buddhist) Ki-duk Kim, is a nice place to get away to \u0096 perhaps one of the most gorgeous places ever filmed, the more so as seen gloriously transformed through the four seasons \u0096 but not a place where one can learn how to live in the world? It is helpful to have been told since seeing the movie that in Buddhist tradition holy men know the moment of their deaths and that the priest's self-immolation on the boat is therefore a logical and necessary ritual within such tradition. Also valuable to learn, post-viewing, that remains of holy men are deemed precious jewels: hence the accolyte's carving out of the frozen boat where the old man has died and planting pieces in the Buddha he has carved in ice. But who can explain the woman without a face, her head swathed in a mauve cloth, bringing a weeping boy? Why does the priest write the sutra using the ink-dipped tail of a whining cat? Why does the priest, immitating his angry former pupil, paste papers over his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth with the word \"shut\" written on them at the moment he accepts death? Is this idiosyncratic avantgardism or reference to another Buddhist concept? No doubt the fact that the role of the grownup acolyte who once was the boy playing cruel games with small animals is taken by three different actors -- the last the martial-arts-skilled director Ki-duk Kim himself -- means that all these experiences are universal and have happened to many men. But this is a movie, and it would succeed better as a movie if its seasonal segments worked either as completely separate short stories or as a running story with well-established continuity. Let us also note that distracting visual beauty can be counterproductive in a movie that means to be intellectually stimulating. It's no accident that more than one writer has called the effect of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring `hypnotic.' In a state of hypnosis we may learn nothing, or we may forget what we've learned.\nTo a non-Buddhist the movie indeed seems steeped in Buddhism. But like so many religious idylls, it preaches to the converted. There are those of us who will leave the theater entranced but unconvinced. And the persistent harshness and cruelty of this movie, so serene and lovely on the surface, will also leave a troubling impression. Ki-duk Kim shows a notable gift for combining dream-like fable with fabulous scenery; he certainly coats his doctrinal pills \u0096 if that's what they are \u0096 in lovely and memorable images. But however exquisite looking and provocative this movie is, it's not for everyone. As the priest's unsuccess with his pupil suggests, religious teachings only bear fruit on fertile ground. One may walk out feeling it doesn't all hang together or make enough sense without an exegesis, though sometimes it's also too free with bald truisms.",

            "content": "Kim Ki-duk continues to solidify his position as one of my all-time favourite directors. Every film I've seen from him has been a unique experience, yet all of them share similarities that make them instantly recognizable as a Kim Ki-duk film.This particular film is one of his best critical successes and in some ways a new direction for him. Most of his films are at least somewhat urban in nature and deal with themes such as sexuality, detachment and the effects of loneliness. And while those themes are also explored in this film as well, it feels different. The story goes that there's a lake up in the mountains, on which floats a small Buddhist temple. A lonely monk takes care of the temple, accompanied by a small boy. The film follows the events of the temple throughout the years, watching the boy grow as the seasons change. Each season is given a clear separate story, a separate mood, a separate set of symbols and omens.In some ways the film can only be understood if you know enough about Buddhism and its particular symbols and teachings. Then again, I certainly didn't, and I still enjoyed the film immensely. I also enjoyed learning about the symbols and meanings afterwards as I was reading about the film.And quite frankly that's about as much as I'm willing to say about the film. Because to say more would ruin the experience. Know that it's not a very fast-paced film. It's not about great characters or complicated dialogues. Rather it's about mood, about ideas, about silence. Very much worth a watch and a great place to start if you're unfamiliar with Kim Ki-duk.",

Indeed the first two chapters \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" were promising, leading up to a plot which manages to hold the attention. After this is starts to go downhill and the final third is just awful, with a few very silly scenes. Also lacking is any kind of subtlety. You expect a quite thoughtful meditation, but really you get a series of really simple dumbed-down messages like \"it is bad to hurt animals\" or there are consequences to evil acts. The director is not content with making a point once, or obliquely, he has to make the point three or four times each chapter. This points to a basic lack of editing directorial concision. For instance, the child monk in \"Spring\" is naughty, mean to three wild animals, a fish, a frog and a snake. The master chastises him an makes him rescue the animals. The whole series of scenes where the child finds each animal in turn and then has to rescue each animal afterwards are needless filler. One animal would have made the point far more clearly and forcefully. Given the quality of the visuals available and the basic concept of the story a much better movie could have been made.",

            "content": "The seasons are allegorical, the movie follows the life of a young boy on the way to manhood under the watchful eye of his Master. I found the wisdom of the Master to be guardedly accurate, EXCEPT when he made the observation to Young Adult Monk that's in my summary above. The Master's statement has the effect of making his observation inevitable for the Young Adult Monk as he sets out into the 'world of men'.Obviously, this didn't have to be. But a young man who cannot control his passions, even over the infidelity of a wife, is still accountable for his actions if they result in murder. The crime the Young Adult Monk committed is troubling within the context of the story because it seems to me he should have learned something from his Master over the years to make his life more productive. He expressed remorse as a Boy Monk when he tortured the animals with a stone. The Master taught him a valuable lesson about carrying the weight of a stone in his heart for the damage he had done to one of God's creatures.Fortunately, the Young Adult Monk was made to repay society for his crime. It would have been inappropriate for him not to face justice. But when he returns as The Adult Monk, he returns with the same heart of stone he left with, and pursues self tribulation to cleanse his heart of it's guilt. The disgraced mother who brings her out of wedlock child to The Adult Monk symbolizes the way he himself may have arrived at the floating monastery to be placed under the care of the original Master. So describes the arc of the seasons in a person's existence, though in this case, one of pain and sorrow instead of joy and fulfillment. In another more uplifting film, this would have been called the Circle of Life.To my mind, the picture would have been more fitting to convey a positive attitude with a positive outcome, but of course, life isn't often scripted that way. Considering that, the film offers an excellent cinematic experience, with the change of the seasons displayed in a vibrant array of textures and colors. This was my second viewing of the movie, and I found that it had gained greater resonance for me than the first time I watched it a number of years ago.",

This film traces the life of the young monk as he grows into adulthood and old age, with each stage of his life represented by a season of the year.This film perfectly exemplifies Buddhist teaching and ideals in both its narrative structure and its message. By framing its story within the changing seasons of the year and of life, it reminds us of the impermanent yet recurring nature of each stage of existence. The great Gautama Buddha sought to help people understand why they suffer and how they can end their suffering. Siddhartha Gautama taught that by maintaining the proper perspective and welcoming each change in one's life, we may avoid the sorrow that comes from clinging to either the joys or sorrows of any given season, and thereby achieve balance.A simple but very effective piece of film-making.

            "review_title": "...and Spring.",
            "content": "The title gives away the structure. It is Spring, and a floating temple is surrounding by an idyllic lake and mountains all around. A young boy giggles endlessly while abusing animals in the most unusually cruel way, and no doubt Kim Ki-duk has inflicted this in real life as it is on the screen, leading to that entire end sequence being cut in the US. Not that I agree with animals cruelty, but there is nothing to be gained and much to be lost by removing the entire ending of a film. Upon being discovered by his master, the boy has his own cruelty imposed on him, and the young actor's ability to laugh and gurgle so unmoved from his acts but also sob endlessly is marvellous. A stone is placed in his heart, and its burden remains for much of his young life. Summer opens as all the other seasons do, with the creaky beckoning of the doors of the archway which often frames the floating temple. Now it provide a docking point in the heat of summer, while at other times it is half submerged by the tide. It provides a purely symbolic function, much like the wall-less door in the temple itself, but signifies the devotion of the Buddhist lifestyle that is marred when the now teenage boy commits theft and flees. He is blossoming sexually, wrapped up by carnal desire, but is also conflicted enough to pray relentlessly and tearfully upon his defeat to temptation. The first instance of sex is framed by a extreme wide shot of the two against the rocky shore of the lake, and I am struck by how much this seems like animalistic behaviour in the wild, of filming a documentary where two creatures unexpectedly give into their biological functions. The master is not furious when he catches him, but warns that a strand of lust and desire will lead to greater wrongs. He carries two items as he flees, heartbroken; the rooster is a purely selfish act, while the statue is the weight of the teachings that cannot be separated. The last shot is of sunlight being pushed out of frame by storm clouds.Fall brings orange leaves and the boy back, now a young man and having committed murder because of his undying love. This is tragic because it shows the pitfalls of the religion and also the solitary lifestyle; he has been taught to repress such desires and has not adequately understood love, and so chases after a woman who, he has shared more sexual experiences than words with. The rock is at its most heaviest here. And yet the master is once again not furious, but wholly accepting. He beats him not for the murder he has committed, but for trying to escape its consequences through suicide. Kim di-Kuk masterfully imbues a peaceful silence as the man carves out his repentance (an admittedly cheesy moment when the master silences the gunshots with well thrown rock). Even the two policemen become swayed by this peace. As he is taken away for physical punishment, there is a achingly beautiful time lapse shot where the water and leaves tremble, and the temple slowly but surely floats across serenely. This signifies the end of the master's life, having done all he has done. There will be another master.Winter, and the lake is frozen in time. In an incident of karma, a veiled woman arrives, proceeds to abandon her son, and pays dearly with her life. The middle aged man, nearly complete in his repentance and understanding, merely accepts this as it is, just as his master did so long ago. We do not see her face, but does it matter? It could be any of us. The soundtrack is at its most dramatic here. A tense orchestration strikes up as he begins a training montage, moulding and sculpting his body according to the meditative teachings, acquiring peace of mind. He gracefully poses upon the slippery surface without the least bit of concern - he has mastered the surface, and the water that he once struggled with so much. To complete his journey, he once again inflicts the punishment of the animals. The traditional ode Jeongseon Arirang is particularly lifting as he beings the ascent to the mountain. Crosscut are a frog, fish and snake struggling and writhing, mirroring his pain. It has been merely an hour in runtime since those childhood actions, but it feels like a lifetime. Life returns us to Spring, and again we have a young boy torturing animals, and showing a lack of awareness of what is to come. But the final shot offers a different perspective, of the Buddhist statue overlooking the lake and its temple, framed and isolated by the power of nature. The cycle of life and birth and reincarnation has brought us back to this point, but the trials and tribulations of a man promises release from this never-ending cycle. The colours and words of the Heart Sutra are now faded, but its lessons remain.",

            "content": "\"Lust awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder.\" \u2013 Old Monk Another minimalist mini-masterpiece by Korean director Kim-Ki-duk, this one revolving around a Buddhist monk who lives in single-roomed monastery which floats at the heart of a serene lake. The monk is the master of a young boy, but their relationship is largely wordless. They spend their days meditating, exercising and praying, occasionally searching a nearby forest for medicinal herbs.The film is divided into five sections (spring, summer, winter, fall, spring) and portrays a cyclical world of actions and reactions, seeds sown and fruits later reaped. The two monks have no names, desires, lusts or possessions, and simply exist in a kind of limbo, floating on their lake, seemingly \"at one\" with nature.This utopia is disturbed one day when the master finds his student torturing several animals. Saddened by the violence buried deep within this child, he punishes the kid by tying him to a large rock. The kid repents for his actions and the film leaps ahead several years.The kid is now in his late teens, and is sexually attracted to a young girl who is staying at the monastery. Overcome with lust, he sneaks out every night to have sex with her. When the master discovers this, he grows furious and bans the girl from his temple. Unable to live without her, the boy leaves the monastery and follows the girl. They get married, she cheats on him, he kills her. All this drama happens off-screen.Chased by the police, the young monk returns to his master. The master shows him pity, and once against helps him repent for his sins. \"Lust awakens the desire to possess,\" the old monk says, articulating the message of the film, \"and possession awakens the intent to murder.\"Sounds like something Jedi Master Yoda would say, but it's actually one of the central tenets of Budhism. IE- all suffering stems from desire, and so one must free themselves entirely from \"Tanha\" (thirst) in order to achieve \"upekkha\" (peace of mind).More time passes. The old monk dies whilst the young monk is released from jail and returns to the monastery, taking his master's place. He finds a child there and the cycle is repeated, master and apprentice, student and pupil, caught in the wheel of life.8/10 - A unique film, with two flaws. The film romanticises Buddhism, turning it into a kind of mystical \"eastern way of life\" (the film was mocked in Korea and seems to mainly appeal to westerners). Ultimately, the fetishizing of these \"eastern religions\" serves only as a balm to sooth the alienation experienced in the West. That by \"tapping into\" this foreign \"Zen\" we might solve our own problems.Secondly, the film's treatment of sex is a bit off-putting. Abruptly filmed, the sex scenes don't mesh with the rather serene aesthetic of the film. Of course this is intentional, the previously repressed monk suddenly becoming unhinged by desire, but the way the film portrays him as a salivating cartoon is a bit distracting.Worth two viewings.",

The scenery takes a front stage in this film which is quite meditative simply to look at. An island hut floating in the middle of a lake and protected on all sides by mountains. And i don't believe that the feeling of cold has ever been so evoked so wonderfully on film. The characters (who have no names) move about in this scenery less like individuals and more like chess pieces going through moments and movements even they fail to grasp the significance of. My only complaint was the handling of the build up to carnal exploration which feels a bit forced, and lacks any of the singular obsessiveness which drives such emotions.8 out of 10",

Without a doubt, this movie requires deep thought, but with careful examination, this movie is definitely one that strikes into the deepest of hearts and souls. The film's chronicle of a young monks journey from an innocent youth, to a troubled adolescence to a reborn adulthood is extremely deep, with all kinds of messages that emphasize the importance of spirituality and the dangers of lust and sexual obsession.The film technically speaking is beautiful to behold. Korean movies generally come out of the same mold. In other words, they are very colorful and the picture of their films are sharp and vibrant. This is especially true in the widely popular Memories of Murder (Or Salnui Cheouk) and Kim's follow-up film, 3-Iron (Or Bin-Jip). The environment of the forest is especially engaging to the eye and it adds to the isolated atmosphere of the film as well as the isolated personalities of the characters. Techinically speaking, Kim does a fabulous job with this film and the beautiful cinematography is one of the many reasons why Kim is slowly becoming one of the more recognized Asian filmmakers of his generation.However, cinematography can't do it alone. The theme of the film as well as the development of characters is extremely important in a film. Kim goes with a different approach in this film that most filmmakers aren't bold enough to do: he relies on silence and actions rather than dialog (much like his follow-up film, 3-Iron, in which his main male protagonist doesn't say one word). It sounds eccentric, but the characters do show their personalities well and the theme of the film is also carried out in a way that words could never do. While this further shows Kim's greatness, a great deal of credit goes to the actors as well. Their excellent performances with such a limited script is commendable and a premiere example of a new kind of art form that is developing in film during this century.Without a doubt, film purists and art-house film lovers will adore this film, but overall, anyone who has an open mind should feel at home with this film. Granted, like his other film, 3-Iron, this movie is not the kind of film that you can sit back with your friends and laugh away with a tub of popcorn. Instead it is a serious film that displays that film is art and a brand of literature, and like those two genres this movie should be studied and analyzed in order to get the most out of this film. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is a pensive film, but for those who put the time in analyzing this film will be rewarded with a message and work of art that is like no other. Kim's latest film, 3-Iron was a study of love and relationships. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring is a study of the growth, fall and rebirth of life.Final Analysis: Excellent!

Surrounding and permeating it all is the circle of life, repeating itself over and over again: spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring again. A year, a lifetime, what's the difference? These are the ingredients of Ki-duk Kim's invitation to lean back and watch, to contemplate and meditate, listen closely to the inner self. While the scenery is guaranteed to impress its viewers right away and throughout the picture, the story itself is basically an allegorical offering, a fable if you will, a touchstone for the individual to measure one's self. Kim's film is simple and straightforward, with no unnecessary embellishments that distract from its core, speaking to the heart and told primarily in images with only a handful of characters and next to no dialog - you won't miss anything. However, while the film is directed to the soul searcher in us it doesn't evoke a philosophically imbued melancholy you might find in European cinema for thinkers represented by the likes of Bergman or Tarkovsky. Rather it opens the doors for you to get immersed in an Eastern world view and it does so with bravura without being preachy or over the top.Ki-duk Kim has a rather diverse oeuvre to offer, but the zen-like quality one finds in \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" is also present e.g. in his fascinating work \"3-Iron\", whose original Korean title \"Empty House\" is much closer to what the film actually tries to convey. In both films food for thought is embedded in a seemingly straightforward story that can resonate deeply, given the viewer's mindset to welcome the Buddhist spirit. It helps to think about the endless sky. Mountains. Trees. Pristine nature all around. And a lake with a single house on it.",

With a very different rhythm and a sense of quietness very unusual, the movie tells us a tao story inside the most spectacular mountains of Korea. Dialogues are forbidden (almost) because they are not needed, and it is task of the actors (good job) to make us understand what is happening. Though being very different (this may do not like to everybody), the photography is superb and the story, though very slow (as demanded in the atmosphere of the film) is very touching and heart-taking.",

The story of the boy who's raised by an old, wise monk, is deeply philosophical and fascinating as we see him growing up and changing with the seasons of the year.The visuals are breathtaking and are a great example of the saying \"an image is worth a thousand words\". The brief dialogues are sharp enough to make you reflect with the protagonist and therefore, with yourself - about your own life and the \"small\" choices we make every day and change our whole lives. A nearly flawless film, which can even be compared to Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, \"Wild Strawberries\" (1957). Kim Ki-Duk (who also has a cameo as the adult monk) is a writer/director to be noted. 10/10.",

This is only what I got from it - I'm sure it holds a thousand messages.\nThere are very few words spoken, and what is said therefore holds great importance. One of the first things the master says is that the boy will carry the weight of the dead animals throughout his life. And he does. Then the master says that part about lust leading to possession leading to murder. And he does. I think the master kills himself because he realizes his own responsibility in the boys life: the way his words have the power to create, and how they perhaps got the boy into jail. I'm not a Buddhist but suicide is a huge deal and I'm sure it is in Buddhism too. Or maybe he wanted to free the boy of himself. He did have creative powers: we saw him will the boat to come to him, or to stop. And then, once out of prison, the \"boy\" realizes he has to become a master himself to a new boy. But he understands The Cycle and wants to get rid of it as well as The Weight. So he takes it all as far as he can get it from the house but still within view as a reminder. And then is free to teach the new boy, and be master himself. And when the new boy goes torturing animals, he is no longer there, like the original master was, watching over the new boy's shoulder. And so the cycle is broken.\nThe message I got from this film is that as any figure of authority, one needs to really really deeply think about their own responsibility, and scrutinize the power they have.",

            "content": "I think I met Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring by accident while browsing IMDb. It was possibly a movie similar to something I saw, but it might just be random. Or maybe I was seeing through the top#250 and realized I never saw this one.An old monk lives in isolation in a house in the middle of a lake. With him lives a young boy who is training to be a monk. One day, the young boy attaches a rock with a string around a fish and laughs at the fish that is painfully trying to swim away. Oblivious to the fact the old monk is watching him, he applies the same treatment to a frog and then a snake. The old monk attaches a string and a rock while the boy sleeps. When the boy wakes up, he complains that he cannot walk because he is attached to a rock. The young monk then realizes it was wrong to do so to the animals and the old monk tells him to go free the animals. If any of them died, then the young monk will have a heart of stone for all his life.Years passes and the boy grows into a young adult when a young woman comes visit them to cure her bad health, the monk quickly falls for her. The woman first ignores him but they soon fall in love and sex comes naturally after. The old monk who ends up seeing them does not blame the young monk, but as the woman's health is much better, tells them that it was the right cure. Once the woman is healed, she prepares to leave-- a painful departure for the young monk, who one morning, abandons the lake and flees... But he is bound to return some day.First of all, I have to say that this was one of the most beautiful movies I have seen. Not only the scenery, but the house in the middle of a lake and in the middle of a valley is absolutely stunning, and the passing of the seasons--which are not only metaphorical of the life of a person and the emotional states of their mind--are also filmed in their respective corresponding season. This all adds up to create scenes of rare splendor.There is a real clever economy of dialogue. There aren't many to begin with, but the ones present are carefully picked and always speak volumes. The relationship between the old and the young monk (who is played by a different actor in each and every season) is complex but a pleasure to watch. I admittedly haven't deciphered all the symbolism, for example, I don't know if there is an explanation as to why each season finds them having a different pet with them, but I am certain there are explanations.I was most stunned with the winter scenery when the water turns to ice. The movie has a lot to say about the cycle of life, the cycles through life and the repetitive wheel of fate. It seems to have quite a fatalistic take on life as the mistakes of our childhood can carry through a whole life, or maybe this is simply a symbol.In a way, I wish that the two young people didn't have sex, it seemed too simple to have them go for it simply because they are the only two in a deserted place. I wanted the young monk to show remorse or guilt in regard of his faith but very little of it was used. This is only a detail and I think that quite realistically what happened in the movie is what would happen in most cases.The movie is a tour de force. The filming must have been a patient task over different seasons but also for the actors, especially the one playing the adult monk (who is in fact the director) and how he had to walk on a lake of ice, fall, etc. There are such beautiful scenes around the pond, whether it's the ice sculpture or the young boy who is smaller than the head of the Buddha. And the wooden doors with paintings that open for every season on a new scenery. The doors could be another theme as the doors in their house were quite interesting.I liked: The scenery. The economy of dialogues. The evolution of a person. Asceticism and faith. It's a film that can't leave you indifferent.I disliked: Is it pessimistic? Fatalistic? It is hard to decide. I found the segments of Spring and Winter superior to the rest.93/100 I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Movies with a capital m, the ones that hold a message, a meaning.Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com",

            "content": "This film is beautiful in all ways. Its setting is a lake somewhere in Korea, separated from the rest of the world. The main characters, which remain nameless through out the entire film, are a monk and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, living on a houseboat in the middle of the lake. There is serenity to the film, which is rarely disturbed by dialogue. The majority of the story is told visually.The film tells the story of the prot\u00e9g\u00e9's life; the journey he takes from innocent boy to teacher himself. Each season comes with it's own fable. In spring, the boy ties a rock to a fish, frog and a snake. He giggles as he watches them struggle but when the monk ties a rock to the boy's back, he tastes his own medicine. In summer, the boy, now a teenager discovers attraction and lust for a young woman brought to the lake to be healed. He experiences the pain of losing her, which will carry into fall where, now a man, he must be redeemed for a sin brought on by his actions in the summer. With winter and age comes the test to walk in someone else's footsteps and by spring, life starts over again.This film brings the whole range of emotions to the table and subtly places each somewhere in this vast story. Only a little over and hour and a half, it feels like it truly could be a lifetime with its slow pace. However, its slowness is not a burden but serves more to enhance the slow quality of this type of lifestyle. In the Western world, we are a fast moving people. Even the two hours it takes to watch a movie often seem too much for some, who feel that they have too much to accomplish in a day as opposed to what we see in this film. Sometimes the simplist life will have the most to be proud of in the end.Not lacking in the technicals, we are given a vast array of wonderful film-making aspects to chew on. The score, like the lack of dialogue, is never over the top or intrusive. The music, composed by Ji-Woong Park, is the perfect compliment to the cinematography, by Dong-Hyeon Baek. Both are understated, and simple. Still, like the film they grace, they are deeper than the four seasons.Ki-duk Kim's screenplay is beautiful, although at times perhaps too simplistic, and contains a beautiful idea. It's the pacing that really brings the story to life. It is sure to remain one of my top screenplays of the year. It's not a story that sweats the small stuff. It's rare to see tales that accomplish this much without feeling over the top. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring is a masterpiece. ****/*****",

With the shifting of each season, the story turns the page on a new chapter, many of which skip decades at a time. While this allows the central character, who is never named, to grow vastly in spirit between appearances, it also makes the task of forgiving his larger sins more difficult for the audience.

Since a lot of talk is about this being a meditation.Sit on Zen Master Huineng's koan of koans, \"Without thinking of good or evil, show me your original face before your mother and father were born\". Carry it around with you for a few days, like you have swallowed a stone and you want to make air of it. It has no answer other than air you will breathe out again.Leave this film for when you want to marvel at an Oriental postcard. I'm familiar with Buddhist practice and do not think this is a very good Buddhist film, not at all actually. It seems like something made from the typical clich\u00e9s about Buddhism and little of the actual heart.The whole point here is that we are rooted in this one place, a remote temple in the middle of a lake surrounded by mountains, as waters of life flow through their cycle. We're taught basic precepts; suffering, the blinding that is desire, transience. Letting go of self and being one with this. And everything having to do with waters and reflections of the floating world is worth seeing, the temple gliding on waters.But the filmmaker gets everything else off. He sees in symmetries, dramatic symmetries, whereas Buddhism thrives in the spontaneous asymmetry of the world simply revealing itself. He is quick to wound and quick to sing about beauty. Karmas are melodramatic. There is no right concentration, no real middle path and only extremities of feeling. There is too much misty-eyed romance regarding Buddhism, for instance the scene with martial arts out on the ice photographed for splendor.An indicative misstep for me is how casually it depicts self- immolation, one of the most sacred images that I know of in Buddhism. It weighs on the old monk's heart that he has betrayed his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but to throw his life away so easily and when so much remains to be done with this sentient life? It rivals A Touch of Zen's actual depiction of nirvana as offensive.It possibly makes some sense to see as another drama of scented orientalism. But it's not meditation, it's not even a very good spiritual film. See if you can find another Korean Buddhist film called Why Has Bodhidharma Left for the East?",

It's an incredible location that remains as we make large leaps through time. The film makers have made the absolute most of their location with excellent cinematography. I also really loved the music which varies from ambient to amazing singing.I loved the start of this film, the spring section, it was a very early peak for me. Here we see the student of the temple as a young boy. In terms of child acting this is about as good as you'll ever see. He's allowed to behave in a perfectly natural way, rather than acting, and that gets the absolute best from the section. His childish ways of interacting with the world feel very real, and are both funny and poignant as he learns valuable lessons. The film continues with this more amusing tone as the student moves into maturity. Some of the comedy works really well here, and some of it falls a bit flat. I felt this is where the characterisation of the student fell a bit. The film has a tendency to draw things out in such a way that they can be very effective, but they can also be slightly awkward. The film becomes far darker and more serious, but also wants to retain a darkly comedic element, for me it doesn't quite work tonally. Throughout the film are two constants. The symbolism, and the Master. So much symbolism in this film which certainly adds a level of intrigue as you form opinions as to what the recurring imagery could mean. The director has done a great job of putting these things front a centre without having them be a distraction. The Master is a brilliant character, wonderfully acted. Subtle and mysterious, very little of him is revealed which gives him a wonderful air of mystery. All in all, this is well worth a watch. Beautiful to look at and will leave you pondering once it's finished.",

            "content": "Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom, better known as Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring is an artistic film by a South Korean director/writer, Kim Ki-Duk. His films haven't been that successful in his home country, but they are internationally very popular. His films have got a lot of nominations and prizes from many European festivals. After seeing a few of Kim Ki-Duk's films on TV, I decided to rent Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring, because of its huge appreciation. Quickly I found where all the appreciation had came. Later on I had the chance to see this on the big screen, in a film theater. I've mostly written this review according to my first time experience, but the second viewing opened some new stuff up too. This is a breathtakingly beautiful tale of moral growth.An old monk lives with his young student in a floating temple on an isolated lake. He observes the young boy's games with animals. The boy learns. The boy grows into a youngster. A young girl comes to the temple to heal. The boy falls in love and goes after the girl to the city. He comes back as a murderer, gets in jail. After many years he comes back as an older man, gets a student and teaches him.That is briefly the storyline of this film. It's a growth story divided in five parts. The first part, spring, shows the boy's childhood. The way he treats animals and the way how the monk gives him a lesson of life. He never could forget the traumatic experience, the horrors he did to the animals. The second part, summer, is about his youth. In that era he meets the girl who comes to the temple to heal. They start having sex and try not to let the master find out. When the girl gets healed and leaves, the boy goes after her. In the third part, fall, he comes back as a murderer of his wife. In the temple he manages to achieve inner peace. The fourth part, winter shows us his return from jail to the temple. A masked woman comes there with a boy. In the last fifth part, spring (again) the boy, the woman brought becomes a student of the man. We see the circulation of life.And that is the main theme of the film, circulation of life. As in the beginning the boy played with animals, in the end the other does it too. It makes us wonder about the life of the first old monk. Did he go through the same as well? The burden the boy had to carry through his life is turned into a stone here. Guilt. The life he goes through includes some of the most touching scenes in the history of modern cinema.This film is an incredibly beautiful tribute to nature and life. I always thought that La Grande Illusion (1937) was the only film that managed to actually salute to life. Even that this is a completely different film, this managed to do the same. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring will make the most die-hard sons of the western-world realize the true beauty of nature, life and the eastern wisdom. Through that this film is a must-see for all the people.As other films by the same director have proved that he has a great talent of visual narrative so did this. The film doesn't have much of a dialog, which was to me one of the best technical things in this film. I understand that many Europeans/Americans might have a problem with that. Because most of us aren't used to this kind of narrative, at least the people who only watch mainstream and commercial films. But those people won't probably even come across with a gem like this. This is a quiet, non-hectic growth story. In addition to its marginal dialog it has a lot of symbols and many of them might be totally unknown for the people of the western world. But that's not a bad thing it's the reason why this film can be watched so many times. It made me to go through some Buddhist symbols in the internet.Earlier I named the circulation of life as the main theme of the film. But it also deals up with themes like: guilt, regret, learning, growth, spiritualism, wisdom, lust and greed. The latter can be proved by the rooster. The rooster is a symbol of greed, a desire to have and own everything. \"Lust awakens the desire to possess.\" As the old monk said.These are the main things I wanted to mention of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring. It's a great film and to keep this as short as possible I left a few things away. By that I also wanted to let you observe on your own to achieve the highest possible enjoyment. This is maybe, dare I say the best film of the decade. Even that I haven't yet seen all the films of the decade, but at least this is one of the best. A very touching experience.",

There an old monk teaches a little boy harsh lessons about life. Years later, the grown boy falls in love with an ill girl, who came to the temple to seek cure. Her body is unharmed, but her spirit is troubled. She finds salvation in the boy's love. Here we have some erotic scenes, I guess they were meant to be pure and innocent looking, but there's nothing really remarkable about them. Later on the boy leaves his old life behind and escapes from the temple to be with the girl. He returns years later, haunted by his horrible deeds, done because of jealousy. Silence and long nearly motionless scenes are OK with me, the pictures tell their story. The open shots are beautiful and inspiring, but in such location it will be spectacular even if you shoot the birds' drops on the roof of the temple \u0096 it all just looks so peaceful and harmonic. I guess the western audience will be more fascinated than me, but I've seen more than one Asian movies and a lot of anime titles, so I am used to such motives. The first fragment, \"Spring\", about the boy's youth was the most interesting for me, simple but strong. I am not really into topics like romantic love, sexual desire, lust and jealousy, but I like the way the movie shows how love makes one to be blind and to betray his principles. I look at it as a different approach to the story about the fall of the good man to the Dark Side. The old monk's words were very close to Yoda's \"Attachment leads to jealousy. Shadow of greed that is. Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.\" The story is not necessarily trying to push you some religious Buddhist wisdom, it tells about the circle of life, the mistakes one can make blinded by feelings. It is a masterfully shot and emotionally charged movie, but there are a couple of things I don't like \u0096 at the end there were some moments that seemed illogical to me, some symbols that were not clear enough, and they left me confused after the end - the old man was trying to help his apprentice to overcome his anger and sorrow, but put an end to his own life. Out of his pyre a snake came out. What was that all about? And the in final episode, when there comes that woman with a baby \u0096 I don't think it is well told, it leaves the audience to wonder what is happening. Maybe it requires a second watch to get a clearer view, or maybe it has something to do with the Buddhist culture or Korean mythology. Or maybe someone is just trying to be enigmatic to look more profound and philosophic. All in all \u0096 it is a very good movie if not excellent, but according to me not that great that everyone is trying to present it. I find phrases like \"The most beautiful film I've ever seen\" and \"Left me speechless\" generally exaggerated. But it's definitely very worth watching.",

And Spring\" (2003) directed by Kim Ki-duk is an utterly beautiful film.The film's simple premise revolves around a Buddhist master in the midst of the Korean wilderness, who patiently raises a young boy to grow up in wisdom and compassion, through experience and endless exercise. Once the pupil discovers his lust for sexual desire, he seems lost to contemplative life and follows his first love, but soon fails to adapt to the modern world, gets in jail for a crime of passion and returns to the master in search of spiritual redemption and reconciliation with karma, at a high price of physical catharsis.The film is truly high art and an example of great film making. The simplicity of the screenplay, the elegance of the direction, the beauty of the cinematography and production design, the sparse score, but most of all, the endearing message of the film will touch your soul.Highly recommended!",

No one is totally good or totally bad and life goes on.In this film, a young boy living on a remote lake is raised by a monk with whom he lives a simple, ascetic life. I think Kim is showing by some of the responses of the boy that someone who grows up so remote from society might have difficulty adapting to living in society.It's a beautiful, reflective film. Not much happens, but on the other hand, more than enough happens to make a great film. Kim Ki-Deok is a thoughtful man and a brave, talented director. Some great performances, most especially from Yeong Su-oh as the monk, but also from Jae-kyeong Seo as the kid and from the director playing the oldest version of the kid.

            "content": "This movie, \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring\" was created by Kim Ki-Duk, a reprehensible and indefensible south Korean director who is well-known for portraying disgusting acts of cruelty that have shocked many audiences causing them to faint, vomit, or leave. In Kim's movie The Isle, unspeakable acts of cruelty were created, in my opinion at this point he should have been persecuted by the law and he should have lost the right to create films. As such, I think this movie should never have been created.As for my rating I give it a 3/10. In my opinion the average film is 5/10 and there must be something good about a film to give it anything higher then a 5/10 and there must be something bad about it to give it less then 5/10. So first, I will address the praise that this movie has got. Well first of all this movie is certainly not entertaining, if anything it is depressing. The praise then, that this movie gets is generally that it effectively teaches Buddhist principles. If you really want to learn about Buddhism go to the library and read some of the things in which Buddha actually said, instead of listening to this sick and cruel director's interpretation of it. In my opinion there are much better movies out there that teach about Buddhism such as Samsara and Phorpa.Another thing is some reviewers have said that this film effectively teaches people to have respect for animals. Well first of all, this movie hardly sets a good example for animal liberators as they used animal cruelty to produce this film. Furthermore, this movie hardly focuses on animal cruelty. It is slow-paced and they throw in unnecessary scenes, including the scene where the old master kills himself.What good was that scene about him killing himself? Perhaps they are advocating animal rights - except for animals that are old? I fully understand the point of the scene - the old master wants to die on his own terms. Even then, the scene is completely unnecessary it is not entertaining at all and it does not tell any educational or moral lesson. If the movie wasn't slow paced and if it didn't have unnecessary scenes such as those, then perhaps it could serve as a decent educational tool.In this movie, the children do all sorts of cruel acts to the animals. I think this is profoundly unrealistic and fallacious. I do not think children have a natural tendency for cruelty, actually I think it is rather the opposite, children are generally very kind and innocent. Yes children like to experiment with things, humans are creative and intelligent animals after all. However, when it turns out that as a result of their experiment an animal dies or is hurt that child has a natural empathy and he/she will probably refrain from doing that action again. I do not believe in real life children will naturally do cruel things and laugh at them in the process, as is depicted in this movie. If anything, cruelty develops with adulthood, but even then that cruelty is unnatural. Yes animals such as humans have a natural tendency to compete for mates and food, that is not the same as the pointless cruelty which is in this movie, as such this movie is profoundly unrealistic.Furthermore, what good did the masters do in this movie if they couldn't even effectively teach their children apprentices to have a respect for life and not be cruel. In my opinion, if the masters teach their apprentices well enough, from a early on, then all the cruelty/murder that happened in this movie would never have had to have happened. I reject that it actually had to happen.Anyways, I will not only shoot down the praise that this movie got, I would like to also make the case that this movie is actually bad. First of all, one of the things this movie advocates is a sort of isolationism, that you should isolate yourself from the world, especially women and that is the path to some sort of \"higher/religious/spirtual truth.\" Isolating yourself from the world is an inherently destructive practice, people need to cooperate with one another if they are to progress at all. In addition, the adult monk should not have to carry the burden his entire life as he did for something he did as a child, he should have instead spent his time doing something actually useful.Furthermore, a significant concern of mine is that in this film they created animal cruelty for a visual effect. This movie was made in 2003, they had so much technology at the time that they could have easily used CGI or some other cruelty-free technology. I would have been fine with watching the movie even if it was a cartoony looking, it still could have portrayed just as effectively, however, it doesn't even have to be cartoony, the CGI technology they had at 2003 was so advanced it would have looked realistic, you would have barely noticed the difference. That is my case for why this movie is actually bad.",

            "content": "'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter\u0085and Spring', an offbeat film from Korea can best be described as a fable. It focuses on a Buddhist monk who lives in a 'monastery' (actually a small house in the middle of a lake) cut off from civilization. The film has five sequences, each set in successive seasons of the year. However, the action does not occur one season after another\u2014there are gaps in years between each season.In the first 'Spring' sequence, the monk (who appears to be in his 60s) is mentoring an apprentice, a young boy who appears to be around 10 years of age. The boy takes delight in attaching a stone to various creatures he finds in the lake: a fish, a frog and a snake. The monk is appalled by the boy's cruelty and decides to teach him a lesson by attaching a rock with some rope around his back while he sleeps. He orders the boy to find the creatures, untie the stones from them and then he will remove the rock. Foreshadowing violence to come, the monk warns the boy that if any of the creatures dies, this will weigh heavily upon his heart for the rest of his life. Sure enough, when the boy returns, the fish is dead and it appears that the snake might be dead too; he is able to find the frog and remove the string and stone from that creature.In the next 'Summer' sequence, a mother leaves a young woman with the Monk as she is suffering from some sort of physical malady which is not made clear. The monk indicates that her physical problems will go away once she deals with the afflictions of her soul. The boy, now a young man of about twenty, takes a sexual interest in the young woman who initially rebuffs him. We never learn anything about this young girl's personality and for some reason she eventually gives in to the Young Adult Monk's advances and has sex with him on a number of occasions. When the old Monk finds out about this, he banishes the girl from the monastery but the Young Adult Monk has fallen in love with her and leaves the island to pursue her. Before he leaves, the Old Monk warns the Young Adult Monk that lust can only lead to murder.In the third 'Fall' sequence, the Old Monk has just returned with provisions he has obtained off the island. While unwrapping a newspaper which contains his lunch, he notices an article stating that his former pupil has murdered the girl that he had years before fallen in love with and was now wanted by the authorities. The former pupil now shows up at the island and makes it clear to the Old Monk that he killed his wife due to her infidelity and that he was still full of rage. In response, the Old Monk paints numerous cryptic characters on the deck of the house and orders his former pupil to carve out the letters one by one with a knife. He explains this will help him overcome his rage. Meanwhile, two detectives appear on the scene and take the Old Monk's former pupil away (presumably out of respect for the reputation of the Old Monk, they wait until daybreak to allow the former pupil to finish carving the letters before he's taken into custody). Later, the Old Monk commits suicide through self-immolation, while sitting inside a rowboat on the lake.Years pass when we arrive at the fourth \"Winter\" sequence. The former pupil is now much older and presumably has been released from prison. He returns to his old haunts on the island and once again takes up the disciplined practice of Buddhism which he rejected as a youth. A mysterious woman (her face covered with a shroud) walks across the iced-over lake and leaves an infant in the new monk's care. She mysteriously falls through a hole in the ice and drowns. In an apparent act of repentance for past sins, the new monk attach's a stone to his back and climbs up a mountain overlooking the island.Finally, there is a coda to the movie\u2014a fifth sequence: spring again! Now life has come full circle. The pupil has now become the master and is teaching the young boy who earlier had been left in his care by the mysterious woman.Despite the film's originality, troubling questions remain. The young woman who has been brought to the Old Monk to be healed ends up becoming the sexual object of the Young Monk. Even though it's clear that the Old Monk knows that there are highly unethical things going on, he does nothing to prevent his charge from taking advantage of her. His response is to merely banish her from the island. He could have drawn boundaries from the beginning preventing his former pupil from acting the way he did. More troubling is the girl herself. What is it about the Young Monk that attracts him to her? For someone who's had no experience with women, most women would not be attracted to such a bumbling novice. We just don't know enough about the young woman to make us believe that she would take up so easily with the Young Monk.More troubling is the idea that the former pupil would end up a murderer. After all that good work the Old Monk does with the kid, apparently not enough of his good advice sinks in. Why exactly does the Young Monk become so jealous that he would resort to killing the woman he has fallen in love with? Most people do not become obsessed as the Young Monk does and the film's creator never explains why. Instead, there's a simple suggestion that everything here is predestined. Still, 'SSFW..and Spring again' features beautiful cinematography and gets high marks for being an original story which will keep your interest to the end.",

            "review_title": "The Gates with No Walls",
            "content": "Kim Ki-duk directed the South Korean film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring\" in 2003. The film tells a story of a Buddhist monk and his apprentice, who live in the lake's floating temple. As the Buddhist disciple grows, he faces various challenges on his way. However, according to the Buddhist teachings, existence is not a linear or transient entity; it is a cycle of life, death, and rebirth, accompanied by suffering. This philosophy serves as a framework of the character's path: the cycle will resume at the very end. Despite the peaceful setting of an isolated forest with picturesque views and a light tone of the initial minutes, the film raises complicated, even intricate, yet compelling questions about life, death, and everything in-between. However, what makes this film an outstanding example of visual art is excellent storytelling and the combination of symbolism, paradoxes in Buddhism, and perhaps the inexplicable tranquility even during the tensest episodes. This review will attempt to present a novel viewpoint about the film, namely, that the film's central idea revolves around the blurred boundaries between various ideas relating to human existence: innocence and cruelty; love and lust; the sacred and the secular.The film's first scene depicts the opening gates that are not attached to any walls (Kim, 2003, 0:01:28). The gates are freestanding and serve as a barrier between the lake with the temple and the rest of the world. There is no indication of a person who opened them, and throughout the film, there will be times when the gates will magically open or close by themselves. However, such instances will not necessarily stand out and be easily spotted. Somehow, this particular magical element is embedded into the reality of the film. These gates illustrate the first example of a blurred boundary between the spiritual-magical world and the profane reality. The temple is not enclosed, not physically separated from the forest, there is no fence, yet all the film characters abide by the unspoken rule - every time they want to go to the temple or see the master, they go only through the gate.\nThe film proceeds to a significant example, which will set the tone for the unfolding events later in the film. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish between the poisonous herb and the one that can heal the sick. How can one tell the difference if they look almost identical? \"Look closely. Here at the tip, you can see a white line\" says the master to his apprentice (Kim, 2003, 0:08:47). It is notable how easily the master spots the poisonous herb and throws it away. The apprentice observes and then light-heartedly asks, picking another bundle: \"Is this one alright to eat?\" (Kim, 2003, 0:09:02). The young apprentice has a lot to learn, but the master is patient and is willing to teach him everything he knows. Although the herbs will not be mentioned anymore later, this example prepares viewers for deeper insights and acts as a precursor for further questions.Moreover, it touches upon one of the fundamental concepts in Buddhism - suffering. The painful death would have been inevitable if not for the knowledge and attentiveness of the master. Once again, signifying the blurring between two closely related concepts.Keeping in mind the herbs' lesson, the young apprentice plays with the dog and the next day goes to the forest to play with other animals. First the fish, then the frog and the snake - all of them were tied to a stone one after another - such an amusing entertainment for the young disciple. The viewer might even forget that it is no longer an innocent game; it is cruel or even torturous. One can wonder how the young apprentice did not know the difference between those two, but the earlier example with herbs showed the boy's indifference and absentmindedness in the face of such decisions. The boy can neither differentiate between a poisonous herb and medicinal herb nor between game and violence. That is why the young apprentice will carry the stone in his heart for the rest of his life. A small mistake will transform into a heavy burden.Finally, the film presents the blurriest border of all - the one between love and lust. Love heals the sick, as the master put it, it can be the \"right medicine\" (Kim, 2003, 0:47:27). However, it is not valid on all occasions, as under the influence of love, person's mind can be clouded, and one will not notice how love will transform into lust and the desire to possess. According to the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, there is a cause of suffering, which lies in the attachment. Indeed, the disciple will eventually acknowledge his feelings to the young girl and run away, succumbing to his feelings. The disciple will not try to end suffering, and he will fall into the trap of killing his wife at the end. Only after violating the first of the Five Precepts (Do not kill) will the disciple return to the \"right\" path.Eventually, the master will die, leaving the temple behind, and his disciple will take his place after returning from prison. The disciple becomes the master, and there will be another young apprentice. The cycle continues; however, some of the questions are yet to be answered. Will they make the same mistakes all over again? Will there be the same amount of suffering, or is there hope? Will the master teach the apprentice the blurred boundaries of human existence? However, one thing is clear: just as the gates with no walls secure the spiritual world from the profane reality, the blurred boundaries will persist.",

First of all, the title gives away the whole point of the film. As you're watching the \"Spring\" segment, you already know this is going to be another one of those life cycle stories... Why not choose another title then ? At the end of the \"Summer\" segment, the Master says that lustful acts can lead to murder *nudge nudge*, next thing you know, he finds an article about his disciple in the newspaper wrapping his fish... Why are these scenes necessary ? The disciple stabbing the floor with his knife full of blood was clear enough, and would have had a much more surprising effect on the viewer than having the whole murder thing spelled out for us beforehand. Finally, the disciple becomes the master and there is a new disciple, as if this had to be an unavoidable cycle... which it doesn't. So, the director says he wrote the whole story in 2 hours and made a point not to alter any of it, and I believe him as this story is cute but superficial as a Paulo Coelho novel. It certainly doesn't have the depth of most works by Mizoguchi, Kurosawa, Kobayashi, Ozu or even Koizumi and Kitano. Still, it's watchable, thanks to the acting, cinematography and nice settings, and can be a nice introduction for some shallow Westerners to Asian cinema.",

            "content": "It was apparent that the Korean culture held strict reverence towards Buddhism and the path to enlightenment. This was heavily suggested in the film through the use of doors. At the beginning of all five seasons expressed, there are two doors that open to a beautiful and isolated monastery out on the middle of a lake. Monasteries, by nature, are sanctuaries where ascetic monks retreat to seek enlightenment. The doors represented the barrier between the noise of the outside world (i.e. city life) and the peace of the inside world (i.e. nature). This sacredness is heightened inside of the monastery as well. Two doors are paralleled next to each; in the center lies a sculpture of the Buddha where worshipping takes place. There is a particular scene that the director suggests how the Buddha becomes desecrated\u0097how what is considered holy is made unholy. When the older boy begins to have sexual relations with the girl, he crawls to her side of the room, not going through the doors, but around the doors. It's as if when the boy was contemplating going through the doors, he hesitated for a moment, realizing that his conscience would have been seared with guilt if he had gone through. This was a commentary that suggests that it is better to be a non-conformist than pretending to be holy.The sacredness of monks being viewed as spiritually enlightened teachers is also highly venerated amongst this culture. The old monk depicted in the film is very experienced and wise\u0097one who teaches the path to enlightenment. In a way, the director portrayed the old monk as God\u0097one whose all-seeing eye watches over everyone. This is demonstrated in one particular scene. From the beginning, the viewer knows that there is only one boat used to travel from the monastery to the forest. When the young boy uses the boat to venture out by himself into the forest to tie stones to the various animals of the field, the old monk is seen watching behind him from a distance. This idea of the monk violating time and space (acting like God) is only understood because of the boat. There would have been no way for him to get to the forest without having the boat to transfer him there. Since the boat was already taken by the young boy, it is apparent that the director is making a commentary on the culture's sacred view of monks.The sacredness of animals is also highly esteemed in the Korean culture. Animals in most Buddhist cultures help teach the way to enlightenment\u0097they are considered the Zen masters. Because they do not possess a mind that is capable of reason, they do not cause unnecessary suffering by attaching themselves to righteous or unrighteous desires like humans do. Most of the pains humans suffer are caused by their own ignorance and enslavement to doing what is wrong. Animals do not know any better. They are in a constant state of bliss and the mere observance of them brings an individual closer to enlightenment. In the film, ducks are shown peacefully gliding, frogs (when given the chance) are shown quietly swimming, and snakes (also when given the chance) are shown gently slithering. All of these traits are effectively contrasted with the inner turmoil and struggle seen within the people of the story. It's as if the director wants not only the characters, but also the viewers, to observe the nature of these animals to help them on their own path to nirvana.",

They aren't known outside Korea.]In music and literature as well as in film, the cycle of seasons often is a profound leitmotif for the stages of human experience.  Rarely has that association been so beautifully and exquisitely portrayed than in the Korean film, \"Spring Summer Autumn Winter...and Spring.\"  The \"fifth\" season reflects not only the Buddhist concept of eternal cycles but it also encompasses a compelling universality.While the seasons change in normal progression, years pass between each one, a technique that allows the unfolding of a rich story of growth, love, loss and redemption.Set in a gorgeous Korean landscape outside, wholly, the bustle of a modern industrialized society, all the scenes take place on either a floating temple in a calm lake or in its immediate vicinity.  A monk in the first spring is the only caretaker but also teacher of a little boy.  Childish acts of cruelty to animals delight the child until a tough lesson from the master molds his awakening conscience.With summer comes a young woman accompanied by her mother, both dressed in comfortable, stylish western garb.  The daughter is ill, coughs betraying a non-specific malady.  Why she has been brought to the monk is never stated but the expectation is for a healing sojourn.Now a young man, the acolyte falls either in lust or in love with the woman. Their sexual congress is proclaimed by the master as an obviously necessary cure for the woman's illness but he warns the smitten youth that in the outside world love and violence are intermingled.  Hardly surprisingly, the man departs with the woman for life outside the rituals and teachings of Buddhism.And then comes autumn and the anguished young man is back.  He married the woman and it didn't work out.  In fact it worked out so badly that two detectives arrive to arrest him.  Now wizened but still wise, the master concocts an act of spiritual expiation to unburden the tortured fellow's soul.  Even the cops fall under the monk's spell.Winter brings the now matured and hardy former disciple back to the temple where he begins to repeat his now deceased master's simple life.  And as he once was brought to the old master, now a mysterious woman brings a baby boy to the temple, a child she can not keep.And spring again...the symbol of renewal but also repetition.This is a brilliant film that distills a great moral tradition into a tale that uses the passage of a little over a year to illustrate much of the human experience.  You don't have to be especially interested in Buddhism to savor the strengths, weaknesses and temptations moving across the screen.10/10",

Compared to the many films I view as \"good, but I didn't get it,\" I generally preferred the segments that I did get here. Even though it is about a very particular set of religious and cultural practices (and who knows if it's portrayed accurately), I found most of the film to be accessible, which was why it was a bit tiresome when the climax, such as it was, was a largely unexplained hike up a hill. Actually, I suppose it wasn't that hard to figure out, but it just seemed to lack an impetus, which you couldn't say for the rest of the film. Overall, however, a strong effort, a movie that has a point but is also very serene, in a good way.",

But Buddhism as pop video, or beautiful adverts for the Buddha's path to release from beautiful illusions, well...I found this basic contradiction so irritating that I couldn't watch the whole movie, but since the bit I did see was so crudely schematic, I doubt that I missed any profound message in what was doubtless a final closing of the circle.Nietzsche praised Greek culture as deeply superficial, and contrasted this with German culture as superficially deep.

This is, first of all a visually ravishing film that forces you to adapt to its snail-like pace and spoon-feeds the basic lessons of life that parents (but few, alas, parents of TODAY) used to teach with the rusks and baby formula. Time was we got these painless lessons as we stood in Lewis Stone's study along with Mickey Rooney's Andy Hardy and learned only by osmosis what Judge Hardy was really saying. Now we get it in a floating temple in the middle of a lake, surrounded by highly picturesque trees growing right out of the water and tall cliffs enclosing us. Here, in almost total isolation, live Master and Pupil and there are lessons to be learned and learned they are. Given the isolation and the timeless, shapeless garments they wear we could be in any century from the 9th to the 21st but with the arrival of two women, mother and daughter, in modern dress we get an inkling - not to say a look at a very modern bra and a visible panty line - that we are in the present. A later sequence introduces two plain-clothes policemen complete with handguns and mobile phone but somehow none of this is allowed to fracture the MOOD that has been created as methodically as a spider spins a web; the web has been spun around us, the audience and we are happy to bask in its centre.

            "content": "I have to get off this `9/11' preoccupation-I'm seeing the event underlying too many films. Recently I saw the xenophobia in `Dogville' and `The Village'; now it occupies my imagination again in `Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter . . . and Spring,' a lyrical Korean masterpiece about isolation, love, death, and renewal.A young Buddhist is tutored by a master on a floating monastery, with only nature to provide food, medicine, and occasional boyhood mischief with fish, frogs, and snakes (Coleridge's Xanadu in  `Kubla Khan' comes to mind). Writer/director Ki-Duk Kim unobtrusively frames his film in the seasons with their usual connotations. But as human drama would have it, even in this isolated mountain lake, the outsider changes things.  A young girl coming to be cured brings a different kind of sickness to the compound: lust. Although the old monk warns the boy that lust \"awakens the desire to possess, which ends in the intent to murder,\" he doesn't listen.  He follows her to enter the `real world,' for which he is unprepared.As Nicole Kidman's character brought apocalypse to `Dogville,' and need forced the residents of `The Village' to become the strangers in the outside world, in `Spring' the intruding and emigrating forces upset the balance of nature even if love/lust is in the design of things, as the master admits. The little boy's torturing small creatures foreshadows the violence to come, relentless as it seems even in the face of the master's power and the boy's innocence. The animal imagery is not always subtle, but it helps emphasize the elemental setting and implacable human nature ready to take the innocent into experience.Dong-hyeon Baek's cinematography is so painterly and mystical that the film could stand alone on that merit.  He uses long, wide shots to suggest the remote beauty, and then close ups to capture the intimacy the monks have achieved with nature.  But human nature is a whole other matter, as uncontrollable as a storm and as prone to destructiveness as the snakes slithering in this paradise. That the characters have no names increases the allegorical implications.Thus this floating palace might be Eden, and humanity is doomed to repeat its mistakes in a `Paradise of Fools,' as Milton might have described it. The master warned the boy about torturing the animals, \"You will carry this stone in your heart for the rest of your life.\"  Then there is always spring to renew hope that wisdom has survived the seasons. You won't forget the images or the lyrical evocation of humanity in its beauty and imperfection.  `Spring' is filmmaking at its best.",

            "content": "Spring Summer Fall Winter & Spring tells the story of a priest/healing/master who has a young boy as his apprentice. The two of them live in a small floating pagoda or house in the middle of a small lake and fill their days finding herbs and such for medicine, praying and learning. The first season of the film, Spring, introduces the young boy as cute initially, then mischievous and finally, after being reprimanded, resentful. Summer follows showing the young boy no longer a boy but a teenager with all the boiling emotions and uncontrollable lust usually present in teenage boys. A young sick girl is brought to the small house by her mother to have the priest cure her and is left there for a while. In the meantime the teenage boys lust for the girl takes control and he is found breaking traditions of his upbringing simply to fulfills his desires. Eventually she is 'cured' and she and the teenage boy leave together to become married. Fall shows the priest alone for a bit and then shows the boy returning to the house on the lake as a man in his 30s or so running away from his actions. We find that he has murdered his wife, the girl from the summer season, because she had become unfaithful to him. He is now on the lam and has returned home to escape the law. The story thus far has showed him digressing from general mischievousness to an all-consuming lust, to a murderous rage that has become unconquerable. To have the pupil take leave of his rage the priest/master has him carve out characters on the wooden deck of the floating house to expel all of the rage built up inside of him. The law has since tracked him to this house on the lake and have been instructed by the priest/master to wait for the young man to finish expelling his rage before arresting him and taking him to court or prison. The young man finishes, is taken away by the detectives, and the priest/master is left by himself to live out his final days. Winter arrives with the young man back at the house on the lake to carry his burden of past transgressions up and away, to continue to work them out of himself. He carries his weight up a hill away from the house on the lake and out of his mind. He toils at this task for a long period of time and learn a great deal from it. The second Spring comes around and shows the young man now an old man. The now old man has taken the priest/master's position and the cycle is begun anew!I thought this film was a very nice piece depicting the life cycle on the whole and depicting reincarnation as well. The direction was well done, story line was very straight-forward and didn't require a whole lot of deep thinking. I actually found myself trying to find a different theme or deeper meaning to the film assuming that the obviousness of the life cycle theme was not the only one the director was trying to submit. The production quality was at least consistent and good, though the cinematography didn't necessarily strike me as anything superb or breathtaking. The lighting was decent, but again, not much to it as most of the film was shot in natural daylight without much in the way of special effects or lighting techniques that were specifically super impressing.Overall I'd give this film 7 out of 10",

Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring. Four words, three seasons, one man, one boy, one girl, one life to each and years of journey. That's all. That's all this film has to offer you in the script. Now you must be thinking, is it really enough for a two-hour-long film? Did I forget to add that the film has less dialogue than many silent-era films made years ago? Now think about the question again, and I'm sure your answer will be No. But you are wrong. It is indeed enough. More than enough, I would say. You have to give two hours of your life to this movie and make sure it is without any disturbance. You can't afford to miss a single frame. It's an art gallery of its own. So many beautiful frames, more than you'll ever see in any art exhibition. The background score makes it heart-tugging. There's some unknown magic and attraction to all the cinematic frames of this film, which I can't describe in words because your answer might be different from mine. As you know, art is subjective, so you'll see something different in the same frame as I'll see something else. It doesn't matter as long as you and I are taking something home. The story is about the life of a Buddhist monk as he passes through the seasons of his life, from childhood to old age. The performances are absolutely fantastic, the cinematography is pure magic, the background score is divine, and the outcome is simply magical. You can't get over it soon. It just stays with you because you know it's life and you can't deny the basic facts or the Circle of Life. I don't know what Kim Ki-Duk saw in the story and decided to make a film, but I know he has made a film of a lifetime. For him and for us, too.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

The movie tends to feel very long due to the serious lack of dialog or even human interaction in that matter. The Winter part doesn't even have a word uttered at all. But the lessons are strong within this movie, including karma and love. The movie, being terribly long in the sense of its lonesome aura and mood, tests our own mettle and patience in watching it. But I really don't agree with the overall conclusion of the movie that the cycle repeats itself, that man cannot be absolved from their inherent sin.

            "content": "Very little in the world of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring is physically attached to one another, yet everything feels connected; physically, spiritually, narratively. The doors insinuating rooms inside the tiny monastery where we lay our scene stand alone, unattached to walls. The small row boat, providing the only connection between the outside world and the monastery is almost never festooned to its moorings. For that matter, neither is the temple itself which gently glides across the lake like it were a pontoon. Nothing is attached, yet everything is connected, tranquil and cyclical.The story is told in simple, largely visual terms; an elderly Monk (Yeong-su Oh), is rearing a small child (Jae-kyeong Seo) with him as his master in an isolated monastery surrounded on all sides by a man made lake. As the seasons pass the boy grows into a young man (Young-min Kim), then a troubled adult (Ki-duk Kim), with each chapter of his life reflecting in the seasons as they pass. We witness as the capriciousness of spring changes the boy into a flirtatious teenager by summer; made all the more apparent by the arrival of a young girl (Yeo-jin Ha) who comes to the temple in search of restoration. His desire for the girl turns to lust, desire then anger, followed by a long absence in fall before winter becomes a pilgrimage of contrition. All the while, the elderly Monk looks on like a spirit as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 succumbs to what is natural.What little is spoken throughout, everything people do speak in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring is given an incontrovertible weight. Yet there's never a lecture or conflict made verbal disquisition. Much of the conflict, characterization and morality is expounded through visual metaphor complimented by the fantastic natural splendor that surrounds our protagonists. What results is a film with the conciseness of a fable without trenchant proselytizing. The elderly Monk mirrors that sentiment, using a gentle hand to guide his young apprentice towards the lessons he needs to learn. The world then bends to the magnanimous will of the story, using animals as larger symbols of the young man's journey.What results is a story lush with beauty and serenity awash in the full spectrum of human experience. With a very small cast, director Ki- duk Kim unravels the central tenants of Buddhism and gingerly brays them into contemporary society. It results in colors and emotional shades hereto unseen by anything ever committed to celluloid apart from perhaps the final works of Ingmar Bergman. The comparison is completed with the ponderous rhythms of changing seasons and the slowly changing perspectives of the Monks.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring makes the short list for most beautiful film in human history, capitalizing on the natural beauty that surrounds the water bound temple. Furthermore it is an innately human parable about the cyclical nature of man and the hidden beauty therein. Contemplative yet truly mesmerizing, Spring, Summer, Fall Winter...and Spring is a revelatory triumph. Those looking for the naturalistic beauty of a Terrence Malick film bending to the meditative majesty of eastern philosophies should pick up Ki-duk Kim's contemporary classic right away.",

            "content": "This is the second film directed by Kim Ki-Duk that I saw. The first one was Bin-jip and I can say that I really like both of them.Despite the very long and difficult to remember title (Spring, summer, autumn, winter...and spring), in the final, seeing the film is a rewarding experience.First of all I love in this film the idea of an floating hermitage (monastery) in the middle of a lake. All the \"action\" (and there is little action, but more frames of action) takes place on this hermitage. In the beginning of the film there are only an old monk and a little boy (his prot\u00e9g\u00e9) in this monastery. Being surrounded by water gives the sensation of isolation from the outer world, a space of loneliness where man can resonate perfect with the nature. The door that opens at the beginning of each one of the five seasons could be interpreted as a gate, linking the two worlds: our world and their world. To go-in and go-out in the idyllic space where the hermitage floats every people must go through this gate.In fact the film is a very simple allegory about the cyclic evolving life. The beginning and the final of the film encloses a cycle: in the first season we find the old monk and the little boy; the boy grows-up, evolves, learns, suffers, loves, is punished and self-punishes him for his mistakes. After all these experiences the boy, an adult now, is capable to guide through life another human being. In winter he is the adult monk and he has a little boy as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And the cycle starts all over.Also the film is about the thresholds that we must overpass in our life from the childhood till the adulthood, and the fact that these thresholds are very similar for all of us.Allover the movie there are very subtle Buddhist symbols like the five animals (a dog, a rooster, a cat, a snake and finally a turtle) each one of them being associated with one season.The film is a superbly visual experience and has a musical theme that repeats in the beginning of each of the five seasons creating (for me at least) a dreaming sensation.",

Looking at the cost of production, $85 million, one can easily see the care director Rob Marshall took with each and every shot. Now let's move on to SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER ...AND SPRING (SSFWAS), director Ki-duk Kim's sparkling success.Shot in one location on a high mountain lake in Korea, and using only a handful of actors/actresses, SSFWAS accomplishes the same wondrous scenery with only a fraction of the GEISHA budget.The story is that of a monk and a young boy in training to become a monk. They live in a monastery that floats, raft-like, on a pristine mountain lake. The monk teaches the boy life lessons: how to pray, caring for one's home, and treating nature's creatures with respect. We view their experiences through the title's seasons, sometimes leaping a few years ahead, watching the boy grow, mature, and learn how tough life can be. As the story progresses, the boy battles his demons, learns by hard example, then comes full-circle to become the very thing he so recklessly tossed away (his faith in God/Buddha and his trust in his old mentor, the monk).The script is a simple one, not delving into side-plots, but giving us a glimpse at how extraordinary life truly is. This isn't just the life of a boy and his master, though. This is everyone's life with all its trials, follies, and triumphs.But through all of this simplicity there's the camera work. It is (to use a clich\u00e9) breathtaking. The changes in season are stunning, and the lighting, angles and scope of the landscape are visually perfect.It's also interesting to note that the film is only 103 minutes long and has maybe 30 lines of dialogue. The scenery tells the story more often than anything the actors say, which is also impressive.Not surprising, the movie is slow but viewers probably won't notice because of the oohing and ahing most will do while sitting drinking in every lush scene.",

            "content": "Kim Ki-duk's latest film simply tells the life of 2 monks who inhabit a temple that exists in a setting that seems one could only dream.  The setting is a small pond that is nestled between several mountains and within this pond a simple temple floats in the center, through the ever changing seasons.  It is within the changing seasons that we follow a young mentored monk from boyhood, to manhood.The first story involves the young monk smart-alecking around and tying rocks to animals for fun.  The next morning he awakens to find a giant stone tied to him by his master.  Considerably immobile and begging his master that he has learned his lesson, his master does not remove the stone until he orders the young monk to go release all the animals first.  If any of them are dead he proclaims, you will carry that stone in your heart forever.There are many spiritual teachings that are throughout the film, and the story continues with the young monk's education.  Other seasons show him as an inexperienced teenager, and then as an adult later.  For sake of spoilers I will not say what happens, only to suggest that the first story hints that the young disciple is headed towards a life of possible tragedy.  However, what happens isn't so much of importance, but the setting it happens in. Kim Ki duk hasn't created so much as a film or a story, but a journey of exquisite beauty that happens around the viewer.  You are literally forced to do nothing and await this films exquisite beauty, and the film isn't so much entertainment as it is a meditation for the soul.From within the lessons and beautifully shot seasons that occur, you are surrounded and literally \"enveloped\", in the temples beauty.  Every single shot in this film, from the cinematic grand pictures of the temple by itself, to simple shots of just someone climbing up a hill, is perfect. EVERY SINGLE ONE!!  More importantly the poetic pace of this film forces you to look and relax and await the beauty that surrounds the temple.  The most spectacular shots involve the camera remaining motionless, and the landscape changing and more importantly MOVING around the participants.  This effect is simply indescribable and powerful in terms of putting the viewer not just in a great film, but as an observing participant in the story.  It's as if we can sit back and watch the lives of these people from some holy juncture.I can honestly say in my several years of strongly watching and reviewing films that I have never seen a film that was so powerful, and effective on the viewer, but was so incredibly simple and extremely subtle to get that effect.   It is a great deal of masterwork that Kim Ki-duk did to pull off such strength while just letting the story and the surroundings tell things by itself.I have seen it on the big screen twice and upon second viewing its power was even stronger and more unforgettable.  It is certainly a film that deserves some award merit come February, and one that I will never forget.Rating 9.5 out of 10",

            "content": "..but an appalling advertisement for Buddhism (and I am no Buddhist). There is much to enjoy in the superb visual richness of this film, but I was left deeply concerned about its presentation of Buddhist principles and practice. If you hope see a film about a novice Buddhist monk being taught the great mysteries, learning to respect all forms of life, and exploring the nature of cause and effect in dialogues with his 'master' you will be deeply disappointed. Instead viewers are privy to a few religious rituals that fail miserably in preparing a novice monk for a compassionate, wise or peaceful adult life. Time and time again in the movie the novice monk fails to relate compassionately to either himself or those about him, and there are several scenes of simple (but repeated and extended) cruelty which made me cringe as a human being.I found the various subtexts of the film (as I saw it) disturbing : that desire for sex (ie. desire for union of polarities & transcendence) is essentially a path that leads to suffering for all, and that the only way to find redemption for oneself is through time and ritual, rather than through practicing self-knowledge, kindness, and observing the nature of cause and effect.Ultimately I found this quite a depressing film about the potential of the human spirit. The message of the film, that human beings can_only_learn through suffering, worries me most. The movie begins and ends with a human being causing suffering to other sentient beings (admittedly through ignorance). That (to me) shows very little insight into the real beauty and essence of Buddhism, and it's also not very hopeful at all! After seeing this film I want to be a tree, for they have the most beautiful, untroubled existence in the film. The scenery in this movie merits much of my seven star rating.",

            "content": "Almira Biss****\nThe name of the movie \"Spring, Summer, Autumn, and... Spring\" defines one of the key ideas embodied in the plot of the work. The recurrence of life being the main idea of the movie, connects other concepts engaged in Buddhism, such as reincarnation, Samsara, and Dharma. Although these ideas were not clearly stated through verbal way, it can be seen that the scenes definitely convey the audience the feelings of characters by their actions and surroundings. The very first scene (5:10) of the picture painted on the Master's boat gives us the basic thought about the correspondence between the phenomenon of recurrence and the name of the film. The picture on the boat depicted a giant man, carrying a lotus, which in its turn carried a little man praying inside of it. The implied meaning of the scene which accidentally can be noticed by the attentive ones, draws the attention to the same idea and highlights it. This work was intended to demonstrate the existential thought of cyclicality by focusing its audience on the changes of seasons, birth and death, mistakes and redemption.\nThe story of a Master and his student is central in tangling these ideas, thereby revealing us the tenets of Buddhism.Throughout the seasonal and spiritual changes the background remain fixed. A deep valley with a peaceful lake and the floating temple. The exotic forest isolating a Master from idleness of the outer world..., Although remaining the same, the location transforms as a new season comes, which symbolizes another shift in personal vision of the main character. As the time flies, each season epitomize same person with different views, which we can attribute to the particular season. In the first scenes it is the spring. The time of renewal and growth, the time of innocence. The nature is young and childish, and so is the student of a Master. Naive and stupid, he follows his heart without understanding the point of his actions. The boy ties a thread to a fish, a frog, and finally to a snake. The Master silently observes the actions of his pupil. After all, he treats the child with the same, tying the thread with a stone to his back. The scene that reveals the stupidity of a child and sage mind of the Master can be interpreted very differently. However, the duality of the scene is not a mistake, but the versatility of life. At the first, the Master can be seen as the God, or Karma, or Universe, etc. Whatever person believes, there is the universal law in the face of such Master that will observe your deeds and penalize for the bad ones. Boomerang or cyclicality is a universal principle here, and the Master teaches the young to understand that. Secondly, it can be seen that in comparison with a mature pupil seen further in the movie, if you're a child, you still have a chance to grow up morally without being penalized for the mistakes, as the adult would have been. Adults are not innocent, even though they still can be stupid and have childish mind. Developing this idea further, it can be said that although everyone can grow morally, but the strikes for mistakes remain, as it leads people to realization of their deeds...Summer. The time of flourishing nature and flourishing youth. The temper and energy of a young man that been alone all this time, were finally realized when he met the lady brought to the Master one day. Being unable to restrain his physical desire, young man neglects the principles taught and steps over the lines, without using the entries, which importance can be noticed since the first sight at the movie (42:45 min). The doors or gateways are symbolical in Buddhism, and neglecting this ritual, young Buddhist implied the superiority of natural desire over life principles in temple. He secretly allows his beloved one to sit on the stone statue, which before was not allowed (43:13 min). His actions apparently reveal that he chooses \"normal\" life over sacral service, and entailing the silent furriness of the Master, he escapes to pursue his love. Before he escapes, the Master tells him the following:\"the desire to possess awakens the intent to murder\"\n(47:41 min)\nBy saying these words, the Teacher warned his pupil to refrain from desires, as such possession blinds people and leads them to sinful things. You cannot control others but rather they will control you, as you give them your everything. It's better to chase your inner peace and harmony. The pupil did not understand it.Autumn. Nature fades away. Death of living creatures. The decline of life energy. The Master finds out what happened to his pupil after he accidentally saw the excerpt of newspaper with his portrait. He understood that the student will be back very soon. The flat colors of autumn epitomize the dark mind of a wanderer. The Master physically punishes him for murder, as it happened since the pupil forgot about the sacral beginning of his life and became ignorant. The Master commits suicide, as he realizes the mistake he made. He could not raise the follower, the next master.\nThis scene describes the dark side of the life circle. As the life continues, the mistakes, sometimes fatal, are inescapable, if people will not follow some principles. However, as the lessons taught in Spring season, everyone still has a hope to grow morally. The Master, before he dies, teaches the last lesson to his pupil, by making him carving the symbols with the knife. The last lesson was a last spark in the dark mind, which started thinking recalling past experience.\nThe shining ice and snow in the winter embodies purification and pure mind. As the pupil comes back to deep valley, he finds a snake in the clothes of his Master. That reminds us of reincarnation; as the snake keeps living with him as if they used to live together before, and does not distract anyone, the symbolic meaning becomes clear. The snake is a symbol of wisdom, and it's interesting parallel with the Master that left as human, but came back as snake. As the winter was going to end, the woman brings her child, which she could not keep with her. That apparently brings us to the logical beginning of the story of the Master and his pupil. As the woman escapes, she drowned in the lake, accidentally stepping into the hole. The new Master walks out and instead of woman he finds the Buddha statue. This symbol of coming back to sacral traditions means the acceptance of a new Master. The last gesture that can be seen as a gesture of respect and tribute to dead Master, can be seen the scene, where his former pupil does the same punishment to himself as in childhood (1:32:36). Since this moment he realizes his role in the world.\nSpring. A new pupil plays with fish, making it eat stones and sees how it drowns. The turn comes to frog, and finally to a snake. Is he going to repeat the Master's lifelong cycle?After watching that movie which idea was the inevitable cyclicality, there's one thought that I believe stuck in minds of people. If the circle is infinite, can it be escapable? Yes and no. The author leaves us with the same question, as the end of the movie remains open. Who knew, whether this pupil is going to repeat the fate of his teacher, or the teacher will save him from his mistakes...\nWhatever the answer is, it happened before, it happens, and it will repeat itself...",

There, and in the films that followed, he's narratively adventurous, and at first sight this seems to be quite ordinary even.

The director himself plays this final phase in the monk's life.The film has a special place in my film life, as it somewhat typifies a period of watching many, many films, and I don't hesitate one bit to extend the film's narrative to my own exploration of cinema: childish curiosity, hits and misses of early life, the tragic swerve, reconciliation, apparent clarity. Isn't this the beauty of watching films, to learn, to be hurt, to heal, and in a positive light not to learn too much, thus making us experience it all over again?",

            "content": "Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring\nIn the outstanding movie Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring, an isolated Buddhist monastery, floating on a lake is the center of all the actions. The main story is about a Buddhist monk and a young boy. The monk awakens the boy, rises, and prepares him to be a monk. The film contains their daily life with seldom changes.\nAs for the scene, the monastery is located in the center of the small lake that is encircled by a thick forest and a mountain. The entrance to the monastery begins from two relatively large and painted doors made of wood. These doors are always open and do not keep people out. Anyone can walk around and see the lake and monastery.\nThe movie is split into 5 consequent sections, named by four seasons, each of which portrays stages of life of the main characters.\nThe first segment begins with the spring time. With no other people around but his master, young boy is busy learning Buddhist rituals and occasionally playing games. The monk and his young apprentice use wooden rowboat to go to the bank of the lake and reach the forest. They go there to have a walk and collect herbs. Local fauna, including fish, frogs and snakes, are the only entertainment for the young boy. One day, the apprentice catches a small fish and ties it with string attaching a stone to an end and laughs observing the fish struggling with weight of the stone. He ties a frog and a snake using the same method and entertains himself quite well. The monk only watches all of this and ties a stone with a large weight to the boy at night. Next day, he comes to his master asking to help him untie the rock. However, the monk refuses to help and tells the boy to free the creatures he tortured. Also, the master emphasizes one thing to the boy: \"If one of them has died, you will always carry that stone in your heart.\" Tied with the heavy rock on his back, young apprentice heads off to the forest and finds only the frog alive. The fish and the snake are dead. The monk quietly observes the boy crying heavily at realizing what cruelty he has done. From this scene, it was clear that monk did not try to prevent the actions of his apprentice but just watched quietly. By doing so, he probably wanted the young boy to experience the pain that he caused for those creatures and learn it the hard way.\nThe next segment is Summer. The boy is now a grown-up teenager. It is worth noticing that now the monastery has its new inhabitant, rooster. In Buddhist art, rooster is considered as the symbol of desire and craving. In summer, a sick girl of the age of the young apprentice has come to the monastery to be healed. While in the monastery, they fall in love. In the beginning, the apprentice and the girl hide their love affair from the monk, but later the master discovers them naked and asleep in the boat. The master does not show any signs of anger or frustration, he just says that \"lust leads to desire for possession, and possession leads to murder.\" After asking the girl if she feels good now, he tells that she has to leave. The young boy is very upset about this and at that night abandons the monastery and the monk. He takes Buddha statue and the rooster with him. The former symbolizes the \"burden\" of knowledge he gained from his master and the latter is the representation of his craving. The monk's earlier notice - that lust causes possession, and possession results in murder - is prophetic. This is because in the following segment of the film, the apprentice, now is wanted for the murder of his wife, comes back to the monastery.\nIn autumn, the monk accidentally sees this news about his former apprentice in a newspaper. The master expects him to come back and prepares some monk's garments for him. Shortly after, his former apprentice shows up. He is full of anger and disappointment. He tries to kill himself but the monk stops him and ruthlessly beats him. It should also be mentioned that a cat joined the household. This pet is often seen as the representation of prurience and lasciviousness. The master takes the cat and by dipping cat's tail into ink, he starts writing the \"Heart Sutra\", a famous sutra in Mahayana Buddhism, on a wooden floor of the monastery. Later, the apprentice is commanded to carve the letters into wood to calm his mind. After finishing it, the apprentice, with the cat joining him, is taken away by two detectives. Following their leave, the monk decides to end his life.\nIn winter, many years later, the apprentice comes back to the monastery for a final time. The monastery has been untouched for several years and now inhabited by the snake, which is the Buddhist representation of anger. The apprentice makes a Buddha statue from ice and collects his teacher's \"sarira\" in a piece of cloth and inserts in the statue. Sarira are small crystal-like objects taken from the cremated ashes of monks and considered as sacred. Since then he starts to read his master's materials and exercise in the cold winter. The apprentice ties the heavy, circular stone, the symbol of samsara, the cycle of life and rebirth to his waist and takes a Buddha-to-come statue; he sets off to the top of the mountain. Reaching the top, he prays and leaving the stone with the statue on top.\nComing back to spring, the life wheel restarts. The former apprentice becomes a new master for a left baby. Playing in the forest rocks, the new apprentice resembles his master's young ages, tormenting small animals nearby. Besides, in the monastery he plays with a turtle, an indication of longevity.\nThe movie Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring raises questions about the concept of human existence. It represents our lives as a sequence of circular actions. The film starts where it finishes - with an old man sharing his wisdom and knowledge with a young apprentice. By showing the life of one boy over the period of his change from the little boy to middle-aged mature man, the film provides insights about the main tenants of Buddhism. For instance, the film depicts how not being able to conrol one's lust can lead to severe consequences. It used certain animals to symbolize desire, craving, anger, and transformation, longevity.\nUnlike other films related to religion, Spring Summer Fall Winter...and Spring leaves the viewer with the thought about their actions and the way how they live their life.",

            "content": "Perfect SimplicityMy review of this film should end with those two words. However, the 10 line minimum requirement that IMDb requires of all reviews belies the differences between my world and the world shown to me in Spring, Summer, Fall, Winterand Spring. I understand why IMDb does not want 1000's of (apparently) useless two-word reviews in their database. However, I would hope that they could make an exception for this film.Perfect: The film is as close to perfect as a film could get. No shot is presented to us, nor a line of dialog uttered that does not make us ponder and understand at the same time. The film is also beautiful. (Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Asian cinema and never tire of the stunning ability of Asian directors to capture beauty on film.) This film exceeds most other Asian films I have seen in the cinematography regard. However, its beauty is surprisingly deceptive. Like most great films, it surpasses the 'cinematography' level of beauty and delves into the beauty of existence through its story. For example, the Old Monk has a different pet during each 'season' of his life. This is not discussed by the characters nor shoved in our face by the director - as would have been done if Hollywood had done this film. It is merely background we experience and come to understand. Two days after viewing the film, I am still finding new reflections in my mind that encompass the cinematography, the literal story and the underlying context of the film.Simplicity: This film approaches a level of cinematic Haiku. While I don't recall the entire dialog with any specificity, I am sure you could print the script on one page of paper. The amazing part is that while you are watching the film, you don't notice this. Every shot moves the story along. The simplicity of life as shown by the story is reflected in the simplicity of the film. After the film ended, I had a strong urge to move away from civilization and live - or die - in peace with nature. I enjoy (and have come to be too dependent upon) modern inventions, so I will stay at home. However, this film will remain in my heart. It does exactly what good story-telling is supposed to do: Take us completely out of our world and put us in another. There is no wonder that this film was selected for so many film festivals.",

The main theme of the movie as stated in the title is to emphasis the seasons and cycles of life. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "One of the most important aspects of cinema is the way it represents culture and transmits a country's beliefs to the rest of the world. You find yourself watching foreign films and contemplating a variety of subjects which you would never even have thought of, and enveloping yourself in said country's culture, at first with some restraint and shock, at the end with deep empathy and profound understanding. Korea, for example, is a country I know very little about, and with the exception of Chan-Woong Park's masterpiece \"Old Boy\", I had never seen a Korean film which truly moved me and which brought me closer to understanding their different culture. Kim Ki-Duk's \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring\" changed my way of thinking, and it became one of the most breath-taking and marvelous film experiences I've ever had.It's a surprisingly simple yet profoundly emotional film, that's about nothing and everything at the same time. It all takes place in a floating house that silently drifts atop a gorgeous river deep within a vast, forgotten forest. Nature here is unharmed and unfrequented by man, and everything is peaceful, stunningly beautiful and quietly sublime. In this floating house live an old, wise Buddhist monk (Young-Soo Oh) and his child apprentice (Young-Min Kim), living in utter harmony with nature and perfecting a profound relationship with their God through meditation and humble living. The film follows these two characters through different stages in their lives and through different seasons; we see the boy grow taller and become a man, and we see the monk grow older and nearer to death. The innocence and natural bliss is interrupted when a young girl (Yeo-Jin Ha) arrives to stay in the floating house to cure herself from sickness, and this awakes feelings the boy never even knew he was capable of feeling.The point of the film is precisely that- to expose the emotions and feelings of human beings in their natural state. Few things happen in the film, but every single scene pertains to a human emotion, and is depicted in such a sublime and poignant way that we identify with them all and cheer for the sheer wonderment we're being shown. Everything moves according to Buddhism too, and we're introduced to various Buddhist principles, simple yet memorable life lessons and a deeper sense of spirituality. There is little dialogue in the film (and I mean little), but that's all for the best; words are useless when you have such raw emotion going on screen. There is a fair use of imagery and metaphor too- the animals that inhabit the floating house, the direction the house floats towards, even the changing seasons...not only do they deepen the supernatural meaning of the events, but point towards a higher meaning of the universe and how human nature distorts and tries to remedy what could be utter perfection.The film lasts a little less than two hours, and even though there's few dialogue and seldom any events, the power, elegance and profundity of the images presented keep you transfixed to the screen, experimenting a variety of thoughts and ideas. Ki-Duk Kim combines breath-taking landscapes, metaphors, a trance-inducing score and masterful cinematography to convey interesting points of view in life and to perfectly exemplify the truth behind Buddhism.The film opens itself to a thorough analysis, and a viewer could spend hours writing paragraph after paragraph about the meaning of each scene. But I rather sit back and let the film wash over me, awakening an explosion of thoughts which would take me hours to write down but which instantly make sense in my mind. Little by little, you will begin to make sense out of many things (including Buddhist rituals you have no idea what they mean), and you will begin to feel as if you've drawn something important and transcendental from what you've seen, and that even though you can't put your finger on it, you are aware of its presence in your mind.Works of art just don't get any better than this. And with this kind of film, it's safe to say that Korea has made itself an everlasting place on the map as one of the countries who has produced one of the most important films the world has seen. I highly recommend it! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",

A gorgeous spectacle Mr. Kim Ki-Duk has captured on film for him to weave in a story where both its overt and subtle narratives are rife in symbolic images, Buddhist themes, and animal motifs that complement its sparse dialogue and affecting soundtrack, all helps in depicting the solitude that comes with the monastic life.\n \nI hope I could visit that place at least once in my lifetime. How lucky it is for those people who live near those places and witness first-hand the changes in the landscape that each season brings. Blissful.Worth noting in the film is scenes where the young monk having reached his adolescence shows off his Tokyo-Drift-esque skills with a wooden boat to a young woman he very much fancies, a bit of humor. But also be warned because there are scenes that show animals being subjected in varying degrees of disconcerting and distressing situations. My rating: A-plus-plus.",

            "content": "This masterpiece of Kim Kiduk lacks the dialogues. However, it is rich for symbolism and hidden messages, so dialogues seem unnecessary.\nFilm describes the fate of a child Buddhist monk disciple living in an isolated floating temple with his master. The painting on the side of the boat representing the lotus birth of Buddha symbolizes the original purity of human mind at birth. As lotus blooms spotless clean in the mud so human is innocent when he is born. In this film you can see how child is influenced by different emotions as temptation, desire to possess and anger through his life, and how stages of this maturation is beautifully aligned with the seasons of a year.(SPOILER ALERT)\nSpringSpring symbolizes the beginning of a new life. As the new sprouts appear, they seem tender and inexperienced. You can see how the older generation teaches the younger their wisdom and knowledge.\nOne interesting detail are 'useless' doors inside the temple. They divide the room into 3 distinct area, yet there is no real wall. Despite that both monk and his disciple use doors instead of bypassing it. I guess it is made for self-discipline: to follow the rules that master set despite how ridiculous it seems.\nAlso, the biggest message in this part is a first point in a Buddhist code of behavior: \"Refrain from harming living being\". Master punishes his disciple the same way as he tortured the animals so he could feel what he did and warns him: \"If one of them dies you will carry the rock in your heart for the rest of your life\".SummerSummer is often associated with youth, freedom, and pleasure.\nWe can notice the symbolism of the doors once again here. As he becomes more tempted with desires, he breaks the habit of using the doors. When he crawls to the girl he steps over his master and avoids both doors. There was no actual prohibition for any kind of action, no matter if it is a lust or crime. 'Door' gives you a choice if you want to take that action or not, but once those 'doors' fall you will stop being conscious about those choices.\nAs monk learns about the relationships between his disciple and the guest, he says that it is natural. However, he sends the guest back to her home as \"lust awakens the desire to possess, and that awakens the intent to murder\". But doors have already fallen for the disciple and he leaves following his desires.FallFall is a decline of life when nature goes to its 'death'.\nThe disciple is also in the lowest point of his life. Full of anger and rage, after revenging his unfaithful wife, he comes back to the temple.\nHe feels lost, his mind is not peaceful, and he feels like he has no control over himself. Sealing his eyes, mouth, and ears with a character 'Close' he possibly wanted to abstract away and remove all the senses. His master makes him to carve the heart sutra on a wooden floor using a weapon, with which he committed a murder to bring the peace to his heart back. The frame where the monk hits the can with a rock that detectives could not shoot shows the high level of self-control and mindfulness. After the disciple finishes carving, he seems to regain the peace in his mind.\nFall represents the down of the monk's life too. The snake swimming away the boat after monk's death may mean the transmigration of his soul and rebirth.\nYou see the snakes a lot throughout the film. Master warns the boy about abundance of snakes in the beginning of the movie, boy kills the snake, he notices the mating snakes in his adolescence, the monk's soul transmigrates into the snake. It may be the referral to the Nagi, the divine creatures from the Buddhist mythology.WinterWinter represents the death and still life. As the disciple comes back to the temple he founds it in abandoned state and learns about the death of his master. He collects the Sarira of his master and places into the ice Buddha statue as a relic.\nAnother meaning of the winter is a confrontation. Harsh weather tempers the mind and raises the resilience. He starts the confrontation the 'evil' in himself trying to temper both his body and mind. He still 'carries the rock in his heart' from his past actions and he is mindful about it. Meanwhile another person could not confront the 'harsh winter' in her life and leaves her baby to the monk.and... SpringLife is cyclic. This is a law of samsara.\nAs seasons of the year replaces each other there is a younger generation that replaces the older ones.\nPeace came to the life of the monk as spring relived the nature after the long winter. There is a new sprout that is just developing his buds. And he is yet to learn about life around him, about violence, about love, about temptations and desires. And he is yet to carry his own rocks in his heart.",

Like The Passion of the Christ, having some objective background in the scriptures of the faith helps you to get more out of the movie. One interesting element in the casting is that after the old master dies, he comes back as the same little boy that the younger monk was in his youth. So there is an implied step beyond reincarnation here; perhaps both men are the same person living a concurrent existence. The story is based on a typical style of Buddhist parable; it illustrates a set of principles that are basic to Buddhist thought by following the monastic lives of two monks in a father-son type of relationship. The characters are bland and unassertive. The scenes of nature reflect the cosmology of Buddhism that life events flow in cycles of cause and effect that follow the patterns of natural law.

Film isn't like a painting or a picture where art is simply what it is. Movies are like one part Art, one part Entertainment, one part Technical, and one part Love.

Things were said such as, \"Sometimes the most complex things are best when they are the simplest.\" Although that is true in some cases, it does not apply here.

            "content": "Spring, Sumer, Fall, Winter... and Spring is a South Korean movie about unusual Buddhist monastery that floats on a lake which is surrounded by forest. This movie showcases the life story of a Buddhist monk from his very early childhood till the time of his old age. While the titular seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter are really represented in the time in which they were claimed to be, as it probably can be guessed, they are not just associated with the real seasons, but they also are allegorically addressing quite convoluted path of a young monk. There is not much dialogues, or a background narrative voice which would have explained what is happening in the story (while sometimes it would be good to have it), but still scenes are showed in such a way that it definitely grasps the attention of the viewer right till the last minute of the movie. Film is packed with numerous allegories, and cultural peculiarities of South Korea (through which indeed differences in Buddhism practices according to regions can be traced) which would entertain the auditory by their sophisticated, and nuanced exhibition. In my opinion, this movie deserves to be watched at least due to its quite unusual but incredibly exciting style of story representation.\n Movie starts with a rather spectacular scene depicting the day-to-day routine of a Buddhist apprentice and his master. What is interesting about these scenes is the strange presence of doors when there are no walls, and right from this moment it starts to seem that movie is going to be a quite capturing one. An apprentice is just a small boy, who seems rather childish and who tries to do everything as his master does. But, once he decided to \"play\" with a fish, frog, and a snake by tying small stones to them and laughing as they struggle. His master is watching at these three occasions all along the way. Then, in the night, in order to teach his apprentice of his incorrect actions he tied a stone, just proportionate to his size. When the boy wakes up and finds himself tied with a stone, he asks his master for help. But his Master claims that only after he would free the creatures from the torments which boy imposed on them, the master would release him. The boy becomes really surprised and amused when he realizes that his 'game' has tortured the creatures, and that snake, and a fish had died. I think that this scene is on what this movie stresses its focus because it very vividly depicts the danger of ignorance, and pursuit of one's unthoughtful desires.\n Later, in the \"Summer\", the story plot is occurring around the young lady that was brought into the monastery because of her illness, and the love to which a young apprentice would fall with her. After his Master would know about their relationships, and sends apprentice's \"girlfriend\" back, an apprentice will escape from the monastery leaving his Master alone in order to pursue his love. But, this story does not actually have a \"happy ending\". In the \"Autumn\" we see that frustrated and grief-stricken man who is looking for a refuge from the police since he has committed a crime. While the Master helps his apprentice to release his anger, stops him from suicide, and supports him - Master appears to be harshly disappointed. After the police had found the man and took him, we see that Master self-emulates him, which appears to be quite compelling scene because the Buddhist teaching does not accept it, and additionally it is a quite vivid scene. \n The \"Winter\" depicts how a grown man, that had experienced all the \"ugliness\" of life, comes back to the monastery where has grown up. He spends some time in seclusion, which notably help him to ensure his spirituality before he himself becomes a Teacher to a young boy, that was brought to the temple by a woman that was in sorrow about her action. While some of the scenes seems rather unclear, and hardly understandable in a thorough way to one who is not quite accustomed to the culture of South Korea, and their way of practicing Buddhism, they certainly provoke a wide variety of strong emotions and questioning of these customs. \n The film ends in an already \"acquainted\" scene - boy playing with stones and creatures. But, now it actually is a different boy. This movie unequivocally represents one of those art pieces which not only are worth watching once, but also for the second and third time as well since I believe every time, and every individual would understand it in a discrete way. This arises because of the \"room\" for imagination which the film cordially provides us for having our own perceptions about the matter of the film, but it simultaneously is depicting the fundamental wisdoms of Buddhism quite concretely.",

            "content": "If you are not familiar with the basics of Buddhism, you will be after watching this movie. You might not realize it, and you won't know the terminology, but this whole movie is not only about a boy who becomes a man and then raises a boy, but also about the core Buddhist beliefs.(NOTE: Some of the following comments might spoil some of the plot elements. However, the official movie website has a \"synopsis\" that spoils the entire plot, without explaining the Buddhist themes, so at least this review is better than that!)The first lesson we see is that creating suffering for others, no matter if they are fish or snake or frog or person, causes suffering for yourself. Most people know this as Karma.The second lesson is that desire causes suffering. The Old Monk warned the Young Monk of this, but the Young Monk did not resist, and ruined most of his life as a result. (I laughed very hard when Yoda, in Star Wars Episode I, explains this same lesson: \"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.\")If you listen carefully to the conversation between the monks, you will understand both how desire causes suffering, and how letting go can prevent the suffering.\nThe third lesson is that you can purify yourself and get rid of the negative thoughts that cause desire and suffering. Some people achieve this by studying the teachings, some by meditating, and some by spiritual tasks, such as repeated bowing or chanting. The Young Monk, instead, drags a millstone and a statue of Tara, the Compassion Buddha, up to the top of a mountain overlooking the lake, where she can keep an eye on things.The fourth lesson is that the cycle repeats, and does not necessarily have to degrade because of the imperfections of the people involved. The Young Monk purified himself and became a capable teacher, and the teachings also transcend the imperfections of the teachers.In addition to these lessons, the movie touches on some of the superstitions about Buddhism which want for a little explanation. These appear in the scenes where the Old Monk leaves this life.Most important is the fact that the Old Monk, like many famous very enlightened Buddhists are reputed, can tell he is about to die. He therefore is able to prepare himself. Some Buddhists, especially enlightened masters, are cremated. Since there is no one to help him, the Old Monk builds his own funeral pyre and then sits in it. It's not suicide -- he knows that he will die soon, and picks the moment of his death, as great masters are reputed to be able to, just before the flames engulf him.We also see a snake emerge from the pyre, and we kind of get the idea that the snake is a reincarnation of the Old Monk. You will find this kind of thing in Buddhist legends, as well.When the Young Monk returns, he digs in the ice for remains of the Old Monk. In Buddhist lore, these remains are considered magical and sacred, as if the Buddhist teachings themselves were somehow compressed into fabulous jewels (some of the remains are said literally to resemble jewels). In civilized areas, these remains are often put in special monuments called stupas, and these monuments literally radiate peace and enlightenment into the surrounding area.However, the Young Monk instead wraps the remains in a cloth and puts them into a Buddha sculpture made of ice. In this way, the remains are released into the water when the ice melts, and this will release the purified goodness into the area for the benefit of all the entities in the area.But put all that aside, and you'll still see a beautiful fable about peace and sanctity and about how it's possible to regain them even if you've gone far away, and about how each life has its own chance to achieve them.I know I'll be buying the DVD and watching it often.",

He should have a nice hair cut and clean fitting clothes before approaching a lady....makes his chances of winning her brighter. The Buddha's garb is for meditation purposes only.

I thought there were, without giving too much away, a few tonal missteps in the fall and winter chapters. I didn't think the investigators should have shown up at the lake for two reasons: One, I loved how we were isolated from the rest of the world in this beautiful, serene atmosphere, and the detectives' costumes really took me out of that world, and secondly, I simply didn't buy that they would allow a murderer to finish the task the master gave him before taking him. There were a few other elements, introduced late in the film, that seemed to be somewhat at the convenience of the screenplay.Though not flawless, Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring, is a beautiful film of great originality that hits more than it misses.

Ki-duk Kim utilizes stylistic techniques characteristic of Korean cinema as both writer and director. The film features a small Buddhist monastery that rests in a lake beneath the snowy mountains of the region. The serene setting is gently interrupted by the arrival of a curious young boy who trains to become an old monk's successor. The narrative is divided into portions of the boy's life, delineated by the passing of each season. The story is revealed at a slow, winding pace as an archetypal life story unfolds on the screen. With little dialog to follow, one begins to interpret the visual symbolism within the film in order to extract deep meaning from the quintessentially Korean narrative. The use of long, unchanging takes allows the viewer to become absorbed in the tranquil environment that engulfs the unusual one-room monastery. As a result one finds the dramatic climaxes within the film that much more jarring; viewing the film becomes, therefore, a reflection on the events that shape, challenge, and reaffirm not only the main character's life but also one's own.",

According to the film, it seems that the fixed rolls of master and disciple will be always present in every season of the human age, invested by different performers condemned to a repetition that perhaps obeys to a stubborn design of the Unknown. Humans and animals are born, search for food and copulation, kill and die. Voluntarily or not, each one carries a burden at his back. Neither punishment nor exercise can avoid, except transitory, the inexorably hard itinerary of living. The pessimistic message that the film oozes out is compensated by a stunning record of a mute, isolated, notwithstanding extremely beautiful surrounding, where are imposed to both inhabitants rites, behavior, and visible and invisible barriers, that in some sense could be perceived as enough similar to those of any society in the past and also now. A statue of Buddha put by the monk at the summit of a mountain may play the judge and protector of men wrong doing and suffering. Kim ki Duk knows to interweave cruelty and compassion and to knock the spectator and fascinate him at the same time. In spite of its schematic ideology the film may strongly touch us by its visual beauty. Not strange that the director was also a painter.",

I remember a friend (from Viet Nam) telling me she had just seen the most incredible movie with her American husband, who absolutely loved it though he never seen an Asian movie, she described it to me as \"calming\". When I saw it I felt I wanted to just drop out my modern day life and find a lake just like the one in the movie. I tried to convince my friends to see it but as often happens, the movie only played for 1 week and most of them missed it. When I bought it (not cheap $25.00) I sat with my boyfriend and watched it, we never spoke a word during the movie, it was a sign of how the simplicity of the story yet strong messages made us think as we went along with the story, it brought us closer together as human beings, closer to our inner source, closer to realizing the symbiotic relation of nature and our souls, in short it was a complete respite from the insane busy lives we personally lead. We talked for days about it, not the message so much but how we felt having seen it and since have decided it was a movie one can see again and again as the message we'll get from it, will and can be different each time. How lovely that the director was able to convey this to us half way around the other side of his world. Gentle and lovely is the best way to describe how it made me feel. Though I love many Asian films such as Hero, House of Daggers, Crouching Tiger, etc. which all have messages as well, this film was the absolute best for me.",

The decision to have very little dialog is also inspired for this certain kind of picture. The Zen master is just perfect for the role, every time I saw him I had the feeling a real master is shown on screen. Everything he says or does is as it should be. Some may not understand his actions, based on \"accepting whatever comes\", but they were pretty authentic. As long as he was around, everything was good.But the winter season just made no sense to me. First of all, what is the purpose of all that Wushu practice ? It was just thrown in there, for the sake of the show. Those high kicks in the middle of the winter(learned from a book ?) without much clothes are, I believe, made just for their visual. If he was practicing as a child, or taught directly by the master, there was at least a connection. Then he went on climbing the mountain with a big stone tied to his back. This was pointless, it made sense when he was 10 since it was a punishment from his master... I know some of you are going to say he was actually dropping his past and so on, but I believe this is commercial rubbish. From what I've read : As you progress in Zen you do less, not more(so it would have made sense if he practiced more meditation). Even the soundtrack is more intense and tries to stand out in the ending scene, whereas in the rest of the film it is just subtly hiding in the background !

The old monk is untroubled and continues his meditation as before in front of the \"missing\" Buddha, because he knows that the stone statue is not necessary for his prayers to be effective.As the young man is taken away by the police the boat suddenly halts, bound to the temple by some mystical force. The old monk is surprised: it appears that his own attachment to the young man (or possibly vice-versa) is holding the boat back. In any case the monk must forcibly will the boat to go.To some degree I view the monk's re-enactment of his pupil's \"Shut\" ritual as penance for developing a strong attachment to his pupil.

The entire dialog could fit on a piece of paper, each character's dialog is of utmost importance, but redundant at the same time, because you would still understand the plot without any dialog at all. What makes this movie so special is that it offers a glimpse into the true human nature, not only portraying our continuous struggle to find ourselves but also our purpose to find meaning in life. The protagonist's life is reduced to four 'seasons' and each season corresponds with a stage in his life. (I shall try to keep it abstract to prevent spoilers.) Spring represents the planted seed, buried deep under the snow and the prospect of growth and maturity around the corner. Summer represents the full grown, stubborn and proud being, gathering precious experience, but still swaying with the wind. Fall represents his desire for reconciliation, foremost with himself but also with others he has met along the way. With Winter comes his longed for peace of mind, having mastered his struggles he buries them under the icy white and soon another being will rise and be challenged the following spring, closing the endless circle of life and the struggle to find purpose and guidance in our lives.Impact on the viewer: We are being questioned about our wasteful, shallow and often times violent ways. The movie holds up a mirror so we may see ourselves in our struggle to discover the core values of life, without slipping into being didactic. Simplicity is not the sole reason this movie is brilliant, it's the fact that underlying all of our complex, engaged lives run the same core values and struggles which shape everyone's life the same way.

            "content": "The first thing that comes to mind after watching this movie is cyclicality, if to be more precise, the spiral cyclicality. The cyclical nature of the seasons which comes after one another with strict order of nature. Interestingly, but I found from this spiral cyclicality some kind of analogy with a fate of human being, which you cannot escape throughout your existence on Earth. Perhaps, there is a Buddhist philosophy according to which an individual goes through a number of stages of his life, at certain momentum of his life a person can think that he/she have some free will, by following after its own imaginary free will that person makes mistakes in something and finally understands that mistake which he did, was important to find his place in life, his truth. However, as I noticed in the movie disciple of Master is trying to change his fate by leaving to the city, while the Master does not try to change anything in his life, by continuing to live with nature in harmony, from my point of view the Master is already found his truth. A disciple in his cycle goes through a series of stages and, perhaps, what he does, everything that he tries to change in it, is the essence of this spiral cycle, which as a result comes to the same outcome.\n I would argue that the main agenda in the film is the soulful load. In spring, little boy did not know that all the bad things you did sooner or later will become transparent and you have to take responsibility for it. This is shown in the scene where child kills fish, frog and snake by playing in nature, then teacher ties him a stone on his back, and says I will untie the stone from you whenever you will untie stone from fish, frog, and snake, if they are died the sin of your action will be on your heart. At this point of time, I think, as a child, he realized how your bad act turns against you, and how your action can hurt someone. He became aware all of it, took upon himself feeling of guilt and carried that stone rest of his life. In summer, director of the movie shows how raging wave of feelings in youth lead them to trouble. The situation depicted in the episode where young man falls in love with girls and enters multiple time into sexual intercourse with her, once upon their amoral behavior is detected by Master, then the girl was compelled to leave the valley. Yet, the young man realizes that he cannot live without girl, and decides to follow after her to the city, where they marry and after some time went by he kills her because of his jealousy. With this scene, I think director tried to deliver that carnal love is not harmony, as Master himself states that passion generates desire, the desire to possess leads to murder, and I totally agree with him. While, in fall, the disciple becomes load for himself after murdering spouse. Then he returns to deep valley where he is again given the opportunity to take the blame and try to atone for it. Master forces disciple to carve out characters from holly Sutra text in order to drive out anger from his heart. After the cutting and painting the hieroglyphs he voluntarily surrenders to the police who came to detain him. Thus, after serving his sentence in prison he finally gets rid of emotional confusions and spiritual contradictions. In winter, he releases from prison and returns to his deep valley. He rises up the mountain with a stone on his back and with a Buddha's statue on his hand and, in my opinion, it is at that moment that he manages to remove the stone from the heart that was lying on it since his childhood. In addition, once upon, veiled unknown woman brings a child and dies, suddenly falling into open ice hole in the lake. The monk takes the orphan into his care. The movie ends with the arrival of another spring to the deep valley and the monk as in his childhood continues to educate the kid. \n Throughout the film, there is a sense of calamity and dimensionality. In some episodes of movie there is an emotional tension, which is very harmonious with nature. The personal conditions of people are connected to nature, it seems me sometimes that human beings are also rigorous and harsh as like winter, mature and wise as like spring, tranquil and friendly as like summer, and, cranky and irked as like fall. Laconic style of movie always kept me on thinking and realizing my past. The movie amused me with its eastern wisdom, its poetry, music and with magnificent landscape. \n After watching this amazing movie, I came to the conclusion that the struggle of the protagonist with his passions leads him to understanding, to consensus, to unity with himself. We observe how the agony of the soul become stronger than the pain of the body. Physical punishment can ease mental pain, but not cure it. Only after accepting and realizing of your own actions you can return to a delicate peace of mind. But your memory will forever save it in deep burdens of your mind, and the stone on your soul will hang forever until you decide to atone it. I would like to end my words with my following statement, \"every your sin is forgivable, if you will decide to atone for it\".",

In the movie you follow the life at a small floating Buddhist monastery, which sole occupant is a little boy and his elderly master. You observe, how the small boy evolves through his whole life, where the seasons represent the life course.The movie is visually absolutely beautiful with its mountain scenery. And the story is okay, but it's many silent movements and the overall long drawn storytelling polls down the rating don't a bit. So I will give it 6 out of 10 stars.

It already hits hard when you complete the first spring part of the film. It foreshadows the future outcome of the characters, past life of them and the entire film to be honest.Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and... Spring (2002) is visually so satisfying that it kept me hooked throughout the entire film despite being an almost silent feature. The cinematography talks about the silence of solitude, love, innocence, corruption, intimacy, Karma, spirituality and redemption. It's really amazing to think how the director pulled off such a voluptuous and spiritual journey not only of the characters but also of the atmosphere, the location and the entire world which revolves around the story throughout the movie. This is one of the most beautiful philosophical cinema I've ever seen. Hats off to Kim Ki Duk, the maestro!When we seek happiness outside ourselves, we are never truly content. This philosophy is the main protagonist of this hypnotic masterpiece of Kim Ki Duk. The entire movie floats around our mind like the monasterial hut. The circle of life is everlasting, innocent and redemptive. Our life is a boomerang and we, the human beings, are the athletes who control their own boomerangs.",

            "content": "The film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring\", created by the Korean film director Kim Ki-duk, was highly appreciated among the critics and was awarded with many global prizes, and after watching this I can easily understand why. Atmospheric - that is the appealing word to describe this film. Everything, starting from the amazing landscapes, and ending with barely-heard beautiful music, make viewers to be completely immersed in this parable-like movie. With the minimum amount of words, the creators of the film clearly delivered the story, and have let every viewer to make his own conclusion. \nIn my opinion, the idea of the film coincides with the Buddhist ideology, that life is full of suffering; it is a continuous battle with yourself, with your own cravings, attachments and unnecessary emotions. During the whole film, the main character is trying to conquer himself and to become like his master. Starting from the period when he, as a boy, attains pleasure from seeing the sufferings of animals and ending with the time when his lust turned him into a murderer. All this way through, his teacher is trying to help him, by attaching the stone to him and thus, showing how instant karma works, or by detaching him from the woman, the object of the disciple's passion. The teacher expects that he would be able to change the life of this boy by teaching him all that he knows. But the Wheel of Samsara is continuously turning because all creatures are sinful, and it is very hard to escape it, as well as it is hard to escape the fact that after spring where will be fall, and after fall there will be winter and on and on. \nThroughout the film, we can see different interesting Buddhist signs and references. The first thing that catches the attention is that nobody in this film has the name. It may be connected with the Buddhist idea of \"no-self\", that there is no permanent \"self\" in us. Another example, when the boy decides to leave, he takes with him the statue of Buddha and the rooster. By doing that he wants the revenge, he wants to hurt his teacher by taking away the things that his teacher loved and was attached to, the same as the teacher separated the disciple from his woman. But rooster in Buddhism symbolizes lust and attachment, so metaphorically speaking, the disciple takes this sin with him to his further life. Another episode, when the teacher burns himself after the monk goes to jail, the snakes come out. Snake in Buddhism symbolizes hatred emotion, so probably this was because the teacher was full of hatred and disappointment in his disciple and in himself, because he failed to pass the Dharma effectively. Or probably because even the disciple tried to get rid of the hatred through cutting the Sutra, it was still left in him. \nThat is the fascinating feature of this movie - everybody can understand and interpret this story according to his understanding. But the main moral is clear - it is all in your mind, which always should be in peace and not deceived by physical attachments, lust, cravings, hatred, and only through abandoning this, it would be possible to change the frailty of life and stop the Wheel of Samsara. Or how it was said in the movie: \"The suffering is in her mind. When she finds peace in her mind, her body will return to health\". \nOverall, I think it is a great movie. It greatly demonstrates the basics of Buddhist ideology and some of the Eastern cultural features. I think it may seem for some viewers to be a little slow, or lack of actions and words, but again, that is the feature of Asian movies, of their culture and mentality. There is a good camera work, amazing nature shown, good storyline, and more importantly, it provides a great food for thought, even for those, who are not interested in Buddhism.",

            "content": "The film shows us \"Spring, summer, autumn, winter...and spring again\" of a student who has experienced all the main human feelings, both high and vicious. The pupil will have to pass through all the trials and temptations to rise to the level of his teacher, so that when the time comes, he can take his place.\nSorting of collected medicinal herbs illustrates the entire film - the ability to distinguish. It seems that two herbs look the same, but one kills, and the other gives life and it is difficult to get confused about what is what. The goal of mature teacher is to make it the wisest way to explain to the student what is good and what is bad.\nThe film perfectly shows the cyclicity of life - samsara, and it is perfectly shown in comparison with the seasons. Spring will come, then summer, and so on, and in the end, spring will come again. No one has power to stop this cycle of life, just as the teacher is not able to prevent the mistakes of his student - everything has place and time to be.\nSpring. The student, as befits all children, wants to know the world around them. The student is like spring, he is still immature and through mistakes learns this world. And fortunately, he has a strict, but kind and wise teacher, who will always point out a mistake and show the right way, although he will have to show it to his favorite student through a well-deserved kick. And one small but meaningful scene occurs when a boy, because of his childish mischief, plays with a fish, a frog, and a snake, tying them to a rock at the end. Noticing this, the wise teacher did not scold him for his mistake but showed him the pain and inconvenience he caused to the animals by tying a large stone to the pupil himself. The most important statement of the teacher in part spring: \"if one of them dies, then you will wear a stone on your heart all your life\". So, it happened: two animals died and looking at the loud cry, the boy realized his mistake and carried the punishment inside himself. The teacher wanted to show his immature student that every life in this world is important, whether it is the life of a fish, a frog, or a snake.\nSummer. Like the summer, the student grew up, gained strength, and became a young man. Now he's smarter and stronger, and he's not that little boy who does not understand the life around him. However, his life changes dramatically when he meets a girl of his own age, who due to illness, came to his teacher. The student is relatively grown up, but he is still constantly discovering new things - it is common for him to make mistakes, previously it was to tie a stone to animals, and now it is to succumb to the temptation of a female body. During the film, love is shown as a drug, as a medicine for boring ordinary everyday life around, you should be able to refuse, but first you need to try it. The student is blinded by love and passion for the girl, now there is no place for teachings in his thoughts. On the day of the arrival of the girl, the student points out that it is prohibited to sit on the stone statue, but over time, finding feelings, he sets her on a stone statue by himself.\nAutumn. There comes a cold, life begins to fade and with this, the teacher sees the news that the man violently killed his wife. In this murderer, the teacher sees his pupil. The disciple comes to the place where he was expected, the place where he is destined to be. The teacher immediately accepts his student, without unnecessary words of aggression or condemnation, because the disciple came here for wisdom, for answers that should muffle all the pain inside. The words of the Buddha are relevant here: you will not be punished for your anger; you will be punished by your anger. Student becomes incredibly determined and aggressive. His anger reaches a peak, the pain inside is so strong that it seems further he cannot live an ordinary life. Consequently, he tries to commit suicide, but was stopped by his beloved teacher, one who was always nearby and always ready to give a help. By cutting out the Sutra, student begins a long and painstaking journey to the lost inner balance. He went off with the police with complete humility to serve his sentence. Whether admitting defeat in the fact that he raised up an unworthy student, or vice versa, deciding that he finished all his business in this world, the teacher commits a suicide ritual.\nWinter. The student returns to his home after serving his sentence and looking at the calm and humility in his actions, it can be understood that he has got rid of his inner suffering, and now, he is completely ready to replace gone teacher. An unknown woman leaves the child to the master, such a boy, which once was the teacher himself for a long time ago, and now everyone already understands what's what. Soon the winter will end, and the entire path must be traversed again.\n...and Spring. As expected, the little child became a student, just like his teacher before, he is childish like his teacher, tortures animals, just like his teacher. Life has come to its beginning, already other people, but with one essence of action.\nLife in the early spring and summer seems intended only for the sake of their own pleasure, the realization that this approach to life inevitably entails great suffering for the soul, sometimes comes too late, only in the fall. Autumn, as a period of personal maturity, brings with it spiritual torments, a re-evaluation of the past and gives a chance to prepare for the next round - winter, a complete life from the point of view of spirituality. Only after passing the full cycle of spiritual transformation, life passes to renewal-spring.",

It is through their choices and actions that you will come to understand the Buddhist philosophy that this film portrays.'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring' is chalked full of symbolism, which, due to the lack of dialog, encourages the viewers to contemplate on the movie's themes of beauty, love, life, death, and rebirth themselves. A thought-provoking film such as this is refreshing when so many other films force-feed us their views on the same subjects.I mention the theme of beauty first, because the cinematography is absolutely stunning. Out of all the movies I have ever seen, there is no comparison. Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring shows by far the greatest display of beauty in nature, from the fragile and gentle aspects of fish swimming in a pond, to the sublime sweeping views of the surrounding lake and mountain sides.Overall, I consider this movie a masterpiece. I believe it comes closer than any other to capturing beauty in its purest form. I am very eager to see what other work Ki-Duk Kim has done if this is any indication of his talent as a director.",

            "content": "Review\nIn my opinion, the main uniqueness of the \"Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and again... Spring\" is expressing key message through the seasons: spring as a little boy; summer as the teenager; autumn as the young man; winter as a middle age; and spring as his old age. Furthermore, it correlates with the level of consciousness of the main character: firstly, he, as a boy, learns initial rules of life from his master, then he does some mistakes, such as indulge with his desires. The next two periods - autumn and winter, as seasons of lifelessness and coldness - represent the harsh period for him. And the spring, as period of new life, shows the awakening of monk and becoming master for adopter boy. As you can see, Kim Ki-Duk made a great effort to visualize the life period of his main character. \nThe main thing, which will keep you to watch this film, is the atmosphere, which definitely shows a professionality of filming crew. Firstly, the limited amounts of words, especially in the second half of film, forces you to watch with the high focus on different details, such as emotions of separate characters and etc. Secondly, several details which could not be explained logically gives for the film some charms. For example, rooms which are separated by doors but without walls; super-natural abilities of the master to force boat move or stop. Lastly, despite the fact that the film is about the Buddhist monks, there is more about personal feelings of each character rather than the Buddhism itself and its traditions. The main reason for this statement is that we discovered the only tradition of burying man from the entire film. All above-mentioned factors are key elements in the whole beautiful atmosphere of this film. \nThis film got several critiques for animal abuse and too expressed sexual content. First one is due to European tolerance for all living creatures. Second critique, in my opinion, is justified by the need to make the audience feel the strength of dark desires in order to explain the failure of the na\u00efve monk to overcome his own passions, which created him further problems. \nTo conclude with, this film of Kim Ki-Duk is worth of your time if you have searched for atmospheric films with core lesson for your life. But be prepared - your position about desires could be changed.",

            "content": "A movie by Ki Duk Kim \"Spring, summer, fall, winter... and again spring\" represents a fascinating story about the lifestyle of monks. This movie also separated to parts described as the seasons of the year. And it starts by spring. Maybe because the spring is associated with living creatures like plants growing again after winter the same as human being born again after death. So, the story begins from describing a childhood of monk living with his master. From the movie, it can be clearly seen that the young monk respects and always listens to his master maybe because he is obliged to do so. However, in my point of view, the author wants to show us that student respects his master because of the master's wisdom. For example, when the young monk tied to a stone to frog, fish, and snake, the master did not just that tell him that what he is doing wrong but showed on him how it is difficult to take actions when you are tied to heavy things. In the other words, the author trying to show us the peaceful manner of the master teaching the right path. The second part is the summer when plants are flowering and giving fruits. The same will occur to the young monk when he gets older and become more aware of what the master teaches. In addition, he fell in love with a young girl who comes to them because of her illness. However, their time spending together comes to the end when the master decides to sent the girl back after the girl gets well. However, the student wants to be with this girl and leave his master because of his unwillingness to control his emotions. The master warns his student that lust might awaken intent to murder. Again, here we can see the wisdom of the master and his true prediction because he really kills his wife with knife. And the next season starts, it is autumn when it is time when leaves are falling down from tree and weather also becomes colder. The student monk also returns to his master feeling angry to his wife and to himself cold enough to his master. Trying to kill himself because he seems not to forgive himself but the master again shows his wisdom even though he has already said the consequences of his lust, by forgiving him and helping to drive all his anger and clean the soul and be in a peace with soul and prevents him from killing himself. After short time the student \nbegins to return his initial peace. However, policemen come to take him. The winter comes and plants dies and his master too. The monk student returns and takes care of the place left by the master. He gains his inner peace and become more soulful. One day one woman with closed face and head brings his son to this holy place. And die when running on the ice and child will be left to monk. This student monk becomes master to this child and teaches what he learned from his master.And again spring as it is written in the title spring comes and everything again come to the world and in the movie this child also makes mistakes as his master by giving stone to ingest to frog, snake and fish. It is like the repetition of life but with other student of monk. This movie does not clearly show what all these occurred things meant but leave the conclusion or the meaning of the story to the viewer. I was also confused but I predict this movie might describe the Buddhism where the people are being born again and again until they become wiser and come to liberation. And it is similar to the seasons of the year which repeats itself as people getting old and being come to life again. Maybe the master and his student came to liberation after dying because the master had ability to control the movement of boat and the house and his student also prepared by repetition of movements described in the book.To conclude, this movie is interesting and seems to give meaning with this story but more than one time should be watched to be able to get the full meaning.",

It was a pleasure to contemplate beautiful images of nature throughout the film. There are very few dialogues, but acting expressiveness of the actors, music and aesthetics of each scene do their job, and do not require words to be said in order to convey the message. The life of a Buddhist monk is compared to the seasons. The monk is portrayed by a different actor in each season. The change of actors is clear and inevitable in the spring-to-summer or a child-to-youth transition, however, later it has more a symbolic meaning, rather than a need. I think, the change of actors refers to one of the most important Buddhist doctrines of no-self. The doctrine states that there is no eternal, permanent, non-changing self or soul in each of us, living creatures. Similarly, we see a quite different personality in each of the phases of the monk's life. The circularity of time, and the change of the seasons represent impermanence as the essence of life. Buddhism teaches that no attachment should take place, as everything is impermanent. Similarly, a monk gets attached to a girl, and loses her later, as her feelings are not permanent as well. The fact that he kills her show that early in his life he did not understand this Buddhist truth of impermanence. The film is full of Buddhist symbolism. The thing that hits attention is the doors. Apparently, they do not serve their usual function and their use is more about the choice than a need. The use of doors might symbolize the discipline, the morality of everyday choices and following a right path. The first signal of a monk going away from monk's morality was when he overstepped his sleeping teacher in order to come close to a girl. I think that the main message that the director wanted to convey in this film was the need of compassion to all living creatures. From the very first scenes, an old monk teaches his disciple to be compassionate to all living things around, and later demonstrates great compassion and wisdom to a murderer. It was heart-warming to see how even policemen that came to arrest a criminal manifested compassion and belief that a person can change. Though, the monk's life path can not be called happy, the film leaves a mood of peace, hope, reconciliation and light sorrow. The other thing that I liked about the film is that it evokes interest in the viewers to the Buddhist culture, religion, traditions. For example, right away after the film I was very curious to google the meanings of the animals depicted in the film, or the meaning of face closed, or the so-called Prajnamapitra Sutra, or the procedure of tight bondage and many other details. Overall, I was very satisfied by this film, abundant of both magnificent images and though-provoking messages.",

            "content": "This movie alone challenged my interpretation of film; basically the very fundamental framework of film-making -- the aperture -- is itself a doorway to the experience of film, a meta-language within the common visual dialect, and now thanks to Ki-Duk Kim's gentle tutelage, it illuminates an understanding of the harrowing and impossible role of the subjective experience in the grander scheme of the nature of this world we inhabit.Ki-Duk Kim's stage in this piece of illustrative theater, a floating monastery, is itself a 1.66:1 framework, first framed by the 1.33:1 of an ornate gate which reveals the stage framed in the grander and somehow less accessible (and impossibly fractal) proscenium of lake-tree- mountain-sky.Thus Ki-Duk tells us within the first 2 minutes that beauty is the intractable edge between nature and sentience; while many have seen this as a \"morality play\" or a \"Buddhist parable\" of the evils of attachment and desire, we are quickly assured (and sometimes even jarringly corrected) that oftentimes morality as we view it -- with its opinions, its judgments of good and evil -- is really itself a distraction. In its place -- a rare commodity it seems -- simple empathy will suffice; empathy say with a fish tied to a rock.But alas, this state of a simple empathic morality cannot be sustained. In the western culture, we are familiar with a fall from grace -- it's parallel in the Ki-Duk universe is the awakening of desire that all sentient beings must encounter. For instance, the old monk does not chide his pupil for succumbing to his temptation; instead he plays a silly trick (one that indeed gives me a chilling flashback to Peter Greenaway's \"Drowning By Numbers\". In fact, I could not flee the fear of submersion and drowning which permeates this film, nor could I cast away the similarities between Ki-Duk Kim's and Greenaway's early -- i.e. not composited -- visual storytelling).The old monk is not at all moralistic about desire and its fulfillment -- he admits that it has healing purposes. He is clear, however, that desire as natural as it is, leads to possessiveness which leads to murder. Desire, because of its selfish possessive nature, precludes empathy, and thus leads to \"murder\" whether literal or allegorical (in order to live we must make others suffer).This film touches many more facets of human existence -- repentance, the inescapable cyclical nature of time, simple compassion in the face of personal hopelessness. In addition, it challenges our understanding of film -- both in its manufacture and consumption. At what point does the framing of the narrative become observable; which framing is intended, and which framing do we bring to our observation of it?",

            "content": "South Korean movie called \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring\" is the cinematography masterpiece directed by Kim Ki-duk and first shown in 2003. It depicts the life of a Buddhist Monk, taking place in a monastery in the middle of an alpine lake surrounded by forest. \nAs the title provides viewers with the hint, the story is divided to 5 episodes roughly ten to twenty years apart, each portraying the important stages of novice monk's growing. \nAt the beginning viewers are introduced with the little boy and his master living in a solitude praying and meditating on a small floating monastery, drifting on a lake in the serene forested mountains of Korea. Small, old boat, which is the only merit of connection with the outer world, is used to reach the bank of the lake where they walk, exercise and collect herbs. The Spring shows the apprentice discovering the power and violence, as he torments fish, frog and snake, tying a small rock to them and watching them suffer. The master, who is attentively observing all 3 scenes, punishes his disciple by tying smooth rock to his back and chastising him to release the creatures, but if boy finds any of them dead, he will 'carry the stone in his heart forever'. Wading through the forest and struggling with the load on his back, boy finds the fish, lying dead on the bottom of the creek, unties the frog frantically trying to jump out of water, exactly where boy has left it, and finds snake in the pool of blood, probably attacked by another animal unable to escape. The boy bursts into tears seeing what he has done to the snake. \nIn Summer episode, viewers see apprentice in his teenage discovering the feeling of love and its dangers. He meets a mother and her daughter heading to the monastery to cure unspecified illness of the teenage girl. Mother prays all night and, then, leaves her child to Buddhist master to be healed. Over the next few days, the apprentice finds himself sexually attracted to the girl; he cannot resist from groping her breast and staring at her at night. Frightened with the absolutely new feelings, he is too shy to disembosom. Nevertheless, these feelings seem to be mutual, as two teens have sex in the forest and the affection gets stronger and stronger. The morning master discovers their relationship, he expresses neither anger nor disappointment, he merely warns his apprentice that 'lust leads to desire for possession, and possession leads to murder' and asks the girl to leave the monastery as she is already healed. The apprentice follows the girl the next morning stealing the Buddha's statue and the rooster, which symbolize the burden of his master's teachings and his own cravings. \nThe Fall episodes takes place many years later. Aged master glimpses a story about his former disciple being wanted for the murder of his wife. Foreseeing his apprentice's return he gets ready to see him, modifying his monk's garments. When adult apprentice appears in the monastery, full of anger, he, then, makes an attempt to conduct suicide ritual by sealing his eyes, mouth and ears, however, master discovers him and beats him ruthlessly, declaring that killing his wife does not allow to kill himself so easily. Master orders his former apprentice to carve 'Heart Sutra' that he has written with the ink on the wooden floor of the monastery. When two detectives arrive to arrest the man, masters asks to give them one night to complete the task as it may help his apprentice to regain his temper. The following morning detectives peacefully take away the man to the jail. Episode ends with the old master building a pyre in the rowboat to conduct a suicide ritual, as he understands that his life is at the end. \nCovered by snow and ice monastery is left with nobody in it. Adult apprentice returns to his former home to bring life back to this place. Soon, he finds the manuscript with the choreographic exercise and starts his training to get ready to become new master. One night woman with shawl wrapped around her face comes to the monastery with her baby son. She leaves her son and flees into the night, where she accidentally stumbles into a hole in the ice dug by the monk. Though apprentice takes her body from the lake, her face stays uncovered to the audience. Completing tough and long process of training and self-discipline, man assigns himself the greater task. He ties the monastery large circular stone emblematic to the Buddhist culture (Bhavacakra, the wheel of life and death) to his body, takes the Buddha's statue (Maitreya) and climbs to the highest peak to meditate and leave the statue of Buddha-to-come to observe the monastery from the mountains. \nReturning to Spring, the cycle is started again. Abandoned baby, who is now apprentice of the new master, repeats the very same steps of his master, so that cycle goes on. \nThe movie is full of symbolism. The seasons themselves can be considered as main characters as they depict the stages of growth which each human being goes through. The sequence of the seasons of the year is that strong, so it cannot be resisted or changed, the same is applied to the growing up and acquiring lessons. Though movie has distinct link to the Buddhism, it can be applied to anybody regardless of the religious or ethnical identity. Being humans we are prone to make mistakes as life is full of temptations. However, we also have the great gif of learning and analyzing, so that as time goes by we evolve and grow both physically and mentally, that way the endless circle repeats on and on. The old teach the young, watch them making mistakes, help and punish when needed, but discipline results in wisdom, so the young is ready to become the old. \nInterestingly, that except detectives, none of the characters have names, so that the message of the movie can be applied to anyone who has his heart and mind open to wisdom, that's why the movie 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring' is absolutely worth watching.",

            "review_title": "It's natural to make mistakes",
            "content": "I watched a movie \"Spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring\" three times: during my childhood, at the age of 17, and today. When I was a child, I thought about this movie as a fairytale. At the age of 17, the movie seemed to be tragic. Today I came back to the idea of fairytale: the movie, in my opinion, is full of symbols and events which are mysteriously happening during the movie. Some of them are intuitively easy to understand even though I am not a part of Korean and Buddhist society. Also, today the story seems to me not so tragic but rather more natural and daily, and the relationships between the old monk and his disciple feels like the relationships between father and son.When the movie started, I was wondered with how the temple was incorporated in the nature. We could see that the house was located near the forest and could be built inside of it. However, it was built on some platform on the lake. It may look like strange place for building a temple but if the temple was built inside of the forest, during the building of the temple, trees would be cut down in the possible place of the temple. Even from the location of the temple we could see caring attitudes toward the nature of people who built the temple and the monk who lived in it. Moreover, the temple represents the old monk. As I understood, the major part of his lifetime he spent alone and was surrounded by nature.Important participants of the movie are animals: fish, fog, snake, cock, cat. In the first part of the movie, young disciple kills a fish and a snake. In the \"Summer\" part, we could see a fish and snake. They are different from the previous part, but it was symbolic: even though you made mistakes, the life continues. I understood as a second chance given to the young disciple.In the \"Fall\" part, we met a stray cat which was found by the old monk near the gates. Ironically, not so long after that his disciple came back to the temple. His mature disciple resembles the stray cat. The stray cat was not able to come down to the earth from the statue without help, however, it's natural for cats to jump without fear. This cat was not able to do such a natural thing. The disciple who disappointed in his life and wanted to end his life, however, it's natural to want to live for human beings. Both went astray. Also, we could see how the old monk was especially emotional toward the cat although he didn't show any emotions to guests in the \"Summer\" part, when people act disrespectful in the temple. In the \"Fall\" part, we can see how the monk gentle to the cat: he was petting the cat with a smile. And it was the only place in the movie when we could see how the old monk smiles. This act reminds how he cared his young disciple when the disciple was a child. Moreover, in the scene when the disciple was carving sutra, the cat was also feeling discomfort. In the end of the \"Fall\" part, when the disciple found peace after whole night of work, the disciple and cat left the temple. I think that scene was important because it illustrated that every people have own destiny and you should sometimes let\nthem go even though it may bring you a feeling of loneliness and suffering.Another important aspect which I want to highlight in this story is the relationships between people, especially family relationships. As we noticed, there are not so many dialogs in the movie as we usually find in movies. This makes us more careful toward nonverbal expressions and small gestures.\nIn the \"Spring\" part, when the old monk wakes up, he tenderly tries to wake up the boy. In the \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" parts, we could see how the monk was observing actions of the boy and letting him to make his own mistakes. It may seem indifferent attitude of the monk toward the boy, but it was acceptance of weaknesses of his disciple. The monk didn't blame the boy even when he decided to leave and took away the Buddha's statue. This situation looked like the situation with grown up children and parents: at certain moment of life children leave, and it's natural.In the \"Fall\" part, we can see how the monk accepted his disciple. He was not blaming him for the murder, he was worried about his wellbeing and happiness. When the disciple tried to commit a suicide, the monk became furious - this act is unnatural for monks who train their patience and acceptance for years. From that we can conclude that the monk had been personally moved by the action of the disciple.Another situation I would like to discuss is when the disciple told that he killed his wife because she had left him, the monk said that you should your loved ones let them go. This action may seem alien to the monk, however, we can see it in the end of \"Fall\" part. In the scene when the disciple and cat were leaving, we can see how the monk was sad and lonely. I can not think that it's a coincidence that after the leave of his disciple the monk deiced to end his life. My feeling is that the monk understood that his disciple would be living a better life and he would come back to the temple, so the monk accomplished what he ought to do in this life. I was emotionally touched when I recognized that during the self-immolation, I saw traces of tears. We can think about it as his attachment to the disciple: the disciple and the monk were a family. In the\nend, the monk let his disciple go even though it brought a suffering.In my opinion, the last 2 parts were final, they showed that all in our lives are periodical as seasons of a year. And at the first glance the nature of human beings may seem to be cruel, stupid, greedy, it does not mean that humans are not able to change and feel sorry for the things they've done. It's natural to make mistakes. As I understood from the movie, you will always have the second chance to start your life.",

            "content": "The \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring\" film is imbued with extraordinary spirituality and symbolism. At the first sight it is just a life story about a young Buddhist apprentice. But the film contains plenty of deep ideas which are worth analyzing separately. In this review, I want to examine some scenes of the film which depict the religious conceptions and to investigate to what extent they correspond to reality. Firstly I will discuss the concept of a collection of changes. Secondly, I will consider how the concept of karma was illustrated in the film. Thirdly, I will write about four noble truths in Buddhism. And lastly, I will try to bind the film with Eliade's idea about sacred spaces, and will express my general feelings about this film.One of the main ideas of the film is a permanent cycle of life which goes, as seasons replace each other. Although someone can claim that the samsara concept is related to this idea, I believe that the concept Yijing Divination of early Chinese religion explains it better. Yijing Divination is a collection of changes. There is a belief system that was associated with Yijing. First is that the world/cosmos is not chaotic or random. Second is that everything that happens is dictated by a pattern just as seasons always go the same way. Considering that, it can be supposed that the Buddhist apprentice was doomed to go through all the difficulties in his young ages, in order to achieve appeasement and mature to become a teacher himself. It is believed that sages could predict the dictated pattern by making special rituals. Probably the monk from the film knew the destiny of his pupil, though no rituals were shown directly. Therefore, he waited for his pupil in a \"Fall\" scene in order to help him to forgive himself, and only after that, the monk decided to pass away.The movie well illustrates the concept of karma. Even a person who did not study religions knows what karma means. It is about that every action inevitably provokes a response either instantly or at some point in the future. We can see the effect of instant karma in a \"Winter\" scene, when a woman who gave her child, leaving the temple, falls into the hole in a frozen lake and dies. Furthermore, we can see how the bullying of animals in childhood led to the suffering of the protagonist in adulthood. In my opinion that was an illustration of karma's response after many years. Also, I believe that the in the \"Winter\" the scene of the climbing on mounting with a tied stone abstractly depicts how all wrong actions we did, all our sins (stone) make it difficult to move forward in life (climbing the mountain).In Buddhism, there are Four Nobel Truths which are undeniable. I want to write about the first three of them, that in my opinion were properly depicted in the movie. First, is Duhkha, meaning that life is full of suffering. The second is Trishna, meaning that the root of the sufferings are cravings. And the third is that to overcome the sufferings one should overcome cravings. It is obvious that the life of the protagonist was full of suffering. It can be seen by his sick appearance in a \"Fall\" scene. The reason for his suffering was that he killed his wife for treason. But he killed her because of the desire to own her, and this desire is caused by the fact that he once could not overcome his lustful desires.Another interesting feature of the film is doors without walls. We can see them in a temple, in a place where they sleep, and on a lake. It is very important for people to go through these doors, though there no walls. In my opinion, those gates represent the entrance to a special place with spiritual calm, where people can find help at any time, where they can heal their souls. There is an illustration of two deities on the doors on a lake. Although it is not directly said in the movie, I suppose that they personify the guardians who protect the entrance both from human enemies and demons. In my opinion, it is closely related to Eliade's concept of a sacred place.To sum up, the \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and... Spring\" movie has a very deep meaning, that will be useful for every person, despite his religious views. But in my opinion, there are some very protracted scenes, and therefore it was a bit boring for me. Furthermore, I did not like the cast and their acting. In general, the idea of the film is good, but I personally did not like the way it was shot, which is significant for such a piece of art as a movie.",

It tries to show how craving for sensory pleasures will ultimately, and inevitably, bring you suffering. Everything, and everyone, comes to an end. Knowing nothing about the film beforehand certainly helped me keep a rather naive state of mind throughout, much like the boy in the movie itself, so you might not be as surprised as I was at the turn of events. However, this movie will definitely make you think about life. If you're into Buddhism, it's spot on. If not, you'll still be able to find a lot of interesting points being made. Each season shows a different part of their lives, and even a different degree of suffering. It's not as gloomy as it sounds, though. I found a lot of positive energy in it, as well as charm and humour. Don't miss this movie!",

            "review_title": "Good film from which you can learn something",
            "content": "We do not always understand how often we make mistakes and how these mistakes are repeated by other people, however, you are lucky if you have a person, who could share his wisdom and help to understand your misstep, as do monks in the film. The Korean movie \"Spring, Winter, Summer, Autumn and Spring again\", directed by Kim Ki-duk, is a simple movie, unremarkable at first sight, however, it has a deep meaning, which illustrated the life cycle of Buddhist monks. Although the film contains some animal cruelty, the scenes of self-immolation and violence, it has a positive and deep meaning, which teaches the audience to ethics, forgiveness and self-discipline.The beginning of watching the film, with the slow and silent actions of main characters without any sounds, was confusing, however closer to the end of the film you stay amazed and fascinated with a great dose of thoughts and emotions. The good impression is also evoked by the great actors, interesting plot and many good quotes, which makes you be lost in thoughts.The movie is divided into five parts, which represents different seasons of the year, although I expected that movie would be concentrated on the one year of life of the monk, however, the actions are expanded during the 30-40 years and shows three generations of monks. In the film, we see an old-monk, master, who teaches his apprentice such things as differentiating different herbs, pray, discipline and gives him several important advice. I noticed how much does the master mean for a young apprentice, since he tries to repeat all master's actions, for instance, the movement of paddles during the row, he keeps respect and put his master on the highest position. However, during the film as an apprentice became older, he behaves more rudely and shows less respect, which in my opinion represents the development of the character and his personality in the wrong way. The most interesting for me was how the master tries to transfer his wisdom and teaches his protege. In the episode, where the young-monk tortured the frog, fish and snake with the stones, the masters did not say anything, however, in that night he tied the stone to his back to show the feelings and struggles of the animals, which shows the more practical and effective way of upbringing.In the film the minimal use of dialogue, which are always simple and calm. The interaction of young monk and young and ill girl, who came to the monastery to recover, occurs almost without words, but through their eye sights. In these scenes I see the idea that the words are not needed for people to communicate or express their desires, the communication happens more spiritually. The moment, which also shows the spiritual connection between heroes, was a baby, who could not find his mother and directly crawled to the place of her death, as he seemed that she was there. Also, in the film director did not use any names for heroes, which could mean that he tried to direct the meaning to all people showing them in the personages or do not give personal characteristics and equate everyone in a film, that would represent the idea of everyone being equal.The first and the last season in a film is a spring, which I suppose represents the rebirth and the start of the life cycle since in spring nature starts to grow, flowers start to bloom and the lake melts. The lake in a film, in my opinion, is a separate character, which used as the portal from the rest of the world to a monastery. Also, the lake could be a representation of calmness and peace, the monastery itself is located in the center of the lake, which illustrates monastery as a small piece of silence and embodiment. The use of rowboat in a film is used as a transmission tool from one world to another. The distance from the gates to the monastery is an individual way of every character, where they try to find peace, satisfy their desires or made an important discussion. For instance, when the monk wanted to leave the monastery, he aggressively sat in the rowboat, or when he wanted to come back, he also had to sit in the rowboat and make a trip, which in both cases shows the important decision.In the film, the most interesting character is the old monk, who represented as human, but illustrates the inner and divine power, which closer to Gods. For instance, the scene were women tried to escape from the monastery, leaving a baby there, resulting to her stumble over the hole, where old monk died, and his teeth were left. This could be interpreted as the Buddhist doctoring, \"karma\" from the old monk, who after his death had become \"deva\". Another example is seen in the episode, where young monk left the monastery with two policemen and their rowboat did not move until old monk did not wave as a symbol of his approval. Although even old monk in a film has divine power, he is not able to control the world, other people and their actions. In the film, the young monk escapes the monastery, kills his wife, tries to commit suicide and shows aggression, and the old monk is only able to redirect him and teach. This could be an illustration of the separation of people and their beliefs since some of our actions are not influenced or controlled by our religion.In a film, many animals were used as symbols, for instance, a white cat, which in the middle of the film, started to live in a monastery, represents the pureness. At the moment, when the young monk leaves the monastery, the cat sits in the rowboat with him, as a symbol of rectification, and lately, we see the young monk returning to a monastery and starting self-discipline as a new-born man. Another symbol, which appeared constantly in the film is the snake. The snake could be interpreted as a symbol of death in a film since it crawls on the clothes of the monk after his death and appeared just before the death of a woman in cold water. However, in the article \"The Past Lives of Siddhartha Gotama\", the master was saved by the Sea-spirit, who in contrast was a symbol of a saviour.The one thing in a film, which evoked negative emotions was scenes of animals' cruelty and physical violence. At the end of the film, we see the idea of the author, who tries to show that people repeat the mistakes of other people as a life cycle, the little boy uses the stones to kill fish and frog. The similar scene occurred at the beginning of the film and after was shown the dead animals, which were tortured. The physical violence was shown when the monk tried to commit suicide and was punished by his teacher. Also, we see the process of self-immolation of an old monk, which also results in unpleasant emotions.At the end of the film, represented the main idea of the director, where he shows the monk starting to intensively train, suffering in the cold, praying and as a result the scene of his rebirth. The important symbol here is the wheel, which he bounded to his back and carried to the mountain, with a Buddha in his hand, which shows the reincarnation of the protagonist. During the whole film, the monk made many mistakes, suffered and learned many things, however at the end he found his individual and right road. Also, the director tries to show the life cycle and the ideas that people constantly repeat their mistakes, therefore in the last season, the young monk became the master with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, who repeats torture of the animals as he did.In conclusion, the film \"Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring again\" follows the Buddhist traditions, showing that all people do mistakes, and it is never too late to find your right way, which your master could help you to do. I recommend this film since it has good actors, many great quotes and you can learn something for you from the film. However, some scenes contain violence, therefore it would not be suitable for everybody.",

            "content": "I understood the woman without a face (whose head was covered in a cloth and who brought a baby-boy) as the mother of the boy whom the monk raises and becomes the boy who matures, as we see in the other seasons.  At the beginning, in the Spring, we hear the boy calling the Holy Man, `Master', not `father.'  The return to Spring, in the end and in my opinion, explained the first spring:  the monk who practiced yoga on the ice was the Holy Man in his earlier years.  The beginning of the movie, was explained in the end.The Holy Man sees the photo of his pupil in the newspaper wrapping his fish, we assume he went to get at the market.  This explains why he begins praying and chanting after eating his fish, in preparation for either the healing of his soul or his return.  Which ever is or will be the need, the Holy Man foresees it because of his spiritually-trained mind.Until the end of the movie, it did not seem credible that the boy could have changed so much as to kill his wife over feeling jealous by her having an affair.  His master had taught him to listen to his heart (earlier in the lessons of the fish, the frog, and the snake, where we see indications that the boy sincerely repented of having harmed the animals).  So, we know that he had understood and integrated those teachings of not causing harm to another.  Was it perhaps due to a former instinct (the collective, or a genetic instinct not overcome...we are shown the mother, covered in a veil, but not the father) that took over once the boy left the sacred confines of the Holy Man's sanctuary on the lake...perhaps.The conclusion that the Holy Man had drawn and passed on to the boy, that sex would lead to lust and lust to violence was not a wise or plausible teaching to me.  It contradicts a greater understanding I have that any excess can lead to strong emotions of attachment.  It is not the deed itself that must be avoided (attraction, love, food, greed, etc.), but rather, what is needed, is to watch how the expression of that attachment is employed (i.e. mastering the reaction faced with an emotional challenge, overcoming an addiction with self-discipline to reach balance).  Facing his wife having an affair (which we do not see in the movie, but see the Holy Man reading in the paper wrapping his fish), the boy had many possibilities:  he could have turned to his statue of the Buddha he'd brought with him to feel calm and feel his heart guide him wisely to his next action; he could have returned to his Master and asked for advice; he could have had a discussion with his wife and tried to understand; he could have left her without killing her. It was not the love (or lust, we don't really know in the movie which it is or maybe both) they might have felt for each other that betrayed the boy-become-man's temper, it was his choice of action when feeling the rage of his emotions faced with the wife's action.  The seasons depict the renewal of nature for sure, but they also illustrate that what isn't worked out at one time, keeps coming back to be improved upon later.  With the renewal, comes a chance to choose better choices, that lead to higher outcomes...or not, no matter what the past...each \"season\" (symbol of our human experience) affecting the next...",

            "content": "Visually it was beautiful. The movie is staged in a very scenic location on a small lake in the mountains. It never goes out of it. And I counted only eight characters throughout the movie. There is very little dialog and I am not even sure there were any names mentioned. The film shows four different seasons for different stages of life. There were also different pets for each stage and according to director different emotions. I would like to believe that I had learned something about Buddism by watching this movie. It was very interesting to see how master taught the student throughout his life and the relationship between the two.In the first stage the student is a cruel little boy that tortures animals. His master teaches him compassion. By the second stage the student turns into a nice teenage boy. But the he falls for lust. Master tells him that lust brings desire to possess and that leads to murder. Yeah, right? Student leaves the temple and takes the Buddha statue as if taking a part of the temple with him. But by that moment I already felt that he would come back to become a monk and to continue the circle just like the title implies. In the third stage student comes back. He had murdered his wife in jealousy. He is in anger and pain. Master had warned him but student had to learn the lesson the hard way. Student almost kills himself but master stops him. Now it is time teach the student finding peace. And he does. The student is peacefully taken by the police. Before, it would not be possible to take him away alive. When they take him away the master seems to hold their boat mentally, he does not want to let the boy go maybe knowing that he won't see him again. But master lets the boat go and waves his student goodbye. At that point it seems that the master has achieved the highest level of mental capabilities, being able to telepathically move objects. And then he kills himself. In the fourth stage the student comes back as a man in his middle ages. He starts living in the temple, finds there a manuscript on physical exercises and starts practicing, as if master still teaches him a lesson even after he died. Then a woman with a closed face leaves a small child in the temple. This stage ends with the student monk tying a stone to himself, like he did to the animals he tortured when he was a kid, and climbing a hill. When student monk was punished as a kid for torturing animals, master monk told him that the pain of those animals would stay in his heart for the rest of his life. Who would guess that he would be right? It was like another lesson master was teaching to his student. Maybe by doing this the student monk was finishing with his student life. Now he would need to become a master himself. The final stage of the movie is spring again. A scene very similar to the one in the first stage. A master monk and a small boy, a student monk. The student monk is played by the same actor as in the first stage. There really was no need in bringing another actor for the role. And having the same person perform the role enhances the feeling of the circle. The student monk is teasing the new pet, a turtle. He must be taught. The master monk probably knows what to do. The final lesson he learned from his own master must be how to teach.The path from student monk to master was not straightforward. He left and saw the world outside and he came back. One can only guess that his master might have a worldly experience of his own.The movie might make people think about the stages of their own life and how each stage shaped them.",

It is like a template for how to make a narrative film properly, leaving in everything that needs to be there with nothing at all extraneous (well, maybe the one freeze-frame of Kim's double-jump kick, which seemed to be there primarily to show off).I think that all films, even those with baroque structures or elaborate plots, could use this film as an example of pure cinema story-telling.This film is also about something. Not since Ray's Pather Panchali have I felt that film was being used for a truly important purpose in story-telling, equivalent to fine literature. It goes to the heart of human experience, beyond culture, social problems, and all the usual \"important\" topics treated in film.",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. The team of cinematographer, Dong-hyeon Baek, and director, Ki-duk Kim, use stunning imagery to tell their version of the circle of life. It's much better than the Lion King.The strength of the movie lies in its ability to tell a tale with imagery instead of dialog. If you're one to get antsy in a Kubrick film due to his long drawn out shots, you likely will hate this movie. However, if you have patience and appreciate a director who doesn't seem to think the movie masses suffer from ADD, you'll appreciate the time the director gives you to reflect on the beauty of the story's natural settings.The actors perform well. The characters are a bit typical of the Asian movies many of us Americans had access to growing up: the wise old man, who sees everything and has a bit of a twisted sense of justice; the goofy, horny young boy (through spring and summer, anyway) who often spazzes out and does things that make no sense (like spin in circles in a row boat when horny); and the young girl who's only purpose is as a lust object.Kim takes the characters in a more mature direction than many of the other tales, and does it with a better eye than most. The hut in which the central characters reside is located in the middle of a woody mountain lake. The lake and the surrounding woods play as important characters as the actors. The changes in the lake and the land through the seasons reflect the changes within the boy monk.If you have the patience to meditate on the wondrous imagery of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring, check it out. If you like foreign films but can't stand reading the subtitles, check it out (not a lot of dialog in this one). If you want the images in a movie to change every second, go check out the latest Vin Diesel flick.",

            "review_title": "A masterpiece",
            "content": "Frankly, I think it's a masterpiece, capturing well Buddhist concepts like rebirth and detachment that as a meditator I appreciate. The child monk, who lives in a floating temple with his master, commits bad deeds in spring, when he incapacitates animals with stones tied to their backs. He's later punished by the master who followed him with the same treatment, and told to untie the animals, \"if one of them is ever dead, you'll carry a stone in your heart for the rest of your life.\" When he finds that the snake he abused has bumped its head on a stone and died a bloody death, he can't help but shed regretful tears.In summer, he as an adult-a great metaphor here, describing as the changing of four seasons the passage of life-falls in love with a visitor, escaping for her. He eventually kills her for infidelity, and in great distress returns to the temple, disheveled and lost. He continuously plunges the uxoricidal dagger into the wooden ground, and even tries to kill himself using pieces of paper to cover his eyes and month (at least this is what I interpreted, for the master later did the same, plus setting himself on fire, to end his life)When the master finds out, he furiously spanks and ties him up, crying, \"young fool!\" Although here I couldn't really understand his actions; he seems equanimous about life, cultivated by decades of meditation, then why's he so angry, which is driven by attachment, about the young monk's suicide? If he wants to help him out of the current suffering out of compassion, then why use anger like an unmindful, unempathetic parent? But anyway, though I disagree on the approach, the monk gradually stops such self-destructive acts.The master writes calligraphy on the floor and orders the monk to carve the wealth of Han characters one by one. This seems one of the many Buddhist ways to cultivate calm and patience, like the unexplainable riddle. While he's on it, two investigators come to bring him to justice, but are persuaded by the master to wait till he finishes. Their compliance is remarkable to me; if they were ignorant or dismissive of Buddhist traditions, they very probably will throw his request to the wind. But they choose not to, and even join the master in painting the carvings while the monk is fast asleep. When the morrow comes and he wakes up, he is arrested and taken away, but the officers, moved by the equanimous atmosphere and his seeming repentance, spare him the handcuffs.After waving them goodbye, the master, as mentioned above, gets on the boat, covering his eyes and month with paper, and lights himself ablaze. He has gotten a life of spiritual experience to see through life's attachment and suffering, to see life as just is, and he accepts death with the same equanimity and peace. Buddhists have done this, as well as other peaceful resistances, to American invasion in Vietnam and Chinese oppression in Tibet. What brave and poignant people.In winter, after serving time in jail, the monk, tested by time and experience, returns again to an icy world. He finds out the boat and the master's death. He stands on the frozen lake, shirtless, doing tai chi (even I feel cold for him...). Later a woman with her head completely covered makes a visit, carrying a wailing infant; she prays in front of the Buddha and cries, and later drowns in a crack in the lake. I'm not sure if this is the monk's lover, who probably covered her scars inflicted by his weapon, but I can't think of another explanation.But anyway, the sight of her seems to awaken in him a sense of atonement. He carries a large stone, just as he did to the animals as a child, and starts a long, difficult mountain journey. When he reaches the summit, he puts a statue of Buddha there, which faces the lake and the temple, depths below. Although Buddha isn't a god-a major difference between Buddhism and other main religions-Let's hope he will oversee and protect this sanctuary.In next spring, another child monk appears, with the same pranks on animals. Life is a reincarnating circle.A top review on Douban Movies, the Chinese IMDb, calls this movie \"trying too hard to send a message, thus appearing pretentious and corny.\" I know well that people can have polarized views on the same movie, but I must say I don't understand this evaluation at all. Does what the master says when the monk wants to go with the visitor, \"lust leads to possession, and that leads to murder\" sound cliched to many? Of course you aren't necessarily going to murder simply because you want to \"have\" someone, but I believe \"murder\" is a metaphor for attachment, desire and therefore suffering, and this is a simple truth. Buddhism doesn't denounce desire as some kind of sin, it just promotes awareness and moderation; when you're aware of these things, it's hard to be controlled by them.In conclusion, this is a fine movie. Probably plainer than hardcore spiritual movies like The Holy Mountain, but plainness doesn't negate profundity.",

            "review_title": "Mystical Dharma and the Cyclicality",
            "content": "The movie \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" directed by a vanguard Korean director Kim Ki Duk is a pure illustration and the reading of the Buddhist dharma, core Buddhist teachings. The work can be torn apart into separate pieces of symbolism, yet seen as a complete cyclic work of art. Through the cyclicality of the nature and the life of one person the director could interpret basic Buddhist concept in a lens of cultural Korean Buddhism and the mystical premises which should not be taken presisely. Unlike Weerasethakul's \"Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives\" the cyclicality as an essential part of the Buddhist dharma has been shown from a slightly different perspective. The driving force for samsara has not only been the deed of one person, as we have partially observed from Uncle Boonmee, Kim Ki Duk illustrated cyclicality in all aspects of the world: from the rotation of day and night, change in seasons to the evolution of human emotions and senses to the change in generations. Even the title of the movie cyclical, as the Buddhist teachings suggest that time is not linear rather cyclical. Here the viewer comes back to the point zero at the end of the movie as well. It has been illustrated not only through the return to the spring season, which can be seen as the point of rebirth: we see the monk with the little boy both in the beginning and in the end. Other seasons can also be seen as other processes of this cycle: summer is birth, fall is life and winter is death. They can be in different levels at the same time: the development of nature, life of the old monk and life of a little boy. Even though the movie represents the small sangha, the monastic community, everything depicted by the director should not be taken literary, because it involves mystery, which is not explained by the movie. For example, even small details of the monastic life have not been shown and can raise some question: for example, the sources of food they have used to live. Another controversial moment in the movie is the one when the little boy has arrived on another shore and played with fish, frog and snake (which has been shown for the didactic reasons, as the viewer gets to see later), the old monk has also somehow arrived at that side of the shore, possibly just walking on the water. Leaving this questions without the answer, the director almost points out on the fact that even though the representation of the Buddhist livelihood seems more or less accurate, it should not be taken without a doubt. Despite this, Kim Ki Duk masterfully showed 3 Jewels on Buddhism: the Buddha, who has been depicted several times throughout the movie, Sangha, monastic community, and the Dharma, Buddhist core teachings. Even the Dukha, the suffering, which is the main driving force of Samsara, has been shown not only through different types and degrees of physical pain, but also through the moral dissatisfaction and psychological suffering: \"Didn't you know beforehand how the world of men is? Sometimes we have to let go of the things we like. What you like, others will also like,\" - as the old monk commented after the younger one's return to the temple.Even though the movie includes a lot of controversial moments, it could masterly introduce to the viewer core concepts and teaching of Buddhist community, however, the viewer should take responsibility to filter and polish the information.",

            "content": "Kim Ki-duk's film named \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" depicts Buddhist society's concept of a cycle of life, death, and reborn. The film shows a connection between the cyclical pattern of humans lives and nature's four seasons of the year. The main character is a monk who lives together with his master in a Buddhist monastery surrounded by a lake and lofty mountains. Moving along the path of life, the monk goes through different stages of development of his personality, consciousness, and soul. This movie review will examine an analogy between the spiritual and physical development of human and seasonal changes of nature.\nIn the spring, nature is waking up, spring buds are blossoming and blooming. So, a child, whose soul is pure, is getting acquainted with an environment through contact with nature. His first contact with nature was when he touched poisonous snake without any thoughts that this snake could bite him. This moment shows that the child did not know about any danger, with which he faced. However, a child has no understanding of the surrounding world, he is in need of a master, who knows about life and who can teach this child the right way to live. In the film, the child did not distinguish between herbs and poisonous plants. However, at that moment the master shed light on this difference between good and bad things. The second time the child tied small stones on amphibians while not thinking about bad consequences due to his deeds. So, only when the master tied a stone on child's back and asked to see what happened with those amphibians, only at that moment, when child witnessed the death of snake and small fish, he realized that he did bad deeds toward nature. The child realized that heavy stone on his back is nothing in comparison with a weight upon his heart.\nSummer is a wonderful time when the weather is hot, the sun is shining, sunny days and short warm nights create an incredible atmosphere of peace and happiness. For humans, this is the time of a blossom of life. The child becomes an adolescent with his own dreams, wishes, and values. Peculiar to this period of life, he is in captivity of his desires (passion), therefore, when he meets with a girl for the first time, his desires for pleasures take over him, meaning that he and she both had chosen a wrong way. In the film, this is depicted in the cadre when in the monastery the girl seats on the sacred statue of a lion, and the young monk let her seat there, even if the master would see such deed, he would have severely punished him. Furthermore, in the film, master holds a cock in his hands, when he finds a young monk with a girl lying in the boat. This moment shows that young monk's such deeds are symbolized by a cock, which is also represented in the wheel of life (Bhavacakra) as a symbol of passion, which turns the wheel of samsara. Despite of admonitions of his master, he escapes from monastery with this girl to a new environment.\nFall is the time of harvest. In the fall period, a person also reaps the fruits of his deeds. At one time, the teacher warned his pupil that \"lust leads to a desire for possession, and possession leads to murder\", but he did not listen to him and was self-indulgent to his desires. Therefore, a monk, after murdering of his wife due to his feelings, avoiding from justice, runs back to the monastery to his spiritual master in search for shelter. However, he wanted to commit suicide, but the master again guides him in the path of righteousness through purifying his karma by humility, patience and praying. So, human in the fall of his life receives the results of his deeds, which are not always positive. So, when human sees his bad result, he did not accept it, trying to avoid punishment. However, at this moment, the right way will be clearing karma and accepting inevitable punishment.\nWinter in a person's life is the awareness and analysis of past mistakes, their acceptance, and spiritual enlightenment. After serving the term, the monk returns to the monastery with a calm spirit. He already understood that his teacher passed away. The monk collected the dust of his teacher and wrapped them in a piece of red material, which he then put in place of the third eye in the Buddha's statue, which was painstakingly cut from the ice by him. Throughout his life, the teacher was a wise man for him; he saw what the monk could not see as he was blinded by earthly life, rather than a spiritual one. After this, he remembers and returns to childhood, to the beginning of his life, when a woman came with her newborn son to the monastery. Her face was covered with a material, probably meaning that she felt her guilt that she leaves her child there. At this moment, the monk realized that he was also abandoned by his mother in childhood. This cadre may mean that he returned to the beginning of his life, that all life is a cycle. The end is another beginning.\nIn conclusion, I recommend watching this film to familiarize yourself with one of the basic concepts of Buddhism, such as the cycle of life. In this film, there were many hidden Buddhist symbols, which are closely related to the life of the main character. This film makes you think and reflect on the actions committed by a person at different stages of life.",

Masterfully set amidst breathtaking landscapes, brilliantly inspired Ki-duk Kim manages to blend flawlessly the western central doctrine, expressed in Freud's theories, with the oriental belief in Karma leaving the viewer at the end with a strong taste of Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty.

            "content": "The film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and ... Spring\" of South Korean director Kim Ki Duk, which is almost silent, but with many frames with deep meaning, gave me high impression, and also left with several questions. Actually, in my opinion, it did not give right answer to particular questions, and allowed the viewers to decide themselves. All of the actions of the film were in the isolated area and temple in the center of lake. The years - entire life of two, old and young monks was shown as change of seasons. During the film, many Buddhism traditions were shown, but, at first sight, mostly it focused on human character: the whole life of a young boy, from ignorant, innocent to passionate, and redemption of his sins and retreats. Then if you pay more attention to every frame, you will notice many hidden messages, wisdoms of Buddhism. This film is more like a parable movie, which are always mean to words, acting characters and change of locations.Spring: The film starts by opening of doors to the world of monks, whose life is slow, calm, every day is like another, but there is no any fencing, so the doors are more like just a symbol of that it is a different world. The next scene showed one of the rules of monks' life - praying to statue of Buddha every morning, wooden rosary on a book, bowl with goldfish. There is nothing else inside the temple, monks do not use anything that every person do. They pray, clean the temple, sail to shore in order to collect medicinal herbs, it is their daily routines. As in usual parables, the older monk who sees the boy who ties a stone to little fish, frog and snake, do the same thing with him and command to find all of the animals and release. Here we can listen to the first wisdom: \"If one of them dies, you will carry the stone in your heart till the end of you days\". And truly, after fish and snake die, boy cries hardly, and after many years he still remembers it and again go to the top of the mountain with a big stone tied on his back. These scenes illustrate how Buddhist monks care about every living creature in the planet.\nSummer: All the same, nothing seems to have changed, but there is no a young white puppy playing with boy. As I mentioned earlier, film contains lots of symbols: that animals, painting on the temple, boat, people. Young monk notices two intertwining snakes, and you can understand what this summer would be about. He couldn't control his passion, when a young woman comes to their isolated temple to find healing to her soul. And older monk, after the woman got well said her to leave the temple, since \"Lust makes the desire to possess, and possess makes the desire to kill\". He continues writing that words to the stone by water, but burning passion of the young monk make him follow her, even though she did not call him.\nFall. \"What we like, may be liked by others too\". Already adult monk returns after killing his wife to the old, peaceful place. He closes his ears, eyes, mouth in order to not to hear, see, say bad thing and words, but he could not fence off his inner emotions, older monk beat him with a stick and tied up for some time. Also, he forced to cut the hieroglyphs of the sutra, which returns peace of mind with a knife. And the adult monk goes back to serve a sentence with gained peace. After that, there was a scene that terrified me: Old monk closed his ears, eyes, mouth, prepared wood and fired himself on a boat. I guess he felt that there was little life left and he didn't want to stay unburned if he died. Mahayana Buddhists believe in reincarnation, so he did not suffer much about dying. Moreover, I want to mention the white cat with the tail of which old monk draw the hieroglyphs. Buddhists believe that when Buddha died all animals except the cat came to mourn, so they perceived the cat as a negative animal. However, they anyway believe that cats as humans can achieve enlightenment. So, here maybe they meant that a man who did a crime, also can redeem.\nWinter. Adult monk comes back again after jail, put on his teachers' clothes, pray, tried to atone mistakes. One day a woman with a baby comes and leaves the baby in a temple. And it was an approaching to the beginning of another Spring.In conclusion, the film was really fascinating, even though there were no many dialogues, actions. Every situation was explained by the parable, wisdom of the old monk and the life was shown as a cycle that never stops, just humans change, the law of samsara, that is a central concept in Buddhism. After analyzing specific details of the film, I can say that it showed effectively the sense of the religion.",

            "content": "This film is not only a work of art that cinematographically depicted the circle of life, but also a great visual representation of Buddhists' philosophy and world perception. This work depicted significant details of the Mahayana Buddhism and gradually opened them up to the viewer, so he would feel no conflict between it and his own religion. Showing the peaceful and isolated life, without any effect from the surrounded world, helped to illustrate an ideal environment for the Buddhism practice. However, the world is not perfect, and everyone meets obstacles on their way to nirvana, it is the fight that we had to meet.\nThe film covers four seasons from the life of the monk-boy, who started his life path at the isolated floating temple with his teacher. As seasons change, the boy is changed too. Each of these seasons shows us a new test for the boy's faith.\nIt all starts with the main Buddhist's lesson. You should care about others, help them and don't harm other live beings. However, the teacher not only thoughts boy a lesson, but also introduce him to the main path to the Buddhism goal, nirvana. One of the Noble Truths says that life is full of sufferings, and the only way to get rid of them is to achieve nirvana. As it is common to that region (Korea), to believe that you make your path easier by helping others. This principle was directly shown as a metaphor with the rock, tied to his back. The boy had to carry his burden while releasing others from it, to be released from it afterwards. Director also made an interesting decision by showing us this scene one more time at the very end of the movie, when the same season came. This time the boy was fully grown up, and now he was a teacher who had to teach a lesson. This time, he made his path heavier by himself, but it brought him peace when he reached his destination. His path to the top of the mountain that finished the film was a direct visual representation of monks who have all these limitations and sufferings on their way to nirvana, having only faith in their hands. This all shows us other very important concepts of Buddhism that is the main theme of this film. Director made a great job illustrating these concepts and hidden truths.\nLife is cyclical. It doesn't matter which roles we play, the universe will come to its balance. We can say that everything surrounding us isn't existing, but it has its order, so we can switch our roles to attain it. This story had so many new elements and people, who affected the boy's life that took his of, and brought him back, but we saw the same picture at the end, as we saw at the beginning. The old monk and a boy at the isolated, floating temple. Nothing changed. Everything is still the same. This also brings the feeling of the Daoism influence on Buddhism, that was common in China and Korea, as it shows the life cycle, but also the harmony of nature and universe. Moreover, it shows a very important concept of Mahayana Buddhism. It mostly relates to Buddha, but here it is also applicable to the whole picture. \"There were before him, and always will be after.\" The life is cyclical and even is the old teacher died, the new season came and there are already a new teacher and his student in this temple.\nThe other very important thing that touched the plot of the film and acted as a turning point was a moment when he wrote the rules in front of the temple. It wasn't said what exactly did he wrote, but I can assume that those were 4 Noble Truths. The Buddha's teaching says that our mind projects the reality around us. And when the boy's mind was out of place, he left the temple and got himself in a lot of troubles. So repeating the truth's made him re-value himself and calm his mind. As it was said, \"to overcome sufferings, you should overcome cravings\". So the boy finally got in peace with his mind and makes his last return to the temple. This little element contains lots of elements of original Buddhism and an outside view from their guests.\nThis film also shows lots of small elements of the Buddhist monks that seems to be perfectly integrated into the picture, so the viewer doesn't even notice the unusual nature of some of them. For example, we can see that monks don't have an excess of clothing or belongings. The boy always leaves the temple without anything, except things that he needs for his faith duties, and he always returns without anything. This is a simple life that all monks have.\nAnother thing is celibate, that he breaks because of his immaturity. This is also a main aspect of the Buddhist monks life. It was a controversial topic in Korea and China, as it wasn't natural for their society, but is one of the main aspects of the religion, that is why it also plays one of the turning points in the film. Martial arts also a very interesting addition to the monk's routine. This element is known only in Mahayana Buddhism as they had to implement this aspect to their lives in order to protect themselves.\nTo conclude, This is a very interesting film that covers lots of details of Mahayana Buddhism in Korea and perfectly shows the world in which such people live and their perception of time and life. The beautiful scenes paired with beautiful music. It is certainly worth watching.",

The movie's hidden meaning lies in the signs, which the director shows to the audience. The signs are based on the concepts of dharma and should be interpreted through the prism of Buddhism. The main message of the movie is that life is a cycle and that each sin can be redeemed through suffering. There are 6 movie signs that will be explained in this essay through Buddhist prism: the hut, doors, dead animals, the death of the master, the mother (in the end), and seasons.The hut represents the inner soul of a human. It contains everything that a human being needs to live according to the Buddhist set of behaviors (eightfold noble path). From the moment when monks let the extraneous figure (woman) in their hut the problems have started. The young monk has fallen in love with the woman. The problems get more significant when the young monk leaves the hut to find this woman, namely the young man who committed the murder because of being too jealous.Throughout the whole movie, the doors without walls can be noticed: in the hut and at the entrance to the forest. The monks are always trying to use the doors knowing that they can just get around it. Therefore, the fact that there are no walls around the door means that using the door is not mandatory, but elected. This implies morality and self-discipline, which are defined not by the supreme power, but the man itself. To recall, Buddhism denies the existence of God-creator and promotes self-awareness.Dead animals are another sign of the absence of high power. The scene when the master seeing how the little boy was scoffing at the frog, the snake, and the fish but did nothing shows that the master wished to give his student an important lesson. The teacher let the little monk make mistakes and then suffer. This method refers to the importance of self-awareness in the Buddhist set of beliefs. The burden of killing two animals (fish and snake) was following the young monk till his maturity. The millstone and statue of Buddha can symbolize the sign of regret for killing two animals. Only after carrying them up to the hill (near heaven), he gets redemption and felt himself free. This scene represents the notion of karma: what you do to others will return upon yourself.The death of the master is one of the unclear signs. Especially, the reason for the suicide is not obvious. Perhaps, the master wanted to suffer instead of his student's crime or the teacher has felt guilt because he could not teach the young monk properly. Moreover, that action also can be interpreted as the end of suffering, in other words achieving the nirvana state, because the hero of the old monk was an example of a man, who follows the eightfold noble path. The scene of the master's death represents the high level of self-control: he made no sound sitting in the burning boat. This implies several concepts of dharma, which improve self-control: meditation, yoga, etc.The mother with child, who has appeared at the end of the movie is the personification of guilt, which is died after the movie hero gets redemption on the peak of the hill. The mother could also be that girl, with whom the young monk has fallen in love. She also could feel the responsibility for the consequences that happened to the young monk, so that she also wanted to get redemption by leaving her child for monk life, but karma decision was an accidental death.The last sign is a shift of seasons and what actions are accompanied by each of the seasons. Seasons can be considered as following: spring - childhood, summer - youth, fall - maturity, winter - oldness, and death. However, the seasonality is connected not to the body of the monk, but to its soul. Throughout the movie, it is seen how the soul of the young monk learning about discipline, love, jealousy, rage, and then the monk's soul is reborn in the end, understanding the dharma after the long journey and becoming the master to another little monk. The idea of seasons refers to reincarnation and samsara concepts, which are stating that life is cyclic.To conclude, this movie presents the main ideas and concepts of Buddhism religion. The first one is that life is full of suffering (dunkha). Second, the root of suffering is human desires (trishna). Third, the end of suffering can be achieved only through getting to the nirvana state. The fourth one is that to achieve nirvana the man should do the right deeds, an eightfold noble path.",

            "review_title": "Buddhist truths that are clear to everyone",
            "content": "\"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring\" is a movie that not only touches the soul of everyone who watches it by telling a very personal story of a young monk who learns how to live right through numerous mistakes, but also, it is a movie that can change one's perception of life. What is happening in the movie is closely related to the philosophy of Buddhism; we see how Buddhism suggests a better way of living through self-discipline. Moreover, the movie has many metaphors and signs that lead to some of the Buddhist notions and concepts such as samsara, karma and nirvana. What is also important, these conceptions seamlessly infused into the subject of the picture as they do not overload the movie. Eventually, the audience of the movie can enjoy an interesting story of life of a main character and can take a brief lesson of Buddhist philosophy of life at the same time. Even though \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring\" might not be considered as the best movie of all time which stands out for an outstanding dramatic performance of actors, it is still the movie about life which conveys a strong message to the viewers - life goes as the seasons and nothing is permanent - which is worth watching it repetitively to learn more and more every time.\nThis movie presents the story of a Buddhist monk, who is living with his older teacher in an isolated floating hut in the middle of the lake, and who experiences drastic changes in life as seasons of the year change. Kim Ki-duk, the director of the movie, does not give specific background information about characters; we do not know their names and how the older monk met a younger one. Things in the movie go smoothly. The audio accompaniment is matched perfectly to the scenes and makes the viewer watch without stopping for a second. Along with the soundtrack, the visual image and fascinating scenes of nature fit the mood of the narration and sometimes even make you get goosebumps. We observe a restful life of two monks at the beginning: they pray, go for collecting herbs on the land nearby, and a boy spends much of his time wandering around and exploring nature. Simply put, monks are almost isolated from the civilization and they just do their daily activities. But, as seasons change and the boy grows, he makes mistakes that will eventually affect his future life. One day he decides to escape from the hut to follow a girl he fell in love with as a result of failing to resist desires and ultimately commits a murder out of lust and then experiences sorrow. Ultimately, the master liberates himself from any attachments to the world by commiting a suicide and his student replaces him after a while.\nThe central argument of the movie is that our actions shape our future, i.e. every action entails some outcome, good or bad, depending on the nature of the action. What is also equally important is that the movie shows us that life is cyclical: the main character, who used to be an apprentice for his master, replaces his master and becomes a teacher to an abandoned child himself.\nComing to the main part, it is essential to discuss Buddhist notions that were established by the author in the script of the movie. First of all, four seasons replace each other by order can be viewed as four important chapters of the life of the main character and four stages of life as well. Important to note that much of the things bind around the concept of seasons. The first lesson that young boy learns from his master comes in Spring when someday he tied little animals with stones on a string and tormented them: the master did the same to the boy. \"Carry the stone in your heart for whole\" - was the first lesson, which reminds the concept of karma which states that one will eventually pay off for the thing he did, so it makes him understand the damage he did to others by experiencing it himself. It might seem that the master symbolizes the God who is watching everyone given that the movie is filled with magic, for instance, how did the master get on the land if the boy used the single boat they had. The same magic happens towards the end of the film when police workers take away the main character for a detention and the boat magically returns back.\nSo, the idea of karma is explicit in the movie, but there is anything else of cyclical nature too; it is samsara, i.e. cycle of death and rebirth. One can escape this eternal cycle if he achieves nirvana. In the movie, as the second spring comes, we see that this cycle is launched again and a new little boy is a reincarnation of the main character, but also he makes the same mistakes, i.e. torments the animals. In that vein, the main character becomes the reincarnation of his elder master. Along with the concepts of samsara and karma, there is also an implicit mention of the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism. The first one, duhkha means that life is full of sufferings, which we can see from the story of the main character who murdered his loved one because he went after cravings. Here comes the second truth which declares that cravings are the causes of sufferings (trishna). \"Love awakens the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder,\" says the master and it turned out to be true. But, in the end our hero learned the third truth - win over cravings leads to the win over sufferings. Ultimately, the fourth truth is to follow the Eightfold noble path, on which our hero steps at the end of the movie. Additionally, one little detail about the film which can imply the concept of \"non-self\" in Buddhism is that none of the characters in the film has a name.\nTo conclude, this film can be understood not only by Buddhists, but by all the people around the world. Even though there are many religions around the world, we can learn new things from any of them, and from Buddhism especially through this magnificent film. \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, and ... Spring\" film is definitely full of beautiful life lessons that could help people orient in life, but I cannot say that I can ever reach nirvana by overcoming all my cravings. However, the film gives an explicit explanation for why we experience so many sufferings and it shows that life is cyclical in nature and nothing is permanent, which is one of the main principles in Buddhism. I really liked the film and would definitely recommend it to others.",

Spring,Summer, Autumn, winter..and spring is a story of one life and many, in his simplicity, nonsense, brutality and sentimentality, categories of feelings, that move us away and sometimes closer to the animals and nature's world. There is a deep austerity and spiritualism throughout the film, so you learn from the beginning to respect the rules of the story, that is to accept to know and believe just on what you see, nothing more is strictly important. The rhythm follows the slow rituals of Buddhism, in its everyday's experiences of difficulties, prices, and of course lessons. the strong symbolism with animals involved the pleasure to discover the secret of a second plot in the story. The director Ki Duk Kim, who plays the \"winter\" protagonist, builds up an optic masterpiece that reminds me a lot on Greenaway,to watch in religious silence in the dark.but he uses also interesting narrative instruments; like Jarmush, quietness, silence of pure mute images and the art of repeating, are more than enough to explain a story of an infinite spiral. it's a movie that let you the time to think about the banal tragedy that is our life seen from outside, from a forgotten world, which is depict by a delightful photography. I get more and more impressed of such a simple movies, that can express nearly everything in two hours, just developing a clear idea, simple in its geniality, from which you can not easily separate, even when the light are finally on. a movie to reflect, which stand to cinema, like Kundera's \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" stand to literature. vote:9 Stefano",

            "content": "The lingering beauty of this great cinematic work is what makes it well worth watching.  Infused with simple, graspable symbolisms to provide interconnections between the characters, their actions, and the awsome nature(cinematography at its best, that no thousand words can do justice), the movie grabbed me by my collar, and I was involuntarily invited into the \"raison d'etre\" of my very own being.  My ego was suspended, and in the end surrendered, for I could not help but to contemplate and project my own life and its actions onto the floating temple. I could not avoid the recognition that I was that mischievious child monk, and I too caused needless pains to others, that I too succumbed to human desires. When the movie is over and we go home, I think many viewers will find themselved on that floating temple looking at their own reflections off the glistening water, surrounding mountains casting their own subjective shadows, resonating into each of our worldly lives.Amidst the backdrop of a breathtaking nature, the movie starts with the seemingly insignificant display of a child's aggressive curiosity and control over his surroundings(fish, frog, snake), and before long we see the amplified reactive effects of his actions as if the surrounding mountains funnel and focus these actions onto the floating temple where desire, emotion, conflict and resolution are played out in seasonal iterations. Like a parent looking over a child, surrounding nature bears witness to this human drama unfolding almost entirely on this floating temple.This movie is so simple yet rich in symbolism that has the effect of drawing us in, almost unconciously.  We are briefly shown various seemingly insignificant symbolic fragments that gets anchored and hooked into our psyche, and slowly they work their way into our conscious as if some Jungian archetypes are laid to bare and brought to fore.  A door by any other name is a door, but the seemingly useless door(this is not a door by any functional Home Depot definition !) that separates the old monk's sleeping area from the young monk is highly symbolic of the transition from ignorance to wisdom, - \"break on throught to the other side\".With the solidity of an all encompassing beauty that surround the unfolding human drama below, Kim Ki Duk goes to work as a painter(that he is), coloring various parts of the canvas with suggestive connections that are subtle but signicant.  In the end, we do see the cohesion of a completed canvas - the seasons, nature, consequences of our desires and emotions ripple across this canvas without much verbiage, but resonates as a whole.The great cinematagraphy and poetic meditations of Tarkovsky's Andrei Rubelov, or Bergman's Seventh Seal, or Bae Yong Kyun's \"Why did bodhi dharma go to the west\" crossed my mind as I watched this film. This movie is simpler, more distilled to its essence(true to zen tradition), and just as profoundly effective.Those who crave the sugar-coated farces(some would say a more stinky word ?) of a typical Hollywood formula fare should ask an hungry question when the last morsel of the empty calorie sinks past the tongue, \"Hey Dude, where is my nutrition ?\".  One can easily find it, in the change of seasons..",

This is what movies are supposed to be, original, unique pieces of art.

            "content": "South Korean movie by Ki Duk Kim \"Spring,summer,fall winter...spring\" illustrates Buddhist monk's changing life through the change of different seasons. To begin with, I would like to tell that this film is fascinating both in terms of its complicated and interestingly developing scenario , as well as director' deep esthetic sense and ability to show meanings and values through symbols. Starting from his early stage of life as a monk together with his master in spring, becoming an adolescent at summer and facing with the natural desire and lust to young girl, moving to the cold and dark nature of autumn, coming back to his origins, in the next spring, which represents new beginnings and reborn, he becomes a master and teaches a young child to the values and principles of Buddha. Even this kind of division of the entire film into parts and assigning young monk's stage of life to the seasons shows a fluctuating ups and downs of one' life as even the weather and seasons also have its own features that people usually associate them.In addition to that, the film delivers Buddhist value not to torture living things in a meaningful and exciting way. As an example, when the young monk ties up a small fish, a frog and a snake to stones and gets excited by watching how they struggle to walk and swim, the master does not tell anything despite watching him and what he was doing to these living creatures. Instead, he chooses more educative and more effective measure, the master ties a big stone to the back of the monk while he was sleeping. The next day young monk finds it difficult to walk and could not it untie. When he asks for his master to help him, he replies to unite those living creatures and if one of them dies, the stone would left in his heart. So, this kind of delivery of the religious belief and principles is very impressive and for the viewers who do not have any ideas about Buddhism will help to understand it, though it is hard to say that every master, guru teaches their monk in this way. So, it is on the other hand controversial in terms if showing it in more positive way.Even though the film depicts a Buddhist religious principle, I think it is more about the human nature and its change over time through the influence of surroundings. Because, not applying it to Buddhist religion, anyone in his life encounters different stages, where in some of them he/she can be \"successful\", while in others \"less successful\", do some wrong things. The important thing is to find yourself, even though you were deceived by some temporary feelings and desires and to be able t go back to your origins. In this case, we are watching the life of a monk, the one who is supposed to be away from sins and be \"pure\", but we are also witnessing his darker side, when he left his master, going after the girl and eventually killing her, because of being jealous. After, he returns to the master and the master without judging him help to get away from anger that he accumulated toward the girl he loved. From here, we can see a master who found the balance and harmony inside him. This energy is even transmitted to the cops who came after the young monk. In addition to that, it is important to note that when the young monk left his master, he takes with jim a statue of Buddha, which represents that whenever he i or whatever he does, the belief inside him and the knowledge he took over the years are with him, and this inside knowledge and belief returned him to the master and helped to find harmony and change for the better. Because, in the next spring he becomes a master, as if he is reborned in terms of his principles and lifestyle.",

            "review_title": "Review from Akezhan Khassenov 201558617",
            "content": "The Korean film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" represents a story of live of Buddhist monk and his apprentice throughout four seasons of the year. In my opinion, the main ideas of this film are the cyclical nature of live and the choice of your own path, which are deeply connected to each other. In this review, I will try to justify my opinion. \nFirst evidence to the idea of cyclicity can be noticed even in the name of the film. The name of the film represents the endless cycle of changes of seasons of the year. Summer comes after spring, fall after summer, winter after fall and again spring and so on. These seasons are shown as the main stages on which the storyline of the film. In each of these cycles, we see the episodes of the old monk and his student's lives. However, the seasons do not go immediately after another: as we see from the context, the time gap between the seasons appearing on the screen is about several years. I suppose, by this director wanted to show again the idea that the time does not matter: seasons was, are, and will go in the same order. \nThe plot of the film shows second evidence for the cyclicity. In spring, we see old monk and his apprentice on the floating monastery, in summer the student grows up into teenager, in fall he becomes an adult man and monk finishes his 'mortal path' (dies), in winter the student himself becomes a monk and adopts the abandoned boy. Finally, in new spring, the monk becomes a master for a new student - the cycle has finished and started over again. There is also one very interesting scene, which clearly shows the cyclical nature of live that director tried to show us. In the first spring, little apprentice plays in the rocky pond near the forest. There, not from the evil thoughts, but maybe from childish naivety, he torments fish, frog and snake by tying them to the rocks and laughs watching them struggle to escape. Almost the same scene we can see in the new spring, where the new apprentice, in literally the same place torments the fish, frog and snake by forcing them to eat the stones. I think that these scenes perfectly show the overall cyclical essence of life that the author tried to convey to us. \nThe second main idea that I think that film tried to show is the idea of choosing your own path. As it was mentioned before, in the scene of first spring, apprentice tormented helpless animals, however his mentor does not interfere and silently watches from behind. Then, to teach his student, monk ties a rock to the back of his student while he is sleeping. When the student awakes teacher tells him that he will untie the rock after the student unties the animals he tormented, to learn about harm to other creatures. He also says, that if any of those animals died, the student will \"carry the stone in his heart forever\" meaning the sin he committed. Student unties animals and finds out that snake and fish had died, student understands his fault and cries, which suggests that he had never committed such act again. Then, in summer student falls in love with a girl who was brought to the temple to be cured from illness. Failing to fight his lust with intensive praying, student chooses to follow his beloved and leaves the temple. Master understands everything, but doesn't stop his student, just warns him that lust can lead to murder. In fall, the master's warning becomes true, and student comes back to continue study. Master doesn't criticize him and doesn't allow his student to commit suicide. Instead, he tasks him to carve the sutra to restore inner peace, which also restores peace in detectives that came to arrest his student. After the departure of detectives with the student, master commits ritual suicide. In winter student comes from prison back to the temple, decides to carve an ice statue of Buddha with the remains of his teacher, and makes a choice to continue the studding through exercises. Then a woman comes to the temple, leaving her child to be the monk's new apprentice. New monk, possibly understanding that the cycle is repeating, decides to put a statue of Buddha on the top of the near mountain on the rock wheel, which represents his sins and possibly the Samsara wheel. We don't know, was the story of old monk the same the new monk's, did the new monk made his decisions with his own will or it was a destiny. However, I suppose he put this statue as a symbol, because the Buddha was the One who escaped this cycle, for his apprentice not to repeat his master's mistakes and to make decisions that will bring him on his own path, rather than repeating the cycle again. \nTo conclude, this film showed two main ideas, first - idea of cyclical nature of live shown by stages of seasons of the year and repeating stories of old and new monks. Second - that there is a possible way out of this endless cycle, shown by the special decision of the new monk to put a statue of Buddha to symbolize that the way out of the cycle exists.",

            "content": "\"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter ... and Spring\" is a South Korean movie about a Buddhist monk's life, which takes place in the monastery that was located in the middle of a forest. As its title says, the film is divided into five seasons of the year and five moments of monk's life. At the same time these five seasons of the monk's life could be associated with evolution of his life and transformation of his character. Below, I will discuss more about how each season is connected with his transformation of character as a young monk and about the distinctive features of the film.Each time period of a monk's life has its own explanation in each season of the year. The life of a little boy who later becomes a monk starts from the \"Spring\" season. In this period of the year, he is shown as a thriving little boy who is an apprentice of an adult monk. Even in this period, he is shown as a sinful person who is harming nature. However, he gets a lesson from his master about the relationship he should have towards the environment and about respecting the living force of nature. In the next season, \"Summer\" he discovers love and human affection. He falls in love with a girl who came to the monastery for a temporary period of time. He also discovers the danger of love at this period of his life.\nNevertheless, in the following season \"Fall\" we see that he did not get lesson from the sinful actions he has done previously and continues doing them. In \"Fall\" he needs to take responsibility for all his evil acts. This period of his life is depicted as the culmination of his life. He returns to the monastery that he left for the pursuit of affection in \"Summer,\" however, he will leave the monastery to get the lesson for his committed crime and sinful actions to the jail. Then in \"Winter\" he returns to the monastery but as a different person inside. As winter is the coldest period of the year, thus his transformation will coincide with the transformation of nature. He has to overcome all the obstacles and challenges of body and mind. This season is the time when he truly becomes a monk since, as its sign, there will appear a woman with his baby who then intended to leave his child to the monk. In the \"... and Spring\" period, we see that the baby left to the monk has grown up and is living his audacious life as his master monk did many years ago.These five seasons, besides explaining the life evolution of monk, also implies about another point- life is a cycle. The fact that the new master is living in the monastery and now he has his apprentice. In a broader sense, it can also imply that everyone on this Earth will continue to experience the challenges. Only after some time when one is ready and honed enough to escape the samsara will voluntarily become the monk. A young-monk when he was living in the monastery and could smoothly without leaving the monastery became the monk. However, he had to escape the monastery and after experiencing many life situations and doing wrong and good karma( it is not shown in the film about his life outside of the monastery, but most probably he has gone through many karmas). After all, to escape the samsara he returned to the monastery and became the monk to attain the nirvana. This was the period when he was ready to become the monk and accept the monastic life.Moreover, if we observe, it was clearly shown from the lifespan of the monk how he has gone through from all four noble truths. Also, all the four fundamental ideas of Buddhism are demonstrated even without putting on emphasis. It is the way how director tactfully presents the ideology of Buddhism. The other distinctive features of the film that need to be discussed are the visual approach, delivery of the movie where more emphasis is put on imagery. Moreover, the location of the shooting and performance of the actors contribute to the harmonious articulation of the film. The animals that were always accompanying the monk throughout his life are another distinctive feature of the film. There is no doubt that these animals have special meanings and facilitate the explanation of each season of the monk. Further investigation could be done to explore the meaning of each depicted animal in the film, according to Buddhism and Eastern countries Culture.\nFrom my point of view, this film skillfully illustrates the Buddhist philosophy and life cycle of human beings according to the Buddhist religion. Keeping in mind the delivery of the film, which was not much dialogue and narrative, instead, focus on nature and the environment again reveal the Buddhist philosophy aesthetically and distinctively not as just religion but as the lifestyle.",

The main story of the film was divided into 5 parts, each assigned with the season, as seen from the film's title. The very first Spring corresponds to innocent childhood, summer depicted as young adulthood, the feeling of love, and its subsequent conversion to lust and anger. Continuing in the same manner, fall corresponds to adulthood errors, where the former disciple murdered his wife on the emotional bases and subsequent perception of those errors as they are. Finally, winter was a time of awareness, which depicted in the film by a returning student to his previous master's hermitage. What I found peculiar and intriguing about \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" was the absence of conversational dialogue between the main characters or any kind of explanation from the filmmakers during the film, despite, the story itself attract and acknowledge viewer into the meaning and cultural traditions performed in the film. Based on the symbolics, prayer, and activities they performed, it is obviously seen that they are followers of the Mahayana Buddhism branch, where people used to pray upon Buddha. Coming up to the main point, there were lots of cultural and metaphorical elements used, such as a boat that automatically returns to master, swiftly changing animals with the change fo season, and the weirdest one was gluing stickers to face when the master burned himself on the boat. However, among all of these signs, the notions mostly related to course material were the depiction of karma and samsara.\nKarma is the belief that any action in the present inevitably provokes an echo-like response in the future. Either negative or positive, depending on the nature of the deed itself. In this particular case, karma was represented in the film by the childhood action of the boy, when he bound a fish to the stone via rope, then repeated the same action with the frog and snake. Despite the obvious suffering of these animals, observed scenes made the boy laugh. At this very moment, his Master observed a young student from behind. To teach him a lesson master bound his young disciple to the heavy stone that night and ordered him to find and free those animals if he wants to take off the stone from his back. Along with this, the following phrase was said by his master: \"If one of them has died, you will always carry that stone in your heart\". However, when the child found fish and snake, they were already dead. Carrying this in mind, the last scenes from the film should be discussed to have a whole picture. In the season of Winter, man (previously disciple) carried the statue of meditating Buddha to the peak of a nearby mountain by bounding himself to huge and heavy stone. At this moment, previously scenes of suffering animals were inserted by filmmakers, which in my opinion was a representation of karma. So the action he made in childhood returned to him as his own anchor, both physically and metaphorically.\nNext, samsara is the Buddhist or even Hinduism term to describe the endless and beginningless chain of lives, where each and every person must rebirth after his death until attaining the state of nirvana. This is the main goal of Buddhist practitioners, to attain nirvana to escape the endless life chain, and dissolve oneself within the universe level. The samsara was depicted in the final part of the film, where the newly arrived disciple of a monk, repeated almost exactly the same animal bullying actions with fish, frog, and snake. Also at the moment when the monk burned himself and ceased to exist, the small snake appeared beneath the boat. This can be interpreted by Buddha's (Siddhartha Gautama) approach toward the nature of the soul as a flow of the river. And when the monk has died, his appearance simply changed or acquired another form. In other words, errors of the past are made to make correct conclusions in the future, in the same manner, life someone lives in the past, define the status and flow of the next rebirth.\nSumming up all points, the film \"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring\" is a mixture of both well-written scenario and Asian minimalistic art style, because of the lack of excessive speech, complex actions, or transition of location. Despite the fact that all details were kept simple, this did not negatively reflect on the film quality. The film combined a physical representation of a monk and his disciple's life path, along with a metaphorical depiction of ideas. From the numerous symbolics and traditions, the idea of karma and samsara was discussed in this review, which in my opinion gives a solid explanation, why Buddhist monks adhere to this kind of lifestyle and the essence of Buddhism as a religion.",
