            "review_title": "Rest in peace",
            "content": "The main reason why I watched this movie that is often described as one of the worst of all times is what appears to be Daniel Kublbock's tragic suicide that occured less than two weeks ago. The actor, businessman and musician jumped off a cruise ship into icy water and his body hasn't been recovered yet. Daniel Kublbock has always been a tragic character evoking both disgust and sympathy and who obviously had his share of mental struggles. His parents had wanted a daughter and separated in his early childhood. His mother was apparently an alcoholic who used to hit him sometimes while his relationship with his father was ambivalent. Daniel Kublbock auditioned for the first edition of a reality talent show when he was just seventeen years old. He wore androgynous clothes, appeared to be overtly emotional and had very dramatic, loud and unskilled vocals. Daniel Kublbock was looking for fame to find his own identity but refused to accept that he didn't have much talent and failed to understand that he was used by producers to have a clown in their show that people could make fun of. Againt all odds, many female teenagers pitied him or even saw themselves in this sympathetically confused being and made his songs and records more popular than anyone would have predicted. Daniel the Wizard was released at the height of his career. Instead of helping him find his fame and identity, the media attention had its share of negative impacts on him. Daniel Kublbock openly identified as bisexual, then admitted being homosexual and ended up claiming he was transgender shortly before his death. His physical appearance also shifted drastically as he looked quite androgynous as a teenager, then gave himself the look of a serious male businessman before adapting a feminine look with dresses and heavy makeup. His music also changed from anglophone pop rock music over Latin pop to a mixture of blues and jazz. Daniel Kublbock's fate is tragic because he never found his true identity and his erratic behaviour gave him a few moments of glory but also a few moments of resentment. Blaming those who bullied him because of his at times annoying behaviour is only partially accurate as his family, managers and friends should have helped him deal with his mental issues first instead of supporting him being watched by millions on television when he was still legally a child.Ironically, much of this torn character can also be found in this movie that mixes fantasy elements and documentary aspects. Daniel Kublbock is seen going completely crazy on stage at one moment and sitting thoughtfully in an isolated room in the next scene. The film portrays a young female teenager who admires the unique and different singer while male teenagers despise him for his erratic behaviour. This film actually shows us who Daniel Kublbock really was and how he was really perceived by society. These two elements alone make the movie bearable and justify a slightly generous rating.The rest of this film is a catastrophe. The plot is beyond ridiculous. The acting performances are stiff. The camera work is shaky. The sound is unsteady. The movie mostly consists of concert footage weirdly intertwined with poorly scripted fantasy elements. While other bad movies such as The Room show a certain degree of passion for filmmaking or are at least entertaining like Samurai Cop, Daniel the Wizard is neither passionate nor entertaining. Despite its short length of only eighty-one minutes, it feels incredibly stretched and could have been cut in half. The movie righteously sold very poorly but is today considered a cult flick because of its flaws. Honestly, those flaws are so amateurish that they aren't even worth discussing. Daniel the Wizard is only interesting to watch if you are intrigued by the lead actor's tragic fate. If you come here expecting hilarious entertainment, you have to looke elsewhere.Calling this film one of the worst ever made would be exaggerated. Describing Daniel the Wizard as unsuccessful low budget mash-up of random documentary elements and weird fantasy parts is more accurate. This movie is a sympathetic wreck. Such seemed to be the life of its lead character as well. May Daniel Kublbock rest in peace.",

This foolish idea ended up being just a waste of my precious time.THe plot reads as follows: A boy who became famous through a TV show has problems with people who don't like his music. The main character is played by daniel kueblboeck, the new star from Germans pop idol (so Kueblboeck actually plays himself). After all I'm proud i made it through the movie. To be honest i only watched it till the end to write about it. The movie itself is so bad it almost hurts physically. So this is a warning : DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!! DO NOT GIVE IT A CHANCE!( unless you are either a masochist or a k\u00fcblb\u00f6ck fan). Don't say i didn't want you. This movie should receive a 0 Voting instead of an awful.",

            "content": "It's unfortunate that the only place this can be tracked down is Germany's Amazon. As much as they may be sick of it, this is a bad movie buff's wet dream. It's unintentionally funny from start to finish, even if you can't understand a word of the dialog. The mistaken \"consummate entertainer\" at the heart of this mess, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck, is a sexless clown who spends the entire film in old lady sweaters while he writes the most banal, oppressively bland pop songs imaginable. Some goth weirdos show up to stalk Daniel outside his home and backstage at his concerts, muttering their intentions while Daniel croons away like a dying cat. They're lead by a shady nogoodnik who bares a distracting resemblance to Peter Stormare. Their acting, especially that of the long haired, brooding guy in black leather had me laughing out loud. An actual \"wizard\" of sorts shows up at one point as well, but what his significance is, and whether he's simply a product of Daniel's diseased mind, is totally incomprehensible to me.There are far more unbearable films to pick up for Bad Movie Night. This is Germany's \"Ben & Arthur\". Track it down on their Amazon, it's the equivalent of about five American dollars and well worth it.",

I mean, we have the German pop idol, Daniel Kubelock (or something like that), a Michael Jackson wannabe, and we have a bunch of assassins trying to kill him!

            "content": "Let me tell you a little story: having once worked in a video store, my boss had ordered 15 copies of \u0084Daniel der Zauberer\" \u2013 two for rentals, 13 to be put into sale. He assured me that this was a wise choice since, at the time, the name Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck was in mouth and ears of many pre-teens and teenagers. K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck made second place in Germany's \"Superstar\"-version (\"DSDS\") and was groomed to become Germany's version of Michael Jackson; music and persona being as artificial as the tip of Jackos nose. Surely a few handsome bucks would come from the rentals.Need I still mention it? Neither rental copy ever left the store. Not once. After having reduced the price to 50 cents, my boss tried to give the DVDs away for free, causing two copies to leave the store. One customer who took a copy assured me that this was meant as Christmas present for 'that guy dating his ex-girlfriend'; the other copy was taken by a drunk who wandered the adult section and who didn't own a DVD-player.Whatever happened to the remaining 13 copies, you ask? Unless my boss has used them as make-shift beverage coasters, they remain the only films in that shop to carry the label \"Free\".Is \"Daniel der Zauberer\" the fabled 'worst movie ever'? Well, sure \"Daniel der Zauberer\" makes \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" look like a Cecil B DeMille picture \u2013 but it's by far not the worst film ever. Oh, by no means. Just check out any other Ulli Lommels production, for example \"The Zodiac Killer\", \"Black Daliah\", \"BTK Killer\" or \"Green River Killer\". They're all god-awful; all bad enough to turn your best friend into your worst enemy.You might wonder why I bother to write a review about such manure: well, it's fun to make fun of movies that are worst than anything you've every recorded with your cell phone.And now you asked me how many points I give and to pass judgement over this film \u2013 to paraphrase the \"Black Adder\": good sirs and madams, I wouldn't pass water over \"Daniel der Zauberer\".",

A 5.5 stars rated film of any genre should do. 6.5 stars might even make your evening if compared with this movie. When I heard of Daniel Der Zauberer being in the bottom Top 100 I decided that it is my duty as an anti-Daniel-fan to watch this movie. By the way, I've seen 'Plan 9 from out of Space' too but for a different reason. This movie was the most horrible experience in my whole life. I almost bit my hand off while listening to the totally senseless dialogue's and the lethal singing of this halfbreed. He can't be from this planet! The worst scene is Dannyboy sitting there reading his own fan-mail to his entire family and giving comment on every letter written by young girls and old ladies...how can you dare? Then after this first torture he goes jogging and sings the whole time.I'm very sorry that he managed not to be shot in the neck by his kidnappers. That would be a reason to watch this movie again. I agree with my German friends that this movie is the biggest waste of time and resources.

Some might argue about the (non existing) abilities of Daniel K\u00fcbelbock as an actor. However you could imagine a story with Daniel K\u00fcbelbock playing himself in a self ironic way and some kind of trash factor supporting the rest of the story. Now Daniel K\u00fcbelblock is actually playing himself and the whole story is trash (if you would look at it from that point of view, actually more points could be given), however the film -I actually searched on several pages on the Internet to confirm this, cause I didn't believe it after I first watched the movie- wants to give its viewers a serious message and is determined to be considered as art. I would call this movie \"Entartete Kunst\" if the Nazis hadn't already used this term for their evil purposes. Still doing it in spite of this is quite tempting.Most of the other actors are better than K\u00fcbelbock, still they are far below average to say it in a friendly way. Quite amusing are the sociolects (in particular indicating uneducated and unemployed people) and jargons (representing a high consume of the German mass media culture) several actors are using. There are several slips of the tongue as well in some quite simple sentences. It really adds a lot to the already great trash feeling this movie provides.",

So of course we also came across this item. We were really looking forward to this because we assumed a lot of funny passages but even with our expectations set as low as they could get while watching this movie it got down under... This 80 minutes movie is pure terror. You cannot even have a laugh about it and you first realize how terrible this movie really is after you have finished it. It is leaves you with the feeling after watching a deep blue drama just without the empathy and tears. Well, I really warn you about watching this piece of junk. The camera is the worst kind of recording I ever came across, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck sings the worst songs I have ever heard (and it is not hard to guess, that he wrote the songs himself)- low light \"Teenage tears\" - and the script is so lacking of any talent that you really hate everybody who has something to do with this movie.I may say that I give everybody a chance, but after this movie Daniel deserves the hatred he gets. He is causing it himself. None of the characters is a tiny bit sympathetic and every minute passing by seems like forever. And nobody has any talent to act. It is also the longest movie I have ever seen.Another thing is that this movie is called Daniel - Der Zauberer (German for magician). Well, there is just now and then a reference to a magician but he never is one. Would it be an intelligent movie, i would guess Daniel would be an imaginary magician and his music is sort of the magic, but due to the fact that this movie is not a slightly bit of intelligent it just cannot be.This movie is a slap into the face of the movie industry. How could anybody allow this to happen in the first place?! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I would categorize it as horror or psycho terror.

The main character in the movie is the androgynous popstar and runner up of German Idol, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck, played by himself. The movie showcases several of his performances which I assume to be real. So far it's more of documentary than anything else, then the fictional part breaks in with a wizard running around with a tuba in his hand, and a trio who hate Daniel and plan to kill him. Since these parts are shot in home-video style they might as well be part of a mocumentary about some idiots trying to kill a popstar. Confusion of genre apart, Daniel himself is fiercely annoying with his shrill voice and flamboyant mannerisms. Wikipedia tells us he was voted most annoying person in TV in 2004, and this movie really shows that side of him. A documentary, or whatever this mess is supposed to be, with focus on an incredible annoying pop star is not a niece experience. When the would be killers had Daniel at gun point around the middle mark of the running time, I was so glad we get rid of this awful guy, but they wussied out and as a result of which, I had to suffer through another 40 minutes of him and his grating voice.Since i saw the film in German, without subtitles, I will give it the benefit of the doubt, and award it one point.",

The plot makes no sense, a fault so expertly delivered that no dialogue is needed to convey this to the audience. The acting is bad in any language, and then there's the real kicker: the editing and camera-work. It feels like something someone filmed for YouTube (back before professional YouTubers with high production values came along), the only hint that this isn't the case is the main character performing in concert venues. The sound quality, the picture quality and the slightly shaky picture betray that this was likely filmed on a home-video camera. The editing is virtually non-existent, with a general feeling most of the video clips were hastily stuck together in Windows Movie Maker. Overall, a must-see for lovers of bad film.

            "content": "I am so, so sorry.I am not sorry for this movie. I am sorry for myself. Vain? Certainly. But vanity, I'm afraid, is a virtue in this instance.Daniel Der Zauberer (or Daniel the Wizard) is a movie about German...entertainer (...?)...Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck. It is apparently supposed to be an art movie about how his singing inspires thousands, but instead of just a bunch of dancing and singing (like the ego trip known as Moonwalker), it seems to have a plot. My German is negligible in this case, so I didn't understand *any* of the dialogue, but according to the handy Internet, a Goth band tries to kill him because his music is better than their's, or something like that.There is a character who I guess is supposed to be \"the Wizard\" of the title, Johannes K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck. Based on the fact that they share the same last name, I assume he and Daniel are father and son, but we never really learn whose side the Wizard is on; I was perplexed. Sometimes he helps the Goths, then he apparently is playing Santa or something for young Daniel (?). And there's something about a girl and her father, who are No. 1 fans trying to help him, although I honestly don't know what happened. The girl looks a little young for him, is it his sister? The ambiguity, perhaps, is the balancing factor of this movie. In many instances, ambiguity can set up a nice atmosphere, provide a bit of mystery...but this isn't a horror or mystery movie. It's an art movie, and an art movie where I really don't have a clue what's going on. My main problem was that it was hideously boring and the acting was terrible.Oh, and of course, I was especially creeped out by Daniel's...choice of dress. He's not gay, I'm sure, it's just...Ah, well. Terrible. And my favorite movie is Manos: The Hands of Fate.",

            "content": "The star of this movie, Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck, took part in the first ever season of the German version of American Idol. He managed to gain some popularity due to his androgynous look and quirky personality. He later took part in the German version of \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" and by now has faded into relative obscurity, but not before leaving us this tremendous achievement of bad movie making.The rough plot of this movie goes like this: Daniel is at the height of his popularity, giving large concerts and receiving dozens of fan letters every day. However, many others hate him and his music. His worst hater is a ridiculously edgy guy called Balthasar, who is planning an assassination together with a teenage couple (Tom and Rike). Meanwhile, Daniel is visited by a mysterious one-armed magician figure (played by the director, Ulli Lommel), who tells him that in order to become a magician himself, there are several tests he will have to pass...Now, where do we start? The beginning of the movie (and several later scenes) show Daniel performing live, but his horrible singing, dancing and his ridiculous outfits quickly become hard to stomach. Speaking of ridiculous outfits, I should mention that the evil killer Balthasar wears a red leather trench coat and has upside-down crosses branded on the back of his head[!]. Judging from the bad image quality, lighting and constant shaking, the movie seems to have been largely filmed on a hand-held camcorder. Adding to the \"charm\" of the movie are some of the exciting locations: K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck's living room, the forest and meadow next to his house, a concert hall and the small apartment of the murderous conspirators. The production values are roughly comparable to the home movie project of a sixth grader. The true \"highlight\" of the movie however are the bizarre dialogues and the general ludicrous and nonsensical way the plot goes forward. It's hard to describe and really has to be seen to be believed.Overall, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can't say that I haven't been somewhat entertained. If you want to take the dive and watch one of the titans of trash, I think you wouldn't regret it.",

            "content": "Detractors of German pop oddity Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck who wanted this movie to fail could not have been indulged more than having Ulli Lommel write and direct the feature. K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck's polarizing persona melded with Lommel's highly questionable style of filmmaking to make for a movie that I'm surprised ever saw the inside of any theater and is practically custom-made for criticism. If someone greatly dislikes the movie, there's really no arguing with 'em...but as a lover of low-budget filmmaking, I found enough things that I liked to inspire a decent rating.The film's biggest liability is not actually its cast or direction, but its screenplay. Lommel's screenplays frequently read like something written by a man on LSD, and this one is no exception. The movie would probably be a lot more coherent if only the story could stay focused on the actual plot. Instead, it entertains no less than five different narratives: (1) the planned assassination of Daniel by a knife-carrying weirdo (Rudolf Brem) and his cohorts, (2) a rivalry between said weirdo and Daniel's ghostly protector (Lommel), (3) Daniel's quest to perform in Hollywood, (4) Daniel's status as a magician-in-training, and (5) the conflict between a teen fan (Marina Lommel) and her grandfather (Peter Schamoni) over Daniel's music. Any movie running under 90 minutes would have trouble exploring all of these subplots, but DANIEL DER ZAUBERER strains itself even further by also focusing on footage from Daniel's live performances, impromptu music videos, and go-nowhere scenes like when the would-be assassins stalk K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck outside of his home.The level of awkwardness is high. Some of it has to do with the acting - performed by mostly first-time performers - but more of it has to do with the blocking, editing, and the script. Dialogue shots are frequently shoved together in a manner that in no way replicates normal conversation, and scenes are occasionally interspersed with completely unrelated footage. Director Lommel must hate establishing shots, because the viewer is often just dropped right in the middle of a scene without buildup. New characters appear from out of nowhere and strike up intimate conversations with established characters. All of it's very odd.While the film depicts Daniel's vehement critics as old fogies and pathetic weirdoes who scribble death threats, his fans don't look all that great either - not the young devotee who's willing to alienate her grandfather's customers for his music and certainly not the odd girl who cavalierly tells him about how he appeared to her father in angel form (even Daniel seems weirded out by that). The movie is not very effective in drumming up support for the guy, but given its lack of production values and inherently flawed nature, I wonder how much better a more restrained version would have even been.There are some redeeming features. While this film kicked off what many consider the absolute worst portion of Ulli Lommel's career, DANIEL DER ZAUBERER has a level of energy that most of his future films lack. Few scenes drag, and unlike subsequent Lommel fare like DUNGEON GIRL, this one actually feels like it's building towards a planned conclusion and not something the crew came up with on the fly. The actors' performances can be contrived, but they're all pretty sincere and played with more confidence than you'd find in a typical no-budget movie. Fans of the main star will probably be disappointed that Daniel is no way cut out to be a dramatic actor, but they'll appreciate the presence of several exclusive songs that have yet to be released in other formats. There's even the occasional feel-good scene, like when Daniel and his on screen grandmother (Katja Rupe) discuss his deceased grandfather.This one's hard to recommend to most people, but if you tend to like films that the rest of the world seems to dislike, this one may be or you!",

            "content": "This movie has a great premise, a boy and a girl, encouraged by a crazy old guy, want to kill the actor Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck. They fantasize how to kill him and even go to his house to end his life, but restrain form it. They change their plan and decide to kill him during a concert and as a nice side effect become famous. But that is the only good part of the movie. The assassins of course get converted by the \"power\" of Daniel's music and become fans of him. If you watch this movie, be aware that there are several songs sang by Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck which can permanently damage your eardrums. This film could have been so great if there was a gory death scene of Daniel K\u00fcblb\u00f6ck. I watched this movie mainly, because I hoped to see a \"good\" b-movie, but I was disappointed. Some b-movies have a cult factor, but that doesn't apply to Daniel - Der Zauberer. You can see way better movies on y**tube. With better I mean: better acting, lighting, directing, story, make-up... I recommend to watch this flick heavily drunk or as a test of courage. But by all means DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!! DO NOT RENT IT!!! If a friend of yours watches it, then watch it with him, but don't make the mistake to spend just one cent on this crap movie! If you want to waste money then burn it, throw it out the window or flush it down the toilet, at least you will have more fun than you will have by watching Daniel - Der Zauberer. If you still want to watch this epic failure, watch the trailer first, it doesn't get any better than that.I give this 0 out of 10 stars, but since that's not possible 1 not deserved point.",
