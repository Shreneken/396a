            "content": "I being a child of the 80's have a soft spot for this movie. Yes it is predictable,but what makes it a great movie is the performances by the 2 main characters. Ralph Macchio is great as a teenager that is bullied at his new school. But the movie belongs to Pat Morita as Mr. Myagi. He plays an old apartment maintenance man that befriends Macchio. He becomes his karate teacher, but they develop a great friendship that makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The great thing is that the movie shows that the old man comes to need the kid as much as the kid needs him, it is a touching relationship. All the rest is standard Rocky film stuff, but what Rocky and this film have in common is that the characters are people we care for, so all the climactic scene stuff works.",

            "review_title": "\"The Old One\"",
            "content": "My love of \"The Karate Kid\" is limited to the fact that this movie, if it had been in the hands of a more fluorescent director, could have turned out a lot differently from the movie we all know and love from 1984.Directed by John G. Avildsen (who also did 1976's \"Rocky\" - another underdog story) and written by Robert Mark Kamen (who would later co-author 2001's \"Kiss of the Dragon\" with Luc Besson, which starred Jet Li - another example of martial arts in American cinema done right), \"The Karate Kid\" is by far the best (and frankly, most realistic) incorporation of martial arts into a mainstream American film.This movie came out the year before I was born, and only through word-of-mouth over the time I was growing up, did I know that \"The Karate Kid\" even existed. I got to view the film my freshman year in high school as part of a class, but the instructor watered down the experience so much that the movie lost its potency.Now a few years later, I finally watch the movie without any intrusion from the outside world and I find a truly marvelous picture that's far better than its many stylized contemporaries, i.e. \"The Matrix\" trilogy, which is the best example of that trend.Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, a new kid to a picturesque southern California community that looks a lot like something you'd see in a magazine advertisement. Daniel makes the mistake of hitting on Ali (Elisabeth Shue), who unknown to him, is the ex-girlfriend of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), and Daniel takes a pretty brutal beating from the martial arts-trained Johnny, that leaves him scarred but with his pride and dignity still in tact.The number of violent clashes with Johnny and his brutal Cobra Kai martial arts friends continue, until Daniel is saved by Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the karate-trained handyman of his apartment building. Daniel insists on Mr. Miyagi teaching him karate, so that he can compete in an upcoming martial arts tournament; this requires Daniel to undergo some pretty unconventional training - \"wax on, wax off; paint fence - side to side\" etc. And in return, Daniel learns that there's a lot more to karate than just fighting and the \"Old One\" shows him that way.\"The Karate Kid\" is a true gem of a film that's shamefully underrated. I'm glad that on February 1st of this year, this movie is finally getting the DVD treatment it deserves.Macchio is convincing as Daniel, bringing a number of wide-ranging emotions to his role that at first may seem quite perfunctory as opposed to being dramatic. The real star of the show (at least in the minds of a number of critics, and the Academy), is Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He brings grace (almost rivaling Bruce Lee) to a role that could have been quite stereotypical, but is still very moving and dramatic.Of course, what's a movie about karate without the fights? I should note that the action in this movie is very convincing, but is not stylized in any fashion, shape or form. It is very down-to-earth and realistic, and that may of course be a bit of a turn-off to some hardcore fanboys that may watch this movie thinking it'll be something like \"The Matrix\" (1999) or \"Enter the Dragon\" (1973).The fighting here is in its own style and mode of action. A number of the fights are quite brutal, especially in the ones where John Kreese's (Martin Kove) Cobra Kai students are featured, as he frequently trains them the brutal way of \"no mercy,\" which Mr. Miyagi is quick to realize is not the way of karate.\"The Karate Kid\" gets a perfect 10/10.",

            "content": "Is there anything more that can be truly said of this inspiring movie? Possibly it is the most unlikely hit movie that has generated a strong faithful following.I rewatched it after 30 years on the back of falling for the Cobra Kai series, and loved it every bit as much as when I first saw it. I'm much older but find so many new things to relate to and remind myself of in life.The premise of the film is simple, but it is almost impossible to explain the impact this movie had on a certain young generation on its release. It was its run in the video market that made it the huge success it became, and so much of it has become part of pop culture be it in its quotable lines and simple action.What made it stand out was that it clearly was the antithesis of all other martial arts movies of the time which were in a boom period on video rental, but they were all muscle bound and flying around at 100mph. The Karate Kid instead centres on peace, life philosophy, defence and self-betterment.The crux is the central partnership between the central pair of Mr Miyagi and Daniel, which begins as teacher mentoring pupil but develops into a father & surrogate son relationship.There are so many layers to this film, and the truth is that the karate is really secondary to all. Any action is short, simple and down to earth. The real fights are for the soul, against bullies and personal defeat. For Mr Miyagi it is a reawakening for him, for Daniel it is a journey of self discovery.The greatest part is the acting. You simply can't take away from either of the two leads, the chemistry between them is just perfect. Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi almost effortlessly but perfectly as the mentor to a young insecure Daniel, which becomes a father and surrogate son relationship. If anything the relationship helps bring Mr Miyagi out of his shell. For example, we see inside the soul of Mr Miyagi, and some of his inner torment (i.e. loss of wife & child), and Daniel becomes closer to him for it.Mr Miyagi is the mentor & father all men wish they had. He practices & teaches peace & self-respect with humour & dignity. Something we can all learn from. His dry wit and personal reserve are humbling to see. Winning the tournament against the bullies is secondary, but the personal development is what comes first.The Oscar nomination for Pat Morita for the role was deserved, and unfortunate not to win it, but his role has left a lasting legacy and is in the hearts of so many. I can only say to him thank you, and also to all who helped put this wonderful touching film together.",

            "review_title": "History and time give this movie a different feel",
            "content": "Done by the same director as Rocky, this unusual \"feel good\" movie became a hit in 1984 and generated two sequels before the mania died and the franchise imploded.I remember the phenomenon from the 80s yet as a \"prolific reviewer\" for the IMDb now (which, for buffs, is not the same thing as a \"Voracious Eater\" from the Claymore series) I now see the film differently.I see a very competently done film that is literally lifted off the ground and carried to the finish line by the extraordinary one-of-a-kind performance from a (then) 50 year old Pat Morita, an actor who essentially spent his entire career doing \"asian walkons\" and offers us only this one role as a chance to see what he actually could do. Given half a chance.Macchio and Shue were competent (the former had some momentum from Happy Days/Laverne and Shirley and the latter was beginning a short career as a type of \"brat pack\" teenage star) but it was Morita who owned the film and kept your interest.Unfortunately the historical record even on the IMDb does not reflect any of this. Shue actually won an award for a completely forgettable part and Morita not only did not win anything for this film but the only nominations he received were in the \"supporting role\" category. This is clear \"color blindness\" on the part of Hollywood. He has almost as much screen time as Macchio (I counted) but because his career was merely bit parts before (and after) this was the prevailing mindset. The film would have failed without him.As a footnote, I was not able to identify precisely why he was cast in the role, but historically Okinawa has indeed been associated with its own unique brand of martial arts and, in the martial arts world, short stocky older men have long been acknowledged as champions even though in the films of our present era someone of Morita's age or body-type would never even be considered for such a part.The two sequels were much weaker but the demand for them was great and, when there is money on the table, Hollywood will always oblige.",

            "content": "The Karate Kid (1984)After seeing the teaser trailer for the forthcoming Cobra Kai TV show I got all nostalgic.\nSo I decided to watch this movie again expecting it not to live up to the fond memories I had growing up in the 80's.\nUnlike me this movie has gotten better with age.\nIt can now be regarded as a classic. Much more than a guilty pleasure. The Karate Kid is a fine movie that is very well made.For anyone who hasn't seen it the film tells the story of Daniel LaRusso played fantastically by Ralph Macchio.\nA young boy who moves with his mother to LA to start a new life.\nUnfortunately for Daniel San he soon falls foul of the local bullies.\nWhat's even more unfortunate is that the bullies happen to be Karate experts and they proceed to practice their moves on the new kid in town.\nDaniel then meets Handyman Mr Miyagi played to perfection by Pat Morita. Miyagi helps Daniel overcome the bullies by teaching him the true art of Karate.\nWhat develops is a very exciting and heartwarming story.Directed by John G Avildsen this movie is as much a story about an adolescent teenager searching for a father figure as it is a film about Karate.\nThink of it not as a Karate movie more of a movie that happens to have Karate in it.\nThe chop socky action plays second fiddle here just as the boxing did in Rocky. A movie also directed by John G Avildsen.\nIn fact the actual martial arts action equates to about twenty percent of the movies actual run time.\nAt 2 hrs 6mins this film is not overly long because it is driven by strong character development.\nEveryone involved puts in a stellar performance.\nMorita and Macchio in particular are superb. Watching their friendship blossom as they work to achieve their goal is deeply moving.\nThis is because in a way they both need each other.\nDaniel is a boy without a father and Miyagi is a father who lost his child.\nBecause of this moving subplot the payoff at the end is all the more enjoyable as they achieve victory together.\nJohn G Avildsen surely knows how to rouse the spirit.The beautiful Elizabeth Shue plays Ali, Daniels love interest and apart from Mr Miyagi the only friend he's got.\nWilliam Zabka stars as Johnny Lawrence the lead bully who actually is a flawed character.\nA good kid at heart who like his buddies have been brainwashed by nasty Karate instructor Kreece played with relish by Martin Kove.\nHis performance here merits him a nomination for best villain of the 80's.\nAs Myagi points out \"There's no such thing as bad student, only bad teacher!\"\nThis movie is packed full of moments and dialogue that are now embedded into pop culture.\nEven if you've never seen this film the phrase \"Wax on, wax off!\" will still be familiar to you.\nIf not then you must have been living on the moon for the last thirty years or so.This movie is elevated by Bill Conti's fantastic score.\nChoosing him was the right choice just as it was choosing John G Avildsen to Direct .\nConti's work on Rocky shows here as yet again he creates a score that will raise the spirit and get the audience punching the air when Daniel San administers that final blow.\nThe movies soundtrack is also a peach, packed full of 80's classics that help stir up the nostalgia.The fight choreography is very well done. The combatants perform as they would in real life.\nThere's no Bruce Lee levels of intricacy here. The fight scenes are grounded and apart from the cheesy crane kick at the end they are mostly believable.\nBut as I strongly stated before The Karate Kid is much more than just a movie about fighting in the physical sense.\nIt's a touching, heartwarming story about a boy fighting the struggles of adolescence. A boy just trying to fit in. A boy searching for guidance from a father figure he doesn't have.\nThe Karate Kid unlike the silly sequels that followed can now definitely be regarded as a true movie classic",

            "content": "While John Hughs' films may be the standard for teen flicks in the 1980s, Hughs' films were just a few of the great and unique teen films to be released in that decade. Coupled with Back to the Future, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, the 80s was a rather unique time for teen movies. The Karate Kid just happened to be another one of those films. With the immortal Pat Morita leading the way, this film was not only touching, but put a whole new spin on the `zero-to-hero' story line which we have all seen too often. Ralph Macchio may have had no career after these film, but at least he proved to be comparable as Daniel (san). Sure, the ending and outcome proved to be a little predictable, but the film was still a winner.",

            "content": "Johnny Lawrence had it all. Cheerleader girlfriend, a group of popular friends, a sweet dirt bike, and a leadership role at an afterschool program with the local martial arts studio. More importantly, he was the defending All Valley Karate Tournament champion.Things begin to spiral when new arrival Daniel, possibly with ties to the New Jersey mafia, starts to befoul Johnny's paradise. When Johnny makes the mistake of spending one night out with the guys, Daniel tries to stalk Johnny's lady, Ali, all across the beach with his corny soccer ball gimmicks and knowing looks over his wiener-roasting spit stake.Thus Mr. Lawrence's spiral begins. Though Johnny successfully defends himself from Daniel's cheap shot thuggery in an oceanside confrontation, Daniel will not be deterred from his obsession with the defending champ. Whether staking out Johnny's home dojo, trying to force-feed horse-history lessons on the school quad, or trying to bribe Ali with cafeteria munchables, Daniel continues his psych-war campaign which sadly has its desired effect.In one of the worst examples of harshing someone's mellow ever captured on film, Daniel ruins both Johnny's halloween costume and sweet green persuasion in an unprovoked aquatic attack in that most sacred of shrines, the public restroom. Finally at the end of his rope, Johnny harnesses his cardio training and precision striking to attempt to put an end to Daniel's abuse once and for all. However, it was not to be. Johnny sinks further into his personal abyss after being assaulted by a deranged handyman.Emboldened by his Okinawan ally, Daniel once again tries to interfere with Johnny and Ali's relationship. Just as the star-crossed lovers reunited with a passionate kiss at the local country club, Daniel managed to ruin the moment by intentionally spilling a huge platter of spaghetti, destroying a waiter's only tuxedo in the process.Somehow our imperfect hero Johnny manages to persevere through Daniel's demented parlor games, making his way once again to the finals of the All Valley tournament. Sadly capitalizing on a questionable disqualification, Daniel somehow makes his way to the finals as well against the incumbent title-holder. Milking a pseudo-injury for additional rest time, Daniel fake-limps to the mat for the final showdown. While we will never know if there was a deleted scene involving bribes to the shoddy referee, the calls made in the final best-of-five battle remove any doubt that Daniel either paid or blackmailed the official just enough to cheat his way into a 2-2 tie before stealing Johnny's trophy with an illegal kick.The film culminates in Johnny's Christlike forgiveness of Daniel's transgressions as Mr. Lawrence hands over the ill-gotten trophy to Daniel, a symbolic crucifixion with the crown of thorns represented by Johnny's ever-present headband.If you read this far you can probably tell I love this movie. 10/10.",

Daniel meets a neighbor in his building and tells him that he fights karate; the neighbor invites him to go to a party on the beach. Daniel meets the gorgeous and wealthy Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue) that lives in Encino and they immediately feel attracted by each other. However, the bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) comes with his gang of bad boys and argues with Ali, who was his former girlfriend. Daniel defends her and is beaten up and humiliated by Johnny in front of his new friends. Then Daniel is frequently bullied by Johnny and his four inseparable friends at school. One night, Daniel is saved by the handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who was born in Okinawa, from Johnny and his friends and he asks the old man to teach him karate. Mr. Miyagi heals Daniel and goes to academy where Johnny and his friends learn karate and he asks their violent instructor John Kreese (Martin Kove) to order his students to give a break in the beatings; in return, he accepts that Daniel participates in an all-valley tournament two months later. Now Mr. Miyagi begins his non-orthodox training of Daniel, especially movements and balance waxing cars and painting fences. \"The Karate Kid\" is a cult-movie of many generations. I do not recall how many times I have seen this film, in the movie theater, on VHS and now on DVD, and I still love it. In the 80's, Ralph Macchio was a sensation with \"The Outsiders\", \"The Karate kid\" and \"Crossroads\" and his chemistry with Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita in \"The Karate Kid\" is something very special. This coming of age story discloses a beautiful friendship of Daniel and Muyagi; the discovery of the first love, with the romance of Daniel and Ali; and the message relative to the importance to find balance in life.

There are also a few scenes in which ethnic slurs are used by rednecks toward Miyagi.Taking this into light, and taking the fact that Daniel has no father that we know of in this movie, the name Daniel-san (sounds like Daniel-SON) helps demonstrate a father son bond that is overlooked. Much of the conversation between Daniel and Miyagi is about Miyagi's great father in Okinawa, because Miyagi has acquired all this knowledge and wants to share it. Daniel substitutes for the son Miyagi never had and Miyagi substitutes for the father Daniel doesn't have.",

            "review_title": "The 'old one' taught him the secret to karate lies in the mind and heart. Not in the fist!",
            "content": "Having a man teach you a valuable art such as that of Karate, is invaluable especially if you are young, inexperienced and in a battle with people who you have no hope against. However viewers of the 'Karate Kid' get to learn a valuable lesson for life out of this story, that fighting is a waste of time, and with time and patience anything can be achieved. In addition viewers get to hear the cute pronunciation of `Daniel-san' by the great teacher!Fatherless teenager Daniel is a new arrival in Los Angeles when he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing group of Karate students. Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi, whom is a martial arts master, to teach him how to fight. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is mastery over the self - mind and body - and that violence is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel learns the physical skills while gaining faith and the self-confidence to compete against the odds as he faces the fight of his life in the exciting finale.I remember watching this film along time ago, but boy was it a thrill. Sure it didn't have 'big stars' or big action in it. One thing it did have was 'heart'. The character of Daniel was one person that typifies this. At no stage does this teenage loner from New Jersey ever give up, when at times that might have been the best thing for him to do. I feel that this story and character for that matter, is how we need to approach our own lives, because if you keep putting in the hard yards and stand-up for what you believe in, things will soon turn around.The stars of this movie are not bad. Firstly main star Ralph Macchio was excellent as Daniel. I felt he brought the struggling teenage character to the screen perfectly. He is a very na\u00efve and inexperienced young man, yet with time and patience he makes what was a terrible situation seem nothing big at all. I enjoyed Macchio in other movies including 'The three wishes of Billy Greer', a movie which again suited this tough actor, about a young man who is dying from premature aging, in addition to movies such as 'The last POW? The Bobby Garwood Story'. I cannot praise Macchio any higher.Other stars are just as worthy. Pat Morita was wonderful as the wise and what I feel was the humorous `Miyagi'. His role was just as good as his counterpart Macchio, yet it was also very different. Miyagi is one person that does not like the spotlight, yet when his young friend is placed in a very precarious position in his new home town, he steps in and shows what a great Karate man he really is. Then you have the other side of this story, which of course has to have a girl in it, with Daniel striking up a relationship with the popular Ali Mills. Actress Elizabeth Shue, who has also had a somewhat 'celebrated' career, played Ali. She has starred in films such as the controversial 'Leaving Los Vegas', 'Back to the future II' and 'III' and the 1988 hit 'Cocktail'. Though there are times that you expect Daniel to never make it with Ali, in the end he does have a faithful person outside of Miyagi.The bad guys are not bad in this film either, with that part of the cast including Martin Kove as the arrogant Karate Teacher John Kreese, who will stop at nothing to see the end of the fairytale of LaRusso and Miyagi. His main student and the person who wants Daniel's blood the most is Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka, and although he has not go on to big and better roles, his bad guy role was enjoyable in the Karate Kid. I did read in one review on IMDb where a person claimed that the bad guys were not given enough of their own treatment. However I disagree, considering the bullying and beatings that Daniel receives, I feel that Daniel and Miyagi teach the 'Cobras' a lesson. Sure we don't get to see Kreese get what he deserves, but if you have not seen the second Karate Kid, then you will get to see what awaits this cruel and relentless individual.The Karate lessons and fighting sequences in this film are incredible. I guess like Daniel, most of the fans of this film would assume that Daniel is not learning anything, yet being Miyagi's personal slave. However we get to see how intelligent this old Okinawa man is, through all of his work for Daniel he teaches him some very basic and vital Karate moves. I love the attitude that this movie brings to everyone, that fighting is the last option for any situation, whether it is verbal or physical. I think this is so true, as fighting gets people nowhere. It just makes life bad for both parties, again this movie shows this to be so true.In conclusion, the Karate Kid is a truly great film, but perhaps I am showing what era that I grew up in? I cannot say that I totally agree with Karate, as it is a very Chinese practice, but if it is based around what Miyagi teaches, that is for self-defence, and then it might be ok. I am sure many moviegoers will never forget the finale to this movie, because I am sure I never will. The sequels which follow slowly start to lose there appeal with this story, but not to matter, if you are looking for a story which shows you that giving up is not really an option, then see what is so special about this story of a courageous Karate student and his clever teacher!CMRS gives 'The Karate Kid': 5 (Brilliant Film)",

Mr. Morita was humbled by the following incidents in his life: interned during WWI, suffered from a weak spine, short in stature and a stereotypical Japanese, nicknamed \"Hip Nip\" and casted for mainly comically roles in American TV and cinema. As if through divine intervention, the role of Mr. Miyagi was created, a natural and defining role for Pat Morita. Like the main character Daniel-san, who earned dignity and respect through karate, so too did Pat Morita earn dignity and respect as an actor for his role as Mr. Miyagi. The Miyagi character is a humble, soft-spoken, respected, Asian sensei (teacher.) He is humble not because he is weak and avoids being some bully's victim, but because he knows he holds the fate of all who bullies him in his hands. So it was that Pat Morita finally achieved through the character of Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid series what Daniel-san always gains at the end of each movie: dignity, respect, and honor to compensate for all the times of abuse, suffering, and humiliation.",

To make matters worse, Johnny is the ex-boyfriend of Ali (Elisabeth Shue), a girl Daniel is pursuing.Enter Miyagi (Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita), an aging handy-man who works at Daniel's apartment building.  Struggling for friends and failing to fit in, Daniel finds support in Miyagi.  After enduring several beatings at the hands of Johnny and his gang, Daniel comes to learn that Miyagi, in fact, knows karate.  Following a vain attempt to speak with Johnny's karate teacher (Martin Kove) about being left alone, Daniel is suddenly entered into the All-Valley Karate Tournament, where he will attempt to win the respect that Johnny and his gang have taken.As he trains for the karate tournament with Miyagi, Daniel learns invaluable lessons about life and love.  And brought to the foreground of this karate story is Daniel's pursuit of Ali, who truly is the single person who gave the new kid a chance.On many levels, \"The Karate Kid\" is an uplifting movie.  It illustrates how a lonely, out-of-place kid triumphs against the odds, and the movie doesn't need computer-animation or special effects to get its story across.  But, for me and anyone who loves '80s movies, the \"The Karate Kid\" has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to \"better times.\"  For that reason alone, this movie is a classic.I've enjoyed few movies, if any, more than \"The Karate Kid.\"  I highly recommend this flick to anyone who loves a touching, uplifting story, or to anyone who simply can't get out of the '80s!!!",

But Daniel (Macchio) finds a potential girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue) and a 'golden connection' with a Japanese American who's willing to teach him the art of karate (Pat Morita). Everything leads to Daniel facing off with Johnny at a tournament. Martin Kove is on hand as the sensei dripping with villainy.\"The Karate Kid\" (1984) is a product of its time, the early/mid 80s, and is unrepentant about it. A long sequence featuring Bananarama's \"Cruel Summer\" tells all. Speaking of which, that's a great school scene.There's something about this flick that always moves me; it has heart. It's about the love of a teenager and his mother; the love of a boy and a girl; and the fatherly love of a harassed new kid on the block and a wise old Asian man. It's also about facing hefty challenges and learning to overcome them. There's a reverent quality and the proceedings ring true, except maybe for the campiness of the uber-machismo sensei, although that's entertaining.Winsome Shue shines on the female front wherein the movie scores well with several peripheral notables and even Daniel's warmly spirited mother (Randee Heller).The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: A/A-",

            "content": "Hoping, once again, for another massive box office hit, like his 1976's film 'Rocky' did, director, John G. Avildsen & his crew, mimics a lot of the tropes and themes of that fighter movie for his new film, 'the Karate Kid'. The risk was successful, as this underdog sport movie, about a young man, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) standing up for himself, against his high school bullies, by joining a karate tournament was a smash hit with most critics and audiences. However, it's not a perfect film, as there is plenty of stuff that, worth nitpicking, that could had made the movie, a little better. One of them, was honestly, making the various lengthy, menial chores like waxing cars, sanding decks and painting fences that Daniel had to do in the film, seem to have more meaning to it than it portray in the film. After all, they come across as too out there & unorthodox to be relate to karate. Also, it seems to me, that Daniel already knew, many of the defense moves that Mister Miyagi (Pat Morita) taught, beforehand, in his YCMA training days; as the fight choreography, between Daniel in the beginning and the climax, are not that different. Heck, if you think about it. The unorthodox training really didn't improve, his fight game. He was still, getting beat up. It seem like Miyagi didn't do much. Even the crane technique that Miyagi said, if done right, that nobody can block, could easily be defeated with a good shove to the chest. Another thing, I'm doubtful that any decent karate judge would have allow that move to be used in the first place; seeing how it's an excessive blow to head. Nevertheless, I know it's just a movie. I just wish, the movie was more open on exposing more on, Mr. Miyagi's past, here, rather than, him, lying, ignoring the question or changing the subject. The reasons, why, is, it come across as not very mentor/student-like. This is where, I thought, 2010's remake of the same name, did a little better. At least, in that movie, the sensei is a little more open to talking about his past, and why he lives, a shut-in life as a maintenance man. Here, it's come across, as very jarring for the audience, to see an old maintenance man, shroud in mystery beat up, kids, without getting arrested, & heal people with little explanation. How in the hell, did he get to Place A to Place B!? Something is missing, here. I hate that, a 1986's sequel had to be made, just to answer, those questions, when, they should had been part of the original movie. At least, thank goodness, that drunken mourning scene was in the film, rather than being cut, because it's the only thing, keeping Mr. Miyagi was being a shallow old wise man stereotype. With that say, I still never understood, why Mr. Miyagi's chose to help Daniel. Maybe the idea is that Daniel, is the closest thing to a son he ever had, but even then, it's a little vague. Nevertheless, I really don't think, joining a fight tournament will stop bullying. If anything, all that competition would probably, would cause more harm than good. If anything, Daniel should had left them, alone. After all, it seem like Cobra Kai & Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) forgot about him, until Daniel provoke them in the Halloween Dance. They are just misguide teenagers, not exactly hardened psychopath criminals. If anything, Daniel is much to blame for his beatings. Regardless of that, I still think, the acting from Macchio was good. He's boyish good looks and high-pitched voice, really did, make Daniel into a likeable hero. As for Pat Morita; as much crap, I talk about his character, I still love his portrayal. He still deserve the Academy Award nomination. He made the character, fun to watch, even if his character, was not that complex. As for chemistry of two, share on screen, it certainly look like friendship. You can feel the special bond between them, with the 'wax on, wax off' screen, being one of the highlight. As for the supporting cast. I found Zabka to be alright as a villain, as he is suffering from conflicting ideologies about life, however, I really didn't like Martin Kove's performance. He was a little too over the top, as sensei, John Kreese. It really took me, out of the movie. Yes, I know, certain fans, love his goofy cartoony performance, but for me, I thought, it was unbearable hokey. As for Elisabeth Shue as Ali Mills, Daniel's love-interest. I found her to be, alright. She's loving, but her character wasn't that developed. She came across, as a manic pixie dream girl, with her romance parts with Daniel being filler. Honestly, if take that romantic clich\u00e9s away, it would, probably make 'Karate Kid' into a stronger movie. Trust me, when I say this, the movie was already, having pacing issues; with the climax seeming a bit rushed. After all, it seem a bit jarring to see Johnny, being alright in handing the trophy to Daniel, after being kick in the face. Cutting scenes like that, would indeed make the film, better. Despite the movie's visuals & cheesy music like 'You're the Best! Around\" by Joe Esposito being highly dated. The movie holds up, remarkably well, since the 1980s. People are still quoting and watching this classic. So, go ahead, Wax on! Wax off! After you're finish with that, go watch the Karate Kid, again. It's worth watching.",

The storyline is brilliantly told from the character development, circumstances, inner demons, training through ultimate triumph, everything was brilliant. I loved the mother/son bond and every interaction seems authentic. This also has a subtle coming of age feel to it. The acting is outstanding and every scene and sequence was perfect.

I had originally watched the movie in the late 80's and early 90s a number times along with the sequels remembering them fondly, so whilst i wasn't watching it fresh 25 years had passed since my last viewing.The movie tells the story of a young Daniel who moves states with his mother for work purposes who shortly thereafter gets into a few tussles with the 'cool kids' at school following which the maintenance man at his apartment signs him up for a karate tournament to get the kids off his back. The rest as they say is history.I have to say i was astounded with how well this movie has stood the test of time. Whilst it is clearly set in the early 80's it does not feel dated at all, something a lot of movies from the mid 80s to the mid 90s suffer from.Ralph Macchio is exceptional as Daniel LaRusso. He absolutely nails every single scene with emotion and personality as well as youthful confidence. I cant imagine that there were many better performances back in 1984. The supporting cast of Elizabeth Shue and Pat Morita cannot be under estimated, they are perfect and Mr Mijagi is one of the most iconic characters in movie history.If you are debating whether to watch or rewatch Karate Kid, do it, it is a charming feel good movie with an uplifting 80's soundtrack that is well acted and hits all the right spots.

            "content": "Like many movies made in the 80s, I feel like people will say there's something wrong with you if you haven't seen this at least once. Aside from an infamously difficult Nintendo game based on this movie, there was nothing really ruining my perception of it, so I decided to take a look. What I ended up getting was a film that is not only memorable, but also one that acknowledges past historical events in order to lend more character to its cast. The movie begins with Daniel (Ralph Macchio), a New Jersey native, moving to LA. Upon arriving, they find their apartment is looked after and maintained by an elderly but wise Japanese immigrant, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). Later on by the seashore, Daniel meets a girl named Ali played by Elisabeth Shue (who was also Marty's girlfriend in Back to the Future), but bad luck intervenes. Ali appears to take a liking to Daniel, but her ex boyfriend Johnny (William Zabka) and his biker dirtbike gang show up. An argument ensues between him and Ali, which Daniel makes the mistake of getting involved in to stand up for her. In doing so, he makes himself a target for Johnny and his friends. Daniel tries to defend Ali physically, which results in him getting humiliated by Johnny in a fight, as the latter happens to be a karate expert. Daniel later gets revenge on Johnny by soaking him with water at a halloween party, but it backfires as he is then beaten mercilessly by Johnny's friends. Luckily, the fight takes place right next to Daniel's apartment complex, allowing Miyagi to climb the fence and subdue all Daniel's opponents effortlessly. Daniel is no doubt impressed by Miyagi's fighting prowess, and wants training from him so he can defend himself. Miyagi has other ideas. He agrees to accompany Daniel to the place where Johnny got his fighting skills. They enter and find Johnny in the midst of his karate class, which is taught by Mr. Kreese (Martin Kove), a vietnam veteran who tells his students to be ruthless when fighting and how you shouldn't feel pity for your adversaries. Kreese notices Johnny is nervous about something, and looks by the entrance to see Miyagi and Daniel standing there. Miyagi tells Kreese he wants to enter Daniel in a karate tournament where he will be competing against Kreese's pupils, and insists that the physical abuse towards him stops. Kreese agrees, but it's clear he has no respect for this humble old man. After this, Daniel starts to undergo training taught by Miyagi, which is strangely unrelated to karate at first. He instructs him to wash cars and to paint fences, which leads to Daniel asking why he's being put through such nonsense. As it turns out, all this is training his muscles to remember certain fighting techniques. Daniel also learns about Miyagi's sad past, as he used to live in an internment camp, fought in world war 2, and lost his wife 40 years ago. Eventually, the tournament day arrives and Johnny still hasn't mentally matured at all. He's still making fun of Daniel, as long as it is unseen by the referees. At the actual event, Daniel is soon face to face with Johnny himself, who is the current champion. Kreese tells one of Johnny's friends to attack Daniel's knee in order to cripple his ability to fight, which is against the rules. Still, he does so and gets kicked out in the process. With Daniel in horrible pain, it looks like Johnny is about to win by default, but Miyagi uses some healing technique on Daniel to heal his leg. He decides to keep fighting. Daniel initially has the upper hand, but Johnny manages to become tied with him after Kreese tells Johnny to go after Daniel's leg again. With both contestants 2-2, one wrong move can cost either of them the championship. Finally, after reading his opponent's moves, Daniel beats Johnny by jumpkicking him when his guard is down. Daniel is the new champion, and Johnny reluctantly gives him the award trophy himself. I rarely give movies made past the 60s the honor of being called classic, but I think this movie has definitely earned it. It's a story of self improvement and how you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. It also shows how karate can also help you spiritually as well as physically. Miyagi says how there's no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher. Johnny could have used his expertise at fighting in order to protect himself, but his teacher is too aggressive and only views karate as a means to dominate people. I really liked how the movie tries to weave actual history into its plot, such as when Daniel discovers a Medal of Honor that was given to Miyagi during his time in the military. Miyagi was in the 442nd regimental combat team, which was a real life infantry corps comprised almost entirely of japanese americans. They also had an extremely good service record. The movie has the same triumphant feel to it that Rocky does, in that both of them have protagonists who are trying very hard to better themselves, and are willing to suffer in order to achieve this. It can't be a coincidence that Bill Conti also did the music for this. As for the characters, I would say that Miyagi is arguably more important to the story than Daniel, as he is more talented than all his bullies put together, but still has a very reserved attitude. He knows he is extremely proficient, but doesn't feel the need to brag. He's just that cool. Kreese is a legitimately scary antagonist, since he has a backstory which makes him believable. The first movie doesn't go that deep into it, but him being a vietnam vet is all you need to know. It makes sense he would have this really violent demeanor, when you consider what veterans of that war had to come home to. One thing I didn't really care for is how Daniel's bullies seem to be absolutely everywhere all at once. It seems like everywhere he goes, whether he's taking a walk in the school hall with Ali, playing games at the arcade, or even in the backlands of his nightmares, Johnny is there waiting for him. Aside from this, I can say with certainty that Karate Kid is not just a satisfying and well made film, but also something that will give you valuable lessons on living.",

            "content": "I'm not exactly a fan of fighting or martial arts movies. It's usually a type of movie I avoid because I find it boring and tiring. However, I was surrendered to this film, which is surely one of the most famous of the 80s, a film that even today, thirty years later, feels good to review. Perhaps because of this, it is a film that still retains its place on the grid of cinema TV channels.The script is simple, but quite appealing and full of well-crafted characters worthy of our sympathy. The protagonist is Daniel, a young teenager who has just moved to California and is trying to adapt to a new environment. However, he quickly wins the enmity of an older, wealthier and more violent boy, due to their common interest in the same girl. Forced to learn karate to defend himself, he befriends the janitor of his building, an elderly Japanese man who will teach him everything he needs to know about the martial art.Ralph Macchio is nice and pleasant in his character, and he does a pleasant job that will earn him fame. In fact, it will become the only major role in the actor's career, who even today plays the same character in video games and series. Elizabeth Shue, for her part, made more intelligent use of the relative success she achieved in her role in this film. Although she doesn't shine, she does what she needs to do well, and that opened the door to a series of other jobs. But it's definitely Pat Morita who steals our attention whenever he's on stage. He is impeccable in the role of the intelligent and sensible Japanese. Through character, the film gives us a vision of peaceful karate, focused on defense and the need to be prepared to never really have to fight. The actor, by the way, was nominated for an Oscar for his performance. The film also features notable appearances by William Zabka and Martin Kove.With good, elegant cinematography, crisp colors, and good shooting work, it's a film that doesn't feel as dated as other films from this decade. I particularly liked the sets of the Japanese house, with its gardens and magnificent carpentry details, and the classic cars in some scenes. The fight and action scenes look pretty choreographed, but they're still genuine enough not to look bad. The soundtrack, signed by Bill Conti, is truly memorable and a little gem that is generally overlooked, forgotten and overtaken by other more well-known and consecrated scores.",

You have Daniel La Russo pulled out of the comfort of his New Jersey life into a totally different world of Southern California. In a different world Daniel tries to fit in. Invited to a beach party Daniel meets a new group of people. He starts a conversation with Ali a girl from the hills. While playing with a soccer ball Ali and Daniel are spied by a group a motorcyclists known as the Cobra Kai named after the karate dojo where they train. Johnny Lawrence their leader and the dojo's top student approaches Ali. Knowing what could happen she \"accidently\" kicks the ball away. Johnny can't take the fact she has dumped him. He wants to talk but she feels the case is closed. When Johnny throws her radio down Daniel gallantly goes to retrieve it. Ignoring his order to leave the radio alone Johnny again throws the radio away. Taking the challenge Daniel confronts Johnny who easily embarrassed him. When Daniel gets in a shot Johnny reacting to the \"No Mercy\" creed of the dojo he then easily dispatches his outmatched opponent. Laying in the sand hurt and humiliated Daniel's new \"friends\" abandon him. Ali wants to stay and help but at the urging of her friends she leaves.In school while at soccer tryouts Daniel is cheap shot and when he retaliates he's kicked out. Frustrated while joining his mother for dinner he spies a dojo where he wants to checque out. Arriving at the school he hears the sensei barking the schools motto. Impressed he sits down to observe. When sensei Kreese asks the senior student to lead the drills when the students bow to the sensei Daniel sees hs tormentor and leaves. On his way home Daniel is accosted and forced off the road. His bike damaged and a black Daniel vents his anger.When he goes out he sees his bike repaired. Going to the handyman Mr Miyagi to thank him. A friendship starts to build. Convincing to attend the school dance Daniel seizes upon the chance for revenge by spraying Johnny which leads to a one-sided confrontation. Facing a serious injury by the Cobra Kai's Mr Miyagi intervenes dispatching the assailants. With Mr Miyagi's philosophy of \"Karate is for defense only.\" he decides to have Daniel take him to the Cobra Kai dojo to see if there could be a peaceful resolution. When that proves to be no resolution Miyagi works out a deal to allow a reprieve while Daniel trains for the All-Valley Karate tournament where Johnny Lawrence is the reigning champion. When the event comes Daniel is dong surprisingly well. Finally, when it gets to the semi-finals Sensei Kreese orders his student Bobby last year's runner up to injure Danel. You know the rest.My issues are 1.) There is no such thing as a \"unstoppable\" technique the Crane technique a.k.a Koken Ich or Crane position one is just that a technique. 2.) Two of Daniel's points should not been allowed. The first point was done by a leg lock which in tournament karate is illegal. The last point from the \"Crane\" technique was contact to the face definitely illegal. 3.) Johnny Lawrence wasn't the bully made out to be. In two instances Daniel was the instigator although in the second one Johnny took his sensei's words too literally.As the late Gene Siskel said this seemed to follow the David Carradine's Kung Fu style.",

            "content": "So much about this movie is perfect. unbelievably quotable, it's in my top 10 of the decade (and the 1980's was an excellent decade movie wise) Plot In A Paragraph: Daniel Laruso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother move from New Jersey to California. She has a wonderful new job, but whilst Daniel quickly meets a girl he likes called Ali(Elizabeth Shue) Daniel also runs into trouble with some karate students led by Ali's ex boyfriend Johnny (William Zabka) The handyman in his building Mr Miyagi, saves him from a beating and discovers the real motivator behind the boys' violent attitude is their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach Daniel karate and arranges for Daniel to fight at the all-valley tournament several months away.Ralp Macchio, who I'd liked in the brilliant \"The Outsiders\" the year before, is perfectly cast as the title character, as is William Zabka as Johnny (According to the commentary on the DVD, Zabka came up with a backstory for his character, to \"get the feel\" for him. He says he envisioned Johnny as having no father, and that Kreese is the closest thing to a father figure). Elizabeth Shue looks gorgeous and I developed a real crush on her from seeing her in this movie, and Martin Kove is splendid as the vicious, take no prisoners (and racist) karate instructor. But the stand out performer in this movie (and that is saying something given how superb Macchio, Zabka, and Kove are) is the Oscar nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita. The fact he was nominated for the Oscar says it all. As much as I love this movie, and I do. It's not the type to be nominated for Oscars.The studio wanted to drop the \"drunk Miyagi\" scene, feeling it slowed the pace of the movie down. Director John G. Avildsen argued for it to stay in and it was felt it was the scene that got Pat Morita nominated for an Oscar.Bill Conti's soundtrack is another valuable asset to this movie. No surprise Conti was Avildsen's go to go after his work on \"Rocky\" that netted Avildsen an Oscar. there are also several songs here too from Bananarama, The Flirts and Jan & Dean and Survivor all which fit perfectly. none more so that \"You're the Best\" by Joe Esposito.Esposito says \"You're the Best\" was originally written for \"Rocky III\". The song had been rejected in favour of Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\".It's a shame this movie was so popular and iconic, that audiences forever associated Macchio, Zabka, Morita and co with their characters here. No matter the quality of the movie or the performance.John G. Avildsen is another curious case. He seems capable of bringing the best out of his actors. After wining the Oscar for \"Rocky\" his work was largely ignored with the exception of this franchise. \"The Power Of One\" made after he returned to direct his only Rocky sequel \"Rocky V\", has some great performances is a good movie I enjoyed at the time, but again it received little attention.Overall I rate it 10/10 because I loved it growing up in the 80's and I still love it, when I watch it with my kids (two boys, 16 and 8) who both love it too.All this without even talking about the crane kick and the end. I love the satisfied smile on Miyagi's face as Daniel shouts \"Hey Mr Miyagi, WE DID IT, ALRIGHT\". It's not quite as spine tingling as \"YO ADRIAN, I DID IT\" from Rocky 2,which it so clearly borrows, but it's close.",

I think this movie is just brilliantly done.The plot of this movie is really great. It has been done before, but it seems very well done in this movie. The characters in this film are unbelievably memorable as well. How many times has Mr. Miyagi been parodied in pop culture? He is a magnificent character. John Kreese is also great as the evil to compliment Miyagi's good. Daniel and Johnny are also very good in their roles.The ending of this movie is very good too. Daniel overcomes great adversity and wins with the crane kick. Good stuff.The sequel was good too, but it couldn't top the original and I don't expect the coming remake to be able to either.",

I never really took karate and I wasn't really bullied, but it is great to remember a time when profanity wasn't needed for humor, or vulgarity, or shootings or blowing up buildings.A time when the \" good guy \" would adhere to the rules and had morals. A time when the \" bad guy \" had no honor, but would rarely curse...lol. ( Hey, this was a PG movie after all, wasn't it? LOL. ) \" Oh, I think nothing of cheating and being mean, because THAT'S what makes the audience dislike me and root for the hero, but I just can't use filthy words. \" I miss that.I love the movie because it takes me back to my childhood and a simpler time. A good guy and a bad guy, with the good guy coming out on top. If the \" good guy \" curses like a sailor, shoots everyone that gets in his way, and does everything vile imaginable, he's not really that good of a guy, is he?Yeah, I'm \" old school. \" So what?",

Going on the first day,we looked at what was being screened. Despite having heard of it for years, we discovered that neither of us had seen the title,leading to us meeting the karate kid.View on the film:Returning to the underdog arena, co-editor/(with Walt Mulconery and Bud S. Smith) director John G. Avildsen reunites with regular collaborator cinematographer James Crabe for a high kicking Sports Drama, with each take-down move in the karate tournament being captured in swift mid-shots,which allow for each move to be cleanly seen,whilst also picking up on the growing excitement in the crowd, who had led Avildsen and Crabe's Rocky (1976-also reviewed) to victory.Training up to Bill Conti's warm score mixed in with 80's Pop song licks, Avildsen turns beaten up Daniel (played with a infectious enthusiastic swing by Ralph Macchio) into the karate kid with glossy \"Magic Hour\" crane shots hanging on Daniel learning the code of karate from Miyagi (played with a real sincerity by Pat Morita) which glide to stylish wide-shots looking towards the foreground of the workout location to the square-jawed Disney baddies Cobra Kai,and the supportive passion from Ali (played with a breezy charm by Elisabeth Shue,whose brother Andrew appears as one of the Cobra's.)Years before he would become a regular collaborator of Luc Besson, which includes co-writing the bombastic Sci-Fi epic The Fifth Element (1997-also reviewed),the screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen neatly blends the hard beatings Daniel takes from the snarling Cobra Kai, with quiet contemplation on the coming of age drama Daniel expirences,from Miyagi teachings being shared to the karate kid.",

It was invigorating to see something real, and see something that would genuinely happen, even now, like an older person getting uncomfortably drunk around someone they shouldn't have to cope with past traumas.Overall the movie has a great message, good acting, and really enjoyable shots.

Meanwhile, Daniel falls in love beautiful young girl(Elizabeth Shue).This agreeable movie, a sort of junior version of 'Rocky', develops a sincere and deep friendship among two protagonists, the rockie young boy and the wise old man. Using more than his fists, Daniel learns about himself and the sense of life. Sympathetic and likable acting by main actors: Macchio and Morita. Furthermore, appear as secondaries, Larry Drake, Chad McQueen, Larry B Scott and Martin Kove. The film contains adequate cinematography and long-standing score , though with excessive disco-music, by Bill Conti, usual of trilogy. The picture is well directed by John G Avildsen. Since then , Avildsen has mixed more karate Kid and Rocky films with such feel-good message films as \u00a8Power of one, Lean on me\u00a8 and again Rocky V. It's followed by three sequels,Karate Kid II(1986) where the protagonists travel to Okinawa, Part III(1989) where Daniel again battling nasties enemies. And 'The next karate Kid'(1994)by Christopher Cain which introduces a new kid , girl, with the two times Oscarized Hilary Swank.

            "content": "This is a movie where you can view multiple times throughout your life. And though a few things are quite outdated, it still has a core message that isn't about bullies or defending yourself. It's about balance.In this case, Daniel's main struggle wasn't exactly bullies fighting him, but accepting a different path in life. You see, as a kid watching this, I always though his moving to another city against his will and trying to fit in was the core of the story. As an adult now, it's that he never gave his new world a chance. You can even say that he never even attempted to \"fit in.\" Yes, the story begins with a beach party that turns into the fight that sets off the bullying. But throughout the movie you do see the bullies seem like, regular teenage kids. Daniel stays to himself and doesn't even begin to integrate himself with the other students.Enter Mr. Miyagi. A man who has lost everything in his life and has integrated himself as the handyman around a San Fernando Valley apartment complex. Not a very good job if you take into account the condition of the pool. Any way, he seems to have found a window of peace past a decorated soldier for the United States. Even though the country stole his life from him, he has found forgiveness and moments of peace. To Daniel, he is shoved into a situation (to a teen this must feel like war) and he decides to go against the waves (sometimes literally) Mr. Miyagi tells him directly that he lacks balance.This is the core of the picture. Balance. Daniel needs to find balance in his life. That he needs to integrate his world with what life has given him. His Mother had gone through much to get to this point. His selfishness and entitlement is what is keeping him back from the peace he wants.In karate, he finds focus.This movie, whether writer Robert Mark Kamen, intended, lacks much more depth than realized. And in the hands of John G. Avildsen (a rather underrated director), finds the real heart of the story.I wish they still made movies like this. Though a five minute scene with just two people talking make producers uneasy. The banter when Mr. Miyagi first saves Daniel and is nursing him is pitch perfect.",

Is the original it is a classic and great film to watch. I watch this film as kid in elementary school in high school and even today. How to defend your life against bullies and high school students who know karate and use it on weaker people. Everything about this movie is great and classic.My girlfriend bought me this film on Blu-ray from the UK and Germany I have two releases from this film. Director John G. Avildsen did a great job. Elisabeth Shue was great in this movie as Ali Mills she supported Daniel, she stood by him the only one even in the fight in the arena I absolutely love her in the movie. I love the song You're the Best by Joe Esposito. I wish I would have this film on steelbook so much I love it. I am defending this film and the second one. I think they are both great sports films. I know some people hate this film.Some guy named J. Matthew Turner made a 4 min. long video about this film saying that Daniel was the real bully and Johnny was just defending his life, but I disagree. Doesn't matter who was a bully, I like hard work what Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel. I love wax on and wax off, paint the fence, sand the floor. I love, love this film to death! I grew up watching this movie as a kid it defines my childhood. This movie doesn't deserve to get a hate. I love Cobra Kai series which completely continues where this movie ends. It shows Johnny Lawrence life and Daniel Larusso's life I love that. That is why I love this movie to death. The fight scenes and the fight choreography for this film was excellent.The Karate Kid is coming on 4k Blu-ray in April 16th in Us. There was a series created by YouTube Cobra Kai which follows the story from this film. Both actors reunite Ralph Macchio and William Zabka played respectfully their characters. I can't wait for Season 2.Great acting from the cast: Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue, Martin Kove, Randee Heller and William Zabka.Miles way better movie than No Retreat, No Surrender which was rip off of this movie on a horrendous way. I love the music score from Bill Conti who made music score for Rocky. Great direction from John G. Avildsen. Even Italians love this film and the second one so much that they created their own Karate movies: Karate Warrior 6 movies.The last fight between Johnny and Daniel on the end was great in the film incredible. NOTE: To: J. Matthew Turner I disagree with you what you said in your video, but if you don't like the film you should do something else with your life, there are more stuff and hobbies you have. Me personal I will always love this film and cherish it. There are far more worse films today than they were in the 80's. :P 10/10 I recommend everyone to see this movie and The Karate Kid part II. :P",

One of my friends went to see it and when I saw him the next day I asked him how it was. He said, \"Phenomenal!\" With my interest peaked, I asked him to tell me about it, but he refused, stating that I just needed to go see it for myself - especially the ending which he said was \"unforgettable\". He was so right.When Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother move from New Jersey to California, little did he know the eye opening transition he would face in his new town and school. Soon, he is invited to a beach party with some of the local kids and immediately falls for a girl there named Ali (Elisabeth Shue). Unfortunately, her obsessive ex-boyfriend isn't too keen on Daniel hitting on \"his girl\" leading up to a fight and constant bullying from him and his Cobra Kai, karate-fighting friends. When all seems lost, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the apartment's handyman steps in and befriends him - and trains him to fight in the All-Valley Karate Championships leading to the film's climactic finish.I did go see it when it was still in the theaters and my friend was right on both counts. It was \"phenomenal\" and \"unforgettable\". This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I honestly couldn't even tell you how many times I've seen it over these past 35 years. Yeah ... a long time. And I still love it just as much with each and every viewing.This movie comes at the highest recommend possible. It touches the heart with the unlikely, yet strong bond of friendship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. It is a crowd-pleaser and a feel good movie that motivates and inspires. And the ending ... the crane kick - truly unforgettable and has earned its rightful place in movie lore and history as one of the best endings ever. If you haven't seen this film (which would shock me) - stop reading about it and go get a copy. You won't regret it.",

Daniel(Macchio) is a transplant from New Jersey, runs afoul with bullies from a karate school known as Cobra Kai. Johnny Lawrence(William Zabka) is the ruthless of the bunch. Their sensei John Kreese(Martin Kove) is barbaric. Then there's Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita, \"Happy Days\", \"O'Hara\" and others) who happens to be Daniel's sensei. His ways are more peaceful, and his patience can be limited with how he handles with his student. Never call him humorless, cause he can have all the fun with his student whenever he could. I like the memorable parts he says, \"Wax On, Wax Off\". And the crane technique is also a gem. Then one that blew me away is when Miyagi chopped the necks of those beer bottles. Then there's the tournament, those Kobra Kais really had it coming, especially Johnny. Falling victim to the crane kick. At least he lost humbly, he was no sore sport unlike the others. However, I think they are starting to see the errors of Kreese's ways. Some are, some aren't, who knows? This movie is a gem and Elisabeth Shue's role of Ali is remarkable! WAY TO GO!

Daniel LaRusso (Macchio) moves with his mother (Randee Heller) from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, a neighbourhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Pretty much from the off Daniel finds he doesn't belong and quickly incurs the wrath of Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) who is the ex-boyfriend of the only person Daniel has connected with; Ali Mills (Shue). Not good since Johnny is an ace karate student from the Cobra Kai dojo, a place where the students are taught winning is everything by tough ex-forces sensei, John Kreese (Martin Kove). But salvation and a stop to the beatings at the hands of Lawrence and his bully loving friends may come in the form of the quirky but kind handyman at the apartment complex; Mr. Miyagi (Morita). In 1976 John G. Avildsen had directed one of the most loved of all the underdog comes good movies, Rocky. Fast forward to 1984 and we find Avildsen treading on the same turf, only for a younger audience. What was to follow would be a monster hit movie (it made over $90 million domestically alone), that spawned three sequels, a remake, pop culture bonanza and more telling; got karate back in the headlines some 11 years after the tragic death of Bruce Lee. Its appeal is not hard to fathom, geeky young guy gets beat up on by some suspiciously Aryan bully types, forms a wonderful and warm friendship with sage old Chinaman, becomes a karate hero after being tutored in an unorthodox manner by kindly Chinaman, then kicks Aryan dudes butt. What's not to like there? Hell us young men even had the all American cutie pie looks of Shue (she was 21 at the time and Macchio 23) to admire as we joined Daniel in chopping, kicking and falling on our asses as we tried the famous \"Crane Kick\". Sure some of it looks creaky now, but it's creakiness with an 80s charm that still engages today. So lets get waxing on and waxing off and relieve the moment when we all cheered at the climax of this simple, yet utterly beguiling movie. 8/10",

People usually like to root for the underdog and always against bullies. I include myself in that category.Revisting the film recently brought mixed results. It was interesting to see a young Elisabeth Shue. I definitely enjoyed this at the theater in 1984 but now the kid, Ralph Macchio, and his New Jersey accent, is annoying and Pat Morita's Far East religious philosophies also got to be a little too heavy-handed.Overall, however, the film has a lot of charm no matter what decade you see it, and you can usually count on a David vs. Goliath type story to be popular.

Tonight's movie review is The Karate Kid (1984) where we have Daniel LaRusso, a New Jersey kid, making a big move to sunny California with his mother Lucille who lands a new job - I believe in the hospo industry. Ralph Macchio plays Daniel, your typical 80s dark haired Italian boy with a Jersey accent who tries to understand the way things work in the west side. Soon, Daniel finds himself invited to a beach get together with some locals and meets Ali played by Adventures of Babysitting star aElizabeth Shue and things seem to look alright for LaRusso, it seems you has understood how things work in Cali. That is until Ali's old flame Johnny Lawrence played by William Zabka intervenes and literally kicks Danny's butt. Danny is scared but still has his pride intact.Think you see the last of Johnny? Guess again, Johnny and his motorbike goons go to the same highschool as Danny and all of them go to a local Karate school Cobra Kai run by an Ex-Vet, Kreese played superbly by Martin Kove. Time to time Johnny and his mates torment Danny, in particular at a Halloween school party, where Danny rocks up as a Shower Curtain, yep a shower curtain and the Cobra Kai kids rock up as skeleton goons. That particular night Danny gets beaten up again outside of his place...that is until Mr Miyagi enters. An old Japanese janitor played by the forever great Pat Morita, is Mr. Fix It and seems to be a harmless old eccentric with a curious hobby, which includes catching flies with chopsticks. But looks are always misleading, it turns out that Miyagi is a karate master, a student not only of karate fighting but of the total philosophy of the martial arts. And yep he kicks the living daylights of the Cobra Kai goons and agrees to take Daniel as his student.I watched this flick as a 6-year-old and even then, it wowed me. From the 80's tunes like Bananarama's \"Cruel Summer\" and Joe Esposito's \"You're The Best,\" to the awesome one liners \"get him a bodybag!!\", \"Its open season\", \"Strike First! Strike Hard! No Mercy!.\" You have Bill Conti's score which raises the spirit of the movie. And of course, the Karate - whether the learnings or the actual fights. In particular when Miyagi promises to teach Daniel and undergoes unconventional training including waxing on and off a few cars, cleaning the floors and painting fences. But its more - it's a true martial arts flick where balance in one's life is always important and when you want to strive for anything, learn the basics which is reflective with the quote \"First learn stand then learn fly.\"The film's story is driven by strong character development and everyone involved puts in a cracker performance. Morita and Macchio are awesome together and watching their friendship blossom as they work to achieve their goal is deeply moving. This is because in a way they both need each other. Daniel is a boy without a father and Miyagi is a father who lost his child. William Zabka does excellent as the supposed bully Johnny Lawrence but really like majority of the characters; he is a flawed character. A good kid at heart who like his buddies have been brainwashed by his always win mentality Karate instructor Kreece.A classic gem, this movie has it all and who doesn't love the crane kick at the end??? A touching flick - 8.5/10",

Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso, who is forced to move to Reseda. He meets Ali Mills, and makes an enemy with her ex-boyfriend, Johnny. When Daniel is violently bullied, the handyman named Mr. Miyagi agrees to teach him how to defend himself in the art of karate. At first, Daniel thinks he's being treated like a slave, because he has to wax the cars, paint his house but he was really learning karate moves the whole time. Mr. Miyagi gets Daniel ready for an 'All Valley Karate Tournament' where he must confront his enemies, and Johnny and see if he has what it takes to be the best and win the gold. I highly recommend THE KARATE KID!!!",

It does a remarkable thing where at once it feels both of its time (it's sooooooo 80s) and also kinda timeless.Much of that can be attributed to the core master-student relationship between Daniel and Miyagi, which took me by surprise for how sweet and tender a friendship it turned out to be. As a movie it's light and breezy and understands its tone very well. This is cheesy and melodramatic but in all the right ways.If I have one complaint it'd be that super abrupt ending after the last fight (a movie pet peeve for me). The opening scene of the Karate Kid Part II should have been this films ending, it has a much more assured sense of closure, fits perfectly with the themes of this film and happens literally moments after the final fight.",

            "content": "If the success of a movie were to be measured by the rip-offs and spurious sequels it generates, Karate Kid would be in Star Wars' league; in fact it brought to the zenith the 1980s frenzy for martial arts movies, apparently waning after the 1970s Bruce Lee era, and contributing western settings to martial arts typical of Hong Kong with their oriental flavor (men jumping building high on wires etc). This is an excellent movie that closely reminds Rocky I. I just read the FULL, ORIGINAL Mark Kamen SCRIPT of the movie on American Film Scripts Online and I must admit many scenes and character development never made it on film, or were lost in the cutting room. For example, there is one scene in which Daniel rescues Ali from \"greasers\" who try to abduct and to rape her. The atmosphere of the \"arcade alley\" seems darker on script than in the film we watched, with lots of unsavory types around. Daniel's name is \"WEBER\" in the script and his father abandoned him as a child (thus not deceased as in the movie ); there is an angle describing Daniel's mother job and a flirtation with a say co-worker, also absent in the movie. Some scenes we watched on screen are totally absent from the script. Akin to Rocky, Karate Kid delivered some \"American dream\" epic tailored to working class people ala Rocky Balboa... Daniel is a working class hero whose exploits are great, but within reach (not another Clark Kent or Commando character ).Worth noting, in this kind of movie main actors may (or may not ) deliver solid acting, but supporting actors are invariably bland to opaque. In Karate Kid not only do Daniel & Miyagi deliver good acting (with Norita being better in the league of Alec Guinness' \"Kenobi\" and Shue distant third ), but minor co-stars like Zabka, Kove, Thomas etc deliver remarkable cameos...Kove's piercing portrait of nasty sensei Kreese is light years ahead of say his bland performance in Rambo II.A true classic I have watched many times without getting tired.",

It also has a great cast (but the Cobra Kai weren't really successful in their movies?? They hardly featured in any). You could say it was a one hit wonder as the numbers 2 and 3 failed to live upto the hype of 1. Elisabeth Shue is gorgeous in this movie, and she and Johnny (from the Cobra Kai) are very likable characters.I remember back in the day when me and my friends watched this over and over in our childhood (ALONG with Home Alone!!) (I'm now 24), but still enjoy this flick 20 years after it was first released! Can you believe it? It should have had more ratings than 6. The story is about an underdog (Daniel LaRusso), and his efforts to defeat the wrongly taught 'bad' students. \"Teacher say, Student do\"...Mr Miyagi - played by Pat Morita, is - amazing. It should have won him the Oscar award, but he must feel privileged to be the first Asian-American actor to be nominated for an Oscar award.Mr Miyagi and Daniel click from the very beginning. It's a superb movie, and shivers run through my back every time I watch the ending ** SPOILER ** and the infamous 'crane finish'. Mostly because it reminds me of the olden days, and the whole 'underdog spirit' thing. It really does motivate you. It has some very distinctive lines that were made popular by this movie. In the late 80's and early 90's you had all the kids doing karate and saying 'wax on, wax off' they still do! It has some memorable quotes, some which are on the IMDb (kk1) page.IMO, it's a legend, and legends never die. This will be played over and over...and over again on my poor DVD player for another 10 years (hopefully!).I really do recommend it to the younger generation....BRILLIANT MOVIE...9/10!!",

Watching it for the second time however, has made me appreciate The Karate Kid a whole lot more now. The acting holds up wonderfully, the karate fights are fun and exciting, the musical score is relaxing and memorable and the chemistry between Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita is the heart and soul of this film. The romance between Daniel and Ali is great too. It really is one of the best coming-of-age movies out there, because it isn't just a story about a martial arts teacher training his student. More than that (At least in my opinion) it's a story about a boy needing a father, and a man needing a son.Overall The Karate Kid has aged incredibly well, and it will continue aging incredibly well. It truly is a timeless classic. And it weirdly left me wanting more, from this Karate Kid story. I. am looking forward to checking out The Karate Kid Part II. But as for this original film, it's aged, and will continue to age like fine wine.",

Their master teaches them to win at any cost. They have had great success in tournaments and seem to rule the school. Macchio runs afoul of them quickly and becomes a target. Eventually, he hears about Morita and begins to work his way into his good graces. This is not easy because the guy isn't into the show business of the martial art. When asked what belt he has he takes one off his pants and says something like, K-mart, Five Dollars. Sorry. I didn't feel like looking up the quote, but you get the idea.

Avildsen. It centres on the same timeless appeal of rooting for an underdog against very long odds. It's formulaic, and predictable, to be sure, but it's a sure-fire audience pleaser, with winning performances all around.Macchio is Daniel, who's moved from New Jersey to California with his cheery mother (Randee Heller). He's not happy about it at all, but he finds ample distraction in the form of a very cute blonde, Ali (an adorable Elisabeth Shue, in her film debut). This, however, incurs the wrath of her ex-boyfriend Johnny (William Zabka, otherwise known as the premiere 1980s movie bully), and Daniel takes numerous lumps. Then he finds an unlikely mentor in Mr. Miyagi (Mr. Morita), the eccentric but wise old handyman in his apartment complex. Miyagi teaches Daniel some of the finer points of karate, and also helps the put-upon kid to believe in himself.Although a little over extended at two hours and seven minutes, \"The Karate Kid\" tells an engaging story that holds ones' attention. There is a lot of humour as well as heart, with some poignant moments for the sassy elder, who served the U.S. in WWII, but had his family sent to one of those detention camps. So Mr. Morita does get a solid and meaty role to play, as he ultimately becomes the father figure that Daniel needs. Macchio (perhaps a little old for his role at the time, but still baby-faced enough to make it work) is appealing - although the character is not entirely blameless. He does bring trouble upon himself at one point.And what is a movie of this kind without its cheesy rock anthems (Survivor does the theme song, just as they did for \"Rocky III\" and \"Rocky IV\") and, most important, the quality of its antagonists? Johnny and his buddies come off as largely despicable, and feeding wrong ideas into their head is their tough-talking sensei Kreese (Martin Kove). Fortunately, we get to see many of these people take their own lumps, leading to the expected rousing tournament finale where Daniel takes on many of them, on the way to fight reigning champion Johnny.While watching, you will notice a variety of familiar faces in smaller roles: Tony O'Dell, Larry B. Scott, Frances Bay, Larry Drake, Peter Jason. As the mother, Heller does come off as rather annoying at first, but soon becomes more endearing as she shows concern for her son.As of this writing, this 35 year old franchise is ongoing: there have been three sequels (the third with Hilary Swank), an animated TV series, a remake (with Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith), and the current \"Cobra Kai\" series, which apparently builds on the idea that some viewers have that *Daniel* is the true villain, and Johnny a victim.Seven out of 10.",

Naturally, having lived in Newark all of his life, Daniel is not happy to leave his neighborhood, but things start to look up when he meets an attractive girl named \"Ali Mills\" (Elisabeth Shue). The problem is that Ali has an ex-boyfriend named \"Johnny Lawrence\" (William Zabka) who still has feelings for her and--being an arrogant bully--does not like it when she gives any attention to someone else. Not only that, but he is also a black belt in karate and surrounds himself with other like-minded teenagers as well. However, after getting beaten up on several occasions, Daniel finds a unique friend named \"Mr. Miyagi\" (Pat Morita) who not only mentors him like a father, but also teaches him a style of karate taught to him by his own father in Okinawa. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is one of those films that manages to capture that awkward transition from being a teenager to adulthood and the struggles a boy sometimes has to endure along the way. On that note, although I liked the performance of Ralph Macchio, I thought that Pat Morita played his character to perfection and pretty much dominated every scene he was in.

Avildsen scored majored success with Rocky. Here he creates a juvenile hero faced with similar responsibilities. Ralph Macchio plays Daniel LaRusso who is not pleased with the move that he and his mother made to this new town. Fitting in becomes an issue when standing up for a female classmate on the beach turns into a beat down, led by her narcissistic ex-boyfriend. Eventually a lonely janitor, played by Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita comes to his aid and ultimately teaches him karate for the purpose of defeating his foe in a karate tournament. Like Rocky, we know where this is headed and how it ends, but that doesn't reduce its effect on rooting for the underdog. Macchio being a small high school kid makes him vulnerable but his determination to avenge his pride and stand up for himself is the stuff that viewers will relate. Morita steals the entire film as the peaceful Kiesuke Miyagi whose methods of teaching Macchio the moves are the film's best moments due to his simplistic and humbling nature. Elisabeth Shue as the female caught in the middle of the chaos is merely a romantic prop. William Zabka makes for an effective narcissistic bully. Randee Heller plays Macchio's well meaning yet na\u00efve mother. It stresses mind over matter, and control over pride. Score: 8 \u00bd / 10",

Yet \"The Karate Kid\" deserves to be judged on its own merit. More than a \"Rocky\" in high-school, the film is a heart-warming, confidence-building, coming-of-age story, with as many stressful as relaxing moments... as if it was trying to find its own balance between Hollywood escapism and human depth.Now I feel compelled to say as many good things about \"The Karate Kid\"... as two consecutive viewings would allow me to, but whatever I say will hardly have the emotional juice of someone who let it grow through the years. I can just drop the many things to appreciate: the struggles of Daniel LaRusso and the comfort he found in the peaceful house and words of Mr. Miyagi, both talking of life, love, bonsais and \"Banzai!\" letting their friendship grow ... until it's Karate talking, then training, then fighting time.I regret that my memories were deprived from a story that could have fixed my preconceived perceptions of martial arts flicks. My cousin, a Karate player who had his room's walled with Bruce Lee and JCVD posters (I mention him in my \"Blood Sport\"'s review) showed me every possible 'karate' film: \"Blood Sport\", \"Kick Boxer\", even \"Karate Tiger\", Van Damme's debut as a villain... an obvious rip-off of \"The Karate Kid\" but I didn't know that. Yes, we didn't see the one that started them all. I only saw the third film actually and thought it was so formulaic and predictable I didn't care much for the original.Just a simple glimpse at the poster should have convinced of how wrong I was. There's no bad-ass threatening pose, the real focus is between these two misfits, the Newark kid who just moved to California with his single mother and the old Japanese janitor who has a knowing and saying about everything yet keeps humble about it. And in the middle you have the iconic sight of LaRusso's poses in the crane position.The beach in the poster is like a metaphor for all the clich\u00e9s that ruined the legacy of martial arts movies and over which the film proudly stands: bad villains without motives, cheesy pop-songs filled montages, revenge stories and a mentor working as a kick-ass version of Confucius. The film never falls into these clich\u00e9s but not without struggle. I still have a hard time accepting the way Daniel was ditched by his new friends, it's not like he chickened out against Johnny...Speaking of chickening out, I was wondering if I had watched the film at that time, would I have abandoned Karate (out of fear of taking hits)? Yes, I feared pain and this fear caused me bigger pain in the long term, if there's one thing life has taught me is that you pay weakness the biggest price and maybe such a film would have taught me not to fear fight... and not to enjoy it either, that's how important Karate and martial arts are. Anyway, even the fight ceases to be the point while we witness the gradual bonding between Sensei Miyagi and Daniel-San. Sure you have \"Sweep the leg\", \"Wax-on, wax-off\" but... \"you're the best friend I ever had\" is my favorite line from the film. And I couldn't believe Ralph Macchio just made the same comment while I was writing this, listening to the 2013 reunion on Youtube. But he's right, that quote encapsulates the beauty and purity of the film.\"The Karate Kid\" not only acknowledges the necessity of a guidance, but it turns the guidance into a friendship and creates in Mr. Miyagi not just a father-friend figure but a man with a past, one that honors and acknowledges the sacrifices and heroism of many Japanese-Americans, a present which is the movie and a bright future incarnated by Daniel's final triumph. Not over himself or some demons... the film is beyond these clich\u00e9s.Daniel has the right spirit from the start, he stays respectful to Miyagi, his romance with Ali doesn't fall into sentimental contrivance and together, they have a terrific chemistry, so the real victory is about not letting the adversary take the best of you. Maybe that's what finding the balance is, being something to be proud of and earning self-respect. So technically before the competition, Daniel had just won everything, the tournament was simply the record to settle between two schools of Karate: the good one and the Cobra Kai incarnated by the merciless Vietnam vet Kreese (Martin Krove). And the film's ending is epic in the sense that it wraps up everything the movie was about in one single minute, exactly like the ending of \"Rocky\": the villain gets a lesson of shut-your-mouth humility, the not-so-bad bully (Billy Zabka) acknowledges Daniel's merit, giving him the trophy, Daniel is carried away by a cheerful crowd so eager to celebrate his victory he literally vanishes from the screen... but we can hear him sharing his victory with his friend and surrogate father, Mr. Miyagi. So it all makes sense that the film ends with his proud smile and held-back tears: the perfect conclusion.Morita was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but this is clearly the symbiosis of two acting talents as Ralph Macchio, looking like a 80s version of Sal Mineo, gave a fresh and authentic performance that worked with Morita and Elizabeth Shue (as talented as youthfully beautifully) and the other cast members. This is Avildsen's second masterpiece after \"Rocky\", served by pop music and naturally a score ,from Bill Conti... why changing a winning team?",

Determined to stick up for himself, Daniel begins to teach himself karate, only to discover that the caretaker at his apartment seems to be a master of karate. Agreeing to teach Daniel, Mr. Miyagi shows Daniel that there is more to karate than violence. The best way to solve the problem he has with the bullies is in the All Valley Karate Championship.While its probably one of the defining films of the eighties, the film has many flaws. It's basically Rocky for kids, and the film is way, way too long.The film focuses too much on the romance side, and while that is good, a maguffin for Daniels rationale to learn Karate, along with the bullying, the film could have been trimmed by twenty minutes, taking out all the creepy parts where Daniel is being aggressive toward Shue.Other than that, it's a fine movie, the bad guys wear black so you know where you are, and Kreese literally sneers and shouts his entire script, which makes the film fun whenever he's on screen.Macchio is fine as Daniel San, but Morita blows him off screen whenever the two are together, which is 90 percent of the time Morita appears in this. Miyagi is a career defining performance, funny, and utterly harrowing when he has his drunk moment. A powerful moment in such a high concept blockbuster.There are lots of standout scenes, and although the final act is exciting, nothing come close to the moment when Daniel learns why Miyagi has made him do all those chores, its jaw dropping stuff.So all in all, its a fine movie, just way too long.",

G. Avildsen has done in this film. What is this moral? Being a father. While Daniel Larusso might not have a father, Mr. miyagi becomes the father he never had, and \"daniel-san\" as Mr. Miyagi calls him, is the son he never had. they bond in that way and it's something that should be done more often in movies.Daniel LaRusso (Played by Ralph Macchio) has left new jersey with his mother to start a new life in the Run down part of what might be Los Angeles, California. Once he is there, he encounters a cute girl (played by Elizabeth Shue) But is quickly bested in a fight for her by Johnny Lawrence, A Black-belt Karate student of one of the most brutal karate teachers of all time (Played by Martin Kove, also known as Ericson from Rambo: First blood part II) After Constant bullying by the Cobra Kai (Johnny's Gang) Daniel turns to Mr. Miyagi (Played by Pat Morita, who has since passed away) for help, and finds not only the skills to earn Johnny's Respect, But a father in the form of an old Okinawan Janitor.This movie defines Good. There is nary a bad thing in it. The soundtrack is great. The fighting Sequences are pretty good, and it's good to tune into AMC to catch this on a late Sunday night.10/10",

            "content": "There are some films that define the generation (or decade) in which they are made. \"The Karate Kid\" does this for the 1980s.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the story of young Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Maccio), who moves to California and finds his new school much less accommodating than New Jersey. After falling for a local girl (Elisabeth Shue), he is targeted by the Cobra Kai, the local karate school that preaches a violent style of fighting. In order to defend himself, Daniel begins learning karate for his own source, that being the enigmatic Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita).There are very few movies I can watch multiple times and still enjoy them, but this is one of them. Besides being a bit cheesy at times (although what 80s movie isn't?!), it does pretty much everything right:The plot is both creative and inspirational, and will have you almost physically \"into it\" by the time the credits roll. The acting (especially from Morita) is also very entertaining, providing both the driving inspirational force as well as subtle touches of comedy thrown in. Even the music positively adds to the experience, as Bill Conti's (the same guy who scored \"Rocky\") tunes will draw out each emotion to its full potential for every scene.Overall, this is a landmark film that can be enjoyed at any age. Youngsters will like the action, while \"big kids\" will appreciate the inspirational and simple (yet effective) direction from Jon G. Avlidsen (also of \"Rocky\" fame).",

Characters worked well, the villains changed but were still put in their place by Daniel and the Yoda like Mr Myagi.\nThe love interests didn't last long, a one film stint seemed as long as it got, each one given a one line explanation as to why they weren't there at the start of the sequels. The basic philosophy was to illustrate that karate is a part of life, which to western audiences was probably lost a bit on them. The training techniques that Mr Myagi uses to teach Daniel San the principles of Karate are every day things, but adhere to the general teaching method of anything ie that repetition makes things faster and more automatic. Getting on a bit and having suffered the fate of so many films of this era has been remade and updated. One of the few sets that don't get worse as they progress, each different enough to avoid them becoming to repetitive but the central core of story and characters giving it a familiar feel.

Yin versus yang in every respect, to be concise. It's an extremely basic storyline, narrow and by-the-books, but the music is great, it's got tons of heart and all the crucial performances are absolutely perfect.Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio are the cornerstones, an earnest and relatable pairing that falls together almost by accident and then patiently develops a tight, resonant bond. They're both dynamite; Macchio as the babyfaced boy-next-door (he was twenty-two at the time, but looked all of fourteen) and Morita as the sage, reclusive font of wisdom and worldly experience. The film really takes its time with that relationship, allowing the audience to learn and grow right alongside the stars and drawing us in via simple, reflective character moments. Why give in to the temptation of a cheesy montage when that would skim over all the important stuff?It doesn't nail every spot - a brisk romance with Elizabeth Shue constantly wavers between sweetness and melodrama, while the hard-earned climax at a big karate tournament is strangely abrupt - but the good far outweighs the bad. Admirably slow and careful without overstaying its welcome, it represents a lost style of mainstream storytelling.

After he's brutally beaten, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) makes an agreement to enter him in a tournament if the kids allow him time to train. If you read many reviews of THE KARATE KID, even the positive ones, you're probably going to see the word manipulative several times. There's no denying that this film is predictable and there's no denying the fact that every scene tries to manipulate the viewer into a certain emotion but who cares? THE KARATE KID is without question one of the best films of the decade and it's also one of the best of its type from any era. There are so many reasons why this film should have fallen flat on its face but a lot of credit has to go to director John G. Avildsen because he makes sure that things never get corny and he is so terrific at building up the characters and the drama that you can't help but get caught up in everything you're fed. I think most people will be able to connect with the Daniel character and Macchio does a terrific job at bringing him to life. Morita gets the role of his career and simply kills it and ends up becoming one of the most memorable good guys in the history of cinema. The two actors have such a warn chemistry that one can't help but feel their relationship grow and even more important is that it comes off real. The film has one of the greatest underdogs, one of the greatest good guys so we have to have a great villain and we get that in William Zabka and Martin Kove who play the main bully and his master. The two are such creeps that you can't help but hate them and want to see Daniel win against them. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a very strong performance as the love interest. It's really remarkable to see how terrific the cast is as all the leads and everyone down to the extras fit their roles perfectly. I'm sure many will see connections to ROCKY, which was also directed by Avildsen but I think this movie is even better. The drama is so real and the emotions that the characters go through are so dark and true to life that you really can't help but feel for them and what they're going through. The film is quite dark in spots but it's also got a terrific heart and message that really make it so memorable. There have been many imitators since (and a remake) but there's no question that THE KARATE KID is something special and something that really can't be touched.",

Whether it's the cheese-tastic 80's soundtrack, the plethora of quotable lines, or the incredibly lovable Mr. Miyagi, The Karate Kid is just such an enjoyable movie. It's the story of Daniel LaRusso, a kid who moves to a new town and runs into a lot of trouble with the school bully gang. In order to protect himself, he learns karate from his apartment mechanic, Mr. Kesuke Miyagi. In order to finally settle the conflict, Daniel agrees to fight in the upcoming Karate tournament, and it is only with the help of Mr. Miyagi that he will have the skills necessary to fight. This is the classic underdog story that we all know, but The Karate Kid does it in a wonderfully enjoyable and very high quality way.The Karate Kid is undeniably an 80's movie. It has plenty of long hair, synthesizer, and cheesy-as-hell montages. But it is all this cheese that makes this film so much fun. It all adds to the great uplifting spirit of this film that just makes you want to get up, dance, and cheer on Ralph Macchio, who is plenty likable. You just can't hate this film. It is too much fun and it leaves a mark on you that you will enjoy for a long time afterwards. There are a ridiculous amount of lines from this film to quote, and certain catchphrases have become staples in pop culture. If you haven't heard \"wax-on, wax-off\" in your lifetime then you have obviously been living under a rock.But all the nostalgia and cheese aside, this really is a good movie. It tells a really great story and is very enthralling for your typical crowd pleasing underdog tale. There are obviously those moments which don't exactly shine, but nobody said it was perfect. The script is full of wit and delivers a ton of wholehearted laughs. Plus John G. Avildsen, the director of Rocky who obviously loves underdog stories, directs this film very well and can make scenes hilarious and entertaining, to exhilarating and gripping.But of course what makes this film complete is Pat Morita, the incredible actor who perfectly plays the role of Mr. Miyagi. Morita even earned an Oscar nomination for this role, and it was much deserved. He is undoubtedly the best part of the film and whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for a treat. He and Ralph Macchio are great together and their teacher/pupil relationship is a joy to watch as it heartwarmingly unfolds, with plenty of laughs along the way.The Karate Kid is just a great movie. There's something for everybody in this movie, and if you don't like it then there has got to be something wrong with you. I'm not saying it is the perfect film, and it isn't exactly a grand work of cinematic art, but it is a classic that has spawned a generation of underdog tales, hardly any reaching the greatness that is The Karate Kid.",

Before I can start that show though I decided that I had to re-watch The Karate Kid trilogy in order to remember the exact story and that starts here with The Karate Kid and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a teenager get help from a Karate Master to teach him to stand up for himself.Main Character\nRalph Macchio didn't really end up with a huge career after his role as Daniel Larusso, but in terms of this film I think he is really good as the lead. He is just a pretty likeable kid and you want to see him succeed. Yes he is a bit hot headed but I thought that added a bit to his character and seeing him train in these strange ways gets you more invested and at least for me by the end of the film I really wanted to see him succeed in his quest.Supporting Character\nThe legendary Pat Morita plays Mr Miyagi and he is amazing here, so much show that he got an Oscar nomination for his performance. The relationship between Danny and him is fantastic and they are the heart of the movie for me, this mentor and student relationship is great and you see the respect between the two of them which makes there journey together so satisfying. Elizabeth Shue plays Danny's romantic interest and I thought she was really good too, they just had really good chemistry together and were a cute couple that you want to see make it through the film and have a happy ending. The rest of the cast are great too William Zabka as Johnny and Randee Heller as Kreese are really good antagonists and I can't wait to see what is in store for them when I get around to Cobra Kai.Story\nThe story is really heartfelt, the relationship between Danny and Miyagi is fantastic and really heartfelt and you really end up rooting for them and want to see Danny end up getting one over Johnny and Kreese. As I mentioned the romance is also good and even though there is a little hint of a love triangle it never forces itself into that trope which was a really good decision. No spoilers here but lets just say the plot is pretty predictable, you know exactly where it is going but in a film like this I don't see that as an issue as you want the nice and predictable ending. My one criticism is the execution of the ending, to me it felt like it was very sudden, the film just needed another few minutes to really wrap up its story and that would have made it perfect.Script\nThe script is fine, it actually has some funny moments that had me chuckling quite a bit and the drama did work for the most part. I do though find it sometime in these films from the eighties is that the scripts aren't great and that is fine but now it is 2021 I just feel it has to be mentioned as a negative in my personal opinion.Style\nThe style is great, all the different training that we see Miyagi use is fun and the montage really works and this film managed to make Karate feel pretty hardcore and violent. The film flows very nicely and even when the more personal scenes are happening it feels really good and adds weight to this story that isn't exactly new in its formulae.Overall\nOverall, I think this film is great, The Karate Kid is a pretty iconic film and is basically the teenage version of Rocky and it does it really well. If you haven't seen The Karate Kid for some reason then give it a watch and you won't be disappointed.Rating - 8/10.",

            "content": "For people of any age, \"The Karate Kid\" can point the way to a more fulfilling life. It's a treat to revisit it as I age because every viewing triggers new insights.The film is full of symbolism and perhaps the best way to watch it is to keep in mind what Mr Miyagi said: \"not everything is as seem\". Its appeal to youth is obvious but it also allows adults to see the journey towards awareness through a young person's more innocent eyes, reopening ways of learning about self that were dropped on the way to adulthood. The lessons are subtle and the pacing leisurely, allowing the viewer freedom to think about what balance means for them.Robert Kamen's script, the casting of Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio plus the performance from both of them is brilliant. All is enhanced by John Avildsen's direction. The scene where Mr Miyagi allows Daniel to make the connection between house chores & learning karate is as good as cinema gets & is a template on how to teach and learn matters of the heart. Plant a seed and allow the student to create conditions for it to grow if they are ready and open like Daniel is. Once he creates those conditions through hard physical and mental work, proving he's ready for the next step, mysterious healing forces of the universe become available through Mr Miyagi.The final crane kick is magical because Daniel finally is able to fully express the balance he was unconsciously seeking throughout the film. The initial pose of this karate move might look somewhat ridiculous, but the message is to have courage to do your own thing despite criticism. Then he unleashes, showing us the power of mind/body balance that can be applied to everything we do.",

Avildsen has a simple but well-adjusted script, playing with various clich\u00e9s from the 80s and even presenting small gaps in the individual problems of the characters that are resolved in the course of the work, in a superficial and simple way it is true , but at least we don't have an empty shell, we have a film that has a moral to expose and a story to tell.The direction is good and the soundtrack is even better, composed by the genius Bill Conti - also the same composer of Rocky- But here Bill gives a much more adolescent and relaxed footprint to his track, but without taking away the excitement of it, we have a photo extremely clear, with a classic gray filter, we have great performances especially that of the master Miyage starring Pat Morita.Finally \"Karate Kid\" is an icon, fun and exciting, with its right dose of overcoming, drama and comedy. 7.5 / 10",

Their friendship evolves over the duration of the film and it feels natural as due to their experiences they have both suffered loses of loved ones and they found what was missing from their lives in each other.As for the fight scenes they are fine and nicely capture by the camera but nothing else and compared with modern-day martial arts films or even the martial arts film of Hong-Kong through the years they are quit lacking. However is the story and emotional investment to the characters that really stick you in the fighting. Also the training montages are expertly made and the music is iconic beyond any doubt.

Of course it also is an underdog story (the director had tipped his toes with Rocky, so he knew about that) and a boy and a girl. Now I remembered the movie fondly from when I was a kid. Re-watching it, the charme is still there, but without Mr. Miyagi, the movie would feel less ... worthy, if I can say that (although I reckon those who are completely in love with the movie will be appalled by the 7/10 rating, so nothing more to lose here).I rewatched them I reckon as most did, to get into the Cobra Kai mood. I have not seen the show yet and I know a 3rd season is announced for next year and they even think about a 4th one. Watching this I saw a few things that some might call flaws. Like that Ralph Macchio looks very stiff to say the least. Now of course it makes sort of sense, since he hasn't trained as much as his opponents from a Karate school. Still William Zubka seems on a different level alltogether, have a fluidity to his movements that one is missing in Macchios character. So the fight scenes seem a bit ... odd to say the least. Him being so stiff or at least looking like it, is even weirder considering the dance moves he lays on the floor in the second movie though ... but back to this one.Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) is as mentioned the best element here. His Yoda-isms, his mellow but concrete advice, his foresight ... he is the perfect father or grandfather one can have. There is something adorable about him, that cannot be denied. Him alone makes this movie what it is.",

            "content": "ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM.Am I the only one who looks at good vs. evil films with a moderate point of view? Am I the only one who perfectly understands why Johnny and the Kobra-Kai's hate Daniel so much? People tend to watch television and accept whomever the writers tell you is the hero. But they never look at it from the antagonist's point of view. To put it simply, Daniel should just mind his own business. There are about 4 or 5 million girls his age in Los Angeles, why does he pick the one who is dating a black belt named Johnny, who also happens to be the leader of an awesome karate clique called the Kobra-Kais?In the beginning, Daniel moves to LA via Newark, NJ, a town ten times worse than happy, sunny Cali. How he grew up there and ended up a punk I'll never understand. When he moves to LA, he meets an equally punkish kid named Freddy. Daniel brags to Freddy that he knows karate and how he can handle himself. Mistake number one. Everybody knows that lies eventually catch up to you, so when Daniel gets his ass kicked on the beach (just hours later) I felt no sympathy for him. He falls for this girl named Ali and when her man comes to talk to her, Daniel butts his head in where it doesn't belong. Mistake number two. Any man knows you never jump in between a lover's spat. Women never fully get over their ex's, that's why when the cops come, they never press charges. Freddy never hangs with him ever again, but can you blame him? Not only is he a complete embarrassment, he's a liar. Again, no sympathy for Daniel.Daniel doesn't learn his lesson. He hits on Ali some more, this time at school. Johnny, understandably is p**sed. So when he sees Daniel in his karate dojo, he takes it upon himself to round up his boys and push Daniel off a steep hill. What was Daniel doing out there on a lonely deserted road anyway? Even if he didn't have a flock of crazed ninjas after him, that's simply stupid anyway. After he fell down the hill, he got what he deserved, and I'll bet any money he'll think twice before riding his Schwinn where no people hang out.The maintenance man of Daniel's building is a thousand year old Japanese man named Mr. Miyagi. When Daniel first meets him, he sees Miyagi at home trying to catch a fly with chopsticks. This alone should have let Daniel know the man was obviously nuts. But Daniel is nuts himself, so the two become best buddies. There is even a scene later in the film where Daniel himself catches a fly with chopsticks. I can dismiss human physics and except Hollywood disbelief for this scene. But what I can't accept is a fly that flies around in one spot.Daniel goes to a Halloween party and makes the dumbest decision I've ever seen in a movie. To impress a girl, (the same one who Johnny is after, mind you) Daniel decides to set up Johnny by putting a garden hose in the bathroom stall over his head. Mistake number three. Not only is Daniel adding fuel to the fire between them, but he ruins the joint Johnny was rolling; a mistake that cannot be forgiven. Johnny is soaking wet and looks like a fool. Can anyone BLAME him for being p**sed? I totally understand the ass whuppin' him and his buddies lay on Daniel. But Mr. Miyagi comes and saves the day, and beats up all the kids. Miyagi is a trained karate master, this act is not done in self defense, and all the kids are minors. Why Miyagi isn't in jail for the duration of the movie, I'll never understand.Daniel goes to the Kobra-Kai dojo and like a true punk, brings his new bodyguard Miyagi with him. He pleads with Kreese, the dojo's master to have his boys leave him alone until an upcoming karate tournament. Miyagi then agrees to teach Daniel karate, but instead turns him into his own personal mail order bride, and Daniel cleans up Miyagi's house for the next 2 weeks. Daniel then learns some karate, gets Johnny's girl, and ends up in the tournament at the end of the movie. Now let me get this straight...I can learn a lifetime of karate from a feeble old man in about 6 weeks? Now there's reality.Needless to say, in traditional Hollywood clich\u00e9 fashion, Daniel's tournament ends with him directly facing off with his nemesis, Johnny. Daniel of course wins, gets the trophy, gets the girl then even gets the friendship of Johnny. Then all the nerds watching the movie stand and cheer. Gimme a break. Who could even swallow this crap? I can accept far fetched movies like Superman before movies like these. This movie is totally fake.If this movie was real, after Miyagi was bailed out of jail, he would have trained Daniel the best he could, failed miserably because of the short time span, Daniel would have been eliminated in the first round, Johnny would have made it to the end of the tournament with some other kid who can truly fight, Johnny would have won, and Ali would have been so turned on by her ex man, she would have jumped into his arms kissing him frantically. Johnny then would have taken her home, banged her one last time, then dumped her for being so shallow. Meanwhile, Daniel would have gone back to Miyagi's house, donned a full maid outfit and once he turned 18, the two would have run off to Vegas and got married in one of those drive thru marriage places. Now that would be a truly good movie.Zero stars out of 5.",

I did like this film, but there were too many things that I didn't find particularly interesting.First of all, I felt like Daniel and Ali didn't really make the \"perfect couple\". They just didn't seem right for each other. There wasn't enough chemistry between them. And I'm sorry, but the kiss that they shared.. I just found that awkward.And also, I found that the fights between Daniel and his bullies got a bit tiresome. I actually considered skipping them altogether. All the bullying scenes were practically the same. The bullies chased Daniel, until they got to beat him up good. I don't see the point in repeating those scenes thrice or more times.I did like Miyagi's original ideas on teaching Daniel karate with the help of simple tasks, though. Watching the 2010 film, I thought it was really a clever idea. Sure, it did seem like Miyagi was just using Daniel at first, but boy, were we (and Daniel) proved wrong.Even though I wasn't that engrossed with the film, I can say that the tournament at the end really caught my attention. That's when we saw Daniel's potential, talent and progress. I was cringing during the final moments. I felt sorry for Daniel. But it all seemed too fast. Maybe that's why I liked the 2010 version better. There was more suspense and really left the audience on the edge of their seats.The main message of this movie, which is to learn how to stand up for yourself and to never give up, is really good and inspiring. I can see why lots of people, especially those who grew up in the 80s, really like this movie.",

The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is fantastic, the dialogue is great, the emotion is strong, the characters are likable and the music is fantastic. I can't believe that this only has a 6.9 and that awful film Avatar has an 8.3. This is in my opinion the most underrated movie of all time. How could anyone not like it. There is one scene in the film that cinematography is so good that my flat screen couldn't even fully capture the moment. Ralph Macchio gives what is in my opinion one of the most underrated performances in film history. When people think of a fantastic child actor performance nobody ever thinks about Macchio in The Karate Kid. They think of Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, or Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Me personally I think that Macchio deserves to be mentioned in the conversation of great child acting. All others in the cast do a great job, but the person who steals the show is Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He deserved the Oscar he got nominated for. The music is great. Both the orchestrated score and the 80's pop songs are really good. The one that stands out though is \"Your the Best\" by Joe Esposito. It is one of the catchiest songs you'll ever hear. The strength of the emotion in this film is very strong like the director's other film Rocky. That's another thing I want to mention. I hate how this is underneath the shadow of Rocky. Rocky is excellent, but so is this film. In fact this film may be even better. This film really needs more love. It is a great movie that even with all these years that have went by is still not truly given the credit it deserves.4 stars out of 4",

I also think Pat Morita did a great job in reducing vocabulary while retaining intelligence for this movie. Another thing that really impressed me was that I heard that Billy Zabka really took that kick to the face in the conclusion of the tournament. The characters really play off of each other and the result is astounding. One thing however I find almost unbelievable, is that in this movie, Ralph Macchio is almost 23 years old. With his ability to pull off such a young role and his performances in The Outsiders along with these Karate Kid movies I believe he is one of the best actors ever. All in all, this movie is a must see and an extremely good classic.",

            "content": "Director John Avildsten, (Rocky) after doing taking a break from the Rocky movies, decides to create another underdog franchise. Though not as good as Rocky, it still holds out as an underdog classic.Story follows Daniel, (Ralph Macchio) and his mom, who move to Los Angeles, where he gets into some trouble with some bully karate experts. To gain his respect and his dignity, he gets karate training from the maintenance man at his apartment named Myagi, (Pat Morita).Follows a similar story to Rocky, not completely, but somewhat. Myagi and Mickey, although both mentors, have different characters. Mickey is broken down and grouchy, while Myagi is nice, and polite. All together though, I kind of like Mickey better. Not to say I don't like Myagi, but Mickey is a lot more famous.The relationship between Myagi and Daniel as they spend more time together is really touching. It never says where Daniel's dad is, but for some reasons he's absent. And later in the film, you find out that Myagi's wife died of child birth. So Myagi becomes like a father to Daniel, and Daniel becomes like a son to Myagi.The bad guy, who is the karate expert's sensei, will annoy the heck out of you. He's just so ridiculous and over-the-top. You just want to see him get kicked in the nuts. The performances are pretty decent. Pat Morita as Myagi is definitely the most powerful. Ralph Macchio is all right as Daniel, though he can get on your nerves sometimes. The bullies are just like the sensei, over-the-top and ridiculous.Its kind of a simple story, but its got a lot of emotion in it. Its a classic underdog movie that is loved by many. Not as good as Rocky, but in the end, there about almost even.",

            "content": "I've seen The Karate Kids about ten times since the eighties. I really enjoy the film as it's one of those feel good films America seemed so good at making in the eighties( see also Risky Business and Ferris Bueller's Day Off).The plot, for the few people who haven't seen the film, concerns a kid from New Jersey, Daniel La Russo( Ralph Maccio) who moves with his mother to LA for a better life. Unfortunately he falls foul of a group of school bullies who train at a karate club owned by the ruthless and sinister Sensei Kreese, played by Martin Kove, whose saying is \" an enemy deserves no mercy... mercy is for the weak\". After being savagely beaten by the gang and being aided by the janitor in his apartment block, Mr Miyagi( the late Pat Morita), who is a karate expert, La Russo learns karate and defeats his enemies in a local karate tournament.OK that's the plot out of the way, but watching the film again and enjoying the story, something seems to strike me as odd and sinister about Sensei Kreese, owner of the Cobra Kai dojo, where he trains Daniel's tormentors in a brutal form of karate. Most karate clubs will contain women, families, older people and children in their ranks, but the Cobra Kai is solely made up of 17 and 18 year olds, La Russo's school year, with Johnny, a blonde surfer type played excellently by William Zabka, as Kreese's star pupil. It seems to me Kreese only seems happy around brainwashed teenagers, who seem to fit into some Aryan stereotype, and he is possibly some kind of fascist using karate to create some kind of brutal movement for his own benefit.Anyway conspiracy theory over, and if you watch the second one, Kreese is deserted by his young gang after brutally attacking Johnny and being defeated by Mr Miyagi. If you feel like a feel good film where a good kid overcomes his bullies, falls in love, has an excellent eighties soundtrack featuring British girl group Bananarama, and some good karate fight scenes, including the famous crane technique, you can't go wrong with The Karate Kid. However, treat the sequel with caution as it's not as good and the third one is well below par.",

Watching him tend to his bonsai trees was more entertaining than anything in this yawnfest. A mother drags her teen kid from the east coast to California. Everyone is blonde and pretty, except him. Some stupid ass beats up on him because he's expressed some interest in some girl. As he's being beaten within an inch of his life, the girl and her \"girlfriends\" watch and do nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't need to go on about the plot as I'm sure there are glorious descriptions of it elsewhere. I found this film to be racist, stupid, trite, dumb, boring, pointless and with acting that must be some other kind of job, as I could not discern any acting on the part of anyone except Pat Morita. I have parted company with the individuals I worked for that required me to view this. I was one of the lucky ones who did not succumb to the advertising campaign for this when it first came out and I am also one of the lucky ones who didn't live in a world like the one created in this film, where everyone except the lead boy, his mother, and Pat (and maybe a teacher and stray friend) was pretty!, blonde!, white!

            "content": "The Karate Kid is apparently one of those 80s nostalgia films that have long since transcended the decade and distanced itself quite far from obscurity. This is probably in large part because of the story.Daniel LaRusso (Ralp Maccio making himself prominent in the business for this role but now having disappeared) is kind of a wimpy, insecure teenager from Jersey who moves with his mom to California. This is where he becomes the vulnerable target of a group of karate chopping bullies, The Cobra Kai, headed by Johnny (played by the gorgeous William Zabka in the bully roles he was type casted for in the 80s). (Look for Steve McQueen's son, Chad McQueen as the guy who bounces around a lot before he prepares to fight during competition scenes). But the building super, Mr. Miyagi, an old karate expert from Okanawa, teaches Daniel the essentials of karate to build his body, his mind, and as always, his self-esteem (which also helps him with his pretty girlfriend, Ali Mills, who is played by Elizabeth Shue). Miyagi's teachings are different from the that of the Cobra Kai master (Martin Kove) because Miyagi is teaching something like soul karate to Daniel (to accept himself in order to gain confidence and then work on his fighting technique from there--to keep him from going 'squish, just like grape'), while the Cobra Kai Master instills on his students a philosophy of win at all costs.This is one of the few enjoyable American martial arts movies, let alone martial arts movies in general (for me anways, since I'm a little tired of the repeated story lines of fighters seeking revenge for the death of masters/brothers/fathers/uncles, etc.). Here, you have a teenager who is being hassled. His mentor (Mr. Miyagi played by Pat Morita, a role he was nominated for) is going to help train him to improve his confidence, and soon enough, to become a decent fighter able to compete against the ruthless Cobra Kai (\"show no mercy!\"). You also get a few lessons in traditional (Miyagi) and modern karate (Cobra Kai, other teams at the competition) style in addition to an entertaining story. The follow up movies were for the most part absolute disasters, going with two sequels starring Machio and Morita. Part 2 takes place in Mr. Miyagi's hometown, Okanawa. The third (in which Cobra Kai master, Martin Kove returns) features a new kind of karate nemesis who befriends Daniel, but actually turns out to be in kahootz. Number four, 'The Next Karate Kid,' however, features a female heroine, played by Hilary Swank who is paired up with our old friend, Mr. Miyagi. The first is and always will be the best (and in my opinion, the only one worth watching in its entirety). It was so popular, they even had an NES game for it (I didn't like it much).Albeit corny at times (Maccio comes off as too pathetic in the earlier scenes), 80s fans (especially young girls) should be drawn by the teen cast alone. Ralph Maccio (who was surprisingly older than Zabka at the time) is a charming, though sometimes doofus character. And Johnny is his relentless (and gorgeous) nemesis, as leader of the Cobra Kai (just under his sensai, of course, since they're an organized karate team). This movie is a lot of fun with great fight sequences, a nice story, great music, and a good cast. And, it is extremely 80s. Yet, young audiences can still enjoy it after all these years.",

I even watched the Italian rip-off, KARATE WARRIOR, before I watched this, alongside the Jackie Chan remake. I was worried that all this avoidance would lead to a disappointing viewing experience, but I needn't have worried; THE KARATE KD has retained its charm.It's an '80s-era slice of cheese, a family friendly self improvement/tournament movie which comes across as a kiddie version of KICKBOXER or BEST OF THE BEST. At the film's heart is the well-written relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi, and it makes for plenty of warm and amusing sequences. The extended training sequences are the best thing this film has to offer, that and the surprisingly exciting and hard-hitting action-flavoured climax.Ralph Macchio is fine as the lead character, coming across as likable and streetwise. Pat Morita is also likable enough as Mr. Miyagi, but I wonder what this would have been like with original choice Toshiro Mifune in the role? There are bonus roles for Elizabeth Shue (PIRANHA 3D) as the love interest, the delightfully nasty Martin Kove as a karate instructor, and even Steve McQueen's kid Chad playing a vicious thug. THE KARATE KID certainly isn't a great movie - it has its fair share of flaws, and is pretty dated by modern standards - but it's likable, and that's the key.",

Hollywood has been using the same \"underdog\" formula since film was invented.Not to mention the \"good guy\" always winning regardless of the sport etc he (truthfully they mostly are \"he\") learns in a few months while experts fall in his wake.Kids watch films like this and think they can learn karate/baseball/gridiron/ballet/tennis/quidditch (yeah even that) in a few months/ weeks and beat people who have played for years just because you are the sympathetic underdog who is taught by a master. I bet many parents have got new clean cars and painted fences etc while their kids have thought that's all you needed to do to learn karate (I wouldn't turn down a clean car).Kids think they can poke bullies with a stick and then whine when the bully punches them because the underdog did it and ran away until the bully caught him and punched him - and then the adult male beat up the bully- reality says the adult male would be in jail.Old Myagi says something about a man who can catch flies with chopsticks being able to accomplish anything \u2013 yet there he is a janitor. I guess Bill Gates caught a few flies with chopsticks in his time. The constant reminders that Asian people love bonsai, use chopsticks, drink sake, live in Japanese looking houses even in America and are experts at karate also show the age of this stereotyping movie.This film is made for kids and sadly teaches kids bad lessons (which they will learn in less than a few months and beat experts at of course).",

            "content": "This movie sucks, and it sucks big time. I don't care if it is supposed to be a cult movie. Nor do I care if many people love it. It is just stupid and overrated. And this, my friends, is not my opinion. It is just pure and simple FACT. That is right. That is what I wrote. Whoever liked this movie is just wrong. I don't know what would you like in it. The karate is pathetic. The story is ridiculous. The moral is absurd.Now I am going to write a few SPOILERS here, so feel free to skip my review if you haven't seen the movie.First, you see the newcomer in town - the new kid in the school - getting beaten on a regular basis by the Evil Bully - the black belt owner. The reason? Daniel LaRusso interfered in an argument between The Bully and his ex girlfriend. Why? Because he was stupid. What kind of an idiot would interfere into an argument between a girl he has met just a few minutes ago and a totally unknown boy? What kind of an idiot would start a fight with another idiot who is obviously able to crush him like a bug? I mean, Daniel was as skinny as a toothpick and had no fighting experience at all. The Evil Bully was a leader of a bikers' gang - and you can't be a leader of a bikers' gang if you can't fight. If Daniel was not as as dumb as something very, very dumb he would have figured that out. He should have had also figured out that by interfering in their argument he can only make things worse for both of them. How would you feel if you were arguing with your ex and some total stranger interfered? Daniel should have shown some respect to Ali and let her solve her problems with the boy without getting in her way.Second, after the beach incident he became the school wimp. Now tell me, do you really think that the most popular cheer leader in the school would show any sympathy to the school wimp? Would she like him? Even if she liked him would she show it? You know the answer. The answer is: \"NO!\" No 16 year old girl would risk her reputation because of the school wimp. Not a single one, especially if the school wimp is a total stranger to everybody in the town.Third, Daniel pretended to know karate from the beginning of the movie. You saw him opening a door with a pathetic excuse of a \"karate\" kick. I liked to do that too... When I was 5. When I was 16 I already knew that if I say that I can fight and I can't I would get beaten by some bully. I knew that if I pretended to know something that I don't know the result would be devastating to me. Keep in mind that Daniel was not a normal teenager. His mother was single. He was the man in the house so he should have been more experienced than I was at that age. But he was not. He was stupid.Now let's talk about martial arts.First, you do remember the sensei of the Evil Bully, do you? The guy who liked to say \"The Enemy Deserves No Mercy!!! ARGH!!!\" Let me tell you one thing. No sensei would keep their dojo if they teach their students like that. Fact. Especially if they teach in a small town where everybody knows everybody. Do you think any parent would let their kids study with a man who turns them into criminals? If you do, then you are just wrong, sorry.Second, there was Miyagi... Who was as much of a karate instructor as the school janitor was. He didn't teach Daniel how to fight. He told him how to wash cars. He trained him to paint fences. He showed him how to dance before the sunset. Do you think that is the way to learn karate? If it was that easy the painters would be the best fighters in the world... However Daniel became an equal fighter to the black belt owners just in two months. That would make any martial artist in the world very angry. You know, it is IMPOSSIBLE for anybody to earn a black belt in just two months. Even if you practice 25 hours a day you just can't do it. Even if you are a God of Karate you can't do it. Yet Daniel did it in just two months washing cars\u0085 Do you know how many kids start visiting martial arts classes because of movies like this? Because of movies showing martial arts as something you can master in a few months. After the kids see that it is actually very hard to earn a black belt and in two months they have learned absolutely nothing they quit the dojo disappointed and with low spirits. Which is actually quite dangerous and that is another reason for me to hate the movie.What is the moral of the movie? Here it is:You don't need to think. You don't have to be smart. You may be a stupid wimp and a poser and people will like you because you are The Protagonist in the movie. You don't have to put any effort if you want to learn something. You don't even have to practice the thing that you want to learn. But you will succeed just because you are The Protagonist of the movie. You will become equal to people who have worked hard for many years because they are Bad and you are Good.END OF THE SPOILERS.The movie probably works as pure entertainment. But you can find better entertainment with another movie \u2013 movie with a better story and a better moral.",

Basically Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio) and his mother Lucille (Randee Heller) have moved from New Jersey to California because of the mother's new job. At his new school, Daniel gets himself into fights with bullies, mainly because he tries to date Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue), and he has no fighting experience. The person who may be able to help him defend himself better, or just help him with his little love of karate, is local handyman Mr. Kesuke Miyagi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), who used to be a karate trainer. For a while, he just makes him do cleaning and painting, e.g. \"Wax on, wax off\" for the car, Daniel then puts these hand and arm movements into use when Miyagi tries to fight. The bullies still bother Daniel though, and a situation arises where Miyagi and other the karate trainer agree to have Daniel and the main bully fight in a karate tournament. Daniel of course does very well, and even with the leg injury towards the end, you knew he had to win, and you had to see Miyagi nodding with a smile. Also starring Martin Kove as John Kreese, William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence, Ron Thomas as Bobby Brown, Rob Garrison as Tommy, Chad McQueen as Dutch, Tony O'Dell as Jimmy, Israel Juarbe as Freddy Fernandez and William Bassett as Mr. Mills.

To me, some \"good\" films may actually be a load of rubbish as people have different opinions with what they see. In the whole the film is too much of a challenge being mostly \"romantic\" without featuring much karate to see on and having watched it once or twice made me feel a bit desperate in wanting it to end quickly that I don't see the point in viewing further Karate Kid films. The casting of Ralph Machoo as a \"kid\" regardless of how young he seems to look was ridiculous as he was actually 23 years old at the time this was premiered yet he was to continue making further Karate Kid films until he was approaching his thirties.

It was refreshing to see this movie again as it has been released on Blu-ray this year (2010). It makes you feel like a kid again! There are some scenes where it seems outdated; but the universal story of the underdog standing up to his bullies, still holds up strong after all these years.After watching this movie again, I really appreciate & admire Pat Morita's character even more! It's the classic bond of an everyday ordinary old man who becomes more than just a sensei to Ralpha Macchio; but also a teacher, a mentor, but most importantly, a dear friend.I saw the remake version of the new Karate Kid and they pay multiple homage to this original film.

The mystical character, Mr. Miyagi, is haunted by his wife and baby, whom he lost during WWII. This really expands the role of mystical character and breaks the stereotype that goes with it. As we see the weaknesses of Miyagi, the strength of his bond with Daniel, the karate kid, shines through. This bond is really what carries this movie. Another strength of this movie is in Daniel's actual training. At the time of the movie this was a shock and awe sequence because Daniel and the audience were led to believe that he was doing something completely different than Karate training. Many films have used blueprint since. The score of Bill Conti takes the movie's climax one step above and the direction by John Avildsen gives the movie the same feel as 'Rocky'.",

As expected, Daniel is not crazy about starting a new life across the country, having to say goodbye to all of his friends and everything. Once they reach their destination, Daniel meets up with some people his age and they go to the beach. It does not take long for Daniel to find trouble. He has an encounter with Johnny Lawrence after the latter gets into an argument with his ex-girlfriend, Ali. The problem is that Johnny knows karate, and proceeds to triumph over Daniel.After the beach incident, Johnny and his pals continue to harass Daniel. While all of this is going on, he begins to develop a relationship with Ali. Not only that, he strikes a friendship with Mr. Miyagi, the handyman at Daniel's apartment building.Miyagi comes to Daniel's aid one night when Johnny and his group surround Daniel and beat him up. Miyagi, who is experienced in karate, defeats all of the boys in no time. This leads to Daniel asking Miyagi for assistance in dealing with his enemies.The duo go to the karate school where Johnny and company train, the Cobra Kai dojo. Once they enter the building, they see why the students are like they are: Their sensei, John Kreese. Kreese is a hardcore type, who believes that anyone you encounter in karate is an enemy. The two sides discuss the matter, and it is agreed that Daniel will enter the local karate tournament, where several Cobra Kai students will be competing as well. How will Daniel fare in the tournament? Will the Cobra Kai dojo win? John G. Avildsen directed this underdog movie, which is familiar territory for him (he was the director of Rocky). Like Rocky, Avildsen knows how get the audience to sympathize with Daniel. Robert Mark Kamen wrote the screenplay, and from watching this movie, you will have a liking or disliking for each character. The casting is also very good. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita give good performances here (and Morita has his share of funny moments), and Elisabeth Shue is fine as Ali. Martin Kove, who played Kreese, is perfect as the villainous sensei.This is a movie that anyone can enjoy. It would make for a good choice for family movie night. Watch it, it's a good one.",

The initial dispute erupts at a beach party when Daniel strikes up a conversation with Ali, the cute blonde, unbeknownst to her past boyfriend and its problems. Soon enough, Johnny and the gang show up uninvited stirring up trouble. Daniel tries to help Ali as he sees her struggling with the annoying Johnny, and wounds up receiving a good beating in return.Later, Daniel moves in for revenge as he sets up Johnny by spraying water from hose onto the Badboy's head, causing Johnny to seek him out with his gang, and the vicious crew tear Daniel up with ferocity, almost leaving the poor kid critically injured. But, Daniel's good friend, Mr. Miyagi rescues him, and the training begins.End of spoilersThe Karate Kid is a very good, solid moving film with subtle touches of humor, some excitement, but mostly important character development that helps the film feel realistic, aside the stationed grand finale that pits Daniel against the gang, something that marked the movie's popularity...Daniel vs. Johnny, as seen in the final chapter of the DVD.Everyone should see the Karate Kid for its significant values of life, respect, and the traditions of friendship, something that will never grow old.",

            "content": "I saw this movie scheduled for an evening showing on Turner Classics last night and something compelled me to watch it even though I saw it when it first came out and still pretty much remembered the story. It seems a lot more simplistic now compared to what might be produced today, probably due to the fact that I'm twenty five years older now, and one's problems rarely get solved as effectively in two months time as they do here. But that shouldn't be read as a negative, I think there's some value in the story's themes of persistence and honor, and staying true to your goal even when that's a scary prospect.I think the picture would have worked with any young actor in the Danny LaRusso role, but the presence of Pat Morita in the picture was an inspired decision. Known primarily as the second Arnold from the 'Happy Days' TV series, Morita brings a solid presence to the story as the wise and benevolent father figure for Ralph Macchio's character. Blending humor with martial arts, the picture subtly explores the importance of repetition and discipline for developing control and power. It pays off in the tournament finale when Danny gains the Valley Championship along with his self respect.I know many will find fault with the idea that Danny could actually beat a competitor who has trained for many years, but that's not the point. If you're going to have a movie where the underdog overcomes his challenges and grows as a person, you wind up with a product like \"The Karate Kid\". A more realistic film would have Danny get his butt kicked in the championship round, but then you have a story without a moral, and who wants to see that?",

Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue, and others became household names and the director of this movie, the late John Avildsen, needed a new hit after his succesful Rocky movie changed sports movies forever. Add to that a great soundtrack, and you've got the recipe for a great 80s movie that can be watched over and over again.

            "content": "John G. Avildsen directs yet another underdog \"rags-to-riches\" kind of story, much like he did with the 'Rocky' films, 'Lean On Me', and '8 Seconds'. This time, the film tells the tale of a New Jersey teenager, Daniel LaRusso, who reluctantly moves with his mother to sunny California. Of course, he is an impatient and impractical smartmouth, but the real Daniel - the Daniel that's actually tolerable, is not far beneath his rough exterior. Due to his new kid status, he is bullied by the Cobra Kai, an overly aggressive group of teenage boys that are obsessed with using their own form of karate on their weaker 'inferiors'. Daniel also takes a liking to Ali, who is of course the former girlfriend of the Cobra Kai's leader. Amidst all this, he befriends the handy man at his apartment building, a Mr. Miyagi. Like everyone else, Daniel at first underestimates Miyagi. Over the course of the film, we learn that Miyagi is really a very wise man who knows a lot about karate - the less aggressive and more genuine kind. The Cobra Kai continues to torture Daniel, and he finally convinces Mr. Miyagi to teach him the ways of the ancient art. But it is not just about getting back at his tormentors - Miyagi teaches him to use karate as a way to discover himself, as well as learning about honor, responsibility, and the like. While I would agree that the film is predictable, and Daniel could get on anyone's nerves, the true magic of the story is Morita's performance as the wise handy-man/karate instructor. Rather than just come swooping in at exactly the right time to save Daniel's sorry butt, we meet him as a handy-man first, and therefore learn about him as a person before putting him into hero situations. His performance makes Daniel tolerable, because without Miyagi, I don't think anybody could stand Daniel. Morita earned an Oscar nomination for the film, and while it was highly deserved, I can't really say whether he should have won because I don't know what his competition for the award was in 1984, without researching it. However, it cannot be denied that he displayed masterful acting talent, and the only element that made the unnecessary and very repetitive sequels watchable.",

Well the maintenance guy turns out to be a rather good karate teacher and thus the teacher pupil relationship is born and the kid even is able to build a relationship with the cute girl.

            "content": "Daniel LaRusso, a teenage boy, moves with his mother (presumably divorced, although this is never made clear) from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles. At first Daniel finds it difficult to make friends at his new school, but he eventually finds an attractive girlfriend named Ali. In doing so, however, he makes an enemy of Ali's jealous ex-boyfriend, Johnny, who never loses an opportunity to bully and torment Daniel, often with his friends joining in. To make matters worse, Johnny is a skilled student of karate, so Daniel decides he needs to study the martial arts himself in order to defend himself against Johnny and his gang of bullies. Fortunately, Daniel has befriended Mr. Miyagi, the elderly Japanese-American handyman in his apartment block, who just happens to be an expert karate practitioner. \"The Karate Kid\" can be interpreted in a number of different ways, largely because it borrows from so many different film genres. On an obvious level it is a martial arts movie. On an equally obvious level it is a high school drama, with stock characters drawn from just about every American high school film you've ever seen; Johnny, in particular, fits the \"arrogant jock\" stereotype, and his one-time girlfriend Ali is, of course, a cheerleader. On the other hand, it is also an \"underdog\" sporting drama similar to \"Rocky\" which was made by the same director John G. Avildsen. Finally, it can also (like a lot of martial arts dramas) be seen as a philosophical, quasi-religious allegory of good against evil. Daniel and Johnny have essentially learned the same fighting skills, but they have done so from teachers with quite different philosophies of life. Johnny's teacher, John Kreese, is significantly not an ethnic Japanese or even an Asian, even though he refers to his school by the Japanese term \"dojo\" and insists that his students call him \"sensei\" (Japanese for \"teacher\"). He is a white American and an Army veteran whose philosophy is based around strength and aggression. He essentially sees karate as a more efficient way of beating people up, and encourages his students to think in the same way. Concepts such as mercy, compassion and the peaceful resolution of disputes are quite alien to him. Miyagi, by contrast, is kindly and humble, believing that one should only use force as a last resort. To him studying the martial arts is not about making oneself a more efficient fighting machine but has more to do with harmony, balance and self-discipline. The final showdown between Daniel and Johnny, therefore, when they meet in the final of a local karate tournament, is as much a clash of two philosophies as a clash of two adversaries. Like many \"underdog\" films this one is both shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental. It is, for example, unrealistic to suppose that Danny would have any hope of defeating Johnny- bigger, stronger and with a lot more previous experience of the sport- in the final of the tournament, but of course he does. (Thereby going one better than Rocky, who lost his big fight, albeit narrowly). Its sentimentality lies in its black-and-white view of morality; it goes out of its way to build Daniel and Miyagi up as the good guys and Kreese and Johnny as the bad guys. Johnny might have the partial excuse that he has been led astray by an older man who should have known better; no such excuse is available to Kreese. This favourable view of a Japanese character was perhaps unusual in the Hollywood of the eighties, a decade in which there was a lot of anti- Japanese feeling in America, mostly rooted in trade rivalry. (This feeling is perhaps reflected in some other films from the period such of \"Woman of Valor\", one of the few traditional war films of the period, in which the Japanese are very much the villains). Even so, the scriptwriters were careful to give Miyagi a distinguished war record with the US Army in World War II, even though Pat Morita would only have been nine years old at the time of Pearl Harbor. I also found myself wondering whether (1) a first-generation Japanese immigrant in the forties would have been eligible for US citizenship or service in the US armed forces and (2) whether someone whose English-language skills are so poor could ever have been promoted to Sergeant. Quibbles like these, however, were obviously less important than the message the film-makers were trying to get across, namely that Japanese people can be good guys- provided they are also patriotic Americans. There are other plot holes; it is never, for example, explained how Miyagi, who presumably only earns a modest salary as a handyman, acquired his collection of valuable vintage cars. Overall, however, \"The Karate Kid\" is a reasonably good example of the sentimental feelgood genre, largely because of the standards of acting. Morita earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (losing to another Asian actor, Haing S Ngor in \"The Killing Fields\"), and Ralph Macchio makes Daniel an engaging and likable young hero. Martin Kove is also good as the brutal, cynical Kreese, although the character struck me as being too close for comfort to the stereotypical view of the Vietnam veteran which prevailed in the eighties. Despite its theme of two conflicting philosophies of life there is nothing particularly profound about the film, but it makes for entertaining viewing. It may be shamelessly unrealistic and shamelessly sentimental, but it is also shamelessly effective. 6/10",

These mindsets themselves are not only indicative of the two most common uses for karate, the offensive sport versus the defensive art, but also an incredibly common opposing take on the world, wherein 'good vs evil' isn't boiled down to its most black and white of interpretations but is instead seen through the way we navigate our lives and treat those that aren't ourselves. Indeed, this central conflict is one of the most realistic and universal in all of film, a battle often seen but not often portrayed with such a clarity and, frankly, nuance, even though it is somewhat pushed to the background and has to be ever-so-slightly read from in-between the lines. The shades of grey that paint the piece aren't always so evident or 'lived up to', in the way that the 80s styling is bound to have aged and so is some of the mentality to a minor extent, but it is always present and, actually, always of a very high-quality. Even the bully, who would normally be the definite villain and does make some cruel decisions (even nearly killing our hero at one point), is drawn with a deft hand that shows him to be a human only as flawed as the hero, who is himself an arrogant and impressionable adolescent. The two provoke each other almost as much as one another, both making similar mistakes but having those filtered through their differing mindsets. The feature's philosophy of 'no bad students, only bad teachers' is especially apparent when the real villain of the piece, the Cobra Kai sensei, is shown to be the one who is corrupting the mind of all the antagonistic teens. The depth of the picture actually stretches to its depiction of its core martial art, too, because it gets a lot of its ideals and principles correct while also portraying the physical side with a lot more accuracy than normal. Though some of it can seem a little dated or just plain off - especially when the 'masters' use it or it's taught through dubious methods, it is actually evocative of the home-town taught variant that would be used by normal people, instead of the Jet Li or Jackie Chan superstars, and definitely fits with the amateur tournament at the end, while still feeling dangerous and properly weighty. The flick is downright entertaining, on top of all that. Its a fun, and at times genuinely funny, film with an important message and a well-developed screenplay that dives into philosophy in an accessible way. It's one of the best films of its decade and has ascended into pop-culture for good reason. 8/10",

A kids movie and I'm sorry, but the main character is just way too wimpy not only in his appearance, but with his \"Oh please, don't hurt me\" attitude thru the whole movie. Only time he showed some moxie was when he got angry about fixing up Miyagi's house and cars. He should have really transformed in the movie from a scared kid to a different person entirely having an inner strength and resolve gained from Miyagi's influence and gentle guidance. Sorry, but some other young actor could have been a better choice, along with some better writing and direction. I am only giving it a 3.",

            "content": "I saw this movie back in the 80's and really liked it at the time. I just watched it again today and found that it still had the same appeal. In some ways that's kind of strange. The story doesn't have all that much going for it. It's entirely predictable. Daniel is a high school kid who has to move cross country from New Jersey to California against his will. He doesn't fit in, and makes the mistake of hitting on Ali - the ex-girlfriend of the high school tough guy Johnny. She actually likes him, but Johnny doesn't take too kindly to the situation and he and his buddies from a local karate school set out to make Daniel's life a living hell. It's a movie about bullies - but it's also a movie about overcoming bullies - because in steps Mr. Miyagi.Miyagi is played by Pat Morita. Morita over the years was a very busy actor, and a very good actor. I probably know him best as \"Arnold\" - the drive-in owner on the TV series \"Happy Days.\" But if Morita had an iconic role, it surely had to be as \"Mr. Miyagi\" in \"The Karate Kid\" and its sequels. He was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his role in this first of the series, and while Daniel was the central character, and so Ralph Macchio the star, for me at least this movie revolved around Miyagi. Miyagi was a fascinating character: the handyman at the apartment complex where Daniel and his mom live who also takes on the role of Daniel's karate teacher when he discovers that Daniel is being beaten up. In fact, it's probably fair to say that Miyagi becomes almost a surrogate father to Daniel. The layers of Miyagi's life get slowly peeled away. Handyman and bonsai trimmer; karate expert; widowed when his wife and baby son died in an internment camp during childbirth; US Army World War II veteran; winner of the Award of Valor. Morita plays Miyagi as a gentle, thoughtful man - even a broken man who's never come to terms with the deaths of his wife and son, but one who's also tough as nails, and who's fiercely loyal to Daniel. Watching the relationship between Daniel and Miyagi grow makes this movie worth watching on its own. He teaches Daniel about karate (the purpose of karate is not so you can fight, but so you don't have to fight) but he also teaches Daniel about life, and perhaps even about love - because, yes, there is the requisite love story in this as Daniel and Ali (Elisabeth Shue) also see their relationship grow.Everyone else in the movie was fine. I didn't think there were any real weak spots in the performances. The weakness of the movie was just in the basic story, which is entirely predictable and formulaic (although it does manage to mix in some gentle humour every now and then) and in the fact that some of the characters were quite simplistic and one dimensional - especially Kreese (Martin Kove), the teacher at the karate dojo where Johnny and his friends train, who comes across as the epitome of evil all the way through. It's not that Kreese can't get his students under control. It's that he wants them to destroy Daniel. He has none of Miyagi's feelings for the more philosophical underpinnings of karate. \"Strike first, strike hard, no mercy\" is his only creed. Basically, what you get with \"The Karate Kid\" is \"Rocky\" with teenagers (well, Macchio and Shue were both in their early 20's actually, although they did come across realistically as teenagers) and karate - which probably shouldn't be any surprise. Both movies are underdog movies, and both were directed by John G. Avildsen.This movie has its weaknesses, and this movie has its strengths. Most of all, though - this movie has Pat Morita, in what was probably his best and most remembered role. (7/10)",

How a unlikly friendship leads to self-confidence aswell as trust and understanding that triumf everything. Pat and Ralph does an amazing job portraying the characters, their chemistry is pure magic.\nAll actors did an amazing job and I can't find anything to complain about. The perfect soundtrack today takes you away back to the 80s both with it's beautyful instrumental sound aswell as the 80s pop songs.\nThis is a pure classic and none should miss it.

This movie illustrated for me the difference between the way a man perceives a situation and the way a woman does, because if I remember correctly, my friend thought Daniel was asking for it by messing with the Cobra Kai boys, and I was all caught up in the romance thing between Daniel and Allie.  Mars and Venus for sure.  LOLNow that I'm 38 instead of 19, I can see my friend's point, although I also got some help from some of the people who've posted here saying that Daniel was a little weasel who deserved getting his butt kicked hourly.  LOL However, I have *always* found the idea of someone learning enough karate in a few weeks' time to win a regional championship a little far-fetched.  And I thought both Miyagi and Kreese were fashioned into caricatures -- it wasn't necessary to make them into stereotypes of Inscrutable Japanese Wise One and Embittered Vietnam Vet Badass for them to be effective characters.The message that karate is for defense, not intimidation, was valuable, but since Daniel spent so much time engaging in behavior that was sure to antagonize his tormentors, it's hard to avoid concluding that he was actually intimidating them, albeit indirectly.",

What made those films (that centered round teenagers) particularly outstanding was that they weren't dominated by clich\u00e9d themes like sex (which became the only thing most Hollywood teenfilms dealt with post 'American Pie'). 'The Karate Kid' really captures the awkwardness of adolescence: the need for identity, dating, growing up etc. It also does a good job of presenting the philosophy behind karate and that it's not about violence at all. The best moments are Macchio's sequences with Morita, Shue and Heller. The mother-son bond is depicted wonderfully without the usual clich\u00e9s. What appears on screen looks very natural. Similarly, the romance is portrayed with innocence and sincerity. And, last but not least, the master and apprentice sequences are delightful and endearing. The fight sequences were great. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita are excellent. Elisabeth Shue and Randee Heller provide brilliant support.Avildsen's film is a charming entertainer. 'Felt good to revisit it after years.",

For me the best ones involve Mr Miyagi. His friendship with Daniel LaRusso has a great dynamic and is a solid example of a surrogate father/son relationship on screen.As a sporting drama, John G. Avildsen captures the spirit of his previous success with Rocky. In fact The Karate Kid feels almost like Rocky aimed at a younger audience. The fight scenes are choreographed well, Ralph Macchio has a charisma not unlike Sly Stallone, it has cool training montages, awkward romantic moments and a spectacularly uplifting conclusion.Visually it is very 80s in fashion and loaded with east meets west symbolism. The cinematography is striking at times with a lovely blend of landscapes, people and action shots. The opening shots set the scene well for the story to be nicely told by effective camerawork and great editing.The soundtrack is mostly good, as there is some music that works fantastically well, such as Bill Conti's original score and some of the pop songs like 'You're the best', but I think generally the use of pop music is overdone.Macchio does a great job in the title role and makes the character, who for me is written as a bit of an annoying mummy's boy, quite likeable.Elizabeth Shue is great as the down-to-Earth love interest from a wealthy family and likewise William Zabka as the main antagonist.Pat Morita is by some distance the star of the show giving a lovable performance as Mr Myagi. He convincingly portrays humour, wisdom, eastern philosophy, paternal instincts, strength and warmth within one memorable character. It is a role that mostly fits the description of a 'magical non-white' trope, but it could be argued that as we learn more about Miyagi's backstory, it is as much about his arc is it is Daniel. Most importantly, this little standup comic turned actor actually made me believe he was a karate master.",

To say the least, it holds up very well. One of the things people never bothered to mention when they praised this movie in the following decades is how good Ralph Macchio's acting was. To say the least, he was very convincing as Daniel Larusso.As for the movie, it's clear that its creation was inspired by the success of movies such as Rocky where the underdog overcomes many obstacles to triumph. Since Macchio is so likeable in his role, the audience can sympathize with his predicament and cheer when he finally proves himself as a champion. The movie also paces itself very well, allowing the kid's relationship to mature naturally with his sensei to a point that we, as viewers, truly believe that the seisei and the student truly loved one another. The film was made at a time when filmmakers didn't feel the need to constantly bombard their customers with explosions and one-liners because their attention span was higher and even thirty-six years later, the story doesn't suffer for it.My only gripe is the ending and especially how producers of the Cobra Kai series and the sequels seemed to forget what happened. The opponent essentially congratulates the victor despite his disappointment at losing which makes a viewer wonder how there could have been any kind of hatred between the two going forward from that moment. An extra five minutes of film would also have been nice, showing Daniel enjoy his victory, thank his sensei and kiss the girl. Of course, few movies are perfect and hence, I felt obligated to dock a point.",

It is not only possible, it has even been done. The lesson here is that the Cobra Kai dojo are teaching karate the wrong way, that karate is more than just a way to beat people up: it is a kind of meditation, if you like; and if you have not grasped this essential, advancement above the lower stages of the sport is impossible.This film is good by itself, but is even better as an introduction to the rest of the series.",

            "content": "\"The Karate Kid\" is more than just a teen movie or a blockbuster classic; I would go as far as saying that it's a lesson of life.Let me explain... the movie centers around a young teen named Daniel Larusso who fits perfectly in the \"un-cool\" category. His mom drives him to his dates, he is a total ass when it comes to flirting, he is a mess on clothes, etc. Overall his a bag of bones.And worst of all, he's a potential victim for bullies in school (oh, what would junior high and high school be without them?). Soon after the situation gets really difficult, he seeks the aid of a Japanese karate master who happens to be his next door neighbor. This man, named Mr. Miyagi who owns a dojo, teaches Daniel that karate is not only for kicking asses; but it's a matter of spirituality and more. Daniel soon finds out that karate made his life better but it couldn't happen without Mr. Miyagi's help. He's some sort of his spiritual master. They start a friendship that breaks all frontiers and the result is a new life for Daniel. A tender relationship by the way.There are some classic scenes in the movie like when Daniel is attacked at the Halloween party, or when he wins the tournament with the infamous \"Gruya\" movement in the final match. An excellent movie for all ages that should be watched by those who think karate is only for \"cool\" purposes or self-defense. It's an art.Pat Morita steals the show as the wise, tender, and lonely Mr. Miyagi. Ralph Macchio is perfect as the whinny, cry baby that suddenly changes for good and demonstrates strong character. Elisabeth Shue is smokin' hot and looks cute whenever she's reacquired to. Martin Kove is a great villain and also steals the show. A very good movie that shouldn't have sequels but that's a different story.",

Coming into this I had only seen the 2010 remake, therefore I did know what was coming in certain points. Still, the plot is interesting and holds a positive message.I would say the run time is longer than I would've chosen, I feel they could've shaved a bit off and not have taken so long to get to the karate event itself. It builds up fairly slowly, meaning the opening 40 minutes are less interesting - to me, anyway. The rest is good fun though.I definitely sensed the 'Rocky' influence, particularly in Ralph Macchio's acting. He reminded me of Sylvester Stallone from the aforementioned film, in terms of the acting perhaps not being anything incredible but there being the required amount of likability and glimpses of hidden talent. Macchio (Daniel) is very good here, as is Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) of course.Onto the sequels!",

            "content": "It looked as if director John G. Avildsen wanted to remake his movie (Rocky - 1976), however with teen Italian lead, gorgeous Adrianna, and Miyagi instead of Mickey!But it turned out to be totally another thing of its own, which also had success and turned into franchise. You can follow that \"karate\" success, and its influence on other movies of the same era, through (The Last Dragon - 1985), (No Retreat, No Surrender - 1986), or even (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - 1990).Though, (The Karate Kid) will live longer. Defining the reason why could be hard in a movie that has nearly all the right ingredients. But I can see it simply. It's considerably that script.Scriptwriter Robert Mark Kamen made brilliant and balanced mix of martial arts, romance and drama. And showed a right way for how the unoriginal underdog story could be excellently recycled to be original apart.And if the script was the movie's crown, then this crown's jewel should be the strong characterization, especially of the unforgettable mentor; Mr. Miyagi. He's not the wicked Japanese only, but also an old soldier, who had his wife and son killed, as we knew in a brief yet fine scene when he was excessively drinking. So he is a wounded man who hates violence, misses his family, and above all is not perfect; living lonely, trying to find balance in his life. And he finally has the chance to be a father of Daniel, as a substitute for his late son, noticing the absence of Daniel's father too, where they become the best of friends.Hence, it's more than just a relationship of a green karate student with an experienced instructor; it's a tale of a son who meets his lost father, father who meets his lost son, and 2 friends who positively affect each other's life for good, so the human, plus the karate, lessons unfold. Ahh, could you name one of today's made-for-teens movies, that has human characters, pains, and lessons?! I don't think so!Moreover, that certain \"reestablishment\" in the character of the Japanese on the American big screen; to be as nothing of its antecedents, and maybe the most important accomplishment done by such a movie. Pat Morita as Kesuke Miyagi was a very belated sorry for Hollywood's long history of dealing with the Asian people through the worst stereotypes and clich\u00e9s ever.Look at the nationalities of the bullied humble characters as the minority of USA, then look at the bully, not honorable at all, WASP wealthy brats; and you'll understand that it isn't just another repeated story about ordinary conflict between 2 guys over one girl. This is how this movie guarantees depth, cause, and numerous viewings.Director John G. Avildsen made it sentimentally wonderful. It's clear how he loved the story, creating it as aesthetical, enjoyable and warm as well. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita's chemistry was flawless. They both did top-notch. However, my higher appreciation must go to Morita, who marvelously proved that he wasn't yet another comedian, as everybody thought at the moment. And how can I forget Elisabeth Shue; I bet she was, still is, every boy's dream!Now, after many virtues, let's see the vices. First off, I didn't like it when the lead showed up at the amusement arcade and his girl was angry of him! It's supposed to be the opposite; as she was the one who didn't come to the last date, and she was the one in other person's arms, so she was the one who should apologize, not him!!For more essential vices, the end was very fast. The competition has been briefed in one pop song like a MTV music video. Not to mention the easiness of it, where the magic of Miyagi's hands does all the wonder. That's all. And, accordingly, they're too little vices.(The Karate Kid) is one in a decade movie. It has every boy's favorite story, mentor, and girl, all made in a very effective way, which clicked at the moment, and still does.",

Daniel catches the eye of a humble rich girl and bad blood is formed from the other envious rich boys. Mr. Miyagi begins to teach Daniel karate in highly unorthodox methods. So much so Daniel almost quits until Mr. Miyagi reveals how much he has actually learned. Of course the rich kids are really good at karate so it's a no-brainer they'll be a showdown at the karate tournament so the audience can cheer for the underdog and the obstacles he must overcome. Will he win and teach the bad boys about morals at the same time? The several memorable scenes still hold up today. In between are standard 80s movie lackluster cinematography.

            "review_title": "A bit cheesy in an '80s kind of way, but still good fun",
            "content": "The 1980s are equally lauded and criticized for giving birth to \"high concept\" movies, i.e. star-carried films, mostly confined to a specific genre (comedy and action, preferably), with a plot that can be summarized in thirty seconds or less. The culmination of that cinematic \"current\" was Top Gun, on which Jerry Bruckheimer built an entire career based on high-concept hits. Most of these films are still enjoyable, but some, including Gun, haven't dated that well after two decades or so. The Karate Kid is no exception: no one would produce it today. Still, the film is actually quite amusing and, in one scene at least, oddly moving.Using high-concept rules, the plot would be summed up like this: nerdy kid becomes a hero by learning karate. The nerdy kid in question is Daniel Larusso (Ralph Macchio), who has just moved from New Jersey to California with his mother. He instantly finds a soul-mate in Ali Mills (Elizabeth Shue), the kind of girl all guys would like to date, and is repeatedly brutalized by her ex-boyfriend Johnny because of the bond between them. Daniel decides to take karate lessons to get even, only to discover the local dojo is run by a glory-obsessed mad-man, whose students include Johnny and all of the latter's friends. When all hope seems to be lost, help comes in the most unlikely shape: Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), Daniel's gentle, plant-loving neighbor and, allegedly, martial arts champion. His peculiar technique consists of four simple words: \"Wax on\u0085 wax off\".It is easy to see why John G. Avildsen, director of Oscar-winner Rocky, accepted to do this film: like Sylvester Stallone's breakthrough, it's the story of an underdog who tries to get to the top \u0096 not for money, but so that he will feel better as a person. Sure, Daniel's bizarre training can easily be mistaken for a spoof of Rocky's more conventional montage, but there is an odd poignancy to those moments, especially when the superb Pat Morita (who was Oscar-nominated for the role of Miyagi) is on screen: elusive, brilliant and, in a scene where he remembers his late wife, touchingly vulnerable, he embodies all the preconceived ideas one might have of a martial arts instructor but manages to go beyond a mere caricature. Macchio is similarly convincing, although his scenes with Shue suffer from an 80's cheesiness (mostly as far as the music is concerned) that robs the movie of the sincere romance that made Rocky a hit.So yes, this is a picture that looked great in 1984 and lost some of its charm as the years went by. And yes, it is true that neither Macchio nor Morita will ever be remembered for anything else. But hey, why hold that against them? Flawed or not, The Karate Kid is good fun. Heck, it even made a catchphrase of something as silly as \"wax on\u0085 wax off\". It can't be entirely bad, then, can it?",

Sorry, that argument is quite trite.

My favorite character is Miyagi, because you don't expect this little, old man to be able to not old defend himself, but beat up a lot of bullies along the way. Plus, he is so funny in how he trains Daniel and just his overall personality. My favorite scenes are the training scenes, where Miyagi uses basic household chores to train Daniel, which confuses him. These are funny scenes, but at the same time, it is great how they will eventually tie in the training concepts with Daniel. This is a great example of someone who needs to prove to themselves and others that they have a great deal of inner strength. The storyline of this movie is phenomenal and there is a great amount of action in it as well. The cast does a great job and really give great performances that make them seem so believable. This is a fantastic family film and even though it's almost 30 years old, the story still holds strong today.

When Danny gets on the wrong side of Johnny and his Karate thugs, things start to look grim for La Russo, until he meets Mr. Myagi.These type of movies are usually aimed at the young, however this is not an action film, nor a teen flick.

He is the father Danny never had, as well as being a great friend, teacher and mentor. And as Daniel La Russo, Ralph Macchio is competent and plays his frustrated 16 year old well.

            "content": "Back in Newark, New Jersey, Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) was the top of the food chain in his school. But luck would have it, when his mother got a new job in California and now Daniel has to start from the bottom. He's now become an instant social outcast and seems mystified as to why the students behave the way they do as he tries to blend in with the others. He appears to have a bit of a tough streak in him, but when he gets into an entanglement with the toughest bullies, he now feels he is totally out of his league. His anger and his determination are his defensive weapons when the going got tough, which at the same time was his downside as well as he becomes a prey to these goons. The wounds don't heal any faster as one of the goon's ex-girlfriend starts to show affection towards Daniel. It does however, adds the dramatic effect toward the tough Jersey teen.One night, while the goons are chasing after Daniel, and they beat the living daylights out of him, the handyman from Daniel's apartment steps up and defends Daniel against these punks and takes them down easily because they are just thugs with no form of training. The handyman's name is Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) and after seeing such a sight, Daniel asks Miyagi if he could train him to fight like him. Very reluctant at first, fearing that Daniel will want to use his skills for vanity purposes and that there is more to karate than just whipping butt and gaining recognition. This is where we get to the meat of the story after we just finished slurping the soup as we now see the movie shift gears from a high-school drama Hallmark Channel schmaltz into a compelling character study with a coming-of-age theme implemented in the story.Ralph Macchio has his fun in the sun as the titular character that made his presence known for his heart-rending performance in the 1983 classic \"The Outsiders\". He was still relatively young at the time was not that polished as a performer, and at times he still feels a bit green in his performance. However, he does capture the image of the alienation in a world that seems rather new to his old surroundings. The casting directors were spot-on when they casted Arnold from \"Happy Days\" Pat Morita in the role of handyman/karate trainer Mr. Miyagi. His execution was perfectly put in place as a subdued, but very spiritual and intellectual as he was the foundation that held this film together. It was a no-doubter that Mr. Morita was the winner for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.In the 80's there was a lot of cheesy movies that came out, \"The Karate Kid\" was one of the many films that overcame the cheesiness to bring you two solid hours of inspiration, entertainment as well as knowledge. It may look towards the younger age demographic, as it shows that even underdogs can achieve success if they put their minds to it. But the central theme in \"The Karate Kid\" is that vengeance is not a solution. There are other ways to crack the bully code without having to crush their balls. And the message stands true to today's standards as schools are petitioning to stop bullying without fighting back. The Miyagi and Daniel chemistry is one of the richest in film history and throw in a young Elisabeth Shue in the mixture you get pure gold in cinema. Not only is it educational, but it's also a gentle film that everyone in the family can get to enjoy. Even though it's been 30 years since this movie has been released, it has not shown a single sign of aging.",

And in all the right ways, too. Macchio was great, who knew he was 23 when he did this-all arms and legs and babyfaced, you'd swear he was 16 or so. Nailed it perfectly. I liked Elizabeth Shue as his gal too-she was sweet if ornamental-not given much to do, etc. Their time at the fun park is nicely shown.Miyagi of course is the centre of the whole shebang, Morita deserved his Oscar Nomination here. Such a leap from Happy Days eh? He was great-self assured, taciturn, well intentioned, wise, etc. I have always thought that this was one of the 40 best performances in the 80s easily.Gotta like William Zabka trotting out his blonde SOB surfer-dude character too here, which he used in 'Back to School' and other places with effect in the mid-80s. He has kinda disappeared though, but here he is good. You really do learn to hate him. Ditto Steve McQueen's kid, it's too bad he didn't go onto bigger things. Martin Kove of course is pretty nasty too.You can't hate this film, the 'Wax on/Wax off' stuff, the posing on the end of the boat ala Crane-style, the new car he's given-great stuff.\nIt has lasted too.I give it a ***1/2 rating and recommend it highly of course.",

            "content": "Ah, this film brings back so many pleasant memories of my childhood, such as watching it 8 or 9 times in one day and annoying the hell out of my older sister with it.  It's that kind of movie that requires little effort on the part of the viewer, and you can watch it after a hard day and still digest the messages it's promoting.   I have to disagree with many on here and say that it's Macchio who is the best thing about the film, and not Morita.  He seems to capture perfectly the awkwardness of adolescence; so much so that I'm still trying to get my head around the fact that he was 23 when he made it!  No wonder he has struggled for work since if he looks that young...   Thinking back at it now; Miyagi can be seen as quite an irritating character, spouting inane homilies that are almost as bad as 'Confucius, he say: man with holes in pockets...'  A smidgen of good taste and the IMDB smut regulators permit me from finishing that one.   (SPOILERS)   Shue is used as window dressing here, but oh, what lovely window dressing she makes!  Martin Kove is also suitably menacing as the bad guy, although the final scene always reduces my friend to hysterics, when he gives orders to \"Sweep the leg, do you have a problem with that?\"  My pal sensibly points out that the leg sweep is an unbelievably tame move, and one which he is well within his rights in performing.  Similarly, the famous \"Crane Kick\" is also quite basic, and not the audacious act of ingenuity it is portrayed as here.   Shamelessly manipulative tosh when compared to real life then, but there's nothing wrong with that if it's done well.  In Avildsen, the director, we have a man who has already performed the trick once with \"Rocky\".  With \"The Karate Kid\", he proved he could do \"Rocky-lite\" for teenagers too...",

Daniel's dedication throughout the film, first to learning what Mr. Miyagi had to teach him, and then to putting into play after his injury at the tournament, was heartening. It was also something my godson could relate to, as he has had many sports-related injuries. I have long been encouraging him to learn karate, and his new favourite movie may help!",

            "content": "The Karate Kid is one of the better teen films of the 1980's. While some of the teen films idealized Gen-Xer life, the Karate Kid tells the story of the new kid in town who can't find his place. At the beginning of the film, Daniel (Ralph Macchio) and his single mother have moved from New Jersey to the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area. He finds love with a schoolmate, Ali (Elizabeth Shue) but his nemesis becomes the girl's ex-boyfriend and his buddies. Turns out ex-boyfriend and company are a gang of teen bullies who are taught martial arts, \"karate\" in Japanese, by an amoral teacher who likens martial arts to military combat. He tells his students \"no mercy\". The gang misuses their abilities particularly against Daniel who is unable to defend himself because he knows nothing of martial arts combat.Luckily, the manager of the small apartment house is Mr Miyagi (Pat Morita). When he learns of the boys misfortunes, particularly after he has a first-hand encounter with the ruffians, Miyagi agrees to teach the young Daniel about martial arts, \"karate\". They strike a deal with the militant karate teacher, who is opposite in philosophy to Miyagi, that Daniel will enter a karate tournament, and until then, the \"gang\" must leave him alone. Miyagi points out that there are no bad students, just \"bad teachers\". He also says that karate is the last resort, not the first.Daniel is then put to work in which he has to wash cars, paint fences, and sand floors. It seems that Daniel is just being an indentured servant to Miyagi, but as the scenes unfold we learn that the point was not to paint the fence and wash the cars. In probably the most memorable scene of the film, Miyagi says \"Show me sand the floor.\" We find out the real point behind Daniel's chores.This is an incredibly uplifting film and has an exceptional story arc. The film is called the Karate Kid which of course refers to the title character. However, for nearly half the film, Daniel knows nothing of karate. He must learn at the feet of Miyagi and that he becomes first a novice then an adept in the world of karate. Part of the story is the universal narrative device of teacher and pupil. The relationship between Miyagi and Daniel evolve from one of uncertainty to mentor-student which for me is the strongest aspect of the film. Filmmakers often forget that while we the audience desire the protagonist to succeed, there should be lots of obstacles in his or her way. If the conquest is too easy, then there's not a lot to root for. Daniel has to climb some very steep mountains before he becomes the \"karate kid\". Definitely a film which has more or less withstood from the 1980's and is far less dated than other offerings of the period. Personally, this is a far stronger film than \"The Breakfast Club\".",

I must admit I always preferred the Kickboxer styled movies over these ones mainly due to Macchio, Macchio is fairly unlikeable in the beginning of the film. He often times deserves his fate and although i'm not sure that was the point, the whole training montage and all that is clich\u00e9d but provides the film with it's best moments it is really the fairly dull subplots involving the bullying and Elizabeth Shue which stop the movie's momentum. It is a tired formula, one that goes on too long but I always enjoy the underdog styled story and really this predictable flick is worth watching only because of the unforgettable training montage and in the latter part of the film when the movie explores the relationship between Daniel and Myiagi (After Daniel becomes more likable) The sequels are mixed as for my money # 3 is the best of the series but this is always the movie that everyone loved that I found only decent. Also the climax when it finally comes around, it manages to get the blood running somewhat but you have to sit through too many scenes of Macchio talking to himself and basically getting beatings before finally delivering what we expect.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",

It's about him finding a friend the last place he would expect, who shows him that to conquer what he fears in the outside world, he has to grow up and learn discipline, put aside the petty back and forth fighting and really stand up for himself.The seemingly unorthadox way Daniel Laruso learns Karate is wonderful, Mr. Miyagi was a great character whose actor, Pat Morita, should have won an oscar for, and all he put into his role; (the back story about the wife and the internment camp), which inspires Daniel to really find himself, and learn a valuable lesson about life, how to accept that bad things happen, and that he has to learn to balance everything out...not just physically...like the crane kick...once you learn balance, \"no can defense\".

Upon arrival you feel disheartened about leaving your friends behind but meet a chap the same age as you. He kindly invites you to a party on a beach that night. Being a new guy in town, it may be sensible to asses the lay-of-the-land. Who's who, and what is okay amongst your new peers. But no, you decide you to show your soccer skills and get your swerve on with the best looking girl there, because she's not likely to be seeing anyone, is she? When said girls double-hard boyfriend makes an appearance you attempt your home, self-taught karate on him. Alas, he's been trained by an evil Vietnam vet how to do evil karate and kicks you up and down the beach. All is not lost as you still have high school to fall back on. Sadly, on your first day you realise every one you alienated attends your new high school. But don't forget you're a whizz at soccer. Surely the school team will be the mark of the turn around for your fortunes. As you show your skills in the try-outs, by not passing to anyone at any point, you are tackled. A tough tackle but probably fair, in any case you've earned a free kick. A good opportunity to dust yourself down and show your competitive spirit. Or you can storm off shouting at all around you how their school \"stinks\" and \"sucks\". Despite all of this, there are two rays of light at the end of the tunnel. Beautiful beach girl has warmed to your \"charms\". Also, a kindly old janitor is willing to give you the time of day. So, you maintain a somewhat upbeat demeanour, except for when your shouting at your mother about how everything \"stinks\" and \"sucks\". It's the school fancy dress party. The options are limitless, Elvis, a vampire, werewolf, Liberace, Richard Nixon you can be anyone you want to be. Curiously you want to be a shower. The costume is cumbersome to say the least but people don't know it's you and that works in your favour. Beach girl thinks your ccccrazy. Things are looking up. In the gents you notice double-hard evil karate bloke smoking evil drugs in a cubicle. Fair to say a quiet retreat is percentage play here. Once again you defy logic and drench him with water. A chase ensues, but luckily you're in your streamlined shower outfit. Double-hard evil karate bloke and his chums are all dressed as skeletons. Somehow they catch-up with you at a fence. The mother of all beatings begins. They're chanting something \"mercy being for the weak\", oh dear. Things are looking bleak until a shadowy figure fends them off. Coming around from the battering you taken you are greeted by the janitor. To your shock it was he who saved you. Well, fortune is finally shining on you. Pushing your luck you ask him to come to the dojo of evil karate. Having fought in a war, struggled to make a life in a foreign land, barely learnt the language, and lost the love of his life, the old man, who just wants to tend to his bonsai trees, regretfully declines the request. Weighing up all that has happened, he's taught you how to prune bonsais, given you one of them, fixed your bike, saved your life and nursed you back to health and put up with your incessant whining, you could thank him and be on your way. Or Jump up shouting \"thanks for nothing man, thanks for nothing\". Against his better judgement the old guy goes with you to the Dojo. There the evil sensei mocks you and the old fella. Irritatingly, the old guy fails to get these guys off your back. Instead he enters you in a karate tournament. You suspect this is payback for being such a whining turd. The old guy has just guaranteed you'll have your ass handed to you except now it'll be in front of hundreds of people. You plead to him to teach you good karate. To which he agrees. However, he seems have misunderstood your plea for training. Instead he seems to have heard \"Can I please redecorate your house and gardens?\". You're not falling for it and after a week of humiliation you down tools. As you go to storm off, the words \"stinks\" and \"sucks\" forming on your lips as you do so, the crazy old geezer comes at you. You fend him off with rudimentary blocks. From somewhere you have developed the ability not to get hit.As time goes by, you see less and less of the annoying woman who brought you into the world. Instead you spend all your time with the old man, who has no family or friends. This seems normal to you as you to struggle to make relationships. However, fit beach girl is still interested. Her friends try to sway her away from you but she's not having it. It's your birthday and the old guy gives you one of his 38 cars. Perfect. Now you can pick fit beach girl up and take her to the fair. All goes well. You even let her drive. When she questions this you deliver the flawless logic \"Hey it's the 80's\". Your training is moving on too. You balance on a pole on the beach and now you're ready.The tournament plays out with predictability. Except for that eastern looking guy who clearly knew more martial arts than anyone else. I have a nostalgic fondness for this film but Larusso is such a terrible human being, he sucks all that's good from those around him.",

It was in this film when he appeared as Mr. Miyagi, opposite virtual newcomer Ralph Macchio as Daniel, the Karate Kid (1984). Add in Elisabeth Shue as Ali and you have a relatively quiet film that ends up packing a huge punch. Pat Morita was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 1985 Oscars for this film.This is that classic tale about a young man from New Jersey, who moves to L. A. with his mother and runs into trouble with some of the local kids, who also happen to be martial arts students. Daniel meets the handyman of his apartment complex, Japanese-American senior citizen and all around great guy, Mr. Miyagi, who knows a lot about the art of karate himself. With training from Miyagi, Daniel, along with help from his new girlfriend Ali, begins training, in the attempt to finally gain the respect from his fellow school students in this new town. This film was a big hit when it first came out. It spawned three sequels and a different rebooted version, starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith. Karate Kid (1984), touched so many in the 1980s, that its legacy continues on in the streaming tv series, Cobra Kai (2018-present). Even 40 years later, after many repeat viewings this film still has its charm. It may look like its from the 1980s, but that aspect doesn't effect its luster. With luck it should continue on as a timeless classic. I also challenge people to watch some of Pat Morita's other work. He was always a special surprise.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

            "content": "Just to let all of the users who gave some positive feedbacks on this film in this website, I would like to say that I've recently saw this film and I've never even heard of it before. However, when news grabbed my ear that lots of people were very fond of this flick from the classic 80s, I've rented a DVD copy from a library last summer and watched it to keep my interest. I was unsure whether or not it was gonna be good, but little did I know that I was in for an awesome treat! Besides, since it received some critical acclaim on Rotten Tomatoes (90%) (With Roger Ebert praising it as well) and became a box office success back at 1984, I actually started to like this movie. It had an original story about a teenager named Daniel LaRusso who moves from New Jersey to California with his mother and makes some new friends and a girlfriend as well. One day, he gets beaten up by a bunch of bullies who are professional karate students working for their over-the-top villain and starts having problems.Suddenly, things started to change when Mr. Miyagi, a gardener and a karate master, saves Daniel and promises him to train him for the All-Valley Tournament, thus developing a relationship with each other. Also, Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate isn't about violence. It makes you what you are inside your soul.Like I said, I still like this movie, but I do have two problems with this flick. The screenplay is sometimes predictable and the reason why Mr. Miyagi is letting Daniel paint his fence and waxing his car remains questionable. With those two problems aside, the music from Bill Conti (with a great pop song \"The Moment of Truth\" by Survivor), a top-notch cast, some touching moments, a good moral about looking deep inside of you, and some riveting karate moments (with the best part where Daniel LaRusso uses his crane kick near the end of the movie) makes this movie an entertaining and nostalgic martial arts movie that would always be watchable to fans of sports films.",

Beautifully paced and with just enough action, story and romance to entertain nearly anyone.Directed by John Avildsen, (who incidentally worked on Rocky 1 and 5) The Karate Kid is a brilliant film with equally brilliant actors. Both Daniel Larusso and Mr Miyagi are acted to perfection by Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. The music is severely underrated and fits very well, especially during the training montage scenes and the action is so real and a wonder to watch.It's truly a story about overcoming yourself and earning your respect. At the end of the tournament after Daniel wins Johnny, his arch rival and enemy, gives him his trophy personally. The villains in the film are really well done, Johnny is Daniel's rival but isn't really a bad person per say, Kreese is the real bad guy and a perfect opposite to the cool and controlled Mr Miyagi.9/10: Uplifting and extremely well done",

Avildsen as a Frank Capra style story of a New Jersey kid who moves to tropical California only to be shunned as an outsider who lives on the wrong side of town. The movie is still enjoyable and in 1984 made a tremendous impact on the movie-going public. Like the Black Stallion in 1979, it became something of a classic movie for young people.The kid, played by Ralph Macchio, finds some strong support in his always devoted mother, who is determined to make a new life. However, the real anchor is the building superintendent and new found friend Mr. Miyagi, played by Pat Morita. Miyagi is a wise elder, who creates bonsais and teaches the young man how to defend himself by mastering karate and its true values. Martin Kove plays the negative adult role model for the gang of kids who terrorize Daniel with their macho karate, not the form of self-defence that Miyagi promotes. I think the show is still great entertainment. The show reaches a Rocky-style climax and you can probably guess how it turns out. It can be faulted for a formula plot but is still good enough to hold your attention and reflect on the values of mutual respect and ethical conduct that often don't register with parents and their teens.",

Disagreements are settled by fistfights. ( I have seen people drink themselves evil. I have seen young people fall apart because of those around them.)

            "content": "Yeah, this was a decent film. I mean, I don't know. Yeah, it was decent, but I didn't know what to expect. In a way, I guess that may have backfired on me a bit. It subtly slithered in expectations to where I got thrown off balance. It was all good in the end, though.I went in with some things at the back of my head: the moment in HIMYM with Barney Stinson believing Johnny Lawrence's the real Karate Kid, bits and pieces from Cobra Kai that I've seen where Johnny's shown in a different light, and how some people think or ended up thinking, more recently, that Daniel wasn't so innocent, either.That made me think Johnny would have more depth, as well as being super cruel, and Daniel would be similar, to a lesser extent: or that he would be a typical bully-victim, super scared and taking it, defenseless, making Johnny more \"evil.\" And I guess that was true, somewhat. But not in the way I was expecting. Johnny wasn't that horrible, just your average bully. But the writer didn't seem to do much with his character, depth-wise. And Daniel wasn't this weak person who garnered even more sympathy when evil Johnny got into the picture; he was headstrong/revengeful and happened to encounter trouble with no proper means to defend himself.The focus didn't seem to be on highlighting Johnny as this evil guy nor Daniel as this good guy you should undoubtedly be cheering on; you end up doing that yourself without any push towards it by the writer, or that's how it seemed. If anything, it seemed like the writer subtly painted John Kreese (through himself, but especially his teachings) as the \"evil guy.\" But even that came across as a back-burner focus. The real focus/message was the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and the latter's life lessons/wisdom, or at least that's what I think.This film was undoubtedly a film from/of its time, that's for sure. Everything about it was screaming that out. That wasn't necessarily a problem in and of itself. It's just that it was somewhat average. The story was simple, maybe too simple, but that could've been more on the direction and pacing; not much did seem to happen. The other aspects didn't seem as \"vibrant\" as I thought they would be, which is probably on me for having certain expectations. But maybe that's the case with loads of films back then. The soundtrack, as well as the score composed by Bill Conti, was decent, though. And the fight choreography, while 80's-esque, was done well.Don't get me wrong: that was fine. I feel like the \"disconnect,\" in a sense, is the nostalgia factor attached to this film. I think that elevated it higher than it was when people refer to it. Because, when peeling that back, what's left is a fairly average (not bad, just average) film.At the same time, there's something about it. That could come from three elements: sincerity, genuinity, and a general sense of heartfeltness; they seemed prominent. Despite being an average film, it seemed to have more of an effect than it realistically \"should've.\" That almost feels like a proper explanation of most films from this film's time, even though I wouldn't know anything about that. And it's not nostalgia, as this is my first time watching it. It just seems to have succeeded against all odds, like an underdog, like Daniel LaRusso.",

First off, you can only beat the same kid up so many times before it gets really old. Also, it is completely unbelievable. There is no way that Miyagi could possibly teach Daniel enough karate in just two months for Daniel to even make it past his first match. The time frame given is two months. He is competing against guys that have been taking karate for years. You're going to tell me that in two months he can learn enough to beat someone who has been taking karate for two years? I don't think so. Also, there is no way that a rich, beautiful, popular cheerleader like Ali would give Daniel the time of day. After the beach incident, Daniel is considered the school wimp by the entire senior class. Ali would be too afraid of ruining her reputation to even give Daniel another glance after the beach fight where Johnny takes him down. Lastly, this movie gives the wrong message. The Cobra Kai's aren't automatically going to accept Daniel just because he beat them in a tournament. It would be more like \"Hey, you cost me my title, just wait till after school tomorrow wimp!!!!!!\" The second movie had a better message. Love is always worth fighting for.",

It's more a coming-of-age film than sports, but it's brilliant to watch.Larusso really does come across as a teenage Balboa, same wise-guy attitude and easy coast patter, the only difference being boxing to karate.

Everyone knows the story of the new kid who moves the town who gets picked on by the bullies and wants to stand up to them but he just doesn't have the strength to do so at first. This is like the pinnacle godfather of those stories. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are both so famous and pop-culture everyone quoted this movie. Rule one of Miyagi karate, and of course wax on wax off. Ralph Macchio as Daniel plays who just moved to town he doesn't know anybody and he just ends up being the center of bullying doesn't have any friends. Doesn't also help that his father's dead. He's a Lovebale guy and you want him to see him fit in. Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi is the kind soft spoken Japanese mentor who saves Daniel and teaches him to fight. Over the course of the story the two bond more and Daniel find out more about miyagi and the two develop more than just a student& mentor relationship but more of a father& son relationship. And overall that's where the heart of them movie lies it's the relationship with Daniel and Miyagi. The cobra Kai villains are some of the most brutal bullies you'll ever see in a movie and that's what's best about them. William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence is just what you expect from your typical high school bully he's a jerk he's not willing to listen to reason he's just use his fist for everything. Of course the one who's responsible for all of his faults is martin kove as John creases he sensai of cobra Kai . Well the premise of the movie is not that original by today's standards the karate kid remains a favorite amongst audiences and has gone on to spawn three sequels, A remake and even a Netflix spinoff over the course of 30 years showing that is still rembered and cherished today as it back then.",

But, now and then you'll hear or see imitations of the famous \"crane\" move that is demonstrated at the end of this movie.It is a simple believable story about a skinny puke of a teenage boy(Ralph Machio)named Daniel Laruso, who moves from Newark NJ to Los Angeles CA. Out of place he tries some what to fit in.  He goes to a party, tries out for the school soccer team, meets a girl(Elizebeth Shue), goes to a school dance.

Eventually this crowd, especially one in particular named Jonny, picks on him so bad that he searches to learn karate to use as revenge.  He discovers that the old oriental maintenace man(Pat Morita) of his cheap apartment complex is a karate expert.  He eventually convinces him, Mr. Miyagi, to teach him.  In doing so he gets more than he bargained for, real genuine karate lessons, friendship, and a car. At the end he enters the All-Valley under 18 Karate Championship Tournament whom he competes with all his bullies from school.Ralph Matchio is great in this movie as a skinny wimp teenager.  He must have gotten beat up in High school alot because he looked experienced.  He realy gets beat the snot out of in two scenes.His relationship with his mother is classic.  They give you no info about his father until in part two you find out that he passed away.  So it's just Daniel and his mom Lucile.  She is your classic middle aged annoying mother. Constantly embarrassing Daniel.  She has no clue that Daniel has been getting beat the crap out of through a good portian of the movie because Daniel says he fell off his bike.  One particular scene when he and her get in an argument in the parking lot outside their apartment is one to remember,  \"I hate this stupid bike!  Damn bike!  I hate it!\"  \"Daniel! Why did you throw your bike away!?\"  \"Because I felt like it Ma!\"Also they manage to throw in a love story with Daniel and Ali(Elizebeth Shew) a girl he meets at the beach party on his first day in town.  But he soons finds out they have many differences, she is a rich country club girl and she's also the ex girlfriend of Jonny.  But nevertheless, it doesn't stop the burning flame.Pat Morita was nominated for an oscar in best supp actor for playing the part of Mr Miyagi.  Who even though is old, can still kick some serious butt.  You get to know a little about his life as Daniel becomes his karate student.  He's a wwII vetran,  wife died along with his baby due to complications at birth, and he's an expert fisherman.  He brings both the funniest lines and the most serious lines to this movie.The movie brings good corny and real laughs to the screen.  But in my opinion there are really only two corny areas:  The beach Party on his first day and his first date with Ali.  But don't get me wrong, these are great scenes!  They add to the 80's mood.  \"You're gonna let me drive?  Are you serious?\"   \"Hey it's the 80's!\"The fight scenes are choreographed very well.  Especially the tournament at the end.  It is fun to watch.  Plus, the great 80's music adds the right touch to every important scene.  People now, say it was a corny movie, but I strongly disagree.  It is far too deep to be corny.",

            "content": "Upon viewing this film in the current day (2020), I can honestly say that it aged really nicely.\nIt's a timeless story (which is hard to botch but, dear Lord, does Hollywood manage to do it more often than not) about a young boy who moves into a new town, only to find himself the subject of a bully, John Kreese (Martin Kove) and the Cobra Kai dojo gang. Defenceless, he befriends fellow tenant Mr. Miyagi (PAt Morita) who, through various techniques , teaches the boy, Daniel (Ralph Macchio), how to use martial arts to defend himself... but not before he signs him up to a tournament against the very people who bullied him throughout the first third of the film.\nThis film oozes 80s vibes, and that's intended as a compliment. The film, despite feeling timeless, has 80s artefacts that make films from that era special. The core story is simple enough, yet its pulled off rather effectively. Daniel is a highly likeable character from the very beginning, and it's a rewarding experience to watch him going through the process of learning karate. The characters (with, perhaps, the exception of the borderline stereotypical Mr. Miyagi) walk and talk in a way that feels natural and realistic. The story (even for someone who was forced to take karate as a child and couldn't possibly care any less about it) is both engaging and inspirational. It keeps moving at a steady pace, with no real need to check the time, and it all comes to a satisfying conclusion.\nIt also includes the great song \"You're the Best,\" written by the late, great Allee Willis. It's always nice to see her songs popping up whenever you least expect it (I remember reading it wasn't used until the third film, but I'm clearly wrong in that).\nUpon watching this film alone, it's hard to really see this warranting a sequel, but that's next on the watchlist.",

            "content": "Ralph Macchio may have been the Karate Kid, but this film belongs to William Zabka and it's such a shame he's not making bigger movies even though he is still acting. He was brilliant as Johnny and even though he was the bully you couldn't help but like him and I had the biggest crush on him growing up and I was only 7 when I saw this at the movies and watched all his movies until Shootfighter and of course when he was on the Equalizer and he was quiet for a while until High Voltage and Python were released in Australia as not all his movies are released here.He put so much heart and soul into his performance as Johnny and it was a shame that he was typecast as the bully in his other films but then again, he was the best actor in Back to School.Elisabeth Shue gave an honest and real performance as Ali but was relogated to the role of girlfriend in her other films until Leaving Las Vegas when again she showcased her wonderful acting ability  and Pat Morita was brilliant as Miyagi. It's a shame that the sequel didn't focus more on the Cobra Kais and Ali as after the opening of the 2nd one the movie fell apart from then on.When Karate Kid 3 was released all I knew then was that Kreese was after revenge and it would have been great if the original Cobra Kais made an appearance other than the arcive footage as the first Karate Kid worked so well when they were on screen that when they weren't the film got a little boring. Of course Ralph's character in the beginning wasn't a expert on karate and of course the underdog has to win the tournament and the girl but I didn't like his character as he lies to his potential new friends and his sometimes treatment of Ali made you want the Cobra Kais to win, but of course in movie land this isn't possible. It's hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. It hasn't dated funnily enough and is always showing on cable. Teen movies are sure a lot different today than what they were in the 80s. It seems every decade the new generation of teens latch onto those 80s movies and even though the fashion etc are questionable, some of the best movies were from the 1980s and this is certainly one of them.",

            "content": "\"The Karate Kid\" was another terrific movie from the '80s. This hit drama from the Oscar-winning director of \"Rocky\" is about a teenager from New Jersey who (along with his mother) moves to California and once he gets there is immediately bullied around by the local nasty boys who are experienced martial artists. Then one night the villainous bad boys beat up the kid real good until a Japanese handyman steps in and precedes to kick their butts and save the kid. The handyman then decides to teach the kid karate, and the boy begins to learn about some important lessons in life. This is a movie that made me feel good after seeing it in the theater in 1984. It's heartwarming, funny, and entertaining. Ralph Macchio stars in his most famous role as Daniel, the Karate Kid. Elisabeth Shue also stars in one of her early film roles as Ali, Daniel's girlfriend who just happens to be the ex-girlfriend of the lead bully. But the real scene stealer in \"The Karate Kid\" is Pat Morita, whose just wonderful as Mr. Miyagi, the old Japanese handyman who teaches Daniel some unique karate techniques (some of them are good for alot of laughs). \"The Karate Kid\" became such a big hit when first released in the summer of 1984 that three sequels followed. The next film \"Karate Kid II\" was very good, but \"Karate Kid III\" and \"The Next Karate Kid\" (the latter starring a then little known actress named Hilary Swank) were mediocre. This one's the best. It's a winner in my book.\n***1/2 (out of four)",

It is definitely a movie for the younger audience. Most of the karate scenes are downright ludicrous. Especially the ones with Mr. Miyagi in them.It is still a quite okay movie though. The kids certainly liked it. The basic story is a classical one of friendship, a bit of love and the bullied underdog kid getting back at his bullies and it plays out without any real surprises. It is the kind of story that most people feel sympathetic towards which is perhaps why most people like the movie.

            "content": "What a great feel good movie (good guy versus bad guy), totally deserving of its popularity.It's of course the tale of a sympathetic young teenager, Daniel, who has just moved from New Jersey to California with his mom. After encountering some trouble from the local bullies, he is given some karate lessons from the neighboring Oriental, Mr. Miyagi, the most memorable mentor of all time. The role of Daniel is charmingly played by Ralph Macchio, but Mr. Miyagi (portrayed to perfection by Pat Morita) MAKES this movie with his quiet humor, his bonsai skills, his unique fly catching technique, his teaching tactics (the immortal \"Wax on, wax off\"), and his personal story of loss during World War II, so touchingly conveyed to young Daniel.Of course it's a classic coming of age tale, so naturally there's a pretty love interest for our young hero, but it's the unusual and touching relationship that develops between the fatherless Daniel-san and the older and very wise Mr. Miyagi (with his lessons in both karate and life) that fuels the fire igniting this movie. As another reviewer cleverly noted, Mr. Miyagi is the father Daniel never had and Daniel is the son Mr. Miyagi never had. As for the Rocky style karate match between Daniel and his quintessential bully opponent, I won't give the winner away, but it'll keep you glued to your seat and cheering regardless of whether or not you're normally a fan of the martial arts. A fabulous movie (also the sequels). My husband, my teenage son, and I...not one of the three of us can resist tuning in to it whenever it happens to be on TV.",

This movie belonged to William Zabka. He played his role with a passion that made him so believable in the role of Johnny. It's a shame he hasn't gone on to bigger roles as he is such a good actor.Even though Elisabeth Shue had a minor role, I thought she was very good, although I didn't believe Ali and Daniel as a couple as there was no chemistry between them - I thought she was better suited to Johnny- any way it is good to see Elisabeth get out of the typecast roles of the girlfriend ( Back to the Future 2 & 3, Cocktail etc etc).Up until two years ago when it was on television, the last time I saw this movie was when I was 12 years old.

The predictable outcome is nonetheless uplifting and gives the audience (especially children) the message that good will triumph over evil.The relationship between the \"kid\" and his \"teacher\" is a high point of this film.

            "content": "Firstly may i say that the acting, cinematography, action and musicin this film are world class and there are no films made within the 80's that not only capture the zeitgesit of the decade but are also able to be timless and hold up after many years and many viewings. The casting within this film is great especially pat morita as Mr Miyagi the sensei who has all the knowledge on how to be the best around and aslo the casting of the cobra kai fighters is amazing especially Rob Garrison as Tommy and William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence. The small flaw that this film has comes from the 'antagonist' Daniel Larusso who is the most annoying character in this film and he is the reason that all the conflicts within the film occur. Due to the fact he starts all the fights within the film I am surprised that he did not join cobra Kai although he learnt the lesson strike first from the beginning of the film. Also the fact that the ending would be perfect apart from that illegal kick he throws to beat the true champion, peoples hero and the real karate kid Johnny Lawrence from being the first 3 time all valley winner. In addition to this he should have won the fight before daniel had a chance to throw the crane kick as Johnny punches daniel in the face to secure the title as during Johnny's semi-final fight against Daryl Vidal he sweeps Vidal's leg then punches his face whilst on the floor also during the tournement montage johnny kicks an opponent in the face to secure a win this also does prove that the crane kick is a legal move but Johnny is the winner. Also the film skips over the abuse that Johnny suffers from his sensei Kreese and even Mr Miyagi who assults Johnny, Tommy, Bobby. Jimmy and Dutch. And the film refuses to acknowledge them the victims of physical abuse of Mr Miyagi (who thought he was protecting someone innocent so that may be forgiven) and the psychological and physical abuse that kreese. Also as innocwnt as the film tries to make Daniel he aslo engages in bullying behaviour that he claims he had been through so why would he portray the behaviour he hated being on the other end of to other innocent people.All in all this is a great film to watch but when you realise all these simple facts the film is still enjoyable but these issues make you change who you are rooting for to win and hurts even more when you know the ending to this trageic story.",

She does acrobatics on the school grounds, where a gorgeous extra with shapely legs can be seen in the background, about 5-10 mins in.The rest is a rehash of Kung-Fu series, with a little bit of Groundhog Day thrown in for good measure, plus a Halloween party.

Now don't get me wrong: I get that Mr. Miyagi was sore about WWII but even if the tse'-tse' and Johnny looked German, what about the wide Ali? Why didn't they beat her up too? Nope. They stole the blonde girlfriend from blondie boy.At the end, they all go to Dennis for scrambled eggs, bacon and ham but Mr Miyagi invites them all to his Tokyo-inspired pad for fried rice and a fare of wingless flies soaked in sake. Larusso got his leg swiped but then the bully that he is apologized to the Aryan boy after realizing his father didn't serve as S. S.: they were Norwegians. They all eat flies and egg fu yung at the end but revenge brews in the eyes of the bullies: they will meet up some 35 years later, for a webseries that only those fools who are soon parted with their money can watch. Don't miss it, if you like to watch blonds get beat up by non.",

            "content": "Anyone notice her chunky stubby legs in shorts? When compared to the girl at back, who had the perfect '80s body, it makes you wonder why chunky girl with the double chin and fat butt got the role and not the cute girl. I mean Ralph Macchio is a very narrow, lanky guy. Next to each other, they looked like Laurel and Hardy... in a bad way for the fat girl.It's not that Daniel Larusso is way too dark for chunky blondie. It's that she's too wide for him. Her clothes have a lot of fabric to them. When compared to him, she's enormous, particularly for the 80s, when no girl would be caught in shorts or a swimsuit if she was chunky. He should have gone out with the girl with the gorgeous legs: as it turns out, she was a brunette. Shoe and the Tse'-Tse' blondie guy were made for each other.I don't remember the first part of the movie. Is that normal? I think every time it goes on TV, I catch it at the shower curtain costumer scene. Anyway, yeah so Larusso was a bully. But instead of focussing on that, Cobra Kai shoulda focussed on how big Ali was. Why would all this men want with such a short, stumpy girl? Her legs are like tree trunks!Not only that, Cobra Kai only gave the one episode for free so I never watched the rest. Their loss. Movies are free and only an idiot pays for watching free stuff. Also Pat Morita doing karate in slow motion against young kids is a bit too \"David Carradine\". But the flute music after Larusso gets beat up is cool. I liked this movie as a kid. Now, I just see the flaws. The Larusso fam is just Jersey trash and should have stayed there. And why does blondie kid flip-flop at the end? Made no sense.The Tse'-Tse' has played in some good guest-starring roles. He's always the bad guy. He has a bad guy face. He seems like a nice dude at coventions and stuff. In conclusion, watch this but only once. After, it gets boring. Pity nobody gave Shoe long pants. She was enormous in this, but looks lean in the face in 2021. However, she's probably still this short. 8/10 for the first watch. After that, it quickly sinks into a 4-5/10.",

This film should have been one more entertainment for the children of the 80s, but it transcended time precisely because of the beautiful oriental sample through the master Miyagi, a character who teaches us that even the most everyday things can be tools to find balance in our lives.Apart from this concept, the film is quite basic, with a series of superficial characters, but useful for the story that was wanted to be told. There are some very good sparks of photography and editing, but overall the film has an average technical level.Great recommendation for a Sunday afternoon.",

            "content": "I never watched this movie until December 2010. This movie is great movie I will be honest. I watched the remake first before I watched this one. At first I like the remake first but then. I watched both again this one is way better big time. I love this classic movie in 2011 I bought it after getting birthday money and I love it. In 2011 it became my favorite of all time. I am so happy to have this as my favorite movie of all time. I was told about this a few times I was told to rent and watch it. I am kind of ashamed I never did so before. Back when people used to rent movies back before 2007. In 2007 my mom started to Netflix after a rude movie sales person kicked me out of movie renting store. My mom refused to rent from them anymore. To be honest we one of there customers and they kicked me out. Then my mom started to rent from Netflix instead back in 2007. Then one night when I was 18 years I was Netflix then I added The Karate Kid, The Karate Kid Part II and The Karate Kid Part III on Netflix to stream. My mom stopped renting because my brother and I accidentally both lost a DVD. My mom had to pay 14 dollars for that.Okay on to the review of this movie its a classic movie which has a standard story. We start off with a teen named Daniel played by Ralph Macchio. He moves from New Jersey to California he took a few karate classes. He makes friends with a guy named Freddy. Daniel goes to the beach and plays soccer with his new friends at the beach. He meets a beautiful girl name Ali and then flirts with her. Her ex Johnny her ex shows up with his Karate gang Johnny wants to to Ali but Ali does not want to talk to him. Then Johnny and Daniel have a little problem of there own Johnny trips Daniel and then Daniel sucker punched Johnny Daniel's friends start to cheer him on. Daniel then wanted to call it even. Johnny instead to doing that says no mercy like his Karate Sensei karate teacher teaches him. Then he beats up Daniel and Daniel's new fiends leave him there they think he's a loser. A day went on Daniel's mom saw bruises and asking what happened he said he fell off his bike. Then Daniel goes to school and also goes to the soccer tryouts. He gets tripped by one of Johnny's karate friends and gets kicked of the soccer tryouts for punching him in the face. Ali took a liking to Daniel Daniel found out Johnny was her ex boyfriend when she told him. About that story then Daniel wants to learn proper karate he went to karate dojo but saw Johnny there and left. He was also taking karate from a video the maintenance guy Mr. Miyagi played by Pat Morita shows up he noticed karate and fixed the faucet Daniel told him was broken earlier in the movie when the He then went to eat was with his mom they talked he after going to the karate dojo and leaving because Johnny was in that class. He told his mom about Ali. Then Daniel fell off his bike and rolled down hill do to Johnny and his karate gang. Then Daniel threw his bike in the dumpster wanted to move to move back to New Jersey and leave California then Mr. Miyagi overhead Daniel. He then fixed Daniel's bike. He teaches Daniel how to care of a bonsai tree. Daniel. Trims one with Miyagi who teaches him to do so. Then goes up to his room because it was a school night. Daniel did not want to near Johnny and avoided him and Ali a little. He then told Mr. Miyagi he would go to dance unless he was the invisible man so no one would see him. Mr. Miyagi gives him a shower curtain to go the dance with. Ali knew it Daniel she told her friends one said she did know what she saw in Daniel one said she must be into fungus. Then she told Daniel her needed water they started talking and made up. She then said Johnny thinks he can do whatever he want to do to people. Then Daniel opened up his shower curtain and get hit with an egg he then goes to the bathroom to wash up and egg out of his hair. He then sees Johnny go into a stall who was smoking Daniel turns on a hose to get Johnny wet. Johnny then ran after Daniel. Who was running. Ali tripped Johnny and karate gang then they got up and chased him. Daniel tried to climb the fence but one of Johnny's friends kneed him and then Johnny punched him then kicked him three times. They got him up Bobby told them to leave Daniel because he had enough. But they said that don't squat but then Johnny was to kill Daniel by kicking him against a fence and then Mr. Miyagi beat up all five of them in like 10 to 12 seconds. Then heeled Daniel. Then went to talk to the Cobra Kai Sensei John kreese played by Martin Kove. To them to stop and that Daniel would in the tournament. Then he teaches Daniel wax on wax off, sand the floor, paint the fence, paint the house. Which taught to block moves and builds up your muscles. Daniel leans all of this then goes to beach. He learns more Karate then goes on a date with Ali to Golf N' Stuff and went on there first date and did a ton of fun stuff they played air hockey, golf, went to the bumper boats I think then played go carts took photos in the photo booth. Then Johnny shows up later and your friend as long as its okay with his mommy. Then Daniel learns more Karate under Mr. Miyagi who teaches him how to find balance. He teaches him how to balance on a boat and also teaches him the Crane kick how to stand and do jump kick. Daniel wanted to go on another date with Ali. He goes the country club to pick up Ali for the date. She was dancing with her dad. The Johnny wanted to dance with Ali so he did. Then he aw in the kitchen and kissed her. Then got spaghetti spilled all over his clothes and then he went to Mr. Miyagi's house who was drinking a lot of alcohol and he got drunk and told Daniel about his wife and kids passing away. Then Daniel read the letter then found about Mr. Miyagi's wife and kid. Then a few weeks latter it was Daniel's birthday Mr. Miyagi had a robe for his all Valley tournament and then a birthday cake then gave him a car. Daniel went to make Ali they kissed. He found out Ali punched Johnny after she kissed him. Then Daniel went to the all Valley tournament. Started winning good and then made to the semi-finals. Bobby Brown got disqualified for cheating. Then Daniel had fifteen minutes left he ask Mr. Miyagi to heel his leg with his hands. Mr. Miyagi then agreed and heeled him. Then Daniel fought against Johnny scored two points by punching him in the gut and hitting him the back and giving a bloody nose. Then Johnny two points by kicking him in the face and side later and punched him in the face and got no point. Then took out Daniel's knee and got a warning Daniel crane kicked and Johnny and won the Johnny gave him trophy and congratulated Daniel.My favorite movie and really really good a classic good take a look at Cobra Kai its amazing.

He is placed within a world he is not use to.  He makes an enemy with the towns most notorious Karate experts, because he falls in live with the leaders x-girlfriend.  These Karate experts unfortunately go to the same school as him.  They beat him to a pulp day after day.At the same time he befriends an old man who not only teaches him how to fight these karate experts.  But he teaches him the meaning of life, friendship, Karate (and above all)love.  A love that goes beyond that of a boyfriend-girlfriend.  The type love a father should give his son.This is a timeless classic, that has a meaning within a meaning.  The meaning seems to be, if someone believes in you and you believe in them and yourself. You can soar as high as you want.  But the meaning within the meaning is: if you stop and look beyond the appearance of something, you may just find that there is something special hidden in us all.  Deep, I know. But fact of life.I give this movie 9 out of 10.  Excellent flick!!",

I really liked the older man who was the boy's \"trainer\". He reminded me of someone who I look up to in life. His vocabulary was very unique, in that it was simple words, but the most critical.I caught early on to what was going on when the boy was doing chores. And was impressed with the lead up, all the way to the boy, who was ready to fight. But the ending confused me, as it was all so sudden. One minute the boy won, and then got the trophy, then it shows his trainer smiling, then suddenly it ends, just then. It didn't make any sense, as it was all so sudden.However, the rest of the movie was very well done, so I rate it 8/10.",

And even so, why would he travel almost 3000 miles to sunny, laid-back southern California to get his ass kicked by Johnny? Are the Kobra-Kai bigger and badder than oh say the Latin Kings? Well hmmm.....oh wait! I forgot that Daniel-san is Italian and being Italian AND from New jersey has to have some perks.  What if.....Daniel(whose father was dead...it never said how...another hmmmm) was connected to a godfather who had people that could \"take care\" of Johnny, Dutch, Bobby, Kreese and the rest of the nasty Kobra-Kais?What if the character of Myagi was substituted by \"Maggio\" (portrayed by Anthony Quinn or Tony Curtis), a maintance man who was secretly hiding under his Federal Witness protection.  Instead of \"The Crane\", he shows Daniel how to pistol-whip, make car bombs and mix cement. Instead of an old Packard, Maggio gives Daniel his very own hoop ride; a 1977 El Dorado convertable that Daniel had to wax with melted wax from a wheel of fontina cheese...bueno!",

(Although it's cool to see some old faces in the tournament scenes, such as Pat Johnson, and there are actually some good karate moves here especially from the guy that makes it to the semi finals)My biggest problem with the movie watching it now is that there is zero chemistry between Macchio and Shue. I know it's aimed at kids but their few intimate scenes together really are disgusting!!! It's like seeing a 20 year old make out with her mates 13 year old brother Also some of the Asian stereotyping is pretty lame and dated. I'm fairly sure Pat Morita didn't really talk like that! Overall though it has a nice central philosophical message in terms of going back to natural elements to build your skills, and the film definitely has a heart.

Being a hero and saving someone from a burning building is one thing, but knocking someone out just because you can isn't attractive to me- yet Ali loved it, so I guess most find that scrappy fighting nature hot. To me, it's a turn-off though and keeps me from liking the movie more.I know this is a karate movie, and that's fine- IF the fighting was more warranted, and fighting hardly ever is. Hence, at no point in this film did I feel any of the fights were really warranted at all.The karate really wasn't my thing, but I watched this with my family who love it.

Myagi, who says he can train Daniel. However, his lessons are very unusual. For example, Daniel is reduced to painting fences and waxing cars. These lessons are not what they appear to be, but instead, they teach young Daniel how to defend himself.This movie is also not what it appears to be. To quote Roger Ebert: \"I took one look at the title and figured it was either (a) a sequel to Toenails of Vengeance, or (b) an adventure pitting Ricky Schroder against the Megaloth Man. I was completely wrong. THE KARATE KID was one of the nice surprises of 1984 -- an exciting, sweet-tempered, heart-warming story with one of the most interesting friendships in a long time.\"Like Roger Ebert said, \"The Karate Kid\" is not an average kung-fu movie. No. It's a drama that starts out like another clich\u00e9d high school movie, but adopts a message and drama. After Daniel finds the meaning behind his training, the movie starts to head into a drama.After Daniel learns the meaning of his lessons, the film gets dramatic. He learns that things aren't what they seem to be, and that karate is for self-defense; not fighting.I remember having to watch this film for \"P.A.C.E.,\" which was a program to help me remember and do better in school and crap like that. They had a lot of weird lessons and only made me watch \"The Karate Kid\" to teach me that things aren't always what they seem.The main flaws in \"Karate kid\" are that the bathroom scene was too unrealistic and that there was a lot of swearing that might offend the younger ones. But, it was a good movie with enough heart, along with a moral.It appears as a crappy, clich\u00e9d kung-fu movie, but ends up looking like a great drama.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",

He is a different kind of mentor from Mickey from \"Rocky\" and is such an engaging character.Also good is the 80's feel of the whole thing, the setting, and the motivational soundtrack. The training montage and especially the karate tournament at the end will have you cheering.I love this film. It is a true classic in the underdog genre and a great movie by any standard.RATING: A",

Ever since I first watched this at age 8, I loved everything about it enough that today, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. Like any good drama you need to have an imperfect character in the worst situation possible (a perky if lonely teenager who's the new kid in school getting bullied by a future girlfriend's ex) and this one does not disappoint. Even better is the lessons Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita in a well-deserved Oscar Nominated performance!) gives to Daniel LaRusso about karate and life itself. And last, but certainly not least is the action sequences. Well choreographed, exciting with the tournament settings, and most importantly the final bout ends on a sweet note. If you need something uplifting, this could be one of your choices.",

This is a great story of how a teenage boy moves across the country and deals with girls, bullies, and trying to defend himself. Movies like this only come around once in a while. The acting was very convincing, the storyline was excellent, and Ralph Macchio is definitely one of a kind, and even though he was twenty-three while filming this, he COULD pass for 15, no doubt of it. I recommend this movie for anyone, it doesn't matter if they're eight years old or eighty years old. I know they'll enjoy this movie.

The film builds towards its eventual ending perfectly and if you don't let out a cheer when Daniel wins, there's something wrong with you.There's alot of different characters, and even the side characters are very distinguishable between each other.There's is alot of funny moments as well, what made me laugh the most was the fly scene. And the character development of Mr Miyagi really brings the story the together.The Karate tournament was much shorter than I expected. But because it wasn't stretched out, I did not find it boring at all. And I like the fact that they didn't just show Daniels fights only, they showed the fights from The Cobra Kai Dojo aswell so it added more to story at the end.This movie was more emotional than I thought. And I would recommend everyone to watch this especially if you haven't seen it yet.",

            "content": "The Karate Kid is one of many feel good movies that packs a powerful entertaining punch. Ralph Macchio plays Danny Larusso, who moves from New Jersey to California when his mother gets a job transfer. He tries to make friends, but can't seem to fit in with the new community. He has eyes for a girlfriend who recently broke up with \"Johnny,\" the main bully character in the film. A jealous Johnny and his friends are also top Karate students at a local gym, run by a sadistic instructor who encourages his students to fight dirty, never back down, as well as to inflict punishment and pain.Daniel took Karate in New Jersey at the local YMCA. But Johnny and his motorcycle friends are tormenting him at every opportunity. A few black eyes and kicks to the body later, Daniel seeks help from their apartment maintenance man, Mr. Miyagi, a wise Karate mentor, who learned from his father that fighting should always be a last resort. He shows Daniel how Karate can be used as an art form, to instill discipline in a positive way. Mr. Miyagi says that Karate should come from the heart, not the fist. He instills gradual self confidence in Daniel by teaching him poise, balance, and coordination exercises through discipline, timing and perseverance. (i.e \" Show me, \"Wax On Wax Off\" Washing a car, \"Show me Paint a Fence, Show me, Sand A Floor.\") At first, Daniel fails to see how these exercises relate to Karate and while initially resenting them, he begins to form a very touching, emotional bond with Miyagi, who enters Daniel in the big Karate tournament, where the final match is against his nemesis \"Johnny.\" The ending is predictable, but worth waiting for, created by the same director who did \"Rocky\" and \"Lean on Me,\" John Avildsen, you know the formula works....well almost.Bill Conti's music is great and sunny scenic California never looked better. Daniel's mother Lucille also provides strong support, and Pat Morita's \"Miyagi\" is deserving of an Oscar. The problem is with lead character, Ralph Macchio.For some reason, listening to his voice and looking at him reminds me of scraping fingernails on a blackboard. It's understandable for him to take on a \"wuss\" persona early on in the film. But the problem is, the character inside of him doesn't change where you WANT to root for him. Ralph's enthusiasm from within just isn't there. The birthday party scene is supposed to be one of the film's highlights. But Ralph's lines seem forced, \"Oh gee, this is great. You did so much already.\" In the big tournament, when Daniel gets his big win, you don't get the type of emotional high that this movie wants you to have. The reason is because Macchio's persona is somehow more naturally annoying that inspiring.This movie miscast Ralph Macchio as the main character. It needed someone you could really cheer for and care about such as Sean Astin in \"Rudy\", (who would have been great in this role.) a Morgan Freeman in \"Lean on Me\", Edward James Olmos from \"Stand and Deliver\", Sean Penn in \"Bad Boys\", Tim Robbins in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" or Sylvester Stallone from \"Rocky.\" Ralph Macchio just lacks that type of charisma that is needed that would have made this movie a \"classic.\" instead of very good. Survivor's \"The Moment of Truth\" as the credits roll, (shamefully not in some TV prints due to copyright issues) is one of the great inspirational songs of any movie. However, Ralph Macchio takes what could have been an awe inspiring powerful knockout film and brings it down to the level of asking, \"If only it wasn't him, imagine what could have been.\"",

Johnny has his friends and they are all bullies with a lot of mouth and a pack attitude. They know just enough martial arts to put on a tough front and La Russo is not strong enough and lacks in self esteem. Ali is more mature but she likes La Russo's innocence and unpretentious ways. He is a charmer.The writers did a super job focusing on personality and discipline and less on martial art technique. Mr Myagi chooses to level the playing field and teach La Russo what he needs to survive. La Russo does that and more as he follows Myagi's lead and goes to the Tournament with confidence.Fortunately Mr Myagi and Ali do a good job of deception and convince the judges and Tournament officials that Mr Myagi has a dojo and Ali is serving as his interpreter. All goes well as La Russo defeats is opponents in single elimination bouts. La Russo and Lawrence both win their bouts and meet in the final match. Lawrence's sensai forces Lawrence to use an illegal move to injure La Russo and give a decided edge to Lawrence. This does not set well with Lawrence as he is confident he can beat La Russo without cheating. Lawrence relents and uses the illegal move injuring La Russo.

            "content": "The Karate Kid (1984) is a movie where persistence and hard work shows that good can win over evil utilizing a high school karate theme.\nA poor Italian kid by the name of Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio), moved with his mother, Lucille LaRusso (Randell Heller), from New Jersey to Los Angeles, not knowing anybody, and placed in a school system with students from wealthy families. Daniel wins the attention of Ali (Elisabeth Shue) who broke up with one of the most popular, athletic, and wealthy boys, Johnny (William Zebka), in school. This flourishing relationship creates resentment toward Daniel from Ali's and Johnny's friends. Johnny and his Cobra Kai karate friends try to intimidate Daniel to keep him away from Ali.\nMr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the apartment maintenance man, takes Daniel under his wing to train him in Karate. Both characters were going through hard times in theirs lives. As this duo created a stronger friendship and team, they engaged the audience to cheer for them as the underdog.\nTo stop the bullying, an agreement was established between Karate instructors (Mr. Miyagi and the Cobra Kai Sensei) where Daniel could not be touched by Johnny and the students of Cobra Kai while training for the upcoming karate tournament. The tournament symbolizes the final battle where Johnny/Sensei can get their revenge on Daniel/Mr. Miyagi. Similar to the movie Rocky, the main actor, Sylvester Stallone, was a poor, out of shape, underdog who had to work hard to reach his goal in an another competitive sport movie where it comes down to a final match between the two rivals.\nThe director, John Avildsen, uses a popular song from 1984, Cruel Summer by Bananarama, to reinforce the difficulty of moving to a cruel place without knowing anyone, while also making a connection with the audience using a song that was a 1984 hit.\nCreative costuming was used during the Halloween party scene to differentiate good versus evil. Daniel's homemade costume was a tall shower with red curtain to conceal himself from the bullies who were dressed as powerful and intimidating skeletons.\nThis action film compares to another 1984 movie, The Terminator, where you have good versus evil. Sarah Connor is equal to Daniel and fighting against the Terminator who is like Johnny. Karate Kid is a more realistic and relatable movie compared to a futuristic cyborg that travels back in time.\nWhere the Karate Kid has its flaw is being able to train and become a black belt within a few months span and defeat a highly skilled Karate student. A weakness within the plot was the unrealistic spiritual powers that Mr. Miyagi had to heal Daniel's shoulder and knee. Due to cheating, Daniel's knee was severely injured and he was about to quit the tournament, when Mr. Miyagi rubs his hands together and places it on the knee; thereby, curing the injury to let him return to the final championship match.\nThis action packed movie will tug at the heart strings, have you on the edge of your seat, and cheering for the disadvantaged underdog teenager who is trying to overcome the evil in his current life.",

Like in my review of the remake, the plot is about a boy and his mother were moving in from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles, California as our main hero makes friends with a beautiful girl, while gets pushed by a bully as a man in his 50s comes into the boy's life to train him how to fight. That is what the premise of this movie is, because there is nothing different as what the remake did. So, with that said, I thought \"The Karate Kid\" is a fine coming of age martial arts movie. It is not my favorite John G. Avildsen movie as much as I love his other movie \"Rocky,\" but that is just me. Avildsen does a great on directing the movie as what he does, when he is telling a story and knowing where to point the camera at. I thought the performance between Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita both have a great chemistry with each other, and they are both Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi. Elisabeth Shue does fine as the love interest, but it doesn't go well when her character becomes a cop out in the second movie which I will talk about that later. Robert Mark Kamen's script is extremely well written, and I thought he written really well on how to develop a great story and characters. Bill Conti's score is just as great as what he did with \"Rocky;\" although I like his music in \"Rocky\" more. The fight scenes in the movie is very well choreographed as what the remake did in its own way as the movie is more on Karate as the remake is more on Kung-Fu. Some parts of the movie are slow, which they should have cut a few minutes of scenes to keep the pacing going along. Nevertheless, I was still keeping interest. So, that is how far I can say about this movie. I really enjoy it , and I will give you my thoughts on the second movie. I give \"The Karate Kid\" a 9 out of 10.",

One of the most memorable scenes in this movie is the wax on, wax off technique which has been a staple in the martial arts genre and gets parodied all the time. The story played out so well and that's thanks to the great characters. Sure it may be dated in some spots and it's kind of hokey, it's so enjoyable you forget about all that.

Many of the reviewers here have pointed out that the underlying theme of THE KARATE KID is that if you persevere, in the face of overwhelming odds, then you're sure to succeed. I heard this philosophy again when I saw Mary J Blige perform in London in June 2006. Mary enjoyed pointing out to the audience between songs that they mustn't listen to people who tell them they can't achieve whatever they want through believing in themselves.I believe this is an ill-considered and inappropriate assertion to make and quite probably the cause of so much of the anger and frustration we see today, especially in urban youths.Look, I can't carry a tune in a bucket. So no amount of perseverance and tenacity will ever turn me into a world-class opera singer. It's fine for Mary to say, in her experience, believing in herself helped make her a big star - but Mary, love, your fabulous soul voice played a small part in that.Equally with Daniel LaRusso - yes, his stick-to-it character was able to improve his karate to the point where he was able to defeat the bad guys, but that was Daniel's path. Another character may not have benefited so much from the teachings of Mr Miyagi.So the message should be, we can achieve highly if we have the strength of character to carry on when it seems all is against us, PROVIDED we have some degree of talent in our chosen field.To tell youngsters otherwise is foolish and harmful and I wish to blazes our role models would think it through before they offer us life advice ...",

Before too long he is attacked by The Cobras, a group of karate students whose leader used todate a girl named Ali (Elisabeth Shue) who takes an interest in Danny.After just one too many beatings, plus the discovery that an old man namedMiyagi (Pat Morita) knows karate, Danny decides that he must learn karate.However, can he last through Miyagi's unorthodox teaching methods?This film used to be quite amusing, and is one of the few Western filmscontaining martial arts that shows some of the martial spirit (in an unusual way), but now it looks rather dated and tacky. Knowing from other movies that PatMorita can speak English a lot better than he does here is a little insulting. Also, what exactly is the Crane stance -- a kung-fu stance -- doing in a film about karate?Its only real saving grace these days is that many parents will not feel that it's something they should shield from their little 'uns (fortunately it's not excessively violent), provided that they take on board that martial arts are not to be used aggressively.Look out for Chad McQueen (son of legendary Steve) as one of the Cobras.",

While I didn't' learn from an unlikely master, I did learn over my years of training the spiritual aspects of the martial arts.The fights scenes are simple and not over the top. The acting is done very well, and the coming of age theme is done very well.I've many of the types of people in the film in real life. The martial arts master who promotes physical force, instead of using your mind. The young male, who gets bullied, the person you would least expect to be a martial arts master, etc.Overall this is a great film, that everyone should watch at least once in their life.",

I think that the defining performance in this film has to be Pat Morita. He plays a very good mentor character. The one part in the film that got to me the most was when Daniel walks in on Miyagi drinking, and he listens to his story of how his wife and unborn child died. This was actually the scene that got Morita his Oscar nomination. There is also a great message of friendship tied in. The bond that Miyagi and Daniel have in this film is unforgettable. The love interest aspect is a little overrated between Macchio and Shue, but this was included in a lot of the movies at this time, so I guess that is okay. Also, there has been talk of Ralph Macchio being extremely \"whiny\" in this film, which is pretty much true, but I think it works for this film because Macchio is trying to depict a boy who does not understand why he is getting beat up and what Karate is actually about. If you want to see a movie that has a great moral and overall message, then this movie is for you. Check it out!",

I smiled at the prospect of one of the bullies being kicked in the crotch hard enough to ensure that he would never have children. Good move! Same guy was kicked in the leg and arm. It would have been great if either or both limbs were broken. I would have killed Johnny, slowly and painfully. I'm sorry, but in the real world, kids are killing kids. That's exactly what the bullies were trying to do to Daniel. They weren't beating him up. They were trying to kill him. I especially would have also liked to see Miyagi dump the sadistic Kreese in the garbage dumpster. The baddies are p***ed off at Daniel for surviving, and it shows. If you ask me, bullies get off far too easy in films. Just once, I would love to see the good guy kill the bad guy instead of just defeat him. Give the bully exactly what is deserved!",

            "content": "(** a minor spoiler or two herein**) When I saw this at the theater upon release I knew that what I'd just seen was essentially a less gritty and considerably lighter rerun of \"Rocky\" for a younger set, substituting karate for boxing and the sunny environs of 'the Valley' for Philly's urban decay but otherwise constructed of the same kinds of elements.   That familiar story though, already familiar enough in its essentials when \"Rocky\" came out, is one that movie audiences apparently have yet to tire of.  It works for me, anyway -- I loved this film when it came out and I still watch it with a great deal of affection. As is true of many movies from the '70s and '80s, part of the appeal for me and probably for many others has to do with nostalgia.  In my case, at the time of the film's release I was just a couple of years or so older than the film's characters, had long been silently infatuated with a girl who looked more than vaguely reminiscent of Elisabeth Shue (if the Shue fits...), and a few years before had suffered a disastrous introduction to martial arts under the sadistic tutelage of a karate teacher who made Martin Kove's scarily sociopathic bad seed look like Mary Poppins.  One of the story elements in \"The Karate Kid\" relates to the fact that the teacher -- of martial arts or anything else -- can make all the difference.  The casting of Pat Morita and Martin Kove as skilled karateka with diametrically-opposed philosophies also works both as a cultural commentary (brash, materialistic, goal-oriented West versus the more multifaceted, humble, centered East) and as an embodiment of the yin-yang principle of opposites.  For my part, I can certainly testify that Martin Kove's nasty meat-axe of a character is, unfortunately, nowhere near as over-the-top as many might think.  Luckily, Mr Miyagi's character (that Pat Morita does an exquisite job with) is also not at all far-fetched in terms of his teacherly attributes. A lot's changed since \"The Karate Kid\" came out.  Elisabeth Shue has gone on to critical raves for later roles (I have no idea where her semi-lookalike is these days) and I ended up living not only in the US but, for several years, not too far from where the action in \"Karate Kid\" unfolds.  I've also been training in Chinese martial arts (commonly known as 'kung fu') since 1986 -- and, no, as far as I'm aware this movie was no influence on that, though my earlier negative experience with the Sensei Kreese clone kept me from getting back on that particular horse for long enough.  As my experience with and knowledge of martial arts grew I saw that this film has one flaw of particular note regarding martial arts training: Daniel's learning enough within a few months to effect a tournament win is unrealistic and only reinforces the con-job claims of some 'instant masters' that they can turn anyone into a lethal weapon within such-and-such a timespan.  Then again, compression of time was necessary for the narrative and -- besides -- early in the film Daniel claims to have learned some karate at a New Jersey YMCA.  I'll give them that one, in the interest of dramatic license.  On the bright side, the philosophies expressed and implied within \"The Karate Kid,\" including those that point out the hidden value of techniques for which martial application is not obvious (\"wax on, wax off\"), are generally consistent with those that form part of the morality base of traditional Asian martial arts.  They're also philosophies that more youth -- particularly in the US -- could do well to adopt, embody, and live by.  If this film still gets young people into martial arts (as long as the teacher's a good one, more Miyagi than Kreese), so much the better for them, for their families, and for society. This is one of a few films that I can painlessly watch again and again and I think that it's held its own very well over the years.  It's hardly a deep movie (neither is it completely shallow), but sometimes that's a good thing.  By the way, I'm still just beginning to cope with the discovery that the blond leader of the Cobra Kai group of teens was William Zabka -- I'd always thought that he was Vince Van Patten, who I could swear looked exactly the same back in the '70s.  Then again, it seems like everyone on TV and in the movies back then had that California blond beach god or goddess thing going on...",

When Daniel seems to get beaten pretty badly, he becomes friends with the Handyman, Mr. Miyagi.

Despite the coincidences, I've only seen this movie a few times; I don't think I've seen the sequels yet. If there were references in my karate class to it, they would have flown over my head because I don't think I'd seen the movie until I was older. (Wondering if my mom was a fan; the karate tournament is hosted on her birthday.)I like it, though, and it's in my personal library because I asked for it. There are many memorable, defining scenes: \"Wax On, Wax Off,\" \"Beginner's Luck,\" the training montage. The characters are relatable and the\nstory's morals of perseverance and facing your fears are presented well. I'm big on climactic, \"moment of truth\" end fights -- for example, Rocky (especially IV) and\nBloodsport -- but I didn't feel as excited for this one's.

Daniel is a bullied teenager who is not so pleased with moving in CA and constantly complaining to his mother that he wished they didn't move there at all. I think that Daniel was written as a tender teenage boy and a gentle soul and all of that makes me think of a \"good guy\" image. Ralph Macchio doesn't give that vibe and i don't think that he's the right choice for the role.

            "content": "According to Mr Miyagi, Rule Number One for karate is that \"karate is for defence only\". According to me, rule number one of reviewing a movie is \"don't judge a film by its sequel\". I could explain how in Cobra Kai, Johnny Lawrence is an unreliable narrator and as such his assertion that Daniel-San's iconic crane kick was illegal is utter nonsense and if I ever review Cobra Kai, then I probably will. But as I'm reviewing the actual movie from 1984, Cobra Kai does not matter. I don't have to regard Billy Zabka's character of Johnny Lawrence as being abandoned by his father and having an emotionally abusive stepfather because the movie has absolutely no indication of that whatsoever. I don't have to regard Sensei John Kreese as someone who was forged from weakling to warrior by maltreatment and lashing out at others due to being traumatized by the Vietnam War because the movie has absolutely no indication whatsoever that that's the case. I don't have to pretend that Daniel LaRusso was the real bully in The Karate Kid when the movie could hardly be more clear about the fact that that isn't the case.Daniel LaRusso is well-played by Ralph Macchio and is a likeable though flawed character. He seems nice enough at the beginning of the film and has a good dynamic with his love interest Alli to the point where when he responds to being tormented by Billy Zabka's character of Johnny Lawrence and the other thugs and responds by angrily lashing out, Daniel remains a sympathetic figure. And his attempts to troll Johnny Lawrence and the others are genuinely funny.At this point, I have to talk about it, since the false claim that Daniel was the real bully was around long before Cobra Kai was aired on YouTube Red. So here's the timeline proving it wrong1) Johnny Lawrence saw Daniel flirting with Alli and was angry that Daniel was flirting with his girlfriend only for Bobby to remind Johnny that Alli had already dumped him\n2) Johnny Lawrence physically pushed Daniel out of the way so that he could talk to Alli.3) Johnny demanded that Alli talk to him despite her telling him she was unwilling to listen to anything he had to say to her and turning on her boom box to drown out what he was saying and Johnny angrily grabbed it out of her hands\n4) Johnny smashed Alli's boom box after he returned it to her and she turned it back on\n5) Daniel objected to Johnny having done that\n6) Johnny threw the boom box at Daniel with considerable force\n7) Daniel retaliated by attacking Johnny with his own amateur Karate that he learned in New Jersey at the YMCA\n8) Johnny fought back against Daniel and won\n9) Johnny brought in his pals to give Daniel a thorough thrashing\n10) Bobby tells Johnny that Daniel's had enough punishment at this point only for Johnny to reply \"he's had enough when I say he's had enough\".11) Johnny and pals deliberately sabotaged Alli's soccer tryouts to provoke in Daniel into a fight and gets Daniel into a trouble for it and Alli banned from soccer\n12) Daniel visits the Cobra Kai karate dojo in the hopes of learning to defend himself from Johnny but leaves when he realizes that it's where Johnny trains\n13) Johnny and his friends deliberately collide themselves and their motorcycles with Daniel's bicycle and push him off a hill while taunting him for not being able to fight back\n14) Daniel fears going to the Halloween party since he knows that Johnny will be there and is likely to let his wrath flare against him if he flirts with Alli again so Mr. Miyagi dresses Daniel up as a shower.15) Daniel hoses Johnny in a bathroom for revenge and Johnny and his friends decide to teach Daniel a painful lesson for so doing\n16) Bobby posits that they've inflicted enough suffering on Daniel that he will be sufficiently deferential to Johnny from now on but Johnny refuses to stop because \"the enemy deserves no mercy\" and after seeing this Mr. Miyagi intercedes on Daniel's behalf.17) Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to teach him karate to exact revenge on Johnny Lawrence but Mr. Miyagi refuses since he doesn't believe karate should be used for non-defensive purposes\n18) Mr. Miyagi takes Daniel to Cobra Kai Karate to explain the situation to Sensei John Kreese in the hopes of him telling his students to end their bullying and Sensei Kreese instead responds by demanding that Daniel fight his students and win with Miyagi agreeing on the condition that their match be in the Under 18 All Valley Karate tournament and that Kreese's disciples leave Daniel untouched until then.19) Sensei Kreese agrees on the condition that if Daniel doesn't show up to the tournament then he can tell Johnny and the others that it's open season on Daniel LaRusso.So yes, Billy Zabka's character of Johnny Lawrence really was the bully in The Karate Kid. There isn't any ambiguity here.Pat Morita plays Mr. Miyagi quite well and the scene where he reveals the nature of \"wax on, wax off\" to Daniel-San is as great as it always was. And despite having a sense of humour and being a bit of a trickster mentor in addition to being quite sage, he has a heart wrenching and sympathetic backstory.The love triangle of Daniel, Johnny and Alli was quite well-handled. And I love what the movie did with Bobby as a character who has a conscience but still goes along to get along but looks upon what he's done with horror after the fact. (When he deliberately breaks Daniel's leg to put him out of commission because Sensei Kreese doesn't want him beaten but broken.).While Martin Klove does an excellent job as the villainous Sensei Kreese. And the movie has excellent lessons. To take one example, Mr. Miyagi tells Daniel \"Always scared. Miyagi hate to fight\" with Daniel replying \"But you like karate and karate is fighting. You train to fight.\" with Mr. Miyagi responding \"Is that why you train?\" and Daniel responding \"no.\" and when Mr. Miyagi asks why he does then, Daniel responds \"so that I don't have to fight\".And Daniel internalizing Mr. Miyagi's lesson about balance was great. As was the ending when Johnny Lawrence was gracious enough to accept his defeat and hand the first place trophy to Daniel telling him \"You deserve it. LaRusso, you're all right\" while Daniel's romantic relationship with Alli is healed and Mr. Miyagi beams with pride towards Daniel-San.I know this movie is sometimes criticized for being \"black and white\" and frankly I think that that's an appallingly idiotic criticism. Not because the movie isn't \"black and white\" but because having a \"black and with\" conception of morality isn't actually bad. (I'll explain that further if I ever review Cobra Kai.)So how does this movie hold up? Pretty well. It's a rightly iconic film.",

            "content": "No human is perfect, every human has flaws, some have more flaws than others and as this film points out rather well, some humans seem to have more luck than others. This movie really makes me sympathise with Johnny and Daniel, with Daniel having so much bad luck at the beginning of the movie whilst Johnny's life was turned upside down by the end of the movie.The plot of this movie is very deep and complex if you think about it in the right way. I won't list all the plot elements of this movie which I found very interesting and complex as there's so many but I found the way Daniel had to lose contact with his friends because his Mum wanted to move to a different place for a better job to be quite interesting, especially when it proved difficult for Daniel to make new friends at the beginning of the movie and when he started getting bullied. Making new friends isn't easy in a place far from any places you've been in your life so that part of the movie makes me question Lucille LaRusso's intelligence and love for her Son.Of course the relationship between Daniel and Johnny in the film is a very complex one, ultimately both characters did some nasty things in the movie but it's very debatable as to who was most to blame of the two. A part of me wanted Daniel to just go back to living at his previous address so that Johnny and Daniel could leave each other alone as whilst they were in each other's lives back in the 1980's, they always seemed to make each other's lives worse, especially as Johnny still had so much to lose (and went on to lose it all) at this point. The rather unfortunate unlucky events of Johnny in the later part of the movie such as Ali becoming the girlfriend of his worst enemy and then going on to lose the All Valley Tournament made it seem like in a way God was punishing Johnny for perhaps being a bit too rough with Daniel but unfortunately this was pushed too far to the point where Johnny's later life experiences more than enough made up for what his slight overreaction to Daniel. The action scenes in this movie are very entertaining but there's not too much action to the point there's little character development.The Karate Kid was one of the big reasons which led me to learning Karate when I was a kid so this film will always be rather special, nostalgic and meaningful to me. I find the Karate Kid very emotional and I think the characters are all above average. Johnny is my favourite character (and one of my favourite characters of all time) from the movie and I relate a lot to Johnny in terms of seeming to have a lot of bad luck and once being happy when I was a very young and then losing all of it in later life. Johnny is quite similar to me in many ways which makes him a more interesting and likeable character for me. The Cobra Kai TV series makes this film even greater due to more information on the characters in the film as well as knowing what the fate of the main characters will be 34 years later. All the characters (except the ones with less than a minute of screen time) all seem to have so much personality in this movie.This movie is well above average from start to finish, with a minor exception of a very short part of the movie where Daniel finds out there's a problem with his homes tap (faucet for American readers) and I just thought that part of the movie was rather pointless, boring and unnecessary. I'm not sure why this film's makers thought that would be a interesting and necessary thing to put in the movie but as that part of the film is only a few measly seconds it really doesn't do anything to destroy the overall quality of this movie.The Karate Kid is one of the best movies of all time for me and I highly recommend The Karate Kid to everyone but in particular those who are going through difficult times in their life or simply love martial arts.",

            "content": "SPOILERS....I bought the DVD and saw this movie again for the first time in years.  I remembered siding with Daniel as a youngster, but upon further review I find myself siding with Cobra Kai for the extermination of this little punk who is supposedly from Newark, as if he wouldn't get his ass kicked there too.  That's another thing I didn't get, he moves from Newark, where supposedly he was bad-ass, to a ritzy high school in CA and now he starts getting into fights?  I don't think there is a person on the planet, except for people with down syndrome and Foley, who couldn't beat up LaRusso.  Anyway, here's why I hate Larusso and think he's a punk who deserved to get his ass kicked every second of that movie.1) first time larusso meets Johnny Lawrence, (brilliantly played by Wiliam Zabka), Larusso is hitting on JL's ex, who by the way isn't his type. Larusso needs some trampy jersey girl cause he's too much of a wuss to hook up with anyone else.  Anyway, JL just wants to chat with his old woman and larusso butTs his pathetic ass in and starts looking for trouble, obviously JL beats the crap out of him.2) Larusso is trying out for the soccer team, which in the mold of She's All That is the big sport at the school (note that schools like this are completely queer), anyway Bobby slide tackles Larusso, legally might I add, and Larusso goes crazy tackling Bobby to the ground, he then drills him in the face.  Bobby laughs because getting punched by Larusso would be like getting into a pillow fight with a small Pakistani baby.  Then the coach kicks Larusso out of tryouts, it's usually not a good idea to start a fight during them, especially when you're a wuss.3) Lawrence and the crew are finished with larusso, as far as they're concerned he doesn't exist.  However, Larusso is still looking for trouble. At the halloween party at the school JL is minding his own business smoking a J in one of the stalls and Larusso decides it would be a great idea to douse him with a hose.  Obviously the Cobra Kai crew chase him for a while and beat the crap out of him, which he easily deserved.  JL even had the line \"you couldn't leave well enough alone could you Larusso...\", JL was ready to ignore Larusso but he had to keep pushing them.  Who does that? Who starts fights with 6 guys who could all kick your ass?  That would be like me walking into the NY Giants locker room and kicking Shockey in the balls, just a stupid idea regardless of the security breach.Thus, Larusso is a wuss who deserved everything he had before he started training with Miagi.  Although my ending of this movie would have had the fat guy from Cobra Kai winning the All Valley under 18 tourney, he was a real darkhorse.  Also notice how everyone at Cobra Kai was a black belt except for the fat kid and the black kid (lamar from Nerds), makes you think if Sensai was some sort of Nazi, I posit he was.",

            "content": "This movie is a guilty pleasure for me, because my brain recognizes how silly it is, but I always come back and watch it again.  Any movie, let alone a trilogy, which takes an irritating, unlikeable whiner and makes him the heroic protagonist deserves some respect, at least for overcoming the hurdles associated with making an unlikeable character likeable.  See also, Star Wars.Ralph Macchio explodes onto the screen as Daniel Larusso, the aformentioned whiner.  The kid gets into fist fights over boomboxes, steals a guy's girlfriend, hoses the guy down at the school dance, and blames the subsequent problems on his \"stupid bike.\"  He is, for lack of a better word, a bonehead.  Who WOULDN'T love this crazy all-American teen?Then Pat Morita steps in to give Daniel some much-needed direction.  His attempts to help are greeted with more and more whining.  But through months of zen floorwax training, Daniel-san becomes the grandmaster of Miyagido Karate and proves once and for all that violence really IS the answer.Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that contributes to the general American non-understanding of Asian cultures, with its stereotypically eccentric Mr. Miyagi, but Kreese (the EVIL karate instructor!) is equally eccentric, so I guess I forgive the filmmakers for that.A word on this movie's soundtrack:  Gnarly!  During the beach party sequence, we are treated to a rapidfire trio of obscure 80s pop tunes (possibly \"fake songs,\" written especially for the movie, but I'm not sure about that).  And during the tournament scene, you'll be dancing like a dork to the motivational hit \"You're the Best Around (No One's Ever Gonna Keep You Down)!\" or whatever that song's called, I don't know.FUN FACT:  I used to have this movie on VHS.  I copied it from my local video store.  But the movie is more than two hours long, and I used SP speed to tape it...so right after Kreese says, \"sweep the leg,\" and Daniel's knee is apparently crushed, the tape ends, with Daniel crumpled on the floor in a heap, gasping for life.  It's GREAT.",

Following the story of the underdog coming good, the Karate Kid is one of those films that has you glued to the screen even though you know how it will turn out. Daniel moves from his home town to Calafornia with his mum and immediately starts to get bullied by a load of kids at his school who are also a bit handy when it comes to Karate. The local handyman at the housing area he lives at, teaches him karate in a very unorthadox manner but also teaches him more about life. There a a number of points in this film that make it seem a lot more realistic than other movies of this type. The fact that Daniel has not got a father and the fact he and his mum live in a very modest flat rather than the usual mansion you see in movies, make it easier to identify with the story. The ending still has the hairs on my neck standing up. Macchio turns in a brilliant performance and the soundtrack is superb in an 80's cheesy way!!!!! 5/5 for a memorable, feel good film!",

I first saw it when I was six and I instantly wanted to watch the sequels that were already out when I saw the original. The final fight scene has become a classic and everyone remembers the crane technique in the final bout. I have watched that about ten times now and everytime it gives me goosebumps! That scene symbolised two things. One was that anybody can overcome the odds if they are willing to fight for it and the second is the mind overcomes the body in all cases. Essentially, karate is a mind over body art and the film shows this as the Cobra Dojo, with its strictly physical regimes, are the losers in the end. It is perhaps the best low budget film of the 80's. Ralph Macchio acts the weakling well and it is a shame he didn't become bigger because of this film. A must see even if the average rating does not signify it as a classic.",

It is the ultimate story of the underdog beating the odds. This theme had been done in movies and tv long before Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita waxed on and waxed off - and it has been done a million times since. But, at least in my experience, it is only once in a blue moon that a movie creates a story and a character that it is so easy to identify with.maybe I am a product of the time I grew up - but i am confident that whatever age I am when I watch this movie, I will be able to relate with Daniel LaRusso - and judging from a lot of the user comments i read, a lot of you agree with me. This is why the grade confuses me, but whatever.This movie is solid all the way through - the acting is fantastic from Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elisabeth Shue - and the very underrated William Zabka, who played Johnny lawrence, the leader of the Cobras who will always in this guy's mind - be the prototypical bully. i also feel i should mention that this movie is put over the top and into the \"classic\" category because it has easily one of the best endings of all time.

Miyagi is indeed a famous surname of Okinawan martial artists; Karate used everyday work implements and movements as part of secretive training to avoid detection by Chinese and Japanese conquerors. (Even the American occupation is hinted at in one of the sequels).  Okinawans are renowned for using their karate skills only for defensive purposes.   The Chinese predecessors to Karate (particularly the style called Kung Fu [Chuan Fa] in the West) took many movements from nature (e.g.: Crane Style); mostly Western, non-traditional accoutrements include the belt system, exhibition sparring, etc.  Breaking bottles is the most extreme and advanced form of a speed break (don't try this at home kids :-) ).  \"Focus all your power in this one punch\"; \"Karate not just way to fight, Karate way to live\"; \"Do Karate Yes, do Karate No, not 'Do Karate guess-so\"; are all integral parts of what martial artists of any style are expected to learn.  \"Best block, not to be there\" is something I think about every time I spar.  Yes, elevating the Crane style \"#4 jump front kick\" (as it's referred to in my current style) to something mystical was unfortunate, as was the \"always look eyes\" (considered disrespectful and a sign of distrust in ALL Asian cultures AFAIK), but overall a much more informative and enjoyable movie than most of the films Hong Kong seems to churn out by the hour.",

Nearly every professional critic I've read thoroughly enjoyed The Karate Kid, and was touched by its heartwarming story. ESPN even ranked it as the #1 SPORTS MOVIE OF ALL-TIME. The Karate Kid is one of those magical movies where everything falls into place. The casting is brilliant, the score uplifting, and the acting spot-on. If you're reading this review and have yet to see the movie, I'd suggest that you ignore the low rating on this website and watch it now! You won't be sorry...MY RATING: An enthusiastic 4.5 Stars out of 5",

            "content": "You're the best around; nothing's ever going to bring you down. Truly words to live by. The Karate Kid is the timeless and shape shifting fable of a disproportionate teenage male overcoming the odds and kicking an utter scum in the face. To do this, he uses sympathy to trick a withering, Japanese puppet into teaching him how to perform manual labour. The most effective strategy of all.The film absorbs the aura of the entire 1980s and spews it unto celluloid. Montages are more commonplace than shoes and people actually meet in person, a practice that was lost with the advent of radio waves. The maturity of this cinematic cheese is what makes the film so enjoyable. While the ending is more predictable than an arithmetic sequence, you purely want this skinny human beat a slightly less skinny human to a human pulp. This comes about because of the numerous scenes they spend showing this gang of karate wielding victimising the protagonist.None of the characters seem quite real. Our \"relatable\" protagonist, Danny, is magnetic to his fellow characters but honestly just acts like a pretentious cocky scumbag. Showing off his skills at keeping a sports sphere airborne as a sort of mating call. The martial arts mentor, Miyagi, is a cackling, reclusive goblin whose origins are simplistically vague. He's enjoyable to watch because he the wittiest retired, Japanese army general in California. The screenwriter seemed to think it a good idea to make Miyagi more human by giving him a slightly less cheery backstory. Does it mean anything? No! Not mentioned by Danny. Not mentioned by Miyagi but mentioned by me. The scene felt entirely pointless.What I did very much like about the film is the message to both the characters and the viewers that martial arts are not just punching people as many movies (which are admittedly still excellent) may portray. It's important to remember that these forms of self-defence are such. Along with this is strapped another message of balance in life. While vague, the message will forever be pertinent.While the fight scenes are not near as jaw-dropping as other films bound with the martial arts label, the underdog story is truly the backbone of the film. I wanted the blonde scumbag to get kicked in the face so much that I wasn't too concerned with the visual spectacle of the combat. The main characters were often nearing levels of contempt rivalling that of the movie's villains and one scene is entirely unnecessary. Nevertheless, the film is wholly enjoyable.",

            "content": "I've heard it said that psychologists have found that certain films can promote certain emotional healings. When I think back on this gem of a film, it certainly brings back a barrage of emotions. It always reminds me of those times when bullies made my school days miserable, and I felt like a weakling, unable to steer my own destiny. In \"The Karate Kid\" I found a comrade in spirit with Daniel. He fought back only when pressed from all sides, and no other avenue of escape existed. Even when faced with the \"no mercy\" and \"unfair\" methods, Daniel San still presses on -- courageous --determined and encouraged by his mentor to do the honorable thing. The most disappointing aspect of the movie? Only having the pan-and-scan version on the DVD. I'd think that the studios would clamor at the chance to give this film a first-class presentation. Widescreen and Dolby 5.1 would restore the quality of this wonderful film and build on the emotional crush that the film delivers... So that when Daniel faces his adversaries, and the crowd cheers him on, I can FEEL his fear and anxiety. An experience like this is only heightened by the visual and audio impact of Daniel's victory. And in that moment, as I sit immersed in that feeling.. those memories from my own life replay.... and from that comes the reminder, that like Daniel, I've ended up victorious! Man, what a movie. Can't wait to see this film with a decent treatment!",

            "content": "There is an oft missed juxtaposition of \"good v bad teaching\" and the careless automatic assumption that Johnny and the other bullies are bad per se.This is often a result of the most mis-quoted quotes in the movie: It's NOT \"No sucha ting as baad student, only baad teachah.\"' It's \"No sucha ting as baad student, only baad teachah; teachah say, student do.\" It's that last part that is most important to making the first part true.In the original, the good teacher is Myagi of course and the bad is the Army dude.ALL students (including Johnny and the other bullies) are \"good\" in the sense they listen to their teacher. The more cerebral perceptive viewer will feel ambivalent towards the bad-guy karate kid realizing, though Johnny's a mean bully, he's also (i) a good student listening to everything his teacher instructs, and (ii) perhaps a product or yet an innocent victim (nurture not nature) of the bad teacher...but only in the end, do some of the students of the bad teacher turn on their teacher, which raises a profound philosophical challenge to the original thesis: No such thing as a bad student only bad teacher.Now what? When is it OK to go against your teacher? What is good v bad (ie evil)? Who decides? If a good student should blindly follow the teacher (ie sand the floor), then shouldn't the bad-guy teacher's students have blindly followed everything and NOT turned against him? Maybe sweeping the leg was art of a tacit creative secretive teaching method that wasn't what it seemed - just like Daniel having to sweep the floor. Granted sweeping the leg is a flagrantly illegal and injurious act, consider the philosophical moral dilemmas in modern war fare and training.",

            "content": "It's the Ka-Rocky Kid with NY attitude! I saw this for the first time at the grand old age of 26, having endured the charm of Part II time and again on syndicated TV for too many years, and the torture of the Parts III & IV abominations.Only catching glimpses of the final All-Valley Under 18 Karate Champs between \"Daniel LaRusso\" (Ralph Macchio- The Outsiders' \"Pony Boy\") and the baddie Cobra Kai hottie \"Johhny Lawrence\" (Billy Zabka- slow-ass \"Jack\" from European Vacation) as a kid on pirated HBO sparked my imagination for far too many years. All I can say is this flick will make you get up and cheer (so I agree w/AFI- so what?!!!). Ralph Macchio plays Daniel LaRusso with so much L.I. spunk you kind of forgive that Robert Mark Kamen sets him up as a Newark native. But \"Mr. Miyagi\" (Pat Morita, bless his departed soul) is to quote Director John Avildsen, \"the ultimate surrogate dad\" ensuring that \"Daniel-san\" takes his special brand of Okinawan karate-do training to heart and keeps his temper at bay while bearing the brunt of the Cobra Kai's ruthlessness over Johnny's jealousy having lost his ex-girlfriend \"Ali (with an 'i')\" (Elisabeth Shue) to the underdog.The editing could have been done better w/spots of continuity problems, one of the most glaring is in the karate tournament/music video montage to Joe Esposito's \"You're the Best Around\" where horrifically peroxided Cobra Kai cutie bad-ass \"Dutch\" (Chad McQueen- that's Steve's baby boy) loses a fight to Daniel w/o seeing how Daniel scored the second of his 2-point bout. It's a damn shame that save for Pat Morita (got the Oscar nod for his portrayal of Miyagi) and Elisabeth Shue no one's career took off as Ralph Macchio was forever typecast as Daniel-san for the rest of his professional life along w/the promising Cobra Kai bullies, Billy Zabka who got the Oscar nod for a short film and silent \"Jimmy\" (though I firmly believe Avildsen edited his lines out) Tony O'Dell is best remembered as \"Alan\" reprising his preppie role for \"Head of The Class\". Chad McQueen a retired racer and sometimes actor is on board as executive producer of a film his dad wrote 30 years ago before his death in 1980. Rob Garrison, \"Tommy\" (\"Give 'im a body bag!\") dropped off the radar completely in the early '90s and humble \"Bobby Brown\" played by Ron Thomas the ONLY black belt at the time (now Billy Zabka an HS wrestling champ now sports one of his own b/c of the film) is a self-help guru running his own wellness clinic and dojo in Northern CA. As for Martin Kove, who exquisitely played the Cobra Kai's sadistic sensei, 'Nam vet \"Capt. John Kreese\" continues to act in bit parts.Call it 80s cheese if you like, but buy the special edition DVD and watch all the features, especially \"The Way of The Karate Kid pts. I & II\" where the writer, director and main cast members (Pat Morita is featured in the months before his death) share their feelings behind the scenes some 21 years later- Ralph is precocious as ever, Pat gets all the laughs, Martin is philosophical and Billy is hyper! As Easter eggs you get the Survior music vid to the film's ending theme, \"The Moment of Truth\" and a choreographed fight scene in Pat Johnson's gym to better understand how he worked his martial arts fight choreography and training for the film.",

Nature is no enemy although fighting spirit gains us self-respect. to grasp the balance we have to fight in a humble manner. it's no easy task. Rocky seems to convey no such kind of message. but we can find it in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. also this movie puts some doubt in my mind - can we still make a movie like that today ? certainly, but in a different style - more complicated and thus maybe less \"powerful\". perhaps sometimes a complicated message is best to be conveyed in a simple way. or maybe we should not remove all our passion from movie. today we get smarter but no doubt it costs something. one day we may have no dream anymore. things really keep changing. in 1984 i saw this movie on cinema. no way could i believe that time i would see it on computer after 20 years.

Avildsen that sees two down-in-the-dumps people, one a young teenager, one an old man, come together sharing a common goal: being able to keep away the students from the Cobra Kai dojo. Along the way, Daniel finds the father he never had in Mr. Miyagi, and Mr. Miyagi finds the son he never had in Daniel.",

            "content": "This 80's flick carries a inspiring tone, and inner breakthrough comes for those willing to embrace the 80 music, and acting! enjoy this film! Mr. Miyagi is a character of wisdom and depth. Carrying the spirit of his father, he teachers Daniel to be still and see early in the movie. And truth is in what he sees from within. This is one of the many gems from the film. You will find yourself laughing both from 80's culture and poignant character development. I personally put myself in Daniel son's shoes and the movie becomes a treat. Daniels romance throughout the film is one of the constant moments of humour. I think anyone who is seeing this film for the first time better be ready for a roundhouse kicking' time!",

            "content": "Okay, it was the 80's, and its quite chic to say how terrible that decade was for movies, clothing, hair, etc.  But c'mon, Karate Kid was a good film. It didn't break any new ground (or any ground for that matter) but it was lots of fun.  Avildsen's love for \"underdog/outsider\" movies may have been his downfall, but like \"Rocky\" before it, Karate Kid had me cheering (figuratively) for Larusso by movies end.\"It's a cruel....., cruel summer,\" and if you found yourself humming just now you are an 80's child, and doubtless saw Karate Kid two or three times. But that's okay, Karate Kid had no depth to it, but neither did it warrant any.  It is what it is, a fun, harmless, great movie going experience. And you know you had a crush on Elizabeth Shue!",

            "review_title": "A great movie with positive ideas and energy; unrepeatable",
            "content": "The Karate Kid is an excellent movie with really positive ideas especially for young people. The first part is greatly conceived: two main characters make a great team - Mr. Miyagi is a calm and dignified man specialized in martial arts, with positive and compelling life philosophy. Not only does he teach Daniel-san karate, but he also teaches him the most important values in life. He is a magnificent teacher and a wonderful friend. Daniel-san is a very simple young man with a friendly personality and strong mind, willing to fight and do good things. This first part is really a nicely done movie, with very good actors and very positive thoughts. Without Mr. Miyagi, the film probably wouldn't be the same, but it is also Daniel who brings the energy in the movie while Mr. Miyagi teaches him to find balance in life. The second part, in my opinion, was not as good as the first one, the third was good, but again, not as good as the first one, while the fourth part (The next karate kid) is definitely the worst, because that chemistry that was there with Daniel is not present any more, and in most of the movie there is not much action or energy as in the first part. Although we cannot say that the remake is bad (since Jackie Chan is a nice actor after all), it does not have the same peaceful energy and chemistry as in this movie. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel-san are a combination that is not easy to repeat. I highly recommend this movie, if you like good,positive action and master-student-relationship movies.",

It is one of the greatest movies of the 80s and a MUST SEE for everyone who has ever felt like the underdog in life! Its a movie for EVERYONE and it doesn't get not nearly the GLORY IT DESERVES.It should be noted in the hall of movie records as the best movie of its kind! Recommend to all!!",

Karate is supposed to graceful but Macchio's movements are more like drowning turkey than graceful Crane. And, he gets to beat a black belt after a couple of months?! The story was obviously not written by an Asian. Why is it Daniel-San but not Miyagi-San? Too much reliance on stereotypes.Cobra Kai series is more realistic perhaps because they have the time to flesh out the characters.",

If you watch the scene very closely, you will see its part of it. He is too drunk to actually take it off. It does not sound like liquid pouring out. He then goes and passes out. I think this was nothing more than an extended attempt by the director to show the level of intoxication by the master. You never actually see the glass with any more booze in it. So, I guess this will remain a topic of debate forever. I just think it was a scene padding. I am not sure how to report it to the goofs section, so I posted it here.",
