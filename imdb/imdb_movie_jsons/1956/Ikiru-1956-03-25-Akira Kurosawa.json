            "content": "Ikiru (\"to live\")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...",

            "review_title": "a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable",
            "content": "Akira Kurosawa knew how to get in touch with human nature through his art. With his visual expressiveness and storytelling, he could pierce through his subjects, even in his big and occasionally comical samurai films, and find the elemental things do work. What he probably learned off of Rashomon probably helped out with Ikiru (To Live), a story of an old man who finds out he will die within a year, as both stories deal with perceptions of the significance of a life spent and a life wasted. Though that was to a different degree in Rashomon, with Ikiru Kurosawa expands into full-on existentialism. The old man Kanji Watanabe (in a wholly believable and often heart-breaking performance by Takashi Shimura) knows his life hasn't amounted to much as a (chief) clerk for the city. He knows he hasn't had a great kinship with his son. He's accepting his fate with a heavy soul. One of the tenets of existentialism is that there's free-will, and the responsibility to accept what is done with one's life. Kurosawa might've (as I speculate, I don't entirely know) caught onto this for his lead, and it works, especially with the little details.Such little details, unforgettable ones, have been expounded upon by other reviewers and critics, such as the drunken, sullen singing of \"Life is short, fall in love my maiden\" in the bar. A scene like that almost speaks for itself and yet it's also subtle. But one scene that had me was one not too many talk about. It's when Watanabe is in the Deputy Mayor's office, asking for permission so that a park can be built. At first the Mayor ignores him, but then Watanabe begs, but not in a way that manipulates the audience for sympathy with the old man. The mayor must be sensing something in his eyes, desperate and weak, however determined, and it's something that probably most of the audience can identify with as well, even if they don't entirely identify with the character.But aside from the emotional impact Ikiru can have on a viewer, composition-wise (with the help of Asakazu Nakai, wonderful cinematographer on less than a dozen Kurosawa films) and editing-wise the film is ahead of its time and another example of Kurosawa's intuitive eye. There are some to-tomy shots sometimes (which could be called typical via master Ozu or other), but everything appears so precise on a first viewing, so descriptive. I think I almost can't go into all of them without a repeat viewing, but there were two that are still fresh in me. The first was right as Watanabe was about to sing in the bar, and there were these bead-strings looming in front of the camera. Perhaps mysterious, but definitely evocative. The other was when Watanabe and one of the other clerks are on a bridge during a dark part of the day. Both characters are in silhouette, and Watanabe gives an indication to the character that he will die soon. But for me, I wasn't even paying a terrible amount of attention to the words. The way the two are lit as they are, with the light in the background and darkness in the foreground, it could maybe give an indication of what Kurosawa's trying to say: we're all not in the light of life, but it doesn't have to be an entire down-ward spiral if the will is good. Whether you're into philosophy (ies) or not, Ikiru won't disappoint newcomers to Kurosawa via his action pictures. A+",

            "review_title": "Complex and thought-provoking masterpiece",
            "content": "Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he's learned that his life has a limit; it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it's a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as 'our hero' throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I've mentioned, he's probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that's just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn't want to be useless anymore. That's why he's 'our hero'. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he's on screen - we're sorry that he's wasted his life, and we're sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it's easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it's final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn't work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you've seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.",

There are so many terrifying and tender moments in this film. The scenes with the young office mate went from charming to cold-- we knew there was no more than companionship, but she can't really even give him that anymore. The scene when he is about to tell his son about his condition and the young man goes off on a rant about how embarrassingly his father has been acting actually brought me to tears. Of course, it's the price he pays for his cold distance all those years. Then there's the whole bureaucratic nightmare of the office. Even at the wake they don't want to give credit. All the buck passers want a share of his legacy. Maybe families who are living on the edge should watch this movie. Even after more than 50 years, it wears extremely well.",

            "content": "Any film buff is bound to have heard of Akira Kurosawa, and likely knows his most famous movies (\"Rashomon\", \"Seven Samurai\", etc). But there's a lesser known one that's just as good. 1952's \"Ikiru\" focuses on the approaching death of government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe, and how it turns into a quest for his life's meaning. After an introduction in which the protagonist's cancer gets addressed - complete with an X ray of it - we see a sequence where several people try to bring attention to a cesspool that they want cleared, but the sheer level of bureaucracy prevents any action (and Japan is supposed to be the most well run country in the world). But probably the most important scene is at the Watanabe's wake. The attendees are supposed to praise him, but one person addresses an unpleasant topic and gets chastised by his peers. Even as these men vow to live their lives with the same dedication that the deceased did, it's clear that the bureaucracy will continue to plague their lives.While an obvious indictment of bureaucracy, the movie also addresses the issue of life and death. Can a person truly live if his job dominates his life? Watanabe sings \"Gondola no Uta\", which references life's brevity. His singing expresses loss. Indeed, Watanabe doesn't have much of a relationship with his son, meaning that the children have faltered in their duty to take care of their parents. All in all, the movie offers a more cynical take on post-war Japan than we're used to. Once again, Kurosawa turned out a masterpiece. I recommend it.",

            "content": "Probably one of the most difficult aspects a film like \"Ikiru\" has to overcome is the very rough march of time. To actually find someone these days, let's say a crowd of regular movie-goers to sit down and watch a film about an old Japanese man dying of cancer would be too much to ask.Long held shots, hardly uplifting subject, to westerners very foreign. An array of reasons not to see it. And yet, once you actually start getting into the picture it doesn't let you go. Which is why it may be rightfully considered to be a classic.Of all of Kurosawa's films this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on a universal level. Because at its core it is about one of the most basic desires of human existence...namely to be able to look back on your life and say \"It was worth it.\"In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. A glorious moment in 20th century cinema, that will hopefully be preserved for decades to come.",

            "content": "I can safely say that I have seen no finer film than Kurosawa's true masterpiece, Ikiru.  The story of a dying petty bureaucrat in 1950's Japan, Ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest and beautiful a film as has ever been made on the subject of life.  Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters, and with an incredible technical direction.  The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many, many lessons on life, and the performances, including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.In short, Ikiru is easily one of the greatest works committed to film, and no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it.  Had Kurosawa directed only this film, it would still be enough to include him in the pantheon of the greatest storytellers who ever lived.  Fortunately for us, it is simply the pinnacle of a staggeringly amazing career.  It is the absolute definition of a 10/10 film.",

It is as always beautifully made, sumptuous in look and the cinematography simple yet interesting. Kurasawa's direction is at its most delicate, making a story that could easily be mawkish and manipulative into a genuinely moving, powerful and quite inspiring one instead, and making us also care every step of the way for the dignified central character of Watanabe. Together with a hypnotic score, a thought-provoking script and a powerful, yet in a discreet and heart-wrenching way, lead performance from Takeshi Shimura, and you have a fantastic film.Overall, I can't praise Ikiru enough. Any complaints of how the final third is not as good as the rest of the movie is valid but I didn't care so much after being moved and inspired so much by the film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Then one day he discovers that he has stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. After the initial depression he sets about living for the first time in over 20 years. Then he realises that his limited time left is not just for living life to the full but to leave something meaningful behind...Written and directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa, this is his magnum opus. Yes, Seven Samurai, Rashomon or Yojimbo might be more popular or more critically acclaimed but this, for me, is his greatest work.Incredibly profound and thought-provoking, examining life and living it plus death and what you leave behind. Also takes a dig at politicians and the wastefulness of the civil service.Very engaging too: characters are well-formed and develop throughout the movie. Moreover we empathise with Watanabe and his issues, issues which are relatable.Highly emotional towards the end too, as we see the impact he has made.A timeless classic.",

            "content": "The main character, so ably played in this movie, is an older bureaucrat whose life has little, if any, significance. After 30 years on the job, he has little to show for himself. This becomes very apparent once he finds out that he is dying from stomach cancer and has only months to live.Now, so far, this does NOT sound like a movie most people would want to see. However, instead of dwelling on death and the meaningless of life, Kurasawa goes beyond that. Much of the movie actually focuses on this man trying to find meaning in his life and ultimately deciding to devote his final days to fighting for the creation of a park in some godforsaken part of Tokyo. Despite a general atmosphere of apathy, he ultimately succeeds in getting the park created.About 2/3 of the way through the picture, the man dies. I thought the movie was over, but then it cuts to a scene at his funeral. A group of bureaucrats and the deputy mayor attend, but few others. What happens next is important, as the movie becomes very philosophical and those in attendance begin to ponder his life and their own as well.In many ways, this movie is both uplifting and cynical. I won't say much more but encourage you to see it for itself. I will say, though, that unlike Bergman's films (which often have talked about death or mental illness), Ikiru is unusual in that it seeks meaning and goes beyond \"life is meaningless and then you die\".",

He soon realizes that he has a strong desire to do something with his life so that it will not have been a total waste. Therefore he begins to work in cooperation with the people... accomplishing something that nobody in the office had the nerve to do before.I consider Ikiru to be Kurosawa's first truly excellent film.

It is a perfect true story of everybody's life- how we don't even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi's quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it's one of the greatest film performances of all time. Not everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it's pretty long.

There is so much that we take for granted in our lives - including our parents - that we can never show how we really feel about everything we encounter in this life. And when we decide to change because of a certain event and then everything remains the same? It takes a lot of strength and courage to change anything.It is here that Ikiru surprised me with all the critics of society, public institutions, and politics. Kurosawa was much more incisive than I expected in that regard, doing it right from the opening scene and carrying those themes with him all the way to the final scene.The performances are always at a very high level, with Takashi Shimura being the highlight with a role that touches us at various levels, not only because we feel his pain, but also because it inspires us the most so we don't waste our whole life as he did. Miki Odagiri as Toyo is also fascinating, and I'm just sad she didn't show up in the third act.Technically, there are beautiful shots at any given time, and of course, when the swing scene arrives, our hearts drop to our feet.

            "content": "There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" (To Live), 1952, is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny \"Ikiru\" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in \"Seven Samurai\", Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then, he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death, he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling, drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies, and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with co-workers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment, Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader. No one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple, he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and co-workers don't even know how ill he is, and that makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words, \"I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that\", the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life - these scenes are heartbreaking. The film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me, watching \"Ikiru\" was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to \"Cries and Whispers\" - how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death, how ugly it is, and how helpless we all are while facing it. \"Ikiru\" is about a dying man, too, but how hopeful and life affirming it is.

            "content": "As difficult as some Japanese films can be, Akira Kurosawa was always welcomed by Western audiences due to the director's embracing of the cinematic, as opposed to, say, the static, conversation-heavy work of Yasujiro Ozu. Still known primarily for his samurai action films and his film noir homages, Kurosawa's movies were action-packed and grandiose, shot beautifully through a lens that brings to mind the great American westerns or the shadowy mise-en-scene of Orson Welles, making them almost Western in tone. Ikiru, one of Kurosawa's most spiritual and tonally dark films, took a few years to make it across Pacific Ocean, and it's not hard to see why. Although, in my opinion, this is probably Kurosawa's greatest achievement, the subject matter is sobering, it's satire alarming and it's story-telling techniques unconventional.The film opens with an X-ray of our protagonist, Watanabe (Takashi Shimura). The narrator tells us he has stomach cancer, but he does not yet know this, and so we join him, reluctantly, as he goes about stamping his papers in his stagnating job as a bureaucrat. Quiet and eternally hunched, Watanabe is an introverted man, spending little of what he earns to the frustration of his selfish son. When he learns that he has only about a year to live, Watanabe goes through the familiar stages of acceptance as he drinks, parties, fails to turn up for work, becomes involved with a much younger woman and angers his family. But he soon turns his attention to building a children's playground, a project he has seen passed around by the many pencil-pushers in the various departments within the council he works for, which has frustrated the residents of the decaying area.It's with this shift of focus that comes the true masterstroke of Ikiru. Up to this point, we have been with Watanabe every step of the way, but suddenly, as the narrator informs us, he's dead. We no longer get the first-person perspective, but the third-person perspective, as various colleagues and political players gather for Watanabe's funeral. The film becomes less a human drama, and more of a social-political statement, as the other dead-eyed civil servant's in his office slowly come to realise the greatness of the man. The deputy mayor is there, claiming Watanabe's work was within the confines of his job and proving the bureaucratic machine works. This, of course, is simple electioneering, but the others reminisce and the truth begins to slowly reveal itself in the final months of Watanabe's life.A lot of the film relies on the performance of Shimura, a long-time collaborator with Kurosawa. He is utterly magnetic here, remaining a hushed presence and developing his persona into a weapon to ensure his work gets done before he bites the bullet. In a heart-breaking moment, he croaks a quiet song in a packed bar for it to fall silent. The young hipsters slowly move away, while Watanabe's companion, a booze-addled writer, looks emotional. Kurosawa, only 40 at the time, was also making a comment on the post-war social outcasting of the elderly, embodied in the aforementioned bar scene and in Watanabe's success and money-drive son. Ikiru is many things, but it's the humanity of the story that will linger on in your mind after the credits have rolled, and it ends with one of the finest closing shots in history.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

If you are willing to go there and still have the strength to go there, you will be rewarded.But then again, the whole movie is a great experience.

            "review_title": "3 approaches",
            "content": "This movie can almost be considered three different movies, as each act contains its own very different approach to the drama of a bureaucrat affected with a lethal cancer and a sudden need for life.The first part is the most self-consciously cinematic, containing the most amounts of wipes, fades, dissolves, flash-backs, and even voice-over of the entire production. Akira Kurosawa backs up the introduction of a lifeless person with stunning set design and deep focus throughout, but these features in conjunction with the cinematic processes described provide a rich and layered detailing of something that normally would be very tedious to watch. This, then, is when Watanabe is still alive. However, he lives while he's dead.The second part, or middle act, is after he discovers his illness and learns that there's no hope for his life nor comfort from his family. 3's appear throughout this work (and Kurosawa was always fond of triangles), and this fateful number appears in the different ways Watanabe attempts to find \"life\"... first is the attempt to live it up in a disturbingly entrapped and claustrophobic Westernized style life (the bitter imagery in conjunction with the bureaucratic theme makes this movie a rather vehement protest against Westernization in Japan). Unfufilled by that, he then attempts to live vicariously through an energetic ex-coworker. After that relationship turns sour, he takes her advice to try to \"make something\" for the world. This part of the movie is the most directly narrative. The film-making is a little more reserved, and it is used transparently to detail the slowly ailing life and the obsession for hope the character has. This is his mis-guided struggle for life, but also contains a scene wherein he is pretty much \"born again\" (the characters in the background singing the happy birthday song don't know it's for him).The third part is a narrative-within-a-narrative, as all of the characters from earlier in the film (save the energetic young woman and the Mephistopheles-like poet) come to reminisce about Watanabe, and in the process begin to understand how much he was actually able to do. Now the story is being told from a completely different perspective, Watanabe isn't even there, and yet... now he's finally alive, as his legacy and his presence is respected by everyone (either immediately or gradually). The narrative-within-a-narrative approach helps to put the audience in the place of the bureaucrats who try to take credit for Watanabe's success. After they promise themselves to become better people and save the world (don't we all after narratives like this?), they soon get sucked back into their real lives, showing that it is not one's intentions, but one's actions that truly define what it is \"to live.\" As usual, Kurosawa shows his skills of consummate artistry, but this time he shows an acute structural approach that transcends narrative to create a rather poignant and undidactic theme. And best of all, he never falls into sentimentality.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "\"Ikiru\" is a film that expresses itself through two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the protagonist of the story, a bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper-shuffling and pen-pushing.The movie opens with an x-ray of Watanabe's stomach and the cancer that thrives within it. His doctor tells him he will die soon.Throughout the first half of the film, Watanabe stumbles about helplessly, remembering his life and trying to figure out what has come of it. He lives with his son, whose resentment for his own father has peaked over the years.Watanabe realizes no one in his life actually knows or loves him. He walks about in a permanent stupor of self-loathing. He embarks on a friendship with a younger female co-worker, but even she soon hates him and thinks he is \"creepy.\" Towards the end of the film, Watanabe finally dies and the second half is the recounting of his final days by co-workers. We realize Watanabe's life changed drastically towards the end and he dedicated his final days to the construction of a playground for children.The Criterion DVD is excellent, and inside is an essay written by a Kurosawa biographer. He notes that the film is a study of existentialism and mirrors a few themes from Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane,\" which is true - I was very much reminded of Welles' film at certain moments throughout \"Ikiru.\" Both films offer solid examinations of life and death and what propels the man stuck in between - in both cases the cruelties of life broke apart the men, leaving hollow shells where souls once existed. In Watanabe's case, his seeking of his own soul finally brings him to a state of contentment and inner satisfaction - his death is, at the beginning of the film, a lingering doom; and at the end a peaceful pact.This movie can change the way you look at life if you open your eyes. Kurosawa might have made better films but \"Ikiru\" is his most emotionally resonant and powerful that I've seen.",

            "review_title": "Coming Alive",
            "content": "'Ikuru' (Japanese for 'To Live') was one of Kurosawa's personal favorites. Prominent film critics worldwide put it, along with \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\", on their lists of the best films ever made by anyone. When first shown in the USA during the 1950's , all three quickly earned widespread critical acclaim and strong patronage. USA film enthusiasts by then had clearly grown weary of the tired formulas followed by Hollywood studios in the timid post-war years. They welcomed the more thoughtful and challenging films from Kurosawa and from other acclaimed film directors in Japan (Ozu and Misoguchi), Italy (Rosselini, De Sica), France (Troufault, Bresson), and England (Lean). All of these great film directors were also able to hold and move their audiences while developing somber themes. 'Ikuru', however, is even more deeply philosophical than any other film that I recall by asking what is needed for us 'to live' well.Takashi Shimura gives an absolutely convincing performance of a tired old man, numb and alone. After learning he has terminal cancer, he learns that dissipation offers no solution. Then he clings to a cute, vivacious girl, taking her to shops and restaurants. She wearies of his dreary, cringing manner but agrees to have one more dinner together. In the powerful climactic scene at the restaurant, he learns why she is happy in her new job packaging toys. 'I feel all the babies in Japan are my friends!!' This gives him an idea. He, too, can do something to help children. 'There's still time!!', he cries, and runs off while she stares in bewilderment. He keeps moving quickly towards his cheerful new life. Shimura reminded me of Albert Camus' essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus.' Sisyphus plods off to yet another day of struggle but has won over the gods, after all, because he is aware of his quest. 'We must imagine Sisyphus happy,' urges Camus. We must also feel the same for the old man in Ikuru when we see how he is reborn and truly alive for the first time.",

            "content": "For pretty much his whole working life, Kanji Watanabe has been a bureaucrat in one of the departments of the city. In terms of long service it is impressive but in terms of living or achieving something, it is practically the equivalent of having never been on Earth in the first place. This is just one of the realisations that hit Kanji when he discovers that not only does he have cancer but that his options are limited and death is perhaps only months away. Determined to try and capture what he sees others doing and unable to really talk to his son, Kanji makes several new acquaintances before decided on his final actions.I've been using my DVD rental subscription to catch up on \"classics\" that I have never actually seen and recently that has seen me focusing on Akira Kurosawa who I consider a great filmmaker \u0096 but mainly because that is what I'm told, hence me seeing for myself! The last few films were very famous ones and also period pieces in feudal Japan so Ikiru was a bit of a change of pace for me and I wasn't even sure what it was about. The rating and high esteem it is held in is probably a bit misleading because those expecting to be amazed or blown away by \"one of the greatest films ever made\" etc will be disappointed because it is a very low key piece. This makes it less roundly enjoyable than, say, Yojimbo, but no less great a film \u0096 just very good in a different way. Being a very slight film, we do not see Kanji blow the world away or decide to go sky-diving, climbing a mountain or any one of many things that make their way onto these \"things to do before I die/ turn 30/40/50/whatever\" lists but rather he just looks to feel energetic, less old and just have small fun that his drab life and focus on work has seen him lose.In trying to discover something that will give him this, we see him almost desperate and I loved the mix of pity and fear in the eyes of some of those around him \u0096 as if death is perhaps catching. We see it in the bar where he sings and kills the mood and also in the eyes of his female colleague who he so desperately wants to be brought alive by. Ultimately his act is not one of self but one for others; nor is it a heroic act of his own labour but one of gentle persuasion to make others act \u0096 in fact it isn't even anything amazing but just a small achievement to try and make him forget the years of inactivity and bureaucracy. It is touching in the simplicity and the meaning of the journey and I did also like the structure of the film at the two-thirds mark where we start looking back instead of following the story forward. Although less full of spectacle than his other films I have seen, Kurosawa delivers some great shots but is more impressive in the detail. He stays very close to his main subject and we are not allow to stay distant from the loss and sense of waste that he feels at the end of his life. It helps greatly that he has drawn a great performance from Shimura, whose face is so expressive and eye's are like a direct link to the character's thoughts. He is the heart of the film and a bad performance would have killed it, but no risk here.Ikiru is perhaps not as well known as some of Kurosawa's work and it is not as easily enjoyable as some of his other films but in this low-key piece there is a real gem of a film that is beautifully delivered without sweeping sentiment, big gestures or lies in the narrative or characters. For this it is all the more touching and another reason why the director is held in such high esteem.",

The film is both long and slow-paced, but the impact is incredible.We begin with 'our hero' (as Kurosawa calls him) Watanabe's stomach x-ray, and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service, slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing, shuffling papers from one place to another, and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background, Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabe's symptoms, and tells him that the doctors will lie to him, as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him, and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep, crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isn't worried by dying, rather he's worried by never having lived. He stops going to work, he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights, but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office, and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing 'Happy Birthday' for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabe's rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabe's funeral, with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they aren't! I was frustrated...I wanted them to recognise that he knew he was ill, and fought the established order so as to achieve something with his life.As they drink more and more, they begin to reflect on what Watanabe had achieved. They become emotional, realising that he knew he was ill, and realising that with determination, the system can be used to achieve things. The final scene, however, is of one of the men present at the funeral subsiding below a pile of papers, unable to change anything.The bitter ending is tempered by the powerful feelings stimulated by Kurosawa during the funeral scene. I reached the end feeling that one man can make a difference if he is determined, and that this can only be achieved by reflecting on your life and achievements, and then making a conscious decision to do something!",

In the first 30 minutes i thought Ikiru is about a changed perspective of one man on his life but then in the the second half it had another great story unfolded about other people's perception on that man life. That's Incredible! We have seen many films on similar storylines but always two different films made individually on any of either topic, not one film having two stories combined. That's a Great thing for any film released during 50s because even half of the film is an influence to make One Solid Film. Ikiru is about an old man Watanabe, who lived his life half-dead and without any meaning discovers that he has a stomach Cancer and got only 6 months left in hand. Here begins a journey of him to find the meaning of his life and do something that he hasn't done ever. It influences corrupt government officials but what difference does it make? Find out in the film. The story is inspiring and very innovative considering the human genre and may be that's why it is little slow. In the first and last 30 minutes the screenplay feels slow paced but otherwise the middle portion is entertaining. Dialogues are meaningful and i think should be treasured for Vocabulary. This dialogue by Novelist in the film hit me so hard, \"We only realize how beautiful life is when we face death. And even then, few of us realize it. The worst among us know nothing of life until they die\". Takashi Shimura in the lead role is so fantastic and amazing that I don't anything else to say. This is the 4th film of Akira Kurosawa in my watchlist and this is his 4th Classic as well which means i am gonna see more and more from his filmography. Kurosawa is A Legend and it feels like an understatement to me, he's something more. Overall, Ikiru is a Classic from Japan Cinema that will change your perspective about Life.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Looking back at Akira Kurosawa's impressive fifty-year career in filmmaking, it's impossible to determine which film was his best. Fans of the late Japanese legend might cite The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress, while critics believe that it should be Rashomon or Ran.A growing band of Kurosawa worshippers has recently named Ikiru as his indisputable masterpiece. Unfortunately, I don't see myself joining the latter soon. Yes, Ikiru is Kurosawa's most deepest and reflective film, though in my opinion it's far from the masterpiece that it's touted to be. Ikiru is a film best described as 'a game of two halves'. The first hour is vintage Kurosawa. It starts out with an X-ray image of a stomach diagnosed with cancer, and then introduces the film's pitiful lead character Kanji (Takashi Shimura) to the viewers. Kanji is a government official who has been loyally serving his department for many decades.Upon receiving news that he's suffering from terminal cancer, he decides to take an extended break from work (which he has never done before) to reflect about his life. After some inner soul searching, Kanji realized that he has been missing out on life since he began working. He sets himself on a quest to live out his final months with a motto, \"I cannot die until I'm satisfied with my life\".Cancer has taught people that life cannot be taken for granted. Kanji is a character that we can all relate to, from his humble personality to his simple outlook on life. Kurosawa cajoled out a magnificent performance from Shimura, not only was Shimura able to make us feel sympathetic toward his character, but his character was also able to earn our admiration by the end of the picture.However, Kurosawa is no Yasujiro Ozu (Tokyo Story, Late Spring). Those familiar with the works of these two Japanese legends will know that Ikiru is the kind of story that Ozu would have relished. Kurosawa is simply not as capable in handling intense dramatic material as Ozu. This is perhaps the reason the second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first. Kurosawa focused too much on the bureaucratic aspects and its faceless officials during the long funeral sequence than Kanji's final farewell gift to the community after an immense struggle involving politics and red tape.Ikiru's lackluster second half dilutes the film's emotional value. Kurosawa did not have an off day; it's just that he was too ambitious to have attempted such a complex urban drama, though his ambitions have often led him to more successes than failures in life.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer.

And I mean impressive not as a melodrama, as a Russian pastiche, for murky sentimental reasons\u0097but as a radically achieved work\u0097something radically valid and achieved. It has vision; this is obvious from the first frame, or from the very beginning; also, it signals itself as the movie of someone who sets himself up for something.Kurosawa's means are here satirical, symbolical, lyrical, though of course all within a certain generic realism. But what is admired in IKIRU is not, of course, the realism\u0097but the masterpiece, the artistic achievement. Also the supreme inspiration and the depth and exactness of vision, and the astoundingly just touch. Kurosawa's ingenuity in the search for human universals served him excellently; he was wisely pragmatic in adopting what he felt that it served his purposes\u0097and his purpose was neatly defined\u0097that which best and most aptly defines the humanity of all people. His art is intrinsically sapient and exists only in relation with his claim at seizing and defining features apt to characterize the generic humanity; a program that is sapient, classic and realist. At Kurosawa, art goes beyond itself\u0097in the understanding of the humanity.In other words, realism with original, lyrical means; and IKIRU is indeed, for several reasons, deeply satisfying and amazing. I underline this category of aesthetic wonder, of surprise, the power of this impression of original and strongly astounding\u0097even eerie.What a fine thing is the long scene of the oldster's wake; how do alcohol, food, interaction, words, gestures\u0097how do they bring people, in fact most people, towards a common conclusion, or towards the recognition of some facts \u0085.Kurosawa is not pessimist; he is satirical, but he invites us to wait and see what happens next, because it will happen in virtue of laws that govern the people's behavior. I believe that Kurosawa is very wise here; and strong, as well. Satire\u0097but not indignation; he says, as it were\u0097let's see what will alcohol and food and company and talks and spontaneous sincerity from one\u0097what will all these make to the people gathered for a wake\u0097people tightly controlled by their _interiorized obedience and servitude. All this is keen and in fact surprising.There are a variety of inner realms here\u0097and not a single false note. The joy of the young woman; her cruelty; the leap forward in narration; the copious scene of the funeral wake; the diversity of portrayals, the fundamental and deep, soothing common sense and balance, the justness of the approach, the genuine independence and ingenuity in using various means, from satire to melodrama, all sorts of flashbacks and even heartbreaking tunes, all amounts to a healthily popular sort of cinema\u0097more like the French Old School. I consider IKIRU a masterpiece of tangible beauty and thrilling interest, and a gift to the buffs, a wonderfully rich elegiac meditation. I would not like to argue here about which Kurosawa is the best; yet what he gave me in IKIRU is absolutely above, it seems to me, what he could furnish in his later historical movies.",

Kurosawa however fully developed the emotional content of his pictures with Ikiru before he became a fully fledged master of the action genre with 1954's Seven Samurai.Ikiru is one of many great films in which an at-first-glance dull, faceless character is humanised and made sympathetic. Similar examples include William Wyler's Dodsworth, in which Walter Huston's ageing factory owner is rejuvenated by romance, and of course Welles' Citizen Kane, which also resembles Ikiru due to its flashback structure. These films set themselves monumental tasks, but they end up all the more powerful for the depth they give to apparently shallow characters. Ikiru sets up this conundrum from the start, announcing the dowdy bureaucrat as \"our hero\" and informing the audience that \"whatever we say about him now would be dreary\" but that soon he will really begin to live.Kurosawa, who co-scripted all his films, created one of his most finely crafted stories with Ikiru. By showing us early on flashbacks of Watanabe's disintegrating relationship with his son Mitsuo, the audience is emotionally drawn into his life. What really works though is Kurosawa's ability to construct scenes and shots with such respect for both subject and audience. He is of course aided greatly here by what must surely be a career best performance from Takashi Shimura.Sometimes na\u00efve viewers dismiss Kurosawa as a sappy sentimentalist, and even some of his fans dislike Ikiru for similar reasons. But these people are missing the significance, not to mention the skill involved in making a work of sentimentality. It's true that Kurosawa would overdo his humane touch years later with Red Beard, but Ikiru is note perfect, and the sentimental side of the plot is nicely ballanced out by the satirical comedy on bureaucracy.For the final word, as with so many Kurosawa films Ikiru ends with a simple yet brilliant image of optimism. We finish with two children playing on swings in the playground; they jump off when their mother calls them indoors, and Kurosawa holds for a few more seconds on the swings going back and forth \u0096 an apt and poignant metaphor for an individual's work living on after they have died.",

The reminiscence of the song from his youth is definitely a memorable scene. However, these get repetitive and don't add up to much. By the end, we've been served a trite idea that life is short, fleeting pleasures aren't the way to live and true service to others can give us meaning.

The second one, is all about a bunch of guys(Watanabe's job mates) getting drunk and discussing about Watanabe's life.Is a heart breaking and sad story in the end, depending of the point of view you adopt. It is a happy ending if we adopt Watanabe's point of view, but is rather depressing if we adopt the point of view of the guy in the second part, who wants to change his life(inspired by Watanabe) but he can't, due to his lack of courage. Is a film full of meaningful themes and is really a class of filmmaking. A masterpiece indeed.",

            "content": "Partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's short novel \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", \"Ikiru\" (To Live) is a Japanese drama film that revolves around the life of an old bureaucrat who learns that he has few more months to live due to terminal cancer. Kanji Watanbi is not so shaken by the fact that he is going to face death as he is by the fact that he left nothing behind.. he could not even remember a moment that he truly lived. He has been long dead! Now, he looks back with regret.. his eyes are frozen, his soul is empty, and he finds himself drunk in a bar singing with a voice that is so cold. Is it too late now to start searching for a meaning? The film shows at the beginning the protagonist sitting on a desk with piles of papers around him.. drowning in this inefficient system of bureaucracy, going by the codes and regulations without emotions, without feelings. It doesn't matter if he saved some money, or if he has been the section head for some time... he is a mummy. Yet, after being confronted by mortality, Watanabi now is determined to go on a last quest to discover his own-self and find what is truly meaningful.. this time not behind a desk but in helping, caring, loving, and being a righteous human being.\"Ikiru\" sheds light on the deficiencies in the social system of Japan post WW2 (the film's events occur in the 50s), on the decay of the family life and bonds, and on the matters of life and death and the responsibilities of every human. The script is touching, deep, and warm that it truly inspires.. with \"Ikiru\" you are not just an observer. And for the closing shot.. well it is considered to be one of the best ever, especially when you live with Watanabi his last days, hours, and moments. Another masterpiece and my personal favorite among Kurasawa's masterworks.",

            "content": "You should not watch this movie unless you are prepared to look at how you are living your life, particularly if you have, or have had, a routine job.The protagonist, Kanji Watanabe, is an aging civil servant, the Section Chief of Public Affairs, in a large Japanese city (presumably Tokyo). Early in the film Watanabe discovers that he is dying of stomach cancer and this forces him to take a sober look at his life, and he is not too happy with what he sees. He sees that he has effectively been dead for thirty years working in an organization where people fear to take vacations lest it be discovered that they would not be missed.The story is not played for sentiment. For example when Watanabi shares the secret of his disease with a young woman, Toyo, and admits to having lived a sterile, spartan life, he tries to excuse his behavior by saying that he has done it all for his son. But Toyo does not let him get away with that excuse, saying that his son never asked for such sacrifice. She notes that Watanabi made his choices regardless of whether he recognized them as choices or not. Watanabi is ultimately taken to the depths of existential despair which forces him to try to salvage some personal meaning in life before he dies. Salvation lies in the passionate and persistent pursuit of a personally meaningful endeavor, ironically at his job. While the main thrust of the movie is in detailing Watanabi's crisis, many other themes are dealt with.We get insights into the state of Japan in the early 1950s, just after the end of the Allied occupation of Japan following WWII. One thing we see is a government mired in bureaucracy. When a group of women come to the local authorities concerned about cleaning up a sewage pond in their neighborhood they are routed to some sixteen departments (including Watanabi's) getting a royal runaround - should be Pest Control, should be Parks, should be Child Welfare, etc. The women finally give up in frustration making the comment, \"This is not democracy.\" The office buildings are run down and many still show scars from the war. Mambers of the Yakuza even make an appearance.Another thing we see is a generational gap. The older generation lives simply and is financially conservative. This distinction is made between Watanabi, who lives in sparse surroundings, versus his son and daughter-in-law who live in the same house but have more possessions and are much more concerned with material things. Also, Watanabi's first attempts to \"live\" after finding out his diagnosis are to frequent the pachinko parlors, jazz clubs, strip-tease bars, and crowded dance halls where young people are congregating. We see that Japan's move to Westernization is well under way. You can interpret Watanabi's death as a symbol of the end of the old Japan and his reluctant passing of his estate to his estranged son and daughter-in-law as the transition from an old self-disciplined Japan to a new more materially oriented, Westernized Japan.In addition to the generational gap, there is an unequal distribution of wealth. When Watanabi and Toyo are at a restaurant there is a birthday party going on in the background. The convivial carefree atmosphere of the birthday party is contrasted with Toyo's jealous gaze as she realizes that she will never be in that class. Initially Toyo works in the same department as Watanabi, but she is smart enough to see that it is a dead end - she is horrified when she realizes that Watanabi has been there for thirty years. But when she quits, the best job she can land is working in a factory that makes stuffed rabbits.\"Ikiru\" reaches its true distinction in the extended scene at Watanabi's wake. Here Kurosawa touches on some of the same themes as in \"Rahomon,\" showing how we all filter experience through our own unique outlooks, frequently ignoring the facts. Watanabi's relatives have interpreted his unusual behavior, due to his illness, as resulting from his having an affair. People rewrite history to present themselves in the most favorable light. Instead of reacting to Watanabi's achievement by reflecting on their own impotence, some of his coworkers actually criticize him for having been so aggressive and not following the rules.All of this presented through masterful black and white cinematography. The civil servants sit around a desk and are dwarfed by huge stacks of paper. It is interesting that in a scene where Watanabi rides through the streets of Tokyo the neon lights of the city are reflected off the car windows in exactly the same way that the same scene is played with Bill Murray in \"Lost in Translation.\"The Criterion Collection DVD is of good quality, even though there is some significant flicker in some scenes. The subtitles have been made current using phrases like, \"I can't wrap my head around it,\" \"bummer,\" \"you actually *get* it\". There is some explicit profanity that would not have been in the early versions. The commentary track is excellent.This film may have its strongest impact on older people who are forced to look back at their lives, but it should have a powerful effect on younger people as well. As one of the characters says, \"But any one of us could suddenly drop dead.\"",

            "content": "This justly celebrated work is often considered uncharacteristic of its auteur. I've heard it said that it more resembles an Ozu, than a Kurosawa film. I would argue that the only way in which it is un-Kurosawaian is in its subject matter, and even in this respect only superficially so.It has become a cliche to say that of the three classic auteurs of Japanese cinema (Kurosawa, Ozu, Mizoguchi) that Ozu was the most \"Japanese\" where as Kurosawa was the most \"western\". The latter claim strikes me as undeniable. Kurosawa's indebtedness to John Ford is frequently apparent. While it does so in an exceptionally powerful manner, \"Ikiru\" treats it's subject in a way that is more characteristic of Hollywood than of Ozuian cinema.Were one to read a simple synopsis of the plot of \"Ikiru\", a bureaucrat in 1950s Tokyo discovers he is dying of stomach cancer, one would not be blamed for imagining the film as uncharacteristic of its director. It in no way deals with violence as do almost all of Kurosawa's period pieces and noirs. However, like Kurosawa's work in general, it approaches its seemingly simple story as a grandiose conflict in which the protagonist overcomes an obstacle to his goal. Indeed, without intending to give too much away, I think it is fair to call the film's protagonist a \"hero\" by the end. The film is unquestionably powerful and moving, profound even, but it achieves its effect by way of the emotionally manipulative machinations of western melodrama. Ozu's work, which often examines the everyday grievances of death and loss, does so with a stoically detached manner that makes his work, in my opinion, deeper than that of Kurosawa.There is another way in which \"Ikiru\" is distinctly Kurosawaian, and that is one which is most particular to the director. As in \"Rashoman\" Kurosawa is boldly experimental in his manipulation of narrative time. Yet even this strikes me as very western. The non-linear telling of the story highlights the emotional impact of certain scenes in a way that is very operatic in a western sense. As I watched \"Ikiru\" it struck me that Kurosawa might be the single most important influence on the work of Quentin Tarantino.",

            "content": "Without denying Akira Kurosawa's greatness as a director, I can't help feeling that he would have accomplished more by saying less. There were any number of points in the latter part of the story when it could have, maybe even should have ended, and it managed to drone on with one bureaucrat after another opining on Watanabe's (Takashi Shimura) role in establishing the children's park in Kuroe. At least the payoff there was cleverly done; when all the administrators fell well under the influence of their Saki, it was at that point they were able to think clearly, and admire Watanabe's ability to work outside the system where protecting one's turf was the primary objective.What struck me most about the story was Kurosawa's acknowledgment of the strangling bureaucracy in government more than a half century ago. Apparently the Japanese were as well experienced in the matter as we here in America. The frustrating aspect of viewing the film today is that it's certainly gotten worse, made even more egregious by the polarization of ideologies among opposing political parties. How that vicious cycle gets resolved is anyone's guess.Undoubtedly there are many who will find Kurosawa's message about being worn down in a meaningless job as striking very close to home. It's only when Kenji Watanabe learns that he's dying of cancer that he's up to the task of finding something more meaningful in his life to extend his legacy. It was striking to see his son lament the fact that his father never told him about his condition, when it was at that point when Mitsuo excoriated his father for dallying with Toyo (Miki Ogadiri). An errant judgment that would create yet another misunderstanding between father and son.So once again, another brilliant treatment of the human condition by Kurosawa done to exquisite but time consuming effect. Although I felt the same with \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\", but felt more appreciation for both of those films upon a second viewing. Unfortunately, I don't feel I would be up to the same task with this one.",

He's spent 30 years in the same boring job and is faced with his mortality and the question of whether he has wasted his life.What would you do if you knew you had months to live? That is the challenge facing our protagonist and it makes for a bleak, yet oddly uplifting human tale.Being Toho I expected it to be well made, it was.

            "content": "\"How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.\"So after I watched the masterpiece \"Seven Samurai\" back in April, I couldn't wait to watch another Kurosawa movie. \"Ikiru\" was one of his movies that I wanted to watch next after hearing so much recommendation for it from The Criterion Collection selection. And the fact that this has been on my watch-list for quite awhile. Actually, it's been on there for over three years now and I finally got myself to watching it.And what can I honestly say about this one.This movie broke me, but surprisingly in the best ways.Ikiru is a miserable and yet powerful film that has a hard hitting message. And to think that this movie was made in the 50's can have a deep impact on you and make you think twice about your life.I have this feeling inside of me that Kurosawa is slowly becoming my favorite director. The camera work, the transmissions and the finest of acting are only naming a few things that's great about this movie. Never as a film that captured depression and people who are diagnose with cancer so damn accurate. Or how relatable it is even today. He really dose live up to be the most influential directors of all time, as he's film making style is seriously impressive beyond any words. As for right now, I only seen two of his films and I'm already in love. Akira Kurosawa is cinema. No question about it.Takashi Shimura delivers such a raw and haunting performance that you just want to reach out and give the guy a hug. It's one of the finest piece of acting I've ever seen. I don't think any other performance broke me down like this guy did. I mean, a scene that involves a man simultaneously reminisces over a favorite song of his, whilst contemplating imminent death in a drunken state of melancholy. The sadness and regret was captured so perfectly just by his face and eyes that tells so much without him saying anything. Even as I'm writing this right now, I see have the image of Shimura sad face is implanted in my head. And to think that about two years later this guy will be in \"Seven Samurai\", which I didn't know while watching this. That's how good he is.This is one of the most honest look at life anyone has ever portrayed on the screen and it will be long before anyone can do the same. What makes this Akira Kurosawa greatest achievement is by displaying the most poignant images in cinema. Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) swinging slowly in the children's playground, singing to himself, \"Life is so Brief/short\" while snow softly falling. And here's something interesting I found out before I started writing this. Akira Kurosawa instruct Shimura to sing \"Song of the Gondola,\" as if you are a stranger in a world where nobody believes you exist.Kurosawa is just a genius and he never stops to make us be so awed at his work.Overall rating: Ikiru is a movie that I think everyone needs to see.

            "content": "Like you can expect from basically every Kurosawa picture, this movie is something unique and beautiful. It's a very well crafted movie, that this time for most part gets uplifted by its story.It has a very simple and also very effective concept about a middle-aged bureaucrat, who suddenly finds out he only has a couple of more months to live. He then realizes he has never achieved anything or enjoyed live and only committed himself mostly only to his work. Even though it of course has a sad premise, the movie itself is really about life and how you should treasure and enjoy it and don't only commit yourself to one thing your whole life without any change, fore before you know you're life will be over and you'll not be able to look back at a fully lived one.It's a character movie that also gets very well constructed story-wise. Seems that Kurosawa had been inspired by \"Citizen Kane\", since it pretty much uses the same way of storytelling. The movie is basically one of two parts. In the first we get to know the main character and see how he tries to cope with his nearing end and tries to enjoy life and achieve something significant as well. The second halve mostly consist out of flashbacks after the death of the main character and shows how he achieved to do something significant and also affected a lot of people around him, mostly his colleagues, who realize that they way they are conducting their jobs is not in the best interest of everyone. It's also a movie that is a comment against the bureaucracy it seems. It's not a movie though that tries hard to be sentimental or preachy with any of its messages. It's a real subtly done movie, that therefore also tends to become a real effective one. It's also more an ode to life than a sad movie about a dying man really.Granted that the movie is a bit too long, making some of its sequences a bit overlong at times but this is something you more or less always have to take for granted in an old fashioned Japanese production. It's also hardly a complained for this movie but I guess it will still turn some people off.Takashi Shimura is really great as the dying man, who is mostly expressing himself with his face, rather than words. You see his pain, grief and desperateness in his eyes. Shimura also was only in his 40's at the time but they did a great job with making him look much older but credit for this of course also has to go to Takashi Shimura himself for this. Shimura is an actor who used to work quite a lot with and is also in some of his best known movies like \"Shichinin no samurai\", \"Rash\u00f4mon\", \"Yojimbo\" and \"Kakushi-toride no san-akunin\". Yet he never had been that well known or recognized as for instance Toshir\u00f4 Mifune. Perhaps because he was mostly normally playing the secondary characters but in this movie Kurosawa really allows him to shine and gives him a stage for perhaps his greatest performance. It at least is his most memorable one.A really fine made and told movie!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "What if in the dreary days of middle-age, as you were cruising along in the set routine of your life, you came to understand you had six months left to live? And further, that your son and his wife looked forward to their inheritance more than they cared for you, and that your co-workers mocked you for how little you accomplished in your meaningless, bureaucratic job? Such is the fate of Kanji Watanabe, played by Takashi Shimura, in an excellent movie by Akira Kurosawa. It may sound depressing and I suppose parts of it are, but Shimura's face evokes such a depth of emotions, Kurosawa's story-telling is so brilliant, and the movie is so profound, that you can't help being gripped by it. Ikiru \u2013 To Live \u2013 what does it mean to live, what is the meaning of life, when it's so brief? Can there be meaning?Watanabe at first 'lives it up', going out on a bender with a stranger he meets, playing pachinko, visiting dance halls, drinking, and going to a strip club. It's the reaction some have to the horrifying transience of life, and in some sense, the characters are right when they say that he has begun to live when he found out he was going to die. It's an immature, unsatisfying reaction, however. He attempts to get closer to a much younger woman from his office, played with childish spunk by Miki Odagiri, not in an attempt to seduce her, but because he admires her passion, and her decision at an early age to leave her boring job. She ever-so-subtly steers him onto the right path by saying he needs to find his own things to make, and he has the idea to use his remaining time fighting for the cause of park which has is stuck in a bureaucratic quagmire. Therein lies his redemption.The movie is distinctly Japanese, with customs like bowing and strict hierarchy on full display, but on the other hand, it has a universal feel to it. Faust and 'Ecce Homo' are referenced. The screenplay was influenced by Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\". The nightclub scenes are highly Western, particularly the piano player. There is evidence of Kurosawa's artistry throughout the movie, with scenes in light and shadow that might remind you of paintings by Caravaggio. The film itself may also remind you of Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, 'Wild Strawberries'. And of course, the theme itself connects us all at that most fundamental of levels.The story is often told in flashbacks, and revealed gradually. It's poignant seeing Watanabe's relationship with his son over the years. It's profound that he eventually realizes he needs to do good deeds with the time remaining, and that, despite obstacles in his path, he says \"I can't afford to hate people \u2013 I haven't got the time\". If only we could all come to this realization! He will see the beauty in a sunset, and perhaps in the most moving scene, swing on the playground in the park he built, singing 'Gondola no Uta', whose lyrics are \"life is brief; fall in love, maidens, before the crimson bloom fades from your lips.\" While he had sung those words despondently before, he now sings them in quiet triumph, knowing he may be the only one who ever understands his life and his truths. Perhaps it's the best any of us can hope for.",

Coming to this decision is a rocky road itself, as he turns to alcoholism and begins to stalk a young woman.Shimura's amazing performance can bring repulsion one moment and pity the next.  He cuts off the personal space of a young woman and you can feel him sucking the life out of her.  In other scenes, his frustrating passiveness wins your heart as you see where it may have come from.Ikiru is a a dark comedy as well, a sad social commentary of the red tape and bureaucracy of post-war Japan.

            "content": "When I hear the word \"Ikiru\", I see and I hear \u0085I see a haunting look engraved in Takashi Shimura's face, a penetrating sadness contemplating thirty years of a wasted life. This unforgettable face, these shocked eyes, these tense lips deadpan like a theatrical mask, is the tragicomic realization of the meaning of Life, and the meaninglessness of a life, the life of Kanji Watenebe, the hero\u0085 and what a hero!And I hear \"Gondola no Uta\", this beautiful ballad about the shortness of life and the soul of \"Ikiru\" as a drop of hope in an ocean of tearful despair, hardly audible in the hero's raspy voice, but whose effect is beautifully showed in a scene where people listen to him, silent, calm and solemn, like meditating on what has been done and even more, what should be done, before it's too late.\"Before it's too late indeed, \"Ikiru\" is oddly characterized by a slow pacing combined with a desperate sense of urgency. Kanji Watanabe in a veteran civil servant working in Tokyo's City Hall, but officiously, he's only one of the many links that constitute the post-war Japanese bureaucracy. A group of women come to complain about stagnant water in the neighborhood and the healthy risks; they go back and forth, from a Bureau to another. Kurosawa handles this part not without a certain humor, but it's only because it would make people laugh if it wasn't so tragic. This waste of time, of energy doesn't bother anyone until it affects one's life.The urgency conveys a more disturbing feeling of despair that can be summarized in one sentence: how can a man who wasted thirty years live his life to its fullest for six months. This question is even more disturbing when you think of the way Watanebe knew he was doomed. In a harrowing scene, one patient tells him that the worst omen is when the doctor allows you to eat whatever you want. How Kurosawa makes the viewer able to penetrate the very soul of the hero is a directorial stroke of genius and a tribute to his genius as a storyteller. Indeed, when Watenebe hears the same words from the doctor, we understand that these lies equals a sentence to death, indirectly mirroring the very lies that made Watenebe's life.His job was a lie; he never truly helped Tokyo citizens all he did was to press rubber stamps on documents to signify that their complaints were taken into account. His love for his son was a lie to convince his mind it was that reason that prevented him from getting married while his son never looked reactive to his father's love. The doom of death ironically provides the relieving blessing of a cathartic lucidity. Watenebe finally knows he wasted his life and Life is goddamn too valuable to be wasted. Two ambivalent feelings for two contradictory reactions: to drink sake despite the gastric cancer, as a \"protest against his life\" and to hide under a blanket, crying like a little boy. The heartbreaking moment showing his reluctance to kill himself is the illustration of a man who simply wants \"Ikiru\". And Kurosawa chronicles through his masterpiece, all the possible meanings of life, starting like an existentialist journey into Tokyo's post-war society. Watanebe tries to find comfort with the help of an intellectual who buys him a new hat, shows him Tokyo's nocturnal life with girls and music. But Watenebe doesn't find the answer yet. In a desperate attempt, he spends time with a joyful and full of life employee. He learns from her that he was nicknamed 'the mummy' in the office, and god when we see Shimura's face, again we know it would make us laugh if it wasn't so tragic. His look indeed incarnates the condition of someone who was indeed barely alive his whole life, and who, more than anything, was alone. The realization of loneliness finally occurs in a pivotal restaurant scene with the employee, when she reveals that she quited the City Hall to work in a toy manufacture, for a job in harmony with her state of mind. Watenebe incarnates this sinister world she finally got rid of, a face that gets more and more unaccommodating. She doesn't want to see him anymore, no one would, Watenebe understands that Death is loneliness, no colleagues, no friends, not even family. Watenebe realizes that he only and he can do something of his life, because if he's barely respected in his lifetime, it will be even worse after. How fitting that we hear 'Happy Birthday' in the background, as if Watenebe's rebirth was celebrated. The story finally takes off, the pacing gets faster as Watenebe decides that a park should be built in the wasteland before he dies. The next sequence is the very illustration of death's insolent effect: Watenebe is dead and the park is built. As witnesses of Watenebe's tormented soul, we know he is the craftsman of this miracle, but all the colleagues and the family members attending his funeral, underestimate Watenebe's role. A series of flashbacks illustrate Watenebe's hardship and inspiring determination to overcome the adversity of an oppressing bureaucracy, of crime syndicate, as he knew how to translate his doom into a force. Watenebe had nothing to lose anymore, except time. At the end of the sequence, the men finally come to the very conclusion we expected, and realized the heroism of Watenebe. Watenebe's whole life was about inaction, the first month was a reaction to a death sentence, and at the end, it was action. A man is only remembered for his actions, and Watenebe's life will forever be defined by this ultimate victory, incarnated by one of the most beautiful and poetic cinematic shots: Shiumura sitting on a swing under a freezing wind, singing 'Gondola no Uta' ...... a universal ode to life, just like Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\".",

He is absent from work for the first time in thirty years, lost in reverie and unable to cope with what he sees as his failure to achieve anything of value.The viewer, guided by a voice over, knows Watanabe is having an existential meltdown, and wonders how this character can ever find redemption in his own eyes. He tries a variety of new experiences (shades of Ferris Bueller). But he still feels a failure. Eventually, he returns to his job and attempts a new strategy.\"Ikiru\" is a tribute to those who get things done. Other films have celebrated the kind man (\"It's a Wonderful Life\"), the principled man (\"12 Angry Men\" or \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"); \"Ikiru\" celebrates the man with a vision and the determination to carry it out, especially in the face of bureaucracy.Director Kurosawa called \"Ikiru\" his greatest work, perhaps because he valued its universal themes. Shimura--a Kurosawa favorite--acts with minimal expression. Watanabe is a sponge soaking up his environment.

            "content": "Ikiru was my favorite Kurosawa film even before I saw it.  I had read Roger Ebert?s wonderful commentary at his \"The Great Movies\" page and told myself many times that I must get it and never quite got around to it.  I had purchased \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Hidden Fortress\" and found both of them delightful.  The former is probably the greatest action movie ever made and the latter has scenes as intense as anything modern directors ever put on celluloid.  But somehow while I figured Ikiru to be more my type of movie than any of the samurai flicks, I still held off buying it.  I told myself many times to do so, and searched high and low for the DVD, but no American company is willing to come out with a version yet.  I finally settled for having one shipped from China and as of this writing it has yet to arrive.     Then I found out a co-worker is dying of cancer.  Having read multiple reviews, searched for months for the DVD and visited almost every Kurosawa site out there, I felt comfortable recommending a movie I had never seen when I almost never recommend a movie to people at all.  I immediately purchased a copy of the video and the afore-mentioned DVD from eBay; the video for him and the DVD for myself.  I received the video last night, banished the wife and kids to bed and for the next three hours sat awed as the story of Watanabe?s life unfolded before me.      I could not have made a better choice.  The story takes hold of you and you follow it and never want to let go.  There are several slow spots that you have to work through, but that is the point of this movie.  This is not a movie to check your brain at the door for.  If you are looking for action and adventure with a plot you'll forget about when you try to tell your friends about it the next day, you are in the wrong place.  If you want a deep movie that will make you think and re-examine your life then this is your ticket.",

            "review_title": "Masterpiece",
            "content": "Ikiru (To Live), by Akira Kurosawa, is sort of a 'lost' film. No, it was never really lost, but it is unlike the archetypal Kurosawa film Western audiences think of him making, and thereby lost in his canon. It is not some historical epic filled with honor, samurais, and swordplay. It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man- in this case lifelong low level Tokyo city bureaucrat office head Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a few months before his death by stomach cancer, and witness how this 'living mummy', as his co-workers chide him (one of the nicer things they say about him), reclaims meaning in a life long since blanched of it. Unlike Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate, or Isak Borg, a renowned Academic, Watanabe is the sort of man most people would ignore.His devotion to his work life only accentuates his forgetability, for he seems somehow pleased with himself and his existence (or maybe just narcotized), merely rubber stamping projects here and there, or assisting his underlings in giving grieving citizens the bureaucratic runaround. Yet, as soon as we, and he, get confirmation of his cancer (although his doctors, in Japanese tradition deny it, and Kurosawa deftly skewers this absurd tradition in a hilarious scene where another stomach patient- played by Atsushi Watanabe- tells Watanabe exactly what horrors to expect from the doctors and the disease, and is right) something within Watanabe shifts. A mere month shy of setting the all time record for perfect attendance, he skips out of work for a few days. The non-news of his impending demise has shattered all his desires for conformity\u0085. This is a great film, and Shimura (a veteran of the Godzilla films I loved in my youth, as well a Kurosawa regular film player) gives a great performance. The way he imposes his will on the gangsters, bureaucrats, and politicians to get the park built shows smart subversion at its best, and possibly enough to make up for the years of living death between his wife's death and his graves-edge rebirth. Like Rashomon, which preceded it in the Kurosawa canon, Ikiru deals with perspective, but not the perspective of many on one event, but the perspective of many on many things: life, a man, a park, accomplishment. It is, in that way, something like Rashomon 2. It is one of the many reasons this is such a great film. Another is that while the first two thirds of the film, while Watanabe lives, is great, there have been Hollywood films that come close to it- in construction and true sentiment. But, no Hollywood film has ever done what the last third of this film does, craft a stage play that can basically stand alone as an existential debate on life and art, purposiveness and meaning. This daring and depth is what soars Ikiru past lesser films. Even Citizen Kane, as great and influential a film as that is, was not as daring narratively, as this film, for the themes of the film, while profound, are not really original. It's all how the film presents these issues, starting with the film's first shot of an X-Ray of Watanabe's stomach cancer. Despite all that is to occur, Kurosawa never lets us forget that all of what occurs is due to a few cells in a man's stomach that forgot how to behave. Without the cancer, Watanabe remains a mummy for years more, and the slum children have no park to relieve, however briefly, their misery.Yet, even more profound than the philosophy of the film, is its realism. By the end of the film, we see that Watanabe's co-workers truly are bureaucratic scum. They talk the talk at his wake, but refuse to walk Watanabe's walk. Watanabe's victory is small, and temporal. Likely, the gangsters will find another way to corrupt that area, and with Watanabe gone there is no one left in his office who will care. Kurosawa has shown us victory, but acknowledges it may be Pyrrhic, at best. It is also the greatest artistic indictment of bureaucracies ever made, and not just of Post-War Japan's problems, nor even Japan's for the three tenets of Japanese bureaucracy- be punctual, never take off, and do nothing, are universal, even if only codified in Japan. We see this most eloquently in the scenes of Watanabe skipping work, for the office work comes to a halt and the mountain of paperwork continues to bloat.Some believe that the famed Tolstoy story, The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, is the basis for this film, since both involve petty bureaucrats who die, but Ikiru is the far greater work of art, for it about life, not merely its waste. Ilyich cannot cope with life, while Watanabe, however, acts upon his demise's coming, but why he does, is a bit of a mystery. We can only assume his motives, for Kurosawa keeps much of his motivation a secret, as Watanabe spends quite some time 'offstage', even when alive. Perhaps the only flaw in the film is in the subtitling, with white subtitles almost blanched out in some of the shots, but that's not anything Kurosawa had control over. That which he did shows mastery, something he never seems to have lost.",

While dying, he finds the meaning of life, and fights for the construction of a playground in a poor zone of the city and the legacy of his existence.Ikiru means 'to live' and it is an undeniable masterpiece. With a story like that it would no doubt go the top-down preachy approach, but Kurosawa never treads the well-worn path and he has achieved something simply extraordinary here. There are a few scenes which are simply amazing and I will mention just one.Watanabe is still at a loss with what he wants to do with the rest of his days. While baring his soul to his spunky ex-co-worker, he found his direction in his infinitesimal life. It is not what he realized that is incredible, it is the setting of that scene. It is at a restaurant with a staircase leading up to the seated area. In the background we see a group of office-type excitedly anticipating something. In the foreground we see Watanabe and the woman. The two different parties in the foreground and background are in the perfect juxtaposition. When Watanabe finally knows what he wants needs to do he walks with twinkling steps down the long stairs with a smile plastered on his face, and the group of office workers started launching into a birthday song for a person walking up the stairs. If that's not one of the most sublime scenes in cinema I don't know what it is. You see, the happy birthday song is for Watanabe's rebirth. Kurosawa is saying that it is not the number of days in your life that is important but what you do with your lot, however short it is, that is most important. My tears rolled...Kurosawa is a master storyteller. It would be so easy to go the heart-rending route after that sublime scene but Kurosawa pulls everything including the throttle back to show Watanabe's funeral a few months later. It suddenly felt like a missed opportunity, a wasted move. It felt like a full-stop! But this final hour is a tour de force of sublime power as it becomes a critique of typical top-down human behavior and we also get an in-depth look into Watanabe's end days through the third person. Think a variation of Rashomon as we see flashbacks of Watanabe's efforts to do something not for himself but for a bunch poor folks. The narration by various people at the wake culminates to a haunting picture of Watanabe that I know I will never be able to forget forever, likewise with the life lesson learned.Watanabe has left an indelible mark in a bare landscape and left a legacy behind, but the thing you have to remember steadfastly is that is never his intention. His intention is simple - he wants to cut through all the bureaucracy to build a playground for the common folk. For some people that is ludicrous and small, but for me life is about committing your best effort to performing a task that you deem meaningful. Taking religion aside, life is ultimately meaningless when everything is said and done. What everyone thinks about Watanabe is utterly beside the point. The lesson learnt here is that one's life is about bringing your best to anything you know is the right thing to do, like for me at this point, it is penning down my thoughts and feelings in this small little review.

            "review_title": "Incisive, bittersweet fable of dying bureaucrat's redemption",
            "content": "Ikiru (\"To Live\" in English) is considered by many to be famed director Akira Kurosawa's greatest film next to Seven Samurai. While filmed very much in the style of the post-war Italian neo-realists, the narrative feels more like a \"fable\" designed for moral edification. For some it's too lugubrious for their tastes but if one has patience there are many insights to garner from this film loaded with both intellectual and emotional motifs.The story is very loosely based on Tolstoy's novella, \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich.\" In Kurosawa's take, his protagonist is Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), the robot-like section chief of the Public Works Bureau in a Japanese city.The film opens with Kurosawa's brilliant montage in which a group of economically disadvantaged women arrive at Watanabe's office petitioning the bureaucrats to build a park for kids in an area that has turned into a virtual cesspool.The women are given the run around by every bureaucrat they approach with Kurosawa depicting each of the men \"passing the buck\" in a series of calculated close-ups.Watanabe's world is upended when he learns he has incurable stomach cancer. As was the policy among Japanese doctors back at that time (the early 50's), patients were not informed they had cancer so they wouldn't be burdened with the knowledge of their impending demise (Watanabe deduces he has cancer after another patient in the waiting room spells out the physicians' usual deceptive routine).Watanabe's suddenly calls in sick to work for the first time ever causing consternation among his employees as well as his son Mitsou (Nobou Kaneko) and his wife, who live in the same house as the father.The next series of scenes are reminiscent of James Joyce's Stephen Daedalus wandering about Dublin in the famed \"Nighttown\" sequence in \"Ulysses.\"Watanabe meets the \"second rate fiction writer\" (Yunosuke Ito) who describes himself as a \"beneficent Mephistopheles\". The Novelist acts as a catalyst introducing Watanabe to a decadent world replete with wild women coupled with a Mardi-Gras-like atmosphere.This experience acts as a shock to his system and the Novelist plants the idea in Watanabe's mind that this is an opportunity to re-examine his life and make the most of the time he has left. Ultimately Kurosawa rejects decadence as an unproductive diversion in finding real meaning in life.The next sequence involves Watanabe's chance meeting with Toyo (Miki Odagiri), his employee at Public Works who needs for him to affix a seal on her resignation letter as she plans to seek new employment.Toyo proves to be a fascinating character as her kindness and exuberance begins to bring Watanabe out of his shell. Her nicknames for all her office colleagues make her boss laugh for the first time. But he's a little miffed when she reveals the name selected for him: the \"Mummy.\"The Mummy appellation is the impetus for Watanabe's reflection about his relationship with his son. Kurosawa provides a series of flashbacks chronicling the relationship with Mitsuo which best can be described as \"broken.\"Perhaps the ultimate moment of alienation between father and son comes when Watanabe decides to go to work instead of staying with Mitsuo (still a young child) while he is having his appendix taken out in the hospital. The coup de grace perhaps occurs later when Watanabe fails to hug his son as the train leaves the station as the young newly minted soldier goes off to war.Inexplicably, Watanabe's response to Toyo's question that he cut himself from his emotions \"for his son,\" underscores just how dead he was inside throughout his life. It takes the recollection of that wistful song he sang earlier along with Toyo's innocent attachment to the toy rabbit that triggers the epiphany in which Watanabe realizes he can still do some good and find some meaning in his life before he dies.The epiphany leads to both hope and tragedy. Watanabe's desire to repair his relationship with his son ends in utter failure. Just at the moment he's about to tell his son about his cancer, Mitsuo accuses him of planning to squander his life's savings on Toyo, who he mistakenly believes has become his father's young mistress.The relationship with Toyo breaks down as well as she now finds Watanabe's solicitousness toward her as overbearing coupled with her disappointment in her new job doing factory work.Kurosawa made the curious and unusual choice of killing off Watanabe at this juncture in the narrative. It proves to be a wise decision as it prevents the narrative from falling into overarching bathos typically found in stories of this nature (impending death).The final sequence focuses on Watanabe's subordinates attending his wake. There they try and figure out the reason for his sudden transformation in which he was able to push through the playground requested by the group of women introduced at the beginning of the narrative.A series of flashbacks chronicle Watanabe's dogged persistence as he calls on numerous bureaucrats and finally persuades the Deputy Mayor to approve the project.Ikiru's bittersweet ending chronicles Watanabe's failure to repair the broken relationship with his son but also his personal triumph in which he finds meaning in helping the community build a playground for children.But Kurosawa still reserves scorn for the \"feudal-like\" subservient bureaucracy. At the wake, while intoxicated, the bureaucrats pledge to do better but the next day it's \"business as usual\" back at the office.Kurosawa's film is both a portrait of redemption and intransigence. The bureaucrat Kimura (Shinichi Himori)-probably a stand-in for Kurosawa-remains the only one left in the office who understands the idea of embracing life with all its possibilities for self-actualization.",

            "content": "Mr Watanabe, a manager in a dull, repetitious council administrative role, discovers he is dying of stomach cancer and sets out to understand his place in life and what he should be doing during his remaining time. The film is broadly divided into 3 sections - 1) he spends time with a strange author who guides him through the nightclub world of women and alcohol, 2) he finds joy with a young girl who works in his office and who has a positive and fun outlook on life and 3) his colleagues sit down at his wake to discuss the last few months of his life and his determination to create a much needed children's playground.Interestingly it isn't until the 3rd act that the true power of the story and Kurosawa's great film making really hit you. The foundations for the story in the first 2 acts are strong and dramatically delivered - including an affecting scene where Mr Watanabe sings in a nightclub - as the central character slowly comes to realise and understand what he needs to do with his last 5 months of life and how this brings meaning to his existence. This final part, whilst spelling out blow by blow what he achieved and how he was felt of by colleagues and locals who lived near the playground, allows Kurosawa to let rip at decaying family values, bureaucracy, political corruption and ultimately the weakness of man.In truth it does take a while to really get to grips with all this and it's importance in what often seems a very personal polemic from the great director plus it is slow, sad and not a little sentimental throughout. It remains though a fine piece of cinema.",

Still, when mentioning his greatest achievements, most people place \"Rashomon\", \"Ran\" and \"The Seven Samurai\" as his most notable pieces.  Only a few will remember this little film that has so much more significance than those others. \"Ikiru\" is a movie that can bring you to tears with very little manipulation.  It's a movie you will not forget, a life lesson.  It's a movie that will forever change how you think about movies.  It is a social criticism.  It is a discourse on bureaucracy. Improving on Rashomon's non-linear way of storytelling, this is a film that forces you to pay attention.  There are no samurai fights here.  There are no melodramatic dialogues where characters scream at the top of their lungs. There are no forced tears in the character's cheeks. This is a movie of very subtle, inner conflict, with a very simple premise: What would you do if you had three months to live? Kurosawa's answer is so devastatingly powerful, smart and original that it will change you forever.  Or maybe, it won't, proving that the director's pessimistic view of humanity was correct.",

It's a slow, poignant and utterly heartfelt tale about a bureaucrat who discovers he has terminal cancer. The film takes that as a starting point and we the viewer proceed to watch as he undergoes a journey of discovery.The story takes inspiration from the likes of Goethe's FAUST in places, but elsewhere it's all it's own. It is admittedly very slow in places - an entire hour seems to consist entirely of men sitting in a room while they drink and argue - but at the same time it's oddly watchable. It helps that Kurosawa is a master of his form, and that he elicits a painfully human performance from his long-time regular star, Takashi Shimura.Come the end, I was most reminded of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, the classic starring James Stewart. However, IKIRU is the more realistic of the two films, stripping back the fantasy and the sentiment to reveal a starker truth entirely, but one equally as profound.",

            "content": "There is something to be said about the five-decade-long career of the late Japanese cinematic master craftsman Akira Kurosawa. I've only seen a few of his master-works, but every film I have seen of his is a brilliant, breathtaking exercise in cinematic master craftsmanship. Case in point: his 1952 dramatic masterpiece \"Ikiru\" (which when translated from Japanese, means \"to live\").The story itself (co-written by Kurosawa himself, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Hideo Oguni) is pretty simple and centers around Kanji Watanabe (Kurosawa's most prolific go-to man and my favorite international movie performer, the late Takashi Shimura), a faceless government bureaucrat who at the beginning of the story, learns he has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. He then sets about trying to make sense of his life and to give his existence some kind of meaning in his few remaining days.Throughout \"Ikiru,\" the one thing that I was continually amazed by was the sincere, heartfelt and ultimately, heartbreaking, performance of Takashi Shimura as this film's dying middle-aged protagonist - and the film's most significantly developed character - Kanji Watanabe. Also throughout the film, I was constantly reminded of Shimura's later performance two years down the road as the wise, headstrong, brave, battle-tested, and heroic samurai master Kambei Shimada in Kurosawa's epic masterpiece \"Seven Samurai\" (1954) - my all-time favorite Kurosawa picture and my all-time favorite foreign-language feature; Shimura's Kambei Shimada was my favorite warrior from \"Seven Samurai\" for his bravery and leadership skills.Here, Shimura's Kanji Watanabe is weak, frail, panic-stricken, and fearful of his impending demise. In a few other ways, I'm somehow reminded of Nicolas Cage's Oscar-winning turn in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995), where he played a failed screenwriter who was determined to drink himself to death and nothing, not even love, was going to stop him from accomplishing his goal. Kanji Watanabe is much the polar opposite of Cage's character, who doesn't just want to live a little bit longer, but just wants to give his few remaining months some sort of meaning and to affirm to himself (and us), that his existence meant something to the world.It's a bold and brilliant statement of what it means to live a life worth living; I've often pondered what it means to go through life and to work in meaningless professions rather than simply living the rich, fulfilling lives that we all really want to live, and not waiting until it's too late to realize it. This is much of what I gather from \"Ikiru,\" though like any great film (or any film, really), many statements and messages can be gathered from it. But this is what I got from \"Ikiru.\"After all these years, \"Seven Samurai\" remains my favorite Akira Kurosawa picture, followed by \"Ran\" (1985), \"Rashomon,\" (1950), and now this film. I think Takashi Shimura really gave his all in this picture, a tragic, career-defining performance that is all too real and for some, could possibly hit a little too close to home (though I will always regard Kambei Shimada from \"Seven Samurai\" as the greatest character he's ever played). Why he was never nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, I will never know. But there's no question that after watching this movie, he deserved the greatest official recognition an actor can receive for their work on a motion picture...10/10",

A sensitive and moving film , including the crucial and wonderful shot of the sick man sitting huddled alone in the park on a kid's swing , while the snow falls and he croons happily to himself as he waits for death .The motion picture was compellingly directed by maestro Akira kurosawa possibly his most Eastern movie .A great achievement in Kurosawa trumphant avoidance of happy end uplight . The usually restrained Kurosawa was one of the films directed of the film history .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the \"Best Foreign Film\" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.

Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August , among others .",

            "content": "I wonder if it's a coincidence that Yasujiro Ozu's 1953 \"Tokyo Story\" and this 1952 masterwork from Akira Kurosawa were released just months apart in Japan, as both deal with the disappointments between parents and children in similarly penetrating ways. It's likely that post-WWII Japan, especially after the Allied occupation ended in 1951, saw an overall deterioration of the family unit as Western influences took hold of the socioeconomic structure. This one goes even further in adding local government bureaucracy as a key factor in diminishing the self-worth of those who sacrificed their lives in meaningless jobs. A particularly effective sequence early in the film involves the local bureau's reaction to a proposal to build a park with each department representative claiming that its hands are tied and passing the buck to another department in ceaseless red tape.The focus here is on Kanji Watanabe, a stamp-wielding chief of affairs who routinely halts civic project proposals that come across his desk, which is covered with stacks of unread documents. At his job for thirty years, Watanabe earns the nickname of \"The Mummy\" for his catatonic manner, but when he learns he has stomach cancer and has six months to live, he takes stock of all he has left undone. Saddled with a son and daughter-in-law who hypocritically feel burdened by him (even though they live in his house), Watanabe embarks on an obsessive journey to find redemption. It takes him from Tokyo's seedy nightlife - some of the more vibrantly surreal scenes are contained here - through an oddly erratic and strictly platonic relationship with a young female colleague named Toyo, whose spirit inspires him to do something right before he dies. The last hour of the lengthy film suddenly becomes a flashback from Watanabe's wake, which retraces his monomaniacal effort to support a group of housewives to build a children's playground where a toxic cesspool exists. The switch in perspective is initially jarring, but it gradually makes sense as it is meant to show the effect of Watanabe's good deeds on others and questions whether they will have a lasting effect on them. As it turns out, the cancer liberates Watanabe from the futile life he led and makes him a greater man than anyone could have imagined with the park as his undeniable legacy.Truth be told, Kurosawa is not as subtle as Ozu when treading such sensitive subject matter, for instance, Kurosawa films actual flashback scenes to understand Watanabe's evolving relationship with his son, whereas Ozu would merely imply the distance between them. However, Kurosawa builds the appropriate gravitas as the story unfolds in a sometimes glacial manner. Takashi Shimura, a Kurosawa regular who would gain greater renown as the leader of \"The Seven Samurai\" two years later, is deeply affecting as Watanabe. With his frozen cow-eyes and slumping posture, he captures the discomforting nature of this hapless man who finds his purpose just before it's too late. He achieves a brutal poignancy with his nightclub-set singing of his theme song, \"Life Is Brief\", his lips hardly moving and his eyes cast in a downward stare toward oblivion. The last shot of him on the swing, magically framed by a jungle gym in a light snowfall as he sings his theme, is an utterly transcendent moment. I am on the fence about Miki Odagiri's performance as Toyo - on one hand, she fully embodies the free, uninhibited spirit of her downscale character, and yet, she can go overboard with her ebullience during key moments. I also feel the nightlife sequences go on a little too long as they appear to provide simply an opportunity for an indulgent novelist, played by Yunosuke Ito, to go on about the joys of the road not taken.Minor flaws aside, this is a moving film that encompasses the importance of bringing purpose to one's life even if you have little time left in this world. The two-disc Criterion Collection set contains plenty of extras - an informative commentary track provided by Stephen Prince, author of \"The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa\", as well as two documentaries. One is an 81-minute film, \"A Message from Akira Kurosawa\", about Kurosawa's late-career creative process around the filming of 1991's \"Rhapsody in August\", and the other is a more engrossing 41-minute film, which focuses exclusively on \"Ikiru\" and has a rare interview with Shimura.",

It could translate to any society where there are individuals who live their lives in jobs that are meaningless, who have little personal joy, who don't really know how to enjoy the blessing of life that they have. They won't die homeless but they often die alone and unrecognized. The message of IKIRU is amazing in that it's about the difference one man can make without being preachy or contrived. Mr. Watanabe isn't a great man, nor is he a bad man. He is an ordinary man, undoubtedly drawn from real-life examples of Japanese government workers in the post-WWII era. The thing about his life is that everyone is comfortable with his state of being, until he finds out he's dying and sets out to fulfill a nearly-impossible building task. After that, no one, including him, is comfortable, and that splits between the people who think he's out of his mind and the people who realize that he is driven to make a positive difference before he dies.The most remarkable facet of IKIRU is that we get a sense of this division without seeing any truly evil characters. Mr. Watanabe's son is not likable, but we sense he's got more of a backstory with his often-absent father than we could suspect and don't just hate him (though he's most outspoken about refusing to try and understand what his father was thinking). And the transformation of this man, from a catatonic civil servant to a dynamo obsessed with change, does include an element of madness, albeit in a focused and positive form. And that made me have more respect for Mr. Watanabe than I ever could for someone who was the classic white knight figure. He fought through the barriers that had delineated his spare, safe life and really accomplished something. That's the lesson here, one that Akira Kurosawa presents without jumping up and down about it, and that makes IKIRU a timeless masterpiece.",

Ikiru is my favourite of his films that i have seen so far and i urge anyone who is thinking about discovering Akira Kurosawa's movies to make this one the first. Ikiru is the modern-day tale of a lonely man confronting death in post-war Tokyo. One of the greatest actors of Japanese cinema, Takashi Shimura, plays Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged civil servant who has slavishly devoted himself to his job for thirty years, only to find that he now has inoperable stomach cancer. With limited time left, and the feeling that he has never truly lived at all, Watanabe embarks on a quest to make the most of his remaining days. After bouts of self-pity, a spell of hedonism and a doomed attempt at a platonic relationship, he commits himself doggedly to the task of converting a city dump into a children's playground.Takashi Shimura was an am amazing actor. His facial expression were masterful. He could light up the screen when he smiled and when he was sad the audience felt his misery. His portrayal of cancer stricken watanabe is amazing. When he says\" I can't afford to hate people. I don't have that kind of time.\" you believe every word.Ikiru is a story that makes you wonder why we trudge along in our everyday lives and what would we do or say if we were told we only had months to live and why would we wait for news like that to start living our lives?Ikiru translation into English is \"To Live\" and you have not lived until you have seen this movie.9 out of 10",

It was playing (no sound) in the background on the opposite side of the restaurant. I couldn't keep my eyes off it (no offense to my friend), especially the scene where the main character is dragged on a tour of the night hot spots of post war Tokyo. The editing and photography was dazzling - I knew immediately it had to be Kurosawa, and I had to see the movie. At the time, i was only interested in seeing his samurai and historic epics.To say this movie didn't disappoint is a huge understatement. It is simply a masterpiece, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. It is of course (as anyone reading the reviews here will know) deeply human and hugely moving. It is a very beautiful and thought provoking movie. But its also quite amazingly structured - it breaks so many rules of film making - it 'ends' half way through and an almost completely new movie starts - a brilliant third act at his funeral, where the formerly minor characters become stars (a brilliant ensemble piece of acting) as the former colleagues argue about what the deceased stood for. I can't think of any movie that has used flashbacks in time to such great effect. Each segment of the movie - the initial funny set up in the government office, the nightclub scene, his dating with the simple but funny office girl and of course the final playground scene - each is perfection.Some reviewers have drawn many comparisons with Ozu's Tokyo Story, made the same year. It so happens that Tokyo Story is maybe my all time favorite movie. Well, Ikiru is right up with it. While Tokyo Story is much more subtle, like 'a strong current under still water' as Kurosawa would have put it, this is much more muscular, direct film making. Its occasionally sentimental, even manipulative, in a way Ozu would never have dreamed of trying. But it is also a '10' in my book. An absolute must-see for anyone interested in cinema. Hell, its a must see for anyone interested in living.",

This movie is another good example of giving us a view into different personalities and their different ways how to deal with life and death.The movie does leave it, like most Akira movies, to the viewer to make our own decision about the characters and their actions. Showing us like in different mirrors the light and shadow sides of our all psyche which we have in us and which we often prefer to deny even from ourselves.Ikiru makes this even clearer as it plays in a modern society instead of the old feudal Japan, which is too distant to most viewers.\nBut the problems showed in the movie and the good and bad traits we can see in this movie are timeless as they show the whole facets of human emotions and traits and how we can grow beyond ourselves when we get confronted with certain situations. Showing without a lifted finger how a single individual can touch the life of others and set a shining example for bravery and determination.And like so many other movies of Akira does also Ikiru leaves the viewer behind with stirred-up emotions, making us once more clear to what positive or negative actions human beings are able to, leaving us with shame and pride at the same time and open the mind for asking ourselves what we often did good and bad in our life and how this decisions affected others.I can just highly recommend watching this movie and showing it also to teenagers to give them something to ponder about.",

This one's in black-and-white not too surprising for the year or for the filmmaker. Also at easily over two hours it is a common running time for Kurosawa and far from his longest. But you should not expect an eastern movie here in the traditional sense of swordfighting, which is what maybe made Kurosawa most famous when he elaborated on samurai. This one we have here is much more current and human from beginning to end and actually the story depicted in here could also somewhat take place like this in the year 2019. I'll get into detail about that later. First of all I would like to mention lead actor Takashi Shimura here who has worked with Kurosawa on other occasions. And he scored a BAFTA nomination for his turn here, which is really really unusual from a certain perspective, namely that he got nominated no less than eight years after this film was released originally, now that is a long time. Funnily before his nomination for Ikiru he was also nominated for another BAFTA for another more famous Kurosawa film that was released two years after this one. Release dates can be strange if films are involved from countries/regions that are far away from the western world.Okay now a few words on this movie itself. It is pretty well-structured all in all. The narration is something to get used to early on, but it is okay. Maybe you could say there are three or four segments. The first would be the beginning when he finds out about his illness, thinks a lot about it and his life and also tries to talk about it with his son which is maybe among the most heartbreaking sequences because of how he says his son is the reason why he worked his life so hard, but the connection between them was really not how it should be accordingly, maybe also because of his daughter-in-law who was clearly not the old man's biggest fan. Then the story moves on to how the man tries to actually live and make up for the time he lost and enjoy his life for the little time still left to him. This sequence at least when he met this young fellow who listens to him and heads with him through the club scene did not do too much for me from an artistic or emotional perspective. But then when the focus switches to this young female co-worked, it gets a lot better and this is probably when the movie is at its best. She is truly mesmerizing and should have received far more awards recognition than she did. Anyway, it also felt realistic how she was written that despite liking him and enjoying her time with him she still sees him as a bit of a creepy old man and does not understand why he wants to spend so much time with her. It's not about romance, which she of course does not see, and the people talking see it even less, those were sort of funny and brought in nice comic relief. But when he talks to her about his fate, it makes sense to her somewhat at least. And I can also see why he somewhat picks her because she made the decision that he regrets he never made. She says the job is not for her and so she goes and quits it. Okay these two had great chemistry. Then not much later the man dies and still he is not completely gone from the picture. The people around him, especially his colleagues, try to find out what was going on with him really. I must say I did not like this really lengthy sequence that much it could have been shorter and honestly I also could not really understand how they did change their minds inspired from the deceased man. I mean it is a pretty nice happy ending, but if it is realistic I don't know. I would even say it was too unrealistic honestly for me to just enjoy it happily as a guilty pelasure ending.But overall, it is a good, not great film I'd say. I mentioned the two best components already in the title oof this review and you yould certainly also add the female performance I mentioned. Shame it is even here on imdb not too easy to find her name, she should have been second- or third-credited at least. I think the way this film is seen today is partially accurate. Now it is not a masterpiece and also seeing it in the imdb top250 is way too much for my taste, but it should be among Kurosawa's more, not most, known. It is a very human and touching film at times. There is for example a great sad irony to it when we see him sitting on the ground not being able to talk to his son about what is going on and his wife then says something along the lines that it is weird how he just sits in their room without permission while they live probably rentfree in the man's house. By the way speaking of it, I don's think we really find out what happened to the man's wife/love. But it is not essential for the film anyway. Then let me add that despite the heavy and sometimes heartbreaking subject the film has moments of creative writing that will put a smile on your lips and well maybe you will like the man's impact at the end after his death more than I did, then you will also leave the theater at least slightly delighted. But maybe for me personally the most important message here is about really wasting his life with work, a subject that always rings somehat close to me because I find it pretty tragic. Honestly, from what I heard it is an even bigger problem in japan to this day where colleagues are on the same level as family and 50-hour weeks nothing unusual. But I think already from that perspective it is really good this film was made that maybe it will have an impact on some people's lives that they start working to live and not living to work. All in all, I certainly give this film a thumbs-up. It had some sequences that did very little for me, but others that were really really good, so lets go with the choice in-between and I send out a positive, but not overly enthusiastic recommendation. You probably won#t need my thumbs-up or down anyway and be able to decide for yourself if a black-and-white Japanese film from the 1950s is up your alley. In terms of the basics. Plot- and content-wise it is certainly worth seeing.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru is an emotional, moving portrait of what it is like to live life. This film really makes you ponder about your life. It asks simple, but important questions such, \"What are you doing with your life?\" Honestly, this film made me contemplate my own life and made some important changes. You only live once, so let's live the best life you can. Based on reviews I have seen from all different ages, this film truly resonated with everyone. Even though Kurosawa constantly mentions death or cancer, this movie never truly felt depressing. I felt happy for the main character because he was finding the will to live despite the diagnosis of terminal cancer. The film is a robust two-and-a-half hours, but you never feel the time passing by thanks to Kurosawa's steady direction, strong visuals and camerawork, and a humane story that invests your mind. Also, Takashi Shimura's performance spoke to me on many levels.Believe it or not, this is the first time I was able to sit through a Kurosawa film. I immediately grasped the idea why he is one of the best directors of all time. He takes these moving images and uses them to create humane stories about life. Everyone knows about The Seven Samurai, which came out several years later, but everyone says this is his most intimate film. I can certainly imagine why. This film was released in Japan in 1952. The United States barely got a chance to see the film in 1956, and it finally was released internationally in 1960. The excuse was that \"it's too Japan.\" I was very surprised by that statement because these themes are universal, and they still resonate to me.The literal translation of Ikiru is \"to live\". Our main character, after his cancer diagnosis, tries to find a reason through alcohol and women, but still does not get moved. It comes down to his job and doing the right thing for people which finally gives him that spark. Kurosawa made some bold statements about modern Japanese bureaucracy as seen in the opening scenes. Huge piles of paperwork, the dictation of a rubber stamp, sending people to pointless stations to \"solve\" mundane issues. Kanji Watanabe (the main character) is not living life. He is going through the notion's day after day. As the film itself says, he is already half-dead.Kanji Watanable (Takashi Shimura) is a Tokyo bureaucrat who has been in his position for over thirty years. He does nothing but work, sleep, and eat, hardly the definition of living. In a harsh scene, he is diagnosed with gastric cancer and is given a death sentence. He does not tell his family about his situation, but rather spends the night in town with a novelist. When that does not satisfy him, he strikes up a friendship with a young woman from his office. Ultimately, it is through his job that allows him to make a difference-building a public park. After his death and during the funeral, his peers and family try to solve the mystery of his death.Takashi Shimura gave a heartfelt performance that will always stick with me. I never knew about any of his roles, but that will change. He apparently worked with Kurosawa eleven times. When he sings \"Gondola no Uta\", I am moved to tears. He sang once at a bar which silenced the entire crowd and once later on in a very pivotal scene. His final scenes really struck me. He did everything well; reacting to his diagnosis, fighting his son over money, etc. Each scene is of importance and Shimura gave it all he got.Overall, Ikiru is a movie that any cinephile should seek out. It is a movie that makes you think about your own life. One day, you'll grow old and look back on your life and ask yourself, \"Did I live a good, meaningful life?\" This movie proved how graceful Kurosawa is as a director. He really knows how to create a story about life and not turn it into some soapy melodrama. Whether it's 1956 or 2021, these themes resonate with any society in my humble opinion. While this may not be a flashy movie like The Seven Samurai, this is still worth seeing especially if you are ready to have some feels.My Grade: A.",

            "review_title": "Fact: Akira Kurosawa was a genius",
            "content": "It's no surprise that this is another beautiful film from legendary Akira Kurosawa. Only this time we move away from the samurai genre and move into modern (1952) times. Ikiru is about a bureaucrat in the city office named Kanji Watanabe. He has worked in the same building, at the same desk, with the same papers for over 30 years. And then one day he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer, left with only six months to live. Upon learning this, Watanabe reflects on his life, coming to the realization that he has no close ties to friends or family. His life is empty. In the six months he has left, Watanabe attempts to fill his life with the things he never experienced in his dull life. From the get-go we expect a strong centralized character development story, and Kurosawa delivers just such a thing in his own beautiful aesthetic.This film covers a lot of ground, and many ideas are presented. It's the story of a dying man, as well as a heartfelt study of life and death, and even a commentary on bureaucracy. There's a lot going on but Kurosawa masterfully organizes it so that it works wonders on the mind and heart. In the beginning we establish just how overcomplicated and heavily structured the bureaucratic system is. It's organized, rigid, and very, very dull. The character of Watanabe acts the same way. He is an empty shell of a man. The film quickly takes a turn down a sloping emotional path when Watanabe learns of his inescapable death. From here this character makes a dramatic switch to actual life. The tag line of the film is \"Only when he learned he would die did he start to live.\" This is such a telling sentence that beautifully sums up the bulk of the emotion in this film. Watanabe begins to explore life and what he can make of it before he dies. Kurosawa's fantastic ability for storytelling provides a great narrative style that stays lively and interesting. Watanabe goes through multiple phases of coping with his inevitable death, each phase revealing more and more about his complex and wonderfully crafted character.The narrative changes it's style in the last act of the film after Watanabe dies. The last hour or so of the film is set at his wake, and what happened in the last couple of months of Watanabe's life is told through flashbacks. This was a fantastic storytelling decision that keeps the already compelling narrative all the more alive, especially when the film runs at two and a half hours. Kurosawa even manages to bring his bureaucratic message back around in the end, when Watanabe must battle the own system he worked for diligently for 30 years, in order to achieve his last great service to the world before he dies. Everything comes full circle to close nicely. The film comes to a beautifully tear jerking end that I'm sure, even after only one viewing, will be unforgettable. Kurosawa treats this smaller scale story of a dying man with such care and respect. It is a fantastic example of his range and ability to have an emotional impact, even out of his usual setting of feudal Japan.I could continue to regurgitate the brilliance of Kurosawa but there's not much need to. This man, in his career, established himself as one of the greatest artistic minds of his time. He could tell a story and then visualize it in such an immaculate and grand way. Ikiru is no different. It's another fantastic Kurosawa film that entertains and stirs emotionally. The man was a genius, and every film of his reflects it.",

A simple setting, a very straightforward story line and very real characters. There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except the journey that it will take you on.For a little over two hours, you become a bureaucrat in the pre- reformation Japanese society. You start off as a corrupt officer of the government and you then go on to experience apathy, sorrow, grief, revival, struggle, disappointment and then finally inner peace.The movie is not just about Japanese society. It is not a commentary on the state of affairs at that time. It is a brilliant take on the human condition itself. A telling tale of transformation, by whatever means, of a human being into a humane being. Yet, it is bitter-sweet in the sense that even such a metamorphosis doesn't really change things too much. People see the man and his transformation, they hear his story. Some of them even weep for him and grieve, but in the end, they all move on. C'est la vie!A must watch for all movie aficionados and a movie worthy of being cherished. A classic and a masterful work of art.

Obsessed with the task of applying his stamp to authenticate the documents that pass through his hands, what he actually does is do nothing, ignoring or solemnly giving runaround to taxpayers who come to the section to make complaints.Absent from his work for the first time in many years, Mr. Watanabe receives the news of his illness, and despairs, less for the doctor's evasive announcement, but for the exact description of his symptoms by an inopportune man in the waiting room who gives him less than three months to live (the doctor does not speak, but believes the man would live at least another six months).Returning home early after nearly being hit by a truck, the old boss kneels in the dark until he inadvertently overhears the talk of his son and daughter-in-law who unknowingly plan to use the father's inheritance and savings. The scene that closes the first half-hour of the movie is very sad and striking: the old man cries under the blanket for no one to hear while the camera shows on the wall a twenty-five-year award for excellent service.Alone, the bureaucrat decides to drink and, in a bar, meets a writer who decides to guide him through places where the man had never dared to live until that moment: pachinko parlors, the red light district, and dance halls. Watanabe asks a pianist to play \"Life is short, fall in love, dear maiden\" and sings the song himself, causing everyone, including the movie audience, to fall into utter bewilderment. Here, Takashi Shimura is unforgettable.Wanted by a coworker, who is resigning and needs his stamp to authenticate his resignation, Watanabe starts dating the girl for dinner and outings and has with her the great insight of her life: something meaningful can always be done. Returning to his work, the boss decides to fulfill an old claim of residents of a neighborhood: eliminate a pool of stagnant water, building a playground there.The last fifty minutes of the film take place at Watanabe's funeral, where successive flashbacks are told of their epic by the city departments to do what they are paid to do. Accomplished, the master solemnly sings \"Life is Short,\" sitting on a park swing under a blizzard, and dies softly.",

            "content": "I suppose it isn't truly a spoiler to say the main character, Watanabe, dies of cancer at the end of the film. For most directors, this probably would have been a overly sentimental death drama. Kurosawa is far to talented and sophisticated for such triteness. This is a rich, meaningful, touching story of a man's attempt to live. The themes of this film are so universal, we can access it even 50 years after its release. Several good films have been made along similar themes. \"Wild Strawberries\" is one of the best. I have not seen \"Umberto D.\", but I understand it is very similar. Bergman and Kirusawa are very similar filmmakers. Bergman seems to me to be more metaphorical and Kirusawa is more aesthetic. They are both superb writers/directors. \"Ikiru\" is a heavy layered film. After listening to the commentary on the Criterion Edition, you learn that this film makes many significant social comments on Japanese life. At the same time, as I said earlier, the emotions and themes of this film are ubiquitous. You don't have to possess a knowledge of 1950s Japanese politics to understand it. You simply have to be human and possess a desire to live a meaningful life. There are many images from the film that linger with you. Kirusawa, like Bergman and Hitchcock, was so good a composition. His films are so visually active that you can know everything you need to know without the dialogue. However, the dialogue is simple and very effective. The characters talk the way normal people talk, yet the say things normal people don't say. That to me is great dialogue. I was disappointed in the film stock from which the DVD came. It was not in good condition. That is a real shame. I am not sure why that is. Criterion does great work with the classics. They must not have been able to obtain anywhere near pristine stock. This is such a beautiful film. It would great to see it from the original negatives.",

Both stories are efforts to grapple with the the imminence of death when it finally arrives for a believably human person who touches us deeply because we so readily recognize our own weaknesses and strengths in his. Much in both stories can also be connected with theories on death developed later by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.Like most symphonies, the film can be divided into four movements: 1) Background and diagnosis, 2) Making up for the waste of the past I--a night on the town, 3) Making up for the waste of the past II--a pathetic infatuation, 4) Funeral scene and flashback on the building of the park. Ikiru is less about a corrupt and obstructionist \"system\" than about one man's struggle to achieve something memorable before he dies.  Everything about this masterpiece is graced with a subtlety that is uniquely Japanese and uniquely Kurosawa's.The sad little infatuation of elderly bachelor Watanabe with a young former office underling is a superby honest appraisal of human nature on the parts of both characters.  And the moment during the funeral when the committee of mothers arrive, kneel, and spend a minute in deep keening was one of the most wrenching emotional experiences I have ever received from a film.Takashi Shimura is so good an actor that watching him is like a form of meditation.  Just looking at his photo on the funeral altar brought tears to my eyes.  It is astonishing that this harmless-looking little man also played the role of the leader of the Seven Samurai!",

            "content": "This Kurosawa favorite veers awfully close to  *Now, Voyager*  territory; to \"Beaches\"  territory; to  *Love Story*  territory.  In the final analysis, a director -- even the greatest one who ever lived -- is never so manipulative as when he chooses a cancer victim for the subject of his film. We all know someone who has, or has had, cancer, and we all know just how horrible it can be for those it strikes.  Therefore, Kurosawa has already plunged the knife in our hearts from the first frame, which shows us an X-ray of our protagonist's cancerous stomach.  All Kurosawa has to do from here on out is twist the handle.Thankfully, the director listened to the wise counsel of co-writer Hideo Oguni, who insisted on having the main character die -- unseen -- a little more than half-way through the film . . . thereby setting up what is perhaps the greatest 45 minutes in all of cinema:  Watanabe's Wake, With Flashbacks. To tell the truth, this  \"second part\"  of  *Ikiru*  stands completely on its own merits, and would by any reckoning rank as the greatest  \"short\" feature film ever made.  Which is not to say that there wasn't any great stuff in the preceding hour and fifteen minutes.  Believe me, there's great stuff.  However, there's also a lot of maudlin stuff.  Put it this way:  one thoroughly sympathizes with a young woman who exclaims to Watanabe  (Takashi Shimura), \"There's that long face again!\"  Kurosawa frankly overdoes the closeups of actor Shimura's face, which is half hangdog, half agonized. It's also half comical, after a while.  And while I can dig the verisimilitude of Watanabe's incoherent mutterings and unfinished phrases (he always says, \"What I mean to say is . . .\"  but he never finishes the sentence), that doesn't mean that the whole thing isn't slightly irritating. The film finally threatens to become downright bad when Kurosawa zooms in on Shimura as he sings a sappy old Japanese love song from the turn of the century:  the hushed voice trembles, the tears spill.<SPOILERS THROUGH THE REST OF THE REVIEW>  Yes, enough is enough . . . but perhaps we required this nadir of maudlin despair for us  (and Watanabe, for that matter)  to bounce back and re-engage us.  Kurosawa masterfully raises the stakes with each set-piece that follows, until the last time we see him alive he's back at his civil service job, heading off to survey a site for a recreational park.  \"You can do anything, if you put your minds to it!\"  he declares to his dubious subordinates.  And then, CUT!He's dead, and we're at his wake.  Kurosawa, who loved American-style detective fiction, proceeds to give us a mystery, of sorts:  was Watanabe REALLY responsible for the city's beloved new park?  and if so, how did he manage it?  AND did he know about his stomach cancer, or was it unexpected? what accounted for his odd yet heroic behavior during the last months of his life?  The rest of the narrative is related via flashback by Watanabe's various co-workers and subordinates.  Of course, the  \"proper\"  thing for a critic to say is that we should NEVER be in doubt early on, as to whether or not Watanabe made the park possible.  But the first time I saw this, I had been put off by the sentimentality just enough to where I questioned the whole thing, and had thought how funny it would've been if this little bureaucrat had been forced to rely on his dreadful  \"colleagues\"  to finally accomplish something worthwhile in his life.  The fact is, I can't tolerate saints.  (Oh well, I guess I'm not a very nice person.)  But the wonder of this sequence comes from the exceedingly witty manner in which Watanabe's feats are told and retold during the increasingly drunken wake.  The little old man, at least in the memory of his fellow bureaucrats, disproves the adage that you Can't Fight City Hall.  The crescendo of the wake sequence, followed by the sober-light-of-morning denouement, are together ruefully true-to-life.A final observation:  I don't think  *Ikiru*  is as  \"existential\"  as some critics have made it out to be.  Watanabe in the end makes a tangible difference in the world he leaves behind.  That park EXISTS in the Real World.  Kurosawa was a HUMANIST, not an existentialist.",

            "review_title": "Just Another Reason Why The \"Lesser\" Kurosawa Is Easily the Most Overrated Director of All Time",
            "content": "This review continues my recent assault on particular cinematic themes that annoy me incessantly, and therefore require a therapeutic purging via an extensive (and scathing) IMDb review. The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa \u2013 hereafter referred to as the \"lesser\" Kurosawa, primarily because when one hears the name Kurosawa one should immediately think of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who is superior in almost every respect to this \"lesser\" Kurosawa, a director artificially propped up on an undeserving pedestal by a group of disillusioned followers. Sure, he had one solid film in Seven Samurai (1954), but every time I see his other movies I wonder how the hell anyone could think that this guy was a great director. It befuddles me, even though I am a huge fan of other directors from the same time period.My primary problem with the \"lesser\" Kurosawa is his indisputable ability of getting the absolute worst out of his actors and actresses. In Ran (1985) Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Lord Hidetora) contributes a series of embarrassingly overacted moments during any and all scenes where strong emotion is required. In Hidden Fortress (1958) Misa Uehara (Princess Yuki) gives one of the worst performances of the 1950s. Even Toshiro Mifune had a truly inept performance in Rashomon (1950). In Dreams (1991) almost everyone stinks the place out. Ikiru (1952) continues the track record for this \"lesser\" Kurosawa, because Takashi Shimura (who plays Kanji Watanabe) is quite simply horrible in this film. He basically has three modes of facial expression:1. Wimpering Crybaby Mode. 2. Sad Puppy Dog Mode. 3. Hallucinogenic Mode.I'll leave it to the viewer to identify the specific instances where each of these modes are employed by Shimura, but I simply cannot help but comment on #2 above. During Sad Puppy Dog phases, Shimura's face lengthens and his eyes bug-out to make even fruit-flies jealous. Basically, he looks like a 3-year-old after being scolded, not a person of sufficient maturity enduring pain or suffering. He doesn't react to situations like any grown man would. In fact, the Watanabe character is so devoid of basic humanity that he comes off as a stand-in for Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I'm not kidding when I say that Shimura's facial expressions make Ikiru both unintentionally hilarious and infuriating. I literally wanted to strike him with a blunt object or stick needles in his eyes just so he'd stop staring pathetically at me through my television screen. This whole situation ruins the entire film. The crux is that even a mediocre director should have prevented this by instructing Shimura appropriately. This \"lesser\" Kurosawa was apparently incapable of understanding the concept of \"overacting\", so he let Shimura ham it up for 140 minutes. You can almost hear this \"lesser\" Kurosawa behind the camera:\"You're a puppy dog, Takashi. You're a puppy dog. Show me those puppy dog eyes!\"It's no wonder why George Lucas found \"inspiration\" from the \"lesser\" Kurosawa's works, since Lucas practically perfected the \"art\" of getting the absolute worst out of his actors, regardless of how good they perform when not under the \"influence\" of good ole George.Like many of the other works by this director, Ikiru is about an hour too long. Watching Watanabe go clubbing for 60 minutes was totally unnecessary. The very thin premise was stretched out for so long that I was reminded of Peter Jackson, who needed 600 minutes to tell one of the most basic, formulaic stories in the history of cinema. The \"lesser\" Kurosawa could have trimmed the first half, but in all honesty it would have only made this agonizing cinematic experience shorter, not better. Since the lead protagonist had the reason and intellect of a 3-year-old, there wasn't much in the way of potential development, and what little occurs comes from out of nowhere. The entire maturity of Watanabe is expressed in a segment spanning a few measly minutes, when he goes to work with zeal and runs out the front door to help the people. Kurosawa \u2013 in his infinite stupidity \u2013 then chooses to cut the sequence off completely, only to then shoot ahead half a year in time to show a bunch of politicians reminiscing about Watanabe's tasks for 45 minutes. There is simply no way that the viewer can relate to the revelatory happiness of the main character through the third-person conversations of characters that had a combined screen time of only a few minutes previously. It's a total miscalculation on the part of the director who takes the cheap way out with an abhorrently overrated \"swing\" scene in the snow. Yes, the scene is pretty, but it simply cannot substitute for a lack of character development that essentially occupies 5 total minutes out of a 140-minute film. And no, I refuse to count 30 minutes of puppy dog glances as character development. The mediocrity of this much-loved \"lesser\" Kurosawa is even more evident in the fact that other, greatly superior dramatic directors like Yasujiro Ozu were making fantastic films like Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) \u2013 films that make Ikiru (1952) look like amateur hour at best, because they have everything lacking in this film \u2013 great acting, storyline, and character development with believable, realistic performances. It's a travesty that exceptional directors like Ozu must live in the shadows of a lesser director who is, quite frankly, incompetent. It's almost humorous that the \"lesser\" Kurosawa came out with Ikiru in the time period in-between Ozu's films mentioned above. We can safely call this a crap sandwich.",

Perhaps, but also a very tedious one.Yes I can appreciate the message about finding your meaning of life and making a difference etc but a film having a serious message doesn't mean it has to drag; Ikiru was very slow and rather long as well. Not a good combination. What cheered up the film a bit was the female lead, the girl from the office... Ikiru, imo, has only one great scene; The girl showing her emotions at the restaurant, her sheer disgust/pity was quite fascinating to watch. Other than that it was the sad puppy face and slumped shoulders of the protagonist for almost couple hours which sure is memorable but also one note acting.The wake scene, which consisted of almost last hour of the film, was some sort of critical social commentary on Japanese culture, way of thinking and bureaucracy - but also rather poor storytelling since it was hard for the viewer to relate to arguments by characters that had not really been introduced properly earlier in the film. More emotionally effective would have been to actually witness the protagonist perform his life altering bureaucratic heroics himself. Well, to be fair, Kurosawa actually did show some of it using flashbacks...It seems that Kurosawa has a fetish for flashbacks, as seen in \"Rashomon\" as well. Yet those scenes in Ikiru were pretty much protagonist merely nodding and begging in apologetic manner. I found that less than convincing way to get the job done... or to achieve a legacy for that matter. Oh well, at least they played Pachinko and visited a strip tease show. But couple breaks from tedium and the life altering philosophy just couldn't save the film from its slow pace, predictability and dare I say rather mediocre cinematography. I'll give it 5/10.",

            "content": "Some people consider \"Ikiru\" (\"To Live\") as the greatest movie that Japanese director Akira Kurosawa ever made. And remember, this is the same man who also directed acclaimed masterworks such as \"Ran,\" \"Kagemusha,\" \"Seven Samurai,\" \"Yojimbo,\" and \"Rashomon.\" Many of Kurosawa's movies also touched on a human level amongst their scenes of gritty, visceral violence and the brilliance of \"Ikiru\" is that its emotional levels outscore all of those without one clip of actual, physical barbarism unless you count a death threat scene near the end of the picture.No swords are swung, no blood is sprayed in \"Ikiru\" because this is not a period piece like \"Seven Samurai\" or \"Kagemusha.\" Set in modern-day Japan, a middle-aged bureaucrat discovers despite his doctor's attempts to hide the truth from him, that he has stomach cancer in that he will die in six months...or less. The bureaucrat, Kanji Watanabe, played by the great Takashi Shimura in what may be his finest performance, mourns over the lack of a real life that he has had so far. At work, one of his unenthusiastic employees calls him \"the mummy\" because he does live life to its fullest. He has spent his entire life stamping sheets of paper without bonding with his son or enjoying the time he has on earth. As the title would hit, Watanabe decides that he has \"to live\" before he inevitably dies, and leave something for him to be remembered by.The ways that Akira Kurosawa tugs on our heart strings is utterly brilliant. The level of sympathy that our souls generate for poor Watanabe is simply amazing as even the younger generations can identify with his fears. I don't think there's a person alive on this earth who is not at least subliminally afraid of the dreadful disease of cancer and the even greater fear of knowing that you only have a short time left to live. Like John Wayne's last film \"The Shootist,\" we develop incredible amounts of sympathy and remorse for the protagonist and the tender moments are truly tear-jerking.Kurosawa's storytelling skills are displayed to their absolute fullest in the first two-thirds of \"Ikiru\" when Watanabe discovers he has cancer and then begins to encompass all opportunities that he has left to him. There's a wonderful subplot where he begins to bond with a younger woman who has an unbelievable passion for living. Now this sounds like a formula for a creepy, off-putting payoff, but it does not. Rather, this becomes one of the most enthralling elements of the picture.Now, I will admit it, \"Ikiru\" is not, to my mind, a perfect motion picture and therefore it is not on the same level (to me) as some of Kurosawa's other films. The reason why is because the last third of the picture, I'm terribly sorry to say, runs out of steam. It does not stretch out with the same passion and enthralling emotions that the previous two-thirds did. Perhaps it just did not flow through the way I had wanted it to.But then again, I am still rather young. Film critic Roger Ebert has stated that \"Ikiru\" was his choice for Kurosawa's best film and that every time he saw it, it became more powerful for him because as he grew older, he identified more and more with Kanji Watanabe. I shall undoubtedly come to cherish and adore \"Ikiru\" as I grow older. As it is now, in my youth, I see it as a wonderful movie that does a tremendous job up to a certain point where it only runs slow just by a smidgen. Everything before that is absolutely wonderful and absorbing. \"Ikiru\" is one of Kurosawa's most emotionally-strong pictures and one of the greatest to tackle the subjects of cancer and more importantly, life and death.",

But in SEVEN SAMURAI (as the head samurai Kamebi), he is strong and able.   Some might think it was two different actors!The man is dying of cancer for goodness sake.  Not everyone handles the situation the same.  Watanabe is just another soul trying to cope with the despair, and for me this was powerful stuff. (I should give kudos to Kurosawa.  The man was able to do more than just epic samurai movies).Hollywood tearjerkers don't compare with IKIRU.

This is an intense character study which hinges on Shimura's bravura acting job, who was himself an action hero in other Kurosawa films. I thought his ability to plumb the depths of sorrow and despair was astonishing, and he was able to sustain the overall impact despite the fact that he was in virtually every scene.I don't think IKIRU could be made today, or if it were it would have a very limited audience. It moves slowly for its length and requires too much involvement with its characters for modern audiences with their abbreviated attention spans. Movies for grownups are such a chore in 2011.",

The film was so fascinating, in so many ways. The director takes his time, and I never felt that the film was proceeding too slowly, or that any scene could have been cut or shortened.This is obviously a stylized film: the mountains of papers in the office, the excessively entrenched bureaucracy--everything was magnified and exaggerated. An example: there is an early scene in which the women from the neighborhood were attempting to find someone to help them, and they were shuffled from one office to the next. Then there is the scene in the doctor's waiting room, when a fellow-patient gives Mr. Watanabe his own diagnosis, and Mr. Watanabe's reaction is extreme. Momentarily, I expected this to become a farce or a black comedy, due to the exaggeration.

It's about that hole that suddenly emerges when our time inevitably draws to an end, that hole that we couldn't fill with meaning. For the old civil servant Kanji Watanabe (played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Takashi Shimura) it's a pretty big hole. He moved papers around for years and years in his stuffy office, got awards for the monotony he got used to, never questioned what he did and why, was satisfied with what he was and never got the idea to change. But he is ultimately alone when he understands that he will die soon. And as moments of his past flash before his eyes, the value of life hits Watanabe, and he needs to make a decision what to do with the little time he still got left...\"Ikiru\" shows us a struggle to escape the ways we are used to and to make the difference. Sounds familiar, right? But if it is kept real and is shot with less sentimental bombast than western productions unashamedly throw at us, then a downtrodden bureaucrat with a sudden fate inspired verve to make something happen turns into a hero. For Kurosawa this film was also a plead for individualism, especially when seen in the face of the Japanese society he lived in, where everybody played his role and life of the single man and woman became just inconveniences. Watanabe represents that flickering of hope, nothing more, but also nothing less, and his key moment occurs when he walks off with a plan, while teenagers celebrate one of their own with singing \"Happy Birthday\" in the background. But well, a single man won't change the world, and to fully appreciate life one needs to be almost dead. One can get a slight advantage by watching \"Ikiru\" though...",

This film really touched a nerve with me although you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it.

One scene that especially moved me was when he requested a song at a bar, and to everyone's surprise he started singing it himself. Similarly, the scene near the end where he was on a swing, singing the same haunting song, was heart wrenching. For the last quarter of the film, after Watanabe has died, we witness his wake as various co-workers discuss his life and piece together what made him change so drastically. Through the scenes at the wake, Kurosawa manages to provide an excellent critique of bureaucracy in post-war Japan but we also get to see how others viewed Watanabe through their rose tinted glasses.

Here it is a process of catharsism that leads him through the early days of hedonism to the enlightened finale where he justifies his life as a human being of worth.One of the defining post-war Japanese films along with the likes of Tokyo Story, it reflects a society amidst the turmoil of reconstruction, both politically and economically, and ultimately emotionally.  The image of Watanabe on the swings is one of cinema's greatest moments, reflecting a poignancy that for me has become synonymous with the best of Japanese cinema, from Mizoguchi to Takeshi Kitano.

Every time I see this movie Im stunned by the fact of its sincerity:the sincerity of Kurosawas vision, and his courage to without compromises follow it through. Embedded in a story of an old man, civil servant, who one day gets the information from his doctor that he suffers from stomach cancer, are all the the big features of great storytelling: allergorism truth, symbolism-take any choice from the dictionary. And its all told by the great humanist Akira Kurosawa, in his downplayed, earthy and somewhat warm ironic way. If you ever wondered about what Kurosawa was all about, watch this one.It is a true catharsis.Watch it!!",

            "content": "\"Ikiru\" is interesting and effective, and quite a change of pace from Kurosawa's action movies.  (Of course, most of his samurai films were made later than this one, but it's almost impossible not to think of them whenever you watch one of his other movies.)  It's long, and sometimes quite slow, but there isn't a minute of it that doesn't have a purpose.Takashi Shimura is memorable as the seriously ill Watanabe.  His distinctive performance might take a short while to get used to, but he has many effective ways of getting across what is going on inside as Watanabe searches desperately for something worthwhile.  It nicely combines the natural need for a meaning in life with the common frustrations that we all have with bureaucracy (\"in some districts, just to empty a trash bin requires enough forms to fill the bin\") and other tedious aspects of life. Kurosawa himself gives the story plenty of good touches, most of all in his interesting approach to the last half, with everyone debating what Watanabe has done.  It brings out a lot of interesting things in the characters that are worth thinking about.Just a thought: it's interesting to compare this with Bergman's \"Wild Strawberries\".  They are very different, of course, both in approach and content.  But in both cases a great director gives us a thoughtful look at a leading character as he tries to figure out what his life has been about. In any case, \"Ikiru\" is an effective and memorable look at a life.  It also shows that Kurosawa's skills work just as well in something quite different from his more action-oriented movies.",

He becomes friends with two people, one who helps him enjoy a little of life and the other someone who teaches him about leaving a legacy. So far this is my favorite Akira Kurosawa film, just ahead of Rashomon. This was an extremely powerful film about life and death that asks a lot of questions and for the most part it tried to give simple answers. There were countless powerful scenes with masterful direction and a brilliant performance by Shimura but the highlight would have to be the singing during the party scene. This was one of the most haunting, beautiful and magical scenes I've ever seen. Another great moment, showing the fear of death, takes place early on in the doctor's office as another character explains the pain that the man will eventually start to suffer. Another interesting and effective move comes in the change of storytelling with an hour left to go in the film. I wasn't quite sure if this move was going to work or not but the director pulled it off quite nicely.",

Unlike Kurosawa's many other movies, this one lacks of violence and battle save for the protagonist's battle against a deadly stomach cancer, threatening to perish him and his monotonous life to oblivion.Bureaucracy, a choking network with unbiased existence in most countries in our world, can break the best of the stubborn. Wanatabe(our protagonist), a natural victim realises his folly after painfully boring 30 years of his life. This movie aimed neither for a happy ending nor for a revolution but just the daunting reality.And undoubtedly the soundtrack 'Gondola No Uta' deserves a special mention. It is a most wonderful music, apt for this movie.",

(I don't dismiss my advancing age may be a factor.) The one element that didn't ring TOTALLY true was a Japanese bureaucracy dedicated to accomplishing nothing. After all, the movie was produced in the middle of postwar Japan achieving an historic national recovery in record time. But it could also be argued that -- as the movie shows -- this bureaucracy was responsive to corporate and powerful interests and not the public good. At any rate, scene after scene is a pleasure, and I found the ending well conceived and executed. Essential viewing.",

            "content": "Takashi Shimura is Watanabe, a man in late middle age who discovers, almost by accident, that he has stomach cancer that will kill him within a year. He can't stop it. What can he do with the time he has left? For thirty years he's worked in one of those Kafkaesque bureaucracies where everyone is buried in sheafs of papers. The shelves are full of binders and folders. The desks overflow with petitions. And when a citizen's committee of poor housewives show up to complain about a sewer in their neighborhood -- it smells terrible, the water tastes awful, it breeds mosquitoes, the children are sick -- they get shuffled from one minor bureaucrat to another, from the Parks Department to Pest Control to Sewage Disposal to the Transit Authority, until they wind up where they started. It's all meaningless and Watanabe, like everyone else, has been doing his best to keep it that way.And now he's faced with dissolution. He tells no one about it. His son and daughter-in-law, with whom he lives, treat him as part of the furniture and behind his back they whisper about how much money he might leave them some day. No good trying to tell them.So he stops going to the crowded office for a few days to think things over, and the first thing he decides to do is what I would do. He goes to a bar and falls in with a dissolute but sympathetic novelist who decides to introduce the old chap to la dolce vita. There are some whirligig scenes of Watanabe buying a ridiculously unbecoming hat, learning how to play pachinko, and getting drunk in jammed nightclubs.It only works for one night. The next day you have to start all over again -- and this time you're hung over. So he latches on to a young lady. She's far from beautiful but she's smart, vivacious, full of life, you might say, and he hopes to borrow a little of it. But by this time Watanabe, nicknamed \"The Mummy\" at work, is getting positively creepy with anxiety. His eyeballs are beginning to bulge with it. And despite his showering her with gifts and free lunches, she becomes both bored and scared and runs off.Well, Watanabe has found that self indulgence isn't the answer -- but what is? If there is any answer at all? He discovers something that will lend meaning to his remaining days. He goes back to work, rips into the petitions on his desk, strips away all the qualifications and rejections, and by dint of sheer persistence, even in the face of physical threat, he sees to it that the sewer those ladies from the citizens committee complained of is covered over and turned into a park with a playground for children.A narrator tells us that Watanabe has died and there is a very long (too long) sequence at his wake. When the \"Big Shots\" from the office feel they've spent enough time at the wake, they leave politely and promptly. The remainder, Watanabe's co-workers, get drunk and swear things will change from now on, now that Watanabe has set the example. But they don't change.Kurosawa was both writer and director of this 1952 film, and movies about fatal illnesses have to be treated very delicately otherwise they wind up like \"Love Story.\" In these movies the elderly don't really need a fatal disease. It's understood that they won't be around long. \"Old age,\" says Mr. Bernstein in \"Citizen Kane\", \"it's the only disease you don't look forward to being cured of.\" Kurosawa does a good job of avoiding cheap sentiment. Ozu did at least as good a job in \"Tokyo Story\" without any flash. In American movies, the moribund tend to find whatever passes for an answer within themselves. In \"Harry and Tonto,\" Harry loses Tonto but finds he's still capable of loving. In \"Whose Life Is It Anyway,\" Richard Dreyfuss finds the strength to tell them to shut off the machine. But this is a Japanese movie. Instead of relying on inner strength, a final act of self actualization like John Wayne in \"The Shootist,\" Watanabe finds the answer in a contribution to the community. His final determined act leads to self fulfillment but also promotes the general welfare. And he does it all with humility and politesse. He sits in waiting rooms for days. He knocks on the mayor's door timidly. He stands and holds his stupid hat while others ignore him. Yet he gets the job done in the end and it stands as a more enduring monument than the drunken praises of his mourners.",

He's a cagey, aging man who is the butt of jokes in his office. He gets diagnosed with cancer and that leaves him shell-shocked. The scene after he leaves the hospital is where Kurosawa's true direction comes into play. He has brilliantly shown a dejected, depressed Kanji walking in the streets, lost in oblivion. The sepulchral silence is interrupted by the honking of a truck and Kanji snaps back to reality. Kanji leaves his home trying to find the meaning of life. He enjoys all the earthly pleasures instead of succumbing to the fact that he would die soon. He doesn't let the cancer make him immobile and his brain quiescent. He approves a long-pending project of setting up a park that would improve the lives of the people living with poor sanitation facilities. He not only approves the project as the Chief of Public Affairs, but also makes sure every single department concerned with and involved in the project nod their heads for the project. He endures the pain and ensures work on the park is done and finally dies on a bench in the park. After his death, his co-workers and family members discuss how and what brought a change in the behavior of Kanji. They first assume he was unaware of the fact that he had cancer. But after detailed discussion and citing of instances, everyone agree he did know that he had cancer and yet fought for the betterment of the lives of slum-dwellers. They think better of him after his death and take him as an inspiration.The movie is verily the one that would make an impact on you, especially if you have someone in your family who succumbed to/survived cancer.",

Unlike Rashomon or Samurai, this picture is set in a more modern Japan, post WWII, instantly making it more relatable, even to those foreign to Japanese culture.

Kurosawa's film is a beautiful, sad masterpiece and Takashi Shimura is excellent as the soft-spoken man who belatedly realises that his life has become meaningless. The film is structured episodically as first Watanabe and a dissipated writer (Yunosuke Ito) explore the seamier side of Tokyo's nightlife, finding no answer in there, he spends time with a vivacious young co-worker (Miki Odagiri) whose joy in life he admires but ultimately cannot be part of, and finally the development of the children's park, in which he finally finds solace and meaning. Kurosawa expertly switches from linear narrative to a flashback structure halfway through the film, and viewers move from Watanabe's perspective to those of his bureaucratic co-workers, as they drink sake at his wake and discuss the changes in the man over his dying days. The scenes of the increasingly drunk men reminiscing are similar to the director's earlier classic Rashomon (1950), as each man tells an aspect of the story from a different perspective. Kurosawa also uses the film to skewer a stultified Japanese bureaucracy, especially self-serving public 'servants' and their sycophants, the wasteful redundancy and resulting zealous turf-guarding, and the endless, worthless 'busywork'. The final scene of Watanabe, serene and satisfied, is beautiful. A flawless, timeless classic.",

To begin with, this is the most philosophical Kurosawa movie I have seen explaining life and death. The movie is about an aged bureaucrat who has not taken official leave for 30 years, lives his life almost like a robot or a mummy - lifeless. His life takes a massive turn when he comes to know that he has about 6 months to live because of a terminal stomach cancer. The things he does in the remaining part of his short life constitutes the movie. The movie is not only about living your life, it also states that one does not need to party 24/7 or go travel the world for the remaining life-span to enjoy it, if one does the work given to him in the most honest way and enjoys it, it leads to a fulfilled life. The movie also talks about the petty politics that takes place in the low-level bureaucracy in any government system.Takashi Shimura has been in all the Kurosawa movies I have seen. The difference though was those movies also featured Toshiro Mifune who always hijacked the movie and fairly so. This movie was meant for an aging actor who you would not even consider if he stands next to you. Takashi Shimura fits the bill perfectly. He has done a splendid job. Sometimes though, I wanted to shout and say, 'Why are you silent, slap your son and tell him your illness'. His portrayal of helplessness forces one to do so. Bollywood classic movie Anand can be said to have inspired from Ikiru. Enough Said.Rating : 8/10",

The protagonist find out he is going to be dead soon. He find life meaning less and consider all his life as a lost. Now he try to find a way to enjoy life and yet nothing can give him that peace of mind which he looking for despite the fact that he got a chance to give a life that he imagined is fun a try.Surprisingly the protagonist find what he was looking for where he were least expected, the place that he thought initially were the most boring place that he could imagined.The story looks like ended at the middle of the movie, Akira Kurosawa surprise the audience when he start the story all over again from other's perspectives.

            "content": "I give the movie a 12 of 10. I feel \"the power of movies\" from it.From the runarounds scene in the beginning, I had an anticipation of a very exciting movie. The runarounds look exaggerated, but each of the excuses officials make when they forward a petition to other section is well considered and compelling. You can imagine the background where the lead character Watanabe, acted by Shimura Takashi, had been promoted to the section manager with his belief of \"Do nothing\".The plot is simple and clear. No discrepancy. And great sense of humor throughout the movie. Yet, the theme is very serious. In fact, the narrator says, \"In his life, nothing has ever been more serious than his acts in this period\", and the audiences get drown seriously. The performance of Odagiri Miki as Watanabe's young female subordinate shines. It is compelling that Watanabe badly wanted to be with her, and that he was eventually inspired to rise up. The performance through the expressions of Odagiri and Shimura is outstanding. Since he is convinced he had a cancer, He confesses \"I see nothing but darkness ahead of me. I struggle and run amok, still I have nothing to grab. I see only you\", with joyful background music. \"Before I die, even only a day, I want to do something, which I don't know yet\". But after a while he says, \"I can do something, something I can ...\". It looks as if Shimura is watching straight at his own death, rather than acting. Then, he stands up determined when another group of people sing \"Happy Birthday\" as if they congratulate him.The long scene of lyke-wake is impressive too. In the beginning people ignore Watanabe's contribution when the city office changed a ditch to a children's play-park. But after the Deputy Mayor leaves, gradually people recognize that Watanabe was the primary driving force of the project, and eventually all of pledge to become true civil servants. The screenplay of this process is so well organized that it reminds \"12 Angry Men\".But the next day, no one dares to keep the decision, and they return to ordinary life of languish officers. Only the youngest officer, Kimura, acted by Himori Shin-ichi, is different. The spirit of Watanabe left in him though not visibly. He stops by the park and watches the children playing in the park. Every time he feels defeated in the city office, he will visit the park.",

            "content": "I would rate this movie as above average, but not nearly the masterpiece that most other reviewers here see it as.**SPOILER WARNING**Plot Synopsis:A man who's life is perfectly routine and without passion finds out he has a terminal disease.  Distractions, such as drink and women are unsatisfactory, so he throws his remaining energy towards a selfless act.  Posthumously, his endurance and accomplishment are an inspiration to his former colleagues in a Kafkaesque bureaucracy.Analysis:On the whole, the acting in this movie is superb, with the exception of the protagonist, who constantly overacts, with his haunted, wide-eyed look that quickly becomes monotonous after the first dozen or so close-ups. However, there are some effective scenes, such as his newfound girlfriend's boredom and revulsion at Watanabe's pathetic, desperate attachment.  His former colleagues are also impressive in their admiration for the deceased.The plot itself is also a mixture of successes and disappointments. Watanabe's realization of the meaninglessness of his life is presented too suddenly.  Finding out that one has a terminal illness is certainly a shock. Still, I believe it would have been more effective to show the emptyness of Watanabe's life gradually dawning on him as he attempted to live it his routine way, rather than immediately running off to seek to live it more fully.However, Watanabe's disillusion with hedonism is effective and essential. Hedonism only leads to the repetition and boredom that mirrors too closely his earlier life.  Watanabe buys company, but it is empty of genuine human affection: the women he is with are only interested in his money.Watanabe's attempt to live vicariously through a younger, vivacious woman is also convincing, as is her quickly growing tired of a brooding man likely twice her age.The most unsatisfactory parts of the movie come in the second half of the film, following Watanabe's decision to redeem his life through selfless service.  In order for him to succeed several artificial contrivances are necessary which wind up detracting from the effectiveness of the film.Watanabe is fortunate to be in a position where he can be effective.  A mere clerk certainly could not have accomplished the creation of a park.  As a clerk would Watanabe have been satisfied with being responsible for the installation of just a bench, or a trashcan instead of the park?  The park, though relatively modest, is still a contrived contingency for effectiveness of the redemption through service solution.Further contingencies are Watanabe's superior's eventual yielding to pressure, and the gangster's deferance to a man who has nothing to lose. Both are unconvincing.A final note should be made in comparing this film to another movie that treats similar themes of existential meaning, Groundhog Day.  Both films avoid the real reprecussions and the ultimately unsatisfactory answers that their protagonists come up with by ending the movie immediately after the answer is proposed.In Groundhog Day Bill Murray is redeemed through love and caring for others, and the film immediately ends.  However, had he gone through as many repetitions of his caring, selfless days as he had days to learn to play the piano or throw cards in to a hat he would likely find his answer unsatisfactory.  Likewise, the reality of being married is also sidestepped by immediately ending the film.In a similar way, the park that is built by Watanabe is a fantasy park, which is really left unexamined by immediately ending the movie. Furthermore, selflessly devoting one's life to the service of others fails as an antidote to the meaninglessness of one's own life, because one is just passing the buck.  Essentially, one is saying that someone else can do better with the life you give them than you can.  This is not at all clear.Weaknesses like these are the sorts of things many Hollywood movies are guilty of.  They pull punches in order to create an inspiring and uplifting film.  These weaknesses are also what seperate this film from masterpieces worthy of the designation such as works by Kafka and Ingmar Bergman.  At their best, the latter do not pull punches.  Kurosawa, of course, has his own masterpiece, which I find much more mature than Ikiru.  Namely, Ran.  Of course, since Ran was based on King Lear, Shakespear must be given some credit.Still, there are some admirably realistic scenes even in the second half of Ikiru.  Watanabe's superiors are hypocritical and self-serving in their robbing Watanabe of credit for the park.  And despite Watanabe's colleagues' inebriated, freverent pledges to work as hard as he, in emulation they quickly fall back in to apathy.All in all, despite many weaknesses of philosophy and plot this movie is well worth seeing for its attempts at dealing with an issue many people find uncomfortable.  Namely, how is one to live one's life?",

            "content": "Loosely based on Leo Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\", Akira Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" stars Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged bureaucrat who discovers that he will soon die of cancer. Determined to indulge in pleasures he spent a lifetime avoiding, Kanji begins partying about town. Finding little joy in such self-centred activities, Kanji eventually decides to do something which he believes will give his life \"meaning\". As such, he embarks upon a quest to get a children's playground built where once lay a cesspool.\"Ikiru's\" early scenes expertly convey the alienation and drudgery of an increasingly bureaucratic post-war Japan. People are consumed by monotonous work, countrymen wrestle with red tape, compassion is deemed an inconvenience, everyone's erecting personal barriers and Japan's state apparatus is sketched as a wholly dehumanising and indifferent thing.Like Tolstoy's tale, \"Ikiru\" then develops into a little philosophical parable. For both Tolstoy and Kurosawa, lives dedicated to self-interests are hollow and ultimately harmful. Their characters aren't only dying of medical ailments, but already dead - already living as dead - and so in desperate need of connection and so life. Both artists then recommend that such states of despair be assuaged with compassion, communal responsibility and service to others.\"Neither fear nor self-interest can convert the soul,\" theologian Bernard of Clairvaux once wrote. \"Only charity can free man!\" Unsurprisingly, Kurosawa identified as a radical when in his teens. Following the mass arrests of members of Japan's Communist Party in the late 1920s, he'd join the Proletarian Artists' League and was for years involved in illegal underground socialist organisations, even serving a brief stint in prison for his activities. Tolstoy was himself a bit of a Christian Socialist, and believed that society should be directed toward social-ethical ends. Today, of course, 21st century man's overriding stance is the opposite: individuals determine \"ends\", individuals must be given the \"freedom\" to pursue their own desires and self-interests, man is \"nautrally selfish\" and such \"selfishness\" ultimately works out for the good of everyone anyway. Such a stance is today not chiefly contested by the church or religion, but by science, post neo-classical economists and neurobiology. Here desires are seen to be inherited or imported, never originating from \"authentic selves\", and the societal rules and laws which foster individual \"self-interests\" are mostly not in either the individual's or group's best interests anyway. Studies into things like William's Syndrome, in which missing chromosomes cause patients to be ceaselessly friendly to everyone, even if such behaviour results in self-harm, likewise show that kindness has a genetic underpinning. In short, compassion, altruism and self-sacrifice often make selfish sense.\"The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society,\" Albert Einstein wrote decades ago, \"but he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives progressively deteriorate. All human beings are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.\" This tension between \"accentuated drives\" and \"social needs\" is conveyed well during \"Ikiru's\" final act. Here Kanji triumphs against the odds and successfully creates a children's playground. Now essentially a Frank Capra hero, Kanji finds himself exalted by co-workers and various politicians, all of whom promise to learn from Kanji and be more responsive to community needs. These promises are subverted by Kurosawa, who launches into a subplot in which these men slowly renege upon their resolutions. Whether these betrayals are due to something innate in human beings, to ideological forces, to Japan's whole mode of social organisation (characters constantly complain about \"bogus democracy\", Japan is clearly still under the thumb of US Imperial designs and civil services and public institutions are seen to be serving something other than common people), or whether Kurosawa believes collective actions as a method of social change always begin with almost militantly \"individualistic\" people anyway, is left ambiguous.\"Ikiru\" boasts an interesting narrative structure. It opens with a shot of an X-ray, cancer eating a gut. From the diseased internal wirings of a man, we move outward to the workplace, where humans depressingly toil. The film then dips into an orgy of pleasures, sights, smells and sounds, \"antidotes\" to the workplace which Kurosawa swiftly deems unsatisfying lest shared. From here the film shifts from the personal, private and the interior to the social, communal and the exterior; Kanji launches a campaign to build a playground. Bizarrely, the film then dwells on the lives of Kanji's successors, who spend a long time cynically evaluating the \"worth\" of Kanji's life. These successors eventually decide to dedicate their lives to social causes, but find themselves unable to. The film then closes with Kanji, ghost-like, singing \"Life is Short\" whilst crying on the park swing he helped create.Interestingly shot and widely regarded as a masterpiece, \"Ikiru\" is also mercilessly unsubtle. Sentimental, cartoonish and heavy-handed, Kurosawa conveys every point and emotion with the grace of a sledgehammer. Takashi Shimura's sad-faced performance, overly emphatic, is also at times comically ridiculous. Other Kurosawa trademarks - screen wipes and a talkative narrator - seem unsuited to a film whose material demands restraint.8/10 \u2013 See Zhang Yimou's \"The Story of Qui Ju\".",

Unless of course you don't want to cry yourself to sleep (be warned this movie is extremely a downer). *Note beyond this point there may be spoilers*The movie tells the story of a bureaucrat who finds out he has a stomach tumor and will die in at least 5 years but he most likely has one year left to live. Only at the realization that he doesn't have any time left does he realize that he hasn't done anything with his life. He falls into depression and begins stop going to work, to drink, and to see a young girl that used to work for him. When she leaves him she more or less tells him to do something with his life. Shortly after he returns to work and begins doing his job the way it should have been done and works to build a park. After the park is completed he sits happily on a swing set as it snows (a cinematography gold mine) and looks at what he has done with his life as he drifts to sleep never to wake again.This movie is brilliant I give it my highest recommendation",

            "review_title": "Live the Cosmic Wow Right Now",
            "content": "Our leadsman in Ikiru, Kanji Watanabe, is an older, exhaustive looking man caught up in the rat race of everyday, robotic living. Exuberance stripped, joy absent, utterly banal. It is only when he learns he's contracted an incurable stomach cancer that he begins to suffer from an existential crisis, plagued by frustration and the dread of approaching death. His language becomes almost ineffable, his soul harrowed up with an array of unwanted emotions, his memory elusive and soon to \"vanish away.\" Realizing his life is near expired and with no significant contributions etched into the hallmark of the living, something inside him changes; the instinctive will \"to live\" overwhelms him. As the disenchanted novelist he meets puts it, \"We don't realize how beautiful (or precious) life is until we chance upon death.\" The words resonate in Watanabe's mind. He seems to understand Sartre's credo, \"Death must enter life only to define it.\" Suddenly, he fearfully and frantically yearns to define his life, overcome the petty existence he's wasted and atone for the quality of life and gratification he's lost, thus rendering death ineffectual. It is a message not only for Watanabe, but for all of humanity\u2014to live the cosmic wow right now without reserve or fear of death.The difficulty Watanabe faces, however, is that the person he's shaped and ultimately become is without adequate faith and determination to face the future. Not only is he ill-prepared to be ordained with vitality, he is without dreams, goals and direction on where to foster his newborn energy to live. It would be likened unto a small child wanting to drive his father's brand new dodge viper yet without the necessary skill, maturity and knowledge needed to operate such a heavy piece of machinery. Watanabe is no different. He only knows that he desires a second chance at life\u2014a life lived to its utmost potential. Clinging to this desire for positive self-transformation, he begins his newly awakened journey by touring the fleshpots of Tokyo, seeking joy through transient means: nightclubs, girls, liquor and other places of revelry. None of these places seem to bring about the type of life he's looking for. He moves on. He tries to make retirement arrangements with his much adorned son who ironically misperceives him. He fails.He then endeavors to capture the secret to living life from his dainty female colleague who appears to have it all: zest, humor, vitality, etc. The secret, he discovers, is not grandiose but utterly simplistic\u2014she enjoys making wind-up bunny rabbits for \"the children of Japan.\" It's a timely message to understand because it shows that the great and grand secret to living life is found where most would have it not be found. There is no secret. According to the film's subtext, \"to live\" a life most fruitful is to be found in a collection of seemingly insignificant moments: laughter between two friends, a chocolate ice-cream cone, a gathering at the theater, the smile of a lover, etc. Watanabe, like all of us, is learning to extract the extraordinary from the ordinary. And slowly but surely, he is.At the close of his journey, he turns his search for life's meaning to a civil service project buried deep under bureaucratic red tape, each member of his department having passed the buck from one office to the next. He personally takes it upon himself to see the project through\u2014to turn a sewage gauntlet into an established play park for children. Though the end product isn't revolutionary, it is Watanabe's last chance for redeeming all of those years of self-absorption, self-loathing and regret. It is his last charitable contribution to life's hallmark academy, be it ever so small; that final part of his positive self-transformation. When he finally dies, the impact it makes parallels the proverb \"our work is never appreciated until we are dead.\" Likewise, people are usually never venerated until they pass on. There is something deeply mystifying about death's impact on the human consciousness that causes it to understand not its own depth until the hour of separation. The film is remarkable in this way in that it creates a hoped for paradigm shift in the viewer, showing the precariousness and evanescence of life. Life, to be fully appreciated, must be threatened with death intermediately throughout and finally absorbed completely in the end. As the poet Tweedy observed, \"You have to learn how to die\u2014if you want to be alive.\" Kurosawa makes an astute commentary on the culture and values of bureaucracies, how we are all to some degree mini-bureaucrats caught up in the cyclical nature of zoning out, taking life for granted, and becoming programmed automatons who seek nothing but self-preservation and creature comforts. Life for Kurosawa is not to be lived by hiding in the seas of faces, hoping to be unobserved, but by making something of one's self, taking healthy risks, living Socrates' \"life examined\" and recognizing the small and simple things that make life worth defending. The secret to life is the recognition of the simple, the ordinary, the plain and mundane. It is that recognition that creates a sort of exuberance in the traveler's life\u2014one that follows in existentialist shadows and gains genuine and authentic meaning by one's active level of participation in it.",

For decades there was just one constant in life, work. In an instant this reality is shattered as Watanabe discovers he little time remaining. And thus Watanabe sets out to live life, to discover the intricate beauties of the people and world around him.Shimura gives the performance of a lifetime. He disappears completely into the role. Every action, every expression, is portrayed with so mach heart I cannot imagine the film without him. This also holds true for the rest of the cast. Each character is given such life and unique subtleties that work well off of Shimura. Kurosawa's direction here is some of his finest, the film being so beautifully shot and composed.

            "content": "Ikiru is poignant and directly profound through contemplating life's meaning in Watanabe's dealings with mortality. Watanabe is an old-aged bureaucrat whose life was obsessed with work until discovering he has terminal cancer. Whereas Ikiru takes its time in reaching Watanabe's revelation of his terminal cancer, audiences are told at the beginning. Audiences being aware of this made Watanabe's mundane office environment extremely bleak. Firstly Watanabe and his colleges are unresponsive at a joke by a younger, immature employee and a montage of citizens being moved around from department to department regarding their queries. Ikiru firmly establishes Watanabe's routine occupation as somber which is emphasised in Watanabe's acknowledgement of his terminal cancer, that he had wasted his adult life.Ikiru's theme of morality became significance in Watanabe's reactions to his impending death. He rejects his bureaucrat duties and becomes engaged with his human desires. Wantanabe disappears for days at a time drinking and reminiscing about his past as one memorable scene showed him singing an old love ballad to the stunned silence of those around him, reflecting Wantanabe's realisation towards death. Watanabe also becomes infatuated with Toyo, a younger employee through her quirkiness giving him revived senses of youthfulness. Yet this soon flames out only emphasises Watanabe's loss of time. These scenes in Ikiru relate to Watanabe's notion of \"a protest of my life up to now\" provoking internal questions of morality and one's use in life.From protesting his life to giving it meaning, Watanabe becomes the catalyst for long-standing plan for a children's park which had previously been ignored by his department. Watanabe's determined vest to complete the park before his death continued to emphasis Ikiru's profound message regarding life. Once Watanabe has passed on and his achievements are recognised, his former co-workers say \"compared to Watanabe we're just trash\", consolidating Ikiru's profoundness for life. It is this message which audiences should take away from Ikiru.",

            "content": "Movies can and do have an impact on viewers but very few manage to truly change lives. 'Ikiru' is one of those rare cases. Kurosawa, best known for his epic period pieces and innovative action scenes, tackles a delicate subject with unfailing clarity.Without ever falling into cheap sensibility the movie focuses on a man who realizes how empty his life is. His inner struggle to grapple the idea of his incoming death and the resolution to persist on making a difference are all handled with great psychological realism and weaved beautifully with a social environment of wanton excitement. 'Ikiru' combines a very personal character driven narrative with a background of indifference that adds a greater thrust of dynamism to the relation between individual and society.Memorable scenes remain grounded on daily events, they are bits of everyday things made interesting by the camera lending them its magic. In some aspects the montage is akin to that of drama and there is an aura of impending tragedy throughout it all. The resolution is the only one possible and very bitter sweet.This is the kind of movie that makes people stop, feel and think. A masterpiece that reveals itself as such in every frame its true power becomes all more daunting as one reflects about it afterward. Perhaps more than changing lives 'Ikiru' provides an emotionally charged space in which to ponder on how people, no matter how average, can make a change both in themselves and on others.Few times has a title been more true, 'Ikiru' is not about dying.

Takashi Shimura plays said bureaucrat with stolid grace, never overplaying the physical and psychic pain that defines him for the first third of the film. He is estranged from his family, his employers, his life, until an improbable encounter with a lively, lovely former coworker and a pet rabbit. At last he sees how his life, so close to its end, can mean something.I highly recommend the 2-disc Criterion set, which includes two documentaries on Kurosawa's life and work, and a commentary track by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince, who's done similar work for Criterion's releases of \"Throne of Blood\", \"Seven Samarai\", \"Ran\" and several others. My lone complaint is with the transfer; typically a strength of Criterion's classic discs. While most scenes are clear, bright and unblemished, others have long stretches of vertical scratches and faded black tones. Knowing the attention to detail that other, even older, films have enjoyed, it's a bit jarring to see.",

I had heard about the scene on the swing prior to seeing the film. It is a beautiful transcendental scene all the more moving as we know he has already passed away. I think it is this reconnection with his character after learning of his death that causes the scene to have such emotional weight. That and the fact that he finally achieved something with his life, finally found some purpose. It could be crushingly sentimental in the wrong hands but Kurosawa floats the camera along past the climbing frame as the snow falls gracefully over Watanabe as he sings to himself in this fleeting moment of happiness. The film has many wonderful scenes but it is the actor Takashi Shimura who steals the show. He is such a presence throughout and dominates every scene. I love the way he moves. We can feel his anxiety, his stress, his illness. I had waited a long time to see this film. It went beyond my expectations. Due to a personal experience I connected with the plight of Watanabe and this made it all the more emotional. Quite beautiful. Interesting that Kurosawa ends the film in a negative way by saying that those who take the place of Watanabe simply fall back into their bureaucratic roles and fail to continue as he had done. They say something along the lines of his death should not be in vain, but by their inaction it is. He dies in vain but it makes Watanabe all the greater as being the one person who decided to change his dull life by doing something more. Stepping outside and seeing the day differently , the sunset, the city, nothing is the same to him. His impending death finally gives his life meaning so he no longer just simply exists. We are all guilty to some extent of this. He stops to smell the flowers and how wonderful they look and how sweet they smell.",

One of its main messages to me is : what would I do in a similar position to the protagonist of the story? Most of us belong to the wage slave class and are in work roles utterly useless to the greater humanity, what would we do if told we had a few months to live (disregarding the fact that even 100 years/1200 months is an infinitesimal fraction of a geological eye-blink)?Watanabe-san is the buck-passing rubber-stamping Section Chief of the Public Affairs Dept. in City Hall, never having had a day off in 30 years until told (in a roundabout way) that he has terminal stomach cancer. He goes AWOL, does a little drinking and flirting and finally comes to the conclusion that he needs to leave something constructive behind him. It all unfolds in Kurosawa's usual inimitable fluid story-telling style \u0096 he left behind a beautiful b&w Japanese film languidly but constructively dealing with terminal illness that can still hook people in to this day. Favourite bits: In the bar where Watanabe-san mournfully groans out his requested song Life Is Brief to the suddenly electrified patrons \u0096 and us; the stark contrast between him and his confused state and the young and healthy flibbertigibbet he spends a few days with; the flashbacks of him doggedly pursuing his pet project at City Hall; the culmination of everything on the playground swing at 11:00 pm on a snowy night. No good doing that here \u0096 the park would be full of losers instead of winners like him.To the impatient I suppose it would be pretty slow at times, but in the hands of this particular Master I wouldn't have minded it lasting another hour.

To put it another way, you can damn with hyperbole just as surely as you can with faint praise. And I really don't want to do that to this movie, because it's amazingly well done, definitely worth seeing, and you'll be a better person if I don't turn you off before you scour the library and independent video outlets for it. So if, like me, you're the sort of counter-dependent brat who revels in ignoring advice that isn't your own, please rent the movie just to prove what an ass I am.For the rest of you who don't use your late fees to prove you cultural sophistication, I'd nonetheless recommend using extended rental policies to see this one a few times. Admittedly, I haven't seen this movie since my VHS days, so the DVD might include the usual goodies that I have no business commenting on. I'll poach off another commenter here and describe Ikiru as a movie about a life almost unlived, and how we find real reasons to overcome the inertial slide to death. Watanabe is the sort of bureaucrat that makes Kafka look like Schwartenegger, and his tentative walking coma at the movie's outset still resonates among those of us making our living in cubicle farms, whacking computer keys like lab rats for our paycheck-pellet rewards.The news that he's dying forces Watanabe into a painful contemplation of the life he's wasted, and the scenes that reveal his back-story are touching and human. When I saw Watanabe's anguish in his doctors' wait room, I was reminded of the pediatrician's office I visited as a child. And when Watanabe's young son humiliates him with embarrassed shame at the boy's baseball game, I felt the guilt a son feels when he doesn't honor his father. When Watanabe finally decides to act, we are moved by his humble desperation to feel alive.I'd agree with other commenters that the final third of the film is a bit stilted; considering the subject matter, however, we can hardly fault Kurosawa for being accurate. Furthermore, I'd rather not take any of the slow, subtle joy you'll get out of this movie by endlessly pontificating about it. Go see it, and if you're not the dork I am, tell others about it too.",

Ikiru in Japanese means \"to live.\" And the film tells the story of a man who, upon learning he is terminally ill, doesn't just realize he has lead a meaningless life \u0097 but that he hasn't lived at all \u0097 a story of a man who begins to live only after he learns he is dying.The first part of the film shows us Watanabe's \"life\" before, and after, he learns he has stomach cancer, and has only three months to live. He realizes he has never really lived. The film informs us that Watanabe thrashing his way through empty efforts to live, to find some meaning to his life. At the end of the film's first half, he finally sees something that opens his eyes to how he must spend his remaining days.The film then takes us to its second half \u0097 which begins at a wake held in honor of the late Kanji Watanabe. The rest of the story, how Watanabe spent his remaining days, is told in the flashback recollections of Watanabe's former workmates. Ikiru opens with Watanabe, a widower, at work stamping papers in his dreary civil servant job at Tokyo City Hall. He hasn't missed a day of work in 30 years, and never takes vacations. He lives with his callous son, and his inheritance-obsessed daughter-in-law.The film begins with a group of women arriving at his department to complain about a cesspool in their neighborhood. They want it filled so the site won't be a health hazard; it should be filled in so the site can be a playground for their children. Watanabe dismissively tells them they must take their problem to the engineering department. Off they go, shuffled from department to department until they end up back at Watanabe's department, empty-handed. When Watanabe discovers he is terminally ill, he fails to show up for work. No one at the office sees him for days. He wanders the streets, until one night he is at a bar and begins to talk to a novelist about his fading life. The young man takes Watanabe on a tour of Tokyo's night spots. Maybe a little frivolity is the missing ingredient in Watanabe's life.At one of these places, Watanabe kills the festive atmosphere when the piano player asks for song requests. Watanabe mumbles that he wants to hear an old song, \"Life is Brief.\"As the pianist plays the sedate, lovely, tune, Watanabe tearfully sings the song: Life is brief, Fall in love, maidens; Before the crimson bloom, Fades from your lips; Before the tides of passion, Cool within you; For those of you, Who knows no tomorrow.It is a beautiful scene, which will be revisited in a different, more memorable way near the end of the film.Night turns into morning, and Watanabe doesn't want to have another night on the town. He then encounters a young girl who used to work at his office, and they eat lunch.He begins to spend a lot of time with her, and is able to laugh with her hoping part of her liveliness will rub off on him. However, the girl tires of the dour old man, but agrees to meet him for one more dinner. Watanabe tells the girl he is dying and was hoping he could somehow discover from her how to live.During the dinner, she does something that gives Watanabe his breakthrough. He now knows what he must do. He goes back to his office, and digs out the proposal to fix the cesspool and build a park at the site. He immediately takes the proposal to another city department to shepherd the proposal to completion.Next, the movie takes us to the wake, where we learn the park was completed. The women who stormed city hall at the beginning of the film arrive to mourn for Watanabe. And they really mourn, while the opportunistic deputy mayor \u0097 who tried to kill the park proposal, then later took credit for it \u0097 silently watches. Tellingly, the women have nothing to say to the deputy mayor or the other city officials present. Kurosawa's camera focuses close-up on face after face, the embarrassed expression on the face of each city official reveals they know the truth they won't admit: It is Watanabe who deserves credit for building the park.Later, Watanabe's former co-workers debate his dogged dedication to building the park. The officials, by now drunk, recall his final successful struggle to create the park, but cynically misinterpret everything he did.The fact that they fail to grasp the simple kindness of Watanabe that redeems his otherwise wasted, unhappy life underscores something the funeral party does not comprehend: that Watanabe, not any of them, was the true victor and happy man. The last person to see Watanabe alive, a policeman on patrol, comes to the wake to honor Watanabe. Watanabe's body was found in the park the night before. But the policeman describes, what seemed to him, an eerie site.The film's last flashback shows us what he saw: Watanabe is at the park late at night, using the park's swing set while snow gently falls on him. While slowly swinging, he sings \"Life is Brief.\" This scene is one of the most beautiful, memorable experiences in all of cinema. Try watching it without tears welling up in your eyes.Ikiru is a masterpiece -- It doesn't call attention to itself. It is only afterward that Ikiru's brilliance becomes plain \u0097 the perfection of style and the dignity and sorrow of Shimura's acting.By Brian Cole",

How to confront living with a terminal disease tied to the aftermath of nuclear fallout may have been especially relevant for Japanese audiences in the early 1950's. And profitable at the box-office. But when viewed today, the theme remains relevant, but it is obvious that the movie itself is depressing in it's conception and execution. In short, what we have here is a depiction of depression that is, well, depressing. The script and direction relentlessly milk the sad subject matter resulting in tedious monotony quickly followed by boredom. The film seems to come alive only after the protagonist has died (starting with the scenes at his wake). But by then, most viewers may be beyond the point of caring or long departed. To provide comedy relief (and to keep theater audiences in their seats?), the director has mixed in some hilarious depictions of the inherent dysfunction of contemporary, local-level bureaucracies. But the impact of these scenes is insufficient to prevent being buried under the unrelenting, repetitious plodding that depicts the depressing subject matter. All of this makes for a film that is much too long by half. (If cut back by starting with, say, the wake and using more flashbacks, it might be more tolerable and a bit better at holding the viewer's interest.) Restoration is adequate, but still a work in progress. Vertical wear lines appear through out the first half of the movie, and some scenes remain just too dark to see much of anything. Music is heard sporadically (the best accomplices the opening credits). The voice over is gratuitous (and distracting).

            "content": "Set in post war Japan, we see Tokyo's bureaucracy at play. A group of women have been on a runaround being sent from department to another with no resolve. They are complaining about a cesspool where they live. No one wants to do anything about it. In fact these bureaucrats shuffle paper but do little of consequence.Watanabe is an elderly bureaucrat who has worked for 30 years without taking a day off. He has got a nice home and accumulated a nice pension. His son and daughter in law lives with him. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer and realises that he ha little time left, it dawns on him that he has accomplished little in his life.There have been lots of movies contemplating the meaning of life but not by 1952. Akira Kurosawa examines a life unfulfilled. If you are a viewer over the first blush of youth, you could understand what Watanabe is going through. You might have built a home, raised a family, loved a woman, have a pension to look forward to but have you really made a difference?Watanabe delves into the Tokyo nightlife including a sequence where a woman dances the Jitterbug in a nightclub and he sings a sad old song. This is not enough for him. Eventually he meets a young woman who wants his signature so she can resign from her job. She finds the job boring and he sees in her a zest for life which is infectious. He spends some time with her.The last third of the film is set after his death as a wake his held. His son never found out that he was dying. His work colleagues finally guessed he knew he was dying. In his final months he wanted to zealously accomplish something. That thing was to turn that cesspit into a children's playground and he went from one department to another cajoling and not taking no for an answer. The old man withstood threats and faced humiliation but showed a steely, determined side of his character.The women we saw at the beginning of the film drop by later to pay their respects.Watanabe died in a snowy night, playing on the swings on the park he help built.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa, the Japanese director more famously known for his epic samurai stories, takes us into the depths of post-war Japan in this very human story of a government official who discovers he has terminal cancer and only six months to live. With this new found information, he decides to start living his life, something he neglected to do for the past thirty years when he never missed a day of work.As the story progresses, we learn more as to why our protagonist is in such a conservative state of mind. This, in turn, propels him to take up a crusade for the people of the city and help them and change their life for the better. This goes to show the most human side of Kurosawa we have ever seen. The character of Watanabe is handled very delicately, never condescending or preaching. He is simply a man who struggles with meaning and definition of his own life but wants to change that forever.It is in this context that Ikiru also has its failures. The final third act of this film is mostly a group of men sitting around talking about Watanabe while drinking plenty of sake and getting very drunk. TO me, this scene dragged on for way to long and was in fact mostly unnecessary. There were also some other scenes that didn't fit too well with the narrative, but they were far and few in between.So, to be honest, this is a real underrated treasure from Kurosawa. And even though it doesn't have the sheer willpower or amazement from his other works, this is definitely a testament to humans and the remarkable changes we can make by putting our mind to something.",

            "content": "The only film Akira Kurosawa made between 1948 and 1965 that did not include Toshiro Mifune in any way, Ikiru is one of the most tenderly human, aesthetically beautiful, and deeply moving films I've ever seen. I labeled it my favorite Kurosawa many years ago, long before I'd seen all of his film (I still haven't as of this writing), and yet I seriously doubt that any film will topple it from that spot. This is one of the pinnacles of cinema, a work of such unbridled and touching emotion that faces death squarely and demands a chance to make an impact on the world. The impact may be small, no larger than a small city park for children, but the impact will remain.The story is about Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a thirty-year veteran of the Tokyo city bureaucracy given the anodyne prognosis of a mild stomach ulcer that he knows is actually a cover for stomach cancer, an effective death sentence that gives him no more than a year to live (a common practice in Japanese medicine at the time was to lie about certain terminal diseases to patients in order to save them grief). Understanding his fate, he's left facing the life he's led, and he realizes how little he's actually lived.This film is both deceptively simple and marvelously complex, and the way the complexity arises is in its structure. There are two major sections of the film that are dominated by flashbacks, the opening third and the final third. The opening third's flashbacks serve a specific purpose in that it is Watanabe reflecting back on the failings of his life, in particular around his son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko). Watanabe's wife died when Mitsuo was only a small child, and Watanabe reflects back on key moments from Mitsuo's childhood when he failed his son. There was the car ride to the funeral of the boy's mother, where he failed to properly console him, a baseball game when the boy was older where Watanabe could not bring himself to cheer on the boy after he had ran into a pickle and been picked off, and Mitsuo's going in for an appendectomy that Watanabe finds an excuse to leave. Combined with his meritorious work in the public affairs department of the city government where Watanabe failed to accomplish a single thing over three decades, Watanabe feels lost with only a few months to live, a mountain of savings from a life of frugality, and nothing to live for.So, he tries to live for himself. He disappears from work for a week and starts drinking in little dive sake bars, eventually running across a writer (Yunosuke Ito) who listens to Watanabe's tale, only able to tell it to a complete stranger, and the duo go out on the town. What follows is a string of bars, dancing, and hat purchasing as the writer shows Watanabe the selfish side of life. He's ultimately unfulfilled by it all, though, with a crushing moment as Watanabe requests the song \"Gondola no Uta\" from a piano player and sings the lyrics, his mouth hardly opening, and in such a sad way that it stops everyone around him to observe. Finding this empty, Watanabe, the next morning, comes across one of his underlings on the street. This is Toyo (Miki Odagiri), the young woman in his office who has come to him to get him to sign off on her resignation from the civil service. She can't stand the inaction, the monotony, and the lack of interest that accompanies a life in the Japanese bureaucracy.Instead of simply stamping her resignation (the wrong form, he informs her before dutifully stamping the form that's in front of him like he always does) and letting her go, he invites her out to a day on the town, showering her with presents like stockings, lunch, and a time at the carnival. For over a week, he keeps doing this, even after her resignation at city hall has gone through and she's started working in a toy manufacturing plant assembling mechanical hopping bunnies, and her patience grows thin. His selfless act of showering her with attention, presents, and nights out on the town has become unsatisfying to her, and the news is crushing to Watanabe. He wants to live in his final months. He wants to live through someone else, and when Toyo pushes him away he gets an idea. He shows up at work for the first time in two weeks, dashing the hopes of advancement of his second in command Sub-Section Chief Ono (Kamatari Fujiwara) with his mere presence, he finds the first request on his large stack of papers, a request for the paving over of an open and fetid water source in a slum to be replaced by a playground for children, and he's off to make it happen.Then the movie does something unexpected. It jumps forward five months to his wake. He's accomplished his goal of building the playground, credit denied to him by the Deputy Mayor (Nobuo Nakamura), seen the opening ceremony, and then died, succumbing to his illness, that very night, alone on the playground. What erupts next is an extended debate on what Watanabe did, how responsible he was for the construction of the playground, and the effect he's had on those around him. This is the final fifty minutes of the film, and it's marvelous. With a more straightforward telling of the story, we'd have Kurosawa stringing us along with the ins and outs of the bureaucracy while forming tension around whether the playground will get constructed or not. By skipping ahead, Kurosawa completely changes the focus. There's no longer any tension around the material construction but a refocus on the effects of Watanabe's embrace of life on those around him.It begins with the Deputy Mayor announcing that he should be given the full credit for the playground's construction, not Watanabe, and that his disrespecting of Watanabe at the opening ceremony by placing him in the back of the crowd was completely justified. All of the section chiefs nod in approval, along with their subordinates, but the Deputy Mayor has to leave after a crowd of women arrive, tearfully placing incense and flowers before Watanabe's picture, obviously giving him credit for saving them and their children from the fetid water that had plagued their homes. With the Deputy Mayor and his section chiefs gone, the subordinates begin the real debate where they piece together the final few months from their individual interactions with Watanabe to discover that it was his dedication above and beyond the limits of his station that led to this good work, that he was driven by his stomach cancer that they decide he must have known about, and that they will all endeavor to become like him in their daily lives. This, of course, does not happen, for the new Public Affairs Section Chief, Ono, sends the next group of petitioners at the desk on the same runaround that the ladies who wished to have the park built had gone through.There's a remarkable mixture of cynicism and humanism apparent here with the grinding down of the bureaucracy removing the basics of human decency from those within it, but, at the same time, the finding of power within the individual to make a difference, no matter how small. Watanabe went through his life alone, even in the end he relied on no one else to give him solace. He worked to make his life matter, and the final shots of Watanabe, perhaps his ghost, swinging in the playground, and singing \"Gondola no Uta\" are touching. He will be forgotten. His works will endure for at least a while longer.The tender humanity in Watanabe's journey from mummy (Toyo's nickname for him) to someone who lives, even for a short time, is wonderfully laid out and executed by Kurosawa, his cowriters (Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni), and, in particular, Takashi Shimura. Shimura was a very good actor in general, and he had a distinctive face, especially when he was meant to look sad, pulling his lower face in and pronouncing his lips, and he gives Watanabe a deep sense of loss, resolve, and emotion as he faces his final days with determination. It's also another example of Kurosawa's remarkable eye, providing marvelous compositions from beginning to end from two people talking in a rundown sake bar to Watanabe facing down goons in a hallway to the final shot of Watanabe on that swing. The aesthetics support the narrative, never calling attention to themselves, always feeling appropriate, and very often just being beautiful to look at.Ikiru is a masterpiece. It's one of my favorite films. It is a towering achievement of humanism and emotion. I adore this movie.",

            "content": "Ikiru, one of Akira Kurosawa's most underrated films, is among my favorites. The reasons for this are many. I don't want to over-analyze the film, because a simple story warrants a simple review, so I'll keep this brief.Kenji Watanabe is a mid-level, middle-aged Tokyo bureaucrat. Every day he reports to City Hall and review memos. Actually, that's being generous. Really, his job is to glance at papers and stamp them, showing that he took a few seconds to look at them. It's not that he hates his life, he just doesn't have anything to live for. His wife is long dead, his son is married and simply doesn't care about him, and he's worked at the same department for 30 years. Not exactly movie material.However, his soul is crushed when he finds that he has stomach cancer, with months to live. After this revelation, he tries to think of his accomplishments (none), and hopes (nil), and realizes that he has nothing ahead of him but a painful death. He decides that if he has nothing left, he should at least try to find some pleasure in his last days.He attempts to find relief in a hedonistic, party-life, as well as pursuing a woman many years younger than he. Naturally, this fails. Finally, he decides that if he can't find fun in living for himself, he will try to change the world for the better. He attempts to have a public park built in the stead of a garbage dump, and dies soon after, triumphant.Still, putting it like that make the film sound much more depressing than it is. Yes, it's not the most happy ending in the world; after all, the last hour of the film takes place at Watanabe's funeral, with him already dead. However, in a particularly memorable scene, he is challenged by a local Yakuza boss because of his ventures, and simply turns the other cheek, leaving the mobster with his tail between his legs.One of the main reason the film works, besides Kurosawa's careful direction, is the main performance of Watanabe, played by Takeshi Shimura. Hardcore movie buffs may recognize him as Shimada, the old man from Seven Samurai. However, this is his best performance. With his wide, sad, puppy-dog eyes, it is nearly impossible not to sympathize, and indeed love the guy. He walks hunched over, slowly, as if walking afraid of his own shadow. But by the time the film is nearly over, he is able to look up into the sky and sing his beautiful farewell as he dies peacefully, in the snowy playground which he has created.But the most important aspect of the film's success is the fact that it actually improves over time. No, the film itself is still in outdated, ugly, faded black-and-white, but viewing it as a teen, and viewing it as an adult will render completely different reactions. Roger Ebert put it best; \"Over the years I have seen \"Ikiru\" every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us.\" Well said, Mr. Ebert.",

            "content": "I found this Japanese film (the title which translates \"to live\") featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was highly rated by critics and it certainly sounded like a worthwhile watch, directed by Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Dersu Uzala, Ran). Basically, set in post-war Tokyo, Japan, Kanji Watanabe (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) has worked in the same monotonous position as a bureaucrat in an office for thirty years and is near his retirement. His wife is dead and his son Mitsuo (Nobuo Kaneko) and daughter-in-law Kazue (Ky\u00f4ko Seki), who live with him, seem to care mainly about Watanabe's pension and their future inheritance. At work, his office is full of bureaucratic inaction, including one case where a group of parents want a cesspool cleared out and replaced by a children's playground. One day, Watanabe goes to hospital for a check-up, where a doctor confirms that he has a tumour in his stomach, which is cancerous and incurable, and he has less than a year to live. Watanabe attempts to come to terms with having terminal cancer and with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He then tries to distract himself with some of Tokyo's nightlife. During the night, he meets an eccentric novelist (Yunosuke Ito), who guides him. They go to a nightclub, where Watanabe requests a song from the piano player, and sings \"Gondola no Uta\" with great sadness. His singing greatly affects those watching him. But after one night indulging in the nightlife, Watanabe realises this is not the solution. The following day, Watanabe encounters Toyo Odagiri (Miki Odagiri), a young female employee at his office who needs his signature to confirm her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm and tries to spend as much time as possible with her. Toyo eventually becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows weary of him. After convincing her to join him for the last time, he tells her the truth about his health and asks for the secret to her love of life. Toyo says that she does not know, but that she found happiness in her new job making toys and knowing that they will bring happiness to all the children of Japan. Inspired by her, Watanabe realises that it is not too late for him to do something significant. Like Toyo, he wants to make something, and through the city bureaucracy he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises his colleagues returning to work after a long absence and begins pushing for the site to be cleaned and for a playground to be built. He has concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments but is determined to get it finished before he dies. Sometime later, Watanabe dies, with his former co-workers gathering at his wake, following the opening of the playground, and try to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behaviour. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realise that Watanabe must have known he was dying, even when his son denied this, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that in the last few moments of his life, Watanabe sat on the playground swing at the park he built whilst it was snowing. He was heard singing \"Gondola no Uta\". The bureaucrats vow to live their lives with the same dedication and passion as he did. But back at work, they lack the courage of their newfound conviction. Also starring Makoto Kobori as Kiichi Watanabe, Kanji's brother, and Kumeko Urabe as Tatsu Watanabe, Kiichi's wife. Shimura gives a credible performance as the old man struggling to find a meaning and purpose for his life, after years as a civil servant doing almost nothing, there are many moving parts and a terrific score by Fumio Hayasaka, it is an intimate story of mortality, self-reflection and redemption, certainly a must-see foreign language drama.

They are sent hither and thither to various departments to no avail until Watanabe decides to use his clout to see the park restored to its natural state.Several scenes stand out as memorable: In the early-going, Watanabe's son and young wife (or fianc\u00e9e) come home only to see the ghastly figure of Watanabe staring blankly in the darkness of their room. The expression on his face conveys his emotional state so well.Later on, Watanabe is confronted by some threatening gangsters opposing his desire to clean up the park. One of them warns Watanabe that he is \"risking his life.\" Watanabe could not be happier to hear this and smiles jubilantly at the gangster. The gangsters, up to this point very tough and menacing, are startled and confused at Watanabe's sheer disregard for his own life.Lastly (you should really just watch the movie) there is the scene of a drunken Watanabe tearfully singing a mournful song accompanied by a jazz pianist.

(Subtle sentiment enough to swamp a whale or ban a banshee, I say! ) This adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's legendary 1952 Ikiru does the master justice, both worlds, Japan and Britain, characteristically reserved and private.Having just learned of his impending death from cancer, uptight London civil servant Williams at first goes the way any of us might such as seaside penny arcades and striptease shows. However, he slowly steps into the role of caring human being, starting by taking a young bucktoothed office worker, Margaret Harris (Sex Education's Aimee Lou Wood), to lunch without any other agenda than to begin opening up. He is leaving his \"nowhere man\" behind.The scenes between them, with her never quite sure if this can be the same tightly-bound boss she's always known and an openness that begs him to watch how life is to be lived. Nighy plays it right by lacking flamboyance but rather as if he were just quietly emerging into life as it should be lived-caring without an agenda. In some ways, he's Tom Hanks' Otto but just across the pond with a little emotional help from Dvorak and Vaughn Williams.While his close-knit bureaucratic colleagues continue to be like their bowler hats--rigid and lacking color, Williams already has a hip new hat along with his new life of meaning. The civil servants remain rigid, except for the new worker, Peter Wakeling (Alex Sharp), young and quiet but smiling and charming, meant by prize-winning writer Kazuo Ishiguro (and before him, of course, Kurosawa) to be the new, softer, more romantic Williams.One of the virtues of this sober take on end of days is to go gently, not drunkenly, and leave no mountains of office folders, but a legacy that cares for children at play, not adults playing at life. When he files into the \"in basket\" the plaintiff request from three ladies to rehab a playground, he is promoting the reserve he needs to let go.Although Brits are often depicted as conservatively stifling romance and even joy in life, Living shows how one bureaucrat broke the mold, even if he had a short time to enjoy a life of love and service. Better living than not at all when you are alive, Living warns us.\"I took to looking around myself a little.\" Mr. Williams.",

(Yes, everyone will die, but how many truly face that reality?)  And for those who have not given too much time to contemplating their life, how they will not live forever, what they have done to date with their lives, what things they may want to accomplish before dying, this film may spur on such thinking.  While the details of \"modern Japan\" depicted in the film are from around 50 years ago, the content and message are just as relevant for today's audience.  Perhaps more relevant than ever. This is NOT a \"feel good\" film.  There is no Hollywood happy ending, no easy resolution of the conflict portrayed.  The director and prime author, Akira Kurosawa, is very passionate about how people need to wake up and get out of the ruts they have fallen into and perhaps have followed for decades.  He also is astute to the limitations people may have or have set up for themselves, how such limitations blind them to what goes on around them, how becoming more aware of such things and of possibilities outside their limitations can be so painful and hard to grasp, and, sadly, how often they are not grasped or acted on at all. Real life is on display in this film. The film is structured as a two part invention with a coda, to borrow musical terms.  Both parts deal with discovery.  The first part, besides introducing almost all the characters and setting up the plot mechanics (very economically done!), shows how the protagonist, a long time city government employee and low level manager, comes to realize (indirectly!) that he doesn't have long to live, shows how he (in several, painful missteps and poor communication) comes to terms with the situation, and what he decides to do with the remaining time left. This part is lively, bounces around from scene to scene, jarring the viewer with new scenes, situations and points of view that keeps one concentrating on what comes next.  They are filled with irony.  With so much activity occurring in the moment, the viewer is not given time to get caught up in bathos or maudlin sentiments. The second part reveals the Japanese way for reflecting on the life of \"the recently departed.\"  It is very regimented with the most important people positioned closest to the memorial, with those of lower status trailing away from it.  It is typical for the comments about the deceased to be cool, measured, not completely laudatory at first.  After a few drinks of sake, when people loosen up and become less inhibited, praise for the individual begins to appear, then take over the talk or conversation.  It is in this setting, with these rituals and conventions in mores, where Kurosawa's sense of irony and rage (outrage?) are ratcheted up further.  For all of them are trying in their own way to understand what the protagonist accomplished and what was his motivation.  He had become a mystery to them during his last months of life and want to solve that mystery, especially after the citizens of the district - whose focus was the deceased's last public act - enter to pay their respects.  (It is an amazing scene to behold, which must be seen, savored and internalized.)  The viewer wants to know what happened as well.  Stories are told (and acted out for the viewer) which demonstrate that what was said early in the wake clearly did not do justice to deceased.  This section is much more static, and greatly, subtly depends on what the viewer has seen in the first part. The coda shows who understands the mystery and reveals how life can be so frustrating and miserable along with its possibilities.  The irony and rage are at their highest fever pitch in these few short final scenes. Within this structure and plot, Kurosawa is able to touch on many aspects basic to modern life.  They include: office politics, social status, the generation gap, poor communication, youthful aspirations, parental aspirations, gossip, children living at home, group dynamics. In addition, he shows specifics of Japanese culture of the early 1950's: American influence (music, shows, though no Americans are seen in the film), third world medical practices, wakes, proper gestures and bowing, etc.  All these aspects are shown in context, are not unduly emphasized, and make their nonchalant contribution to the plot.  Viewing the film with these in mind becomes a richer experience. By making this film, Kurosawa shows how the world could be altered and made better, that the status quo can be overcome.  Yet it also shows, when someone embodies such attitudes in his/her life, how they can be so easily misunderstood and, worse, readily ignored by others.  It demonstrates how so much effort is often required to accomplish so little in return.  Life as it is has never been portrayed any better than in this marvelous, extraordinary film. Quite simply, it is the greatest film ever made. Technical notes: This film was made in 1952 by Toho and it shows in the poor sound quality (the shot of the protagonist heading home from the doctor's office being a special, wonderful exception), the shakiness of certain images, and the overall wear of the print.  The negative for the film does not exist; it was destroyed in a fire.  The film cries out for restoration, but it would be a costly undertaking.  The film is 141 minutes long on the video, not 143 as printed.  The English subtitles on the video are from the 1960 Brandon Films release.  They need to be revised: there are some scenes where important information is not translated.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. FAIR WARNING!First, I want to get the negative out of the way and in so doing, point out that this film was finished and released in 1952. Perhaps melodrama of this type was the norm, but I came away feeling that this man's immanent death and his reaction to that inevitability was a bit overplayed. There, that is out of the way.I love the way Akira Kurosawa put this together. The film opens on the dull and crushingly boring life of Kanji Watanabe. He is a bureaucrat in the office of public affairs. For thirty years his primary responsibility has been to shift what ever comes to his office to some other department. In short he does nothing. He is a \"rubber-stamp\" official.Early in the film Watanabe realizes he has terminal cancer. Worse he is not told the truth by his doctor, but finds out from another patient. It is clear he is going to die; and he realizes that he has lived too regimented a life. He has done nothing useful and this, not his impending death, is what really bothers him. The fact that he has managed, for three decades, to waste not only his own time, but the time of others.Fortune is kind to him though. In his despair, he first encounters a novelist who has a penchant for words. This writer, played by Y\u00fbnosuke It\u00f4, perfectly expresses what Kanji is going through and applauds his every effort to rectify his wasted life, but it not enough for Kanji.The next day he runs into the youngest coworker in his office. He soon realizes that she has a childlike joy of life and he begins to experience envy and a longing to see life as she does. He eventually frightens her by wanting to spend so much time with her. This is perhaps the best casting done for the entire film, Miki Odagiri as Toyo, delivers such boundless joy and enthusiasm you forget that she's acting.Eventually Kanji finds a purpose for his life and the first three fourths of the film closes on his death. You don't know what he actually accomplished, but you do know by this point that he found a purpose; perhaps now he can die in peace.The last quarter of the film is Kanji's wake and the revelation that he almost single-handedly got this special project completed. His co-workers refuse to believe it at first, but as the wake wears on and the participants become more inebriated, revelations come about that prove that the lowly Watanabi did indeed accomplish his task.It is interestingly done. This could be a very dull story about a small and almost insignificant man and his life. But Kurosawa completely immerses us in Kanji's pain, dismay, and confusion. We become Watanabe. We cannot help but feel very deeply for this character.Just when you would expect the story to tell of Kanji's triumph Kurasawa kills the character and tells the remainder of his story through a series of flash-backs revealing the truth of Kanji's deeds at his funeral. It is almost astounding how many flash-backs there are yet Kurosawa manages to keep the story cohesive and easy to follow.It is a masterwork of story telling, though it seems overly melodramatic by today's standards of cinema.",

I heartily recommend this film to everyone who has ever toiled in a cubicle or at any mundane job that gives no inner satisfaction.

But it deeply touches my heart, prompting me to reflect on my lifestyle.I have recently written an article about \"Ikiru\" for a church's magazine. The first half is truly amazing. I was initially bored by the second half. But after some deep reflections, the second half actually vaults \"Ikiru\" into the ranks of classics. It does not only criticize bureaucracy, but it tells us that a meaningful life is not based on other people's praises and recognitions. Only one worker among Watanabe's colleagues appreciate his work and spirit. Regardless, Watanabe experiences fulfillment and joy even without any appreciations.We often wish to be glorified when we accomplish great tasks. But \"Ikiru\" teaches the opposite. We really live when we enrich life albeit one individual or a small community. Kurosawa calls us to serve people selflessly without seeking personal glory in the second half. Meanwhile, bureaucracy will continue to swarm and swallow people.I do not think that \"Ikiru\" is about life and death. Rather, \"Ikiru\" discusses how we live meaningful lives every day. Watanabe's terminal cancer motivates him to search a meaning for his life. I hope that \"Ikiru\", instead of death, prompts us to discover our lives' goals.\"Ikiru\" deserves to be one of Kurosawa's classic or even a classic or all time.

The girl says the all she does is eat and work. She makes toys, but when she makes them she feels like 'she is playing with every baby in Japan'. She asks him 'why don't you make something?'. There is nothing much he can do in a government office like his, and it is too late for him to change. But suddenly he realises that there is something he can still do, and runs out from the restaurant.All the time they were talking, there are children in the back excited trying to organise a birthday party. Kurosawa intentionally shows this in the background to give a feeling that something good is about to happen. And the moment he realises that he can do something and runs out, they start singing 'Happy Birthday' for the friend who is arriving. A life has just been born... I only noticed this the second time I watched the movie.Go ahead and watch this great movie many times. Highly recommended.",

Of all of films Kurosawa made, this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on an universal level, because at its core it is about one of the basic truths of life- death.In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. The film details the existential struggle of one ordinary man in his desperate search for purpose.Ikiru is a film that expresses itself in two separate parts.

Well, that's not the case at all for Ikiru, one of Akira Kurosawa's first universally praised hits.Ikiru tells the story of a man out of time. A bureaucratic man who has worked the same job for decades and can't seem to find any purpose in his work or life in general. That is, until he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer. What follows is a coming of age story for a middle aged man who does his best to leave an impact on the world he will inevitably leave. With one of these types of stories, it all comes down to execution. The only way to make a film like this leave you with a particularly effective message is to have a filmmaker like Kurosawa. For the most part, I did go through the emotions the film wanted me to. It's also a story that lends itself to being more relatable the older you get. It's not easy for a 23-year-old guy like me to understand what Watanabe goes through in Ikiru, but it may be something that I relate to more as I get older.I found this film to be especially inspiring from his co-workers perspective. No one at the office does anything of value it seems, and it's only until after Watanabe takes a leave of absence and goes on a journey of self-discovery that they feel like they need to do something as well. The film shifts from Watanabe's story to his friends & families' story about half way through. I found each part to be interesting in its own right, but watching the people he cares about look back on his life and the impact he seemed to have made was some powerful stuff. The lessons and themes in the film are important ones. Pleasure is not living. Don't always do things for others or to please others, make sure you're taken care of as well. And most importantly, life is brief, make of it as you wish.+Poignant+Kurosawa's direction (duh)-Two separate parts feel jarring at first8.4/10",

It's always been a meaningless, pretend work job, just as is the work in all the other sections.W. has increasingly suffered from stomach and digestive problems. He finally sees a doctor but, just before seeing him, he chats with a fellow patient in the waiting room from whom he learns that, if he has certain symptoms (all of which W. has), his doctor will tell him he has a mild ulcer, to eat the foods that agree with him, etc.--but he really has stomach cancer and less than a year to live. After examination, his doctor tells W. he has a mild ulcer and to eat the foods that agree with him, etc. W. realizes his life is near its end.He tries to tell his uncaring son but he's disinterested and doesn't hear. W. has been frugal, saving money--but for what? He withdraws some and a new acquaintance suggests W. live it up with drink, dance, and wild women and serves as W's guide through his futile attempt to find meaning this way.A spark happens when a young woman who works in his department resigns because she can't stand its meaninglessness. W. is attracted by her vitality and spends time with her until she pushes him away. But then he finds a purpose to accomplish: some mothers have been trying to get a swampy, buggy area in their neighborhood drained and converted into a playground for their children. But, typically, they've been shuffled from department to department fruitlessly without any progress. W. takes up their cause and accomplishes the deed just before his death. During his last breaths, he gently swings in the new playground in the snow, smiling, at peace, softly singing a song about seizing life before it's too late.After W's death, there's a wake at which his supervisors and coworkers drink and discuss W's legacy--did he accomplish anything?--did he know he had cancer?I saw this in a \"great films\" group. All others probably rated it as 10/10 stars--they were very moved by and loved it. I also thought it was good, worthwhile, but I'd rate it as 7/10. The cause of my disappointments: I thought ALL of the characters were VERY one-dimensional stereotypes and that the work situation & appearance were over-the-top caricatures. Those qualities reminded me most of plays in puppet theaters and that resemblance diminished its power for me.

Because, and this is a sign of how brilliant Kurosawa was as a director, with a single take we can understand most of the character. Shimura acts brilliantly, as usual, as a every-day-man who has nothing really special. I don't think i've seen character development as amazing as this one in any other movie, not even a Kurosawa one.

A classic piece of cinema that movie fans from across the world should seek out if they have yet to partake in it.5 games of Pachinko out of 5",

Would you spend your last days doing everything you wanted to do\u0085 any form of pleasure you can imagine, or would you do something importance, something that would actually mean something.An old man (Takashi Shimura) named Kenji is dying of cancer and feels his whole life has been wasted. For the past 30 years he's been working at Tokyo City Hall behind a desk accomplishing absolutely nothing, mainly just stamping papers with his rubber stamp and warming his chair.When he does find out he has cancer in the beginning of the film, he simply stops going to work and one day meets a stranger (who does a terrific job with his role) in a bar and in a conversation he says that he has money but doesn't know how to spend it for sheer entertainment. The stranger has pity on the man but at the same time envy since he doesn't just kill himself, but faces the facts of life and so of course he helps the old man have a good time but with his money as they go out on a night of night clubs, women and booze.Akira Kurosawa is one of my personal favorite directors and has many masterpieces but this doesn't exactly rank among those masterpieces like \"Ran\", \"Throne of Blood\", \"Yojimbo\" and the forgotten gem \"The Bad Sleep Well\". But that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film because in reality it's a great film, and the strongest point of this film is the simple but brilliant script as it tells us to appreciate life and the beauty of it, while we have it, hence the title of the film, \"Ikiru\" which means \"To Live\".One thing I didn't like about this film is the way the old man talks throughout the film; as if he can barley speak and you can barley make out what he is saying. But then again that is his role, moping around with this performance, you really believe that this man is dying of cancer and is truly upset with himself for not \"living\" his life all these years. One of his co-workers even tells to him over lunch that everyone has a nickname at the office and his was \"The Mummy\". He pauses for a minute and she thinks she has offended him but he reassures her that she hasn't in-fact; she has named him perfectly as he realizes that's what his life has been ever since his beloved wife has left him 30 years ago.Kenji feels that the worse part isn't dying; he feels that he has wasted his whole life and doesn't want to die before he does something of importance, meaning he wants to live his last days and not just exist as he has been doing all his life. He feels that he has been dead for a long time now but is just realizing it now when it's too late.There is a great moral to this story and a novelist in this film says it best with this beautiful and unforgettable quote: \"How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.\"",

This part of the plot is like the nine blind men each telling a little bit about each part of an elephant - the tail, the trunk, the feet - they are all touching, but none telling the story of the elephant completely.However the theme - the story of his last year - the 'real' Mr. Watanabe comes to life as each individual describe the Mr. Watanabe they all know. The girl puts the last piece of the story together.Ikiru is quite slow moving and if you're use to car chase scenes and blood at guts, you will not find Ikiru exciting or interesting at all. But if you want to see life, Ikiru (To Live) and love, then you will be in tears at the end of this beautiful great film.",

I'm not going to repeat what others have said, as you can read many a fine summary of the movie, but here is what I will tell y'all...Ikiru gives us the finest of Akira Kurosawa the director and Takashi Shimura the lead actor. And unlike most Japanese films, this one is not about feudal Japan! Instead, one gets a peek at the Japan of 1952, one that remains more unknown to most folks, including myself. Just observing the surroundings is an adventure, a discovery of the hereto unknown.The story itself possesses more raw emotion than, well, forget the comparisons. I'd put it up with Schindler's List.

They have been too slow, too Japanese in themes, for me to get into them. Until today.And don't get me wrong, Ikiru is very Japanese in themes, but those themes happen to be pretty universal. That of the meaning of life and why we live in the first place. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a middle-aged bureaucrat, who has dedicated his entire life to the wheels and cogs of paperwork. Endless paperwork, with no clear goal or even function. Just paperwork. But then he learns that he's about to die of cancer. And this monumental discovery finally jolts him awake and forces him to take a look at what he has accomplished in his life. He doesn't like what he sees.Ikiru's strength is the same that has always been Kurosawa's forte. A really strong central character and a strong theme that is explored through him. And Watanabe just might be one of Kurosawa's best. Through him we explore Japanese society and work culture with quite a critical eye, but the themes and problems themselves are universal. Why do we live? On our deathbeds, can we say we wouldn't have done anything differently? Few of us can, I'd claim.Ikiru is a slow movie. It is also deep, provoking and quite sad. Not for everyone, but for fans of Kurosawa and great themes in general, it is quite worth it.",

The coming of death awakens him to life. All previous considerations of remaining stable and safe are shattered (the man having slept for 30 years awakens to the emptiness of his life). What happens here is the neglect of the Delphi oracle \"know thyself\"; the approach of death forces Watanabe to examine his life, and this reveals the horrifying void. Many men postpone Socrate's question \"What is a good life\" until some shock awakens them to the decades lost to thoughtlessness (perhaps many only awaken to quickly fall back asleep, like a slave awakened from wonderful dreams who demands to return to them). Watanabe's courage, as noted by the drinking novelist, is his serious consideration of his life (stand and fight) rather than going back to sleep or suicide (run like hell).Watanabe's courting of the working girl is a determination to find something in life, and at their last meeting she gives him the necessary clue. How can you be so happy? She answers that she makes bunnies and thinks many children are happy thanks to her. She lives with some meaning, however trite. Watanabe returns to work determined to do something meaningful. He is happy as soon as he gets the idea and until he dies, working honestly to help create something beautiful.The song sung by him, in the first instant(when drunk) seems to suggest a passionate hedonistic life - given the atmospher this interpretation fits; however the second singing (his last words) is Watanabe swinging on a swing in the park he helped build. In the first he is melancholy and weeping, in the second he is joyous. The words can be paraphrased \"life is short. fall in love maiden. don't let the passion in your heart die\". Watanabe's message is not to indulge in drunken forgetfulness but to find something worthwhile to love, and use one's passion to create something good. It is an appeal to not fall into self-forgeting, but awaken to the urgency of life and the need to love beauty and create it.Watanabe says, \"I don't have time to be angry\". The urgency he feels makes this clear - there is only time to love and admire. In light of his purpose, anger is pettiness.while admiring the sky \"This is beautiful. For 30 years I have not noticed\".The movie also comments on the apathy of people in bearocracy. He reveals that one man can do great things and that apathy is evil that destroys society.Kirasowa asks us to examine out lives, to awaken and look about. Beauty is going unadmired, and men capable of creating beauty are passing the bucket.",

            "content": "I watched \"Ikiru\" for the second time after seeing its remake \"Living\" (2022, Oliver Hermanus). The pitfall therefore is that I compare the two films in the wrong order. I shall try to avoid this pitfall by not comparing the two films at all (or at least as little as possible). All I would like to say about it is that \"Living\" is a very faithfull remake of \"Ikiru\" and still a good film in its own right. This indicates that \"Ikiru\" must be a great film, and this indication is true.The story is about the bureaucrat Watanabe (played by Takashi Shimura) who is diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of the movie. He has only a few month to live. His first reaction is to take a walk on the wilde side for the first time in his lfe. He soon realises that this only leads to a shallow satisfaction and decides to spend his last months creating a neighborhood playground.I will make some remarks about each phase of the storyline.We are first introduced to Watanabe the bureaucrat. The bureacracy is really outrageous. Piles of papers are shuffled around, collecting a lot of (apparently necessary) stamps. The bureaucrats are disappearing after there own piles, citizens are sent from one department to another. After watching this part of the film you know that the concept of meaningless jobs was not discovered by David Graeber.The diagnosis scene is I think a bit dated. The doctors don't tell Watanabe the bad news but they try to comfort him. However a man in the waiting room had Wanabe told which words doctors usually use to wrap bad news in, and these doctors use exactly the same words. This is probably the scene in which \"Living\" differs the most from its original. It is still a fascinating scene though. When Watanabe leaves the hospital the film is completely silent to convey the extent to which Watanabe is shocked by the news. Only when a truck passes by there is sound again.The desire to walk on the wild side is partly prompted by the arduous relationship between Watanabe and his son. He has heard a conversation between his son and his girlfriend indicating that they are most of all interested in his inheritance. A few flashbacks however show that this arduous relationship is not only due to the son.Watanabe may want to walk on the wild side, he has no idea how. A novelist comes to his aid, acting (in his own words) as a sort of benificent Mephistopheles. Together they visit gambling palaces, dance halls and the red light district. In the red light district scene there is practically no nude, but still this scene is more erotic than the equivalent one in \"Living\". The most moving scene of this part of the film is however a drunken Watanabe singing an old song in a dance hall, reminding not only himself but all visitors of their mortality.The transition from the wild side to good deeds is set in motion by a young colleague from the office. She has resigned because the work was dull and monotonous. She has put a meaningful job ahead of career perspective and causes Watanabe to rethink his own decisions thirty years ago.The good deeds part of the story is told as a flash back. The colleague bureacrats of Watanabe visit his funeral and talk about his strange behaviour of the last months. They only begin to understand when they are drunk, and prefer to forget this understanding when they are sober again.There are many beautiful shots in \"Ikiru\". I already mentioned a few (Watanabe leaving the hospital, the drunken Watanabe singing in a dance hall) but the most famous is without any doubt the shot of Watanabe happily on the swing of the playground he fought so hard for.There are many films about love, but there are only a few films about dying. By dying I do not mean dying the quick way (such as in the shoot out of a Western), but dying the slow way (such as in \"Ikiru\"). But don't be fooled, \"Ikiru\" translates as \"to live\". It is not about a man dying too soon, it is about a man starting living too late.\"Ikiru\" is a film that makes you think. Yes Watanabe is an outrageous bureaucrat, but what about me? Maybe I'm also postponing good intentions until after my retirement?Akira Kurosawa is most well known for his samourai films such as \"Rashomon\" (1950) and \"Seven samourai\" (1954). He has however also made very good movies in other genres. Apart from \"Ikiru\" (1952) I like to mention \"Red beard\" (1965) and \"Dersu Uzala\" (1975).In the \"old man looks back on his life\" genre \"Ikiru\" is only equaled in my opinion by \"Wild strawberries\" (1957, Ingmar Bergman).",

It induced total immersion, which made remembering the whole film forever - to now.So I had to search to find film's title. I now again - spoke to another of seeing IRIKU so long ago. In 1980's when I visited my terminally ill coworker, I noted that she too had a son -acting just like this film's heroic Mr. Watanabe's son.The facing-death-bureaucrat - who humbly acted courageously - was also dismissed, mistreated, demeaned by his son in same manner. Sad. Ungrateful. A very disrespectful son.It was this mere \"civil servant\" whom we still now recognize as a model of how we too want to become- [perhaps before such dire dx occurs - if such circumstances occur to us too. ....With Pandemic dangers of 2020 surrounding us now, too, it may.It was then my surprise in carefully telling her the story plot, about un-grateful sons too - that I heard that my terminal-friend too had been taken by a group -long before - to see it - but that was also many years before we spoke. That coincidence of referring to this film, & w/o even knowing the title but only the story-line /plot - was also impressive & revealing:\nof how important a Good Film is to our different lives. How a film connects it's viewers closer -more than other talk can.This fantastically seductive movie is so good that it can never be forgotten. IRIKU shows us what we could -maybe- also become like that secret-hero. With this memory, we may get closer to doing better than could otherwise be possible. How many films have this strong & memorable & continuing on-and-on effect?

After a period of high-life and introspection he resolves he must do something meaningful with the precious time remaining to him.The premise of Ikiru (which translates in English as \"to live\") is an old and clich\u00e9d idea; the plot is nominally derived from Leo Tolstoy's The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, but probably a thousand other stories. What distinguishes it, and what makes it still as relevant as ever, is the depiction of Watanabe as someone drab and ordinary, with whom we can all relate. When he is faced with the horror of his own mortality he looks back over his work, his family, his contribution to society, and he can find nothing he has done which made any difference. He has slept through life, keeping his head down, following whatever path was the simplest and easiest, either afraid of or indifferent to the possibilities around him. Kurosawa's amazing gift is to present the story of a man painfully similar to ourselves, living in an all-too familiar world where almost everybody is either bland or corrupt, and yet somehow still produce a gripping, profound and intensely moving drama. Shimura is remarkable in the lead, his body bent by the weight of his predicament, his eyes shining with fear and regret as he searches for truth and clarity in an unfeeling world. His outcast status is beautifully encapsulated in the scene where he sings an old song, Gondola No Uta, and those around him move back in fear, lest they somehow catch his affliction. Kurosawa isn't telling us to pity this man - he's saying we are all this man, and everything we do, in our lives, in our work, in our relations with others, affects us and everyone around us. We must all face our own mortality at some point, and consider what account of our deeds we can give. The supreme irony is the lengthy wake sequence, in which Watanabe's colleagues initially downplay his role in the building of the playground, then gradually confess their admiration, then pledge that they will follow his example - only to carry on in the same thoughtless way, doomed to repeat his mistakes. The movie is full of wonderful shots (the shell-shocked Watanabe hearing no sounds on the busy street, the incongruous toy bunny between him and Toyo at the restaurant, the water reflected on his face when he is revived on the building site, many others) which subtly emphasise his plight, as does Fumio Hayasaka's mournful score. Written by the great team of Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni and Kurosawa, who (along with another frequent collaborator, Ryuzo Kikushima) wrote fifteen films together, nearly all classics of Japanese cinema. Ikiru is a picture of great humanity; without simplification or sentimentality it tells a story of hope in a world where the greatest enemies are conformity and inaction. Kurosawa shows us that everyone can make a difference - the choice is up to us.",

It's set in urban Japan, around 1950, so it's less \"foreign\" than some other Japanese films made around that time.  I've seen it in several video rental stores over the years, both dubbed and subtitled.In order not to spoil the plot, let's just say that as a result of a series of events, a bureaucrat approaching retirement age realizes that his life to date hasn't amounted to much, and, given an opportunity to reflect, tries to do something about it.  Then, just as you find yourself thinking \"Gee, that sure was a short, sweet movie!\" there is the bonus of a long and fascinating denouement.  As movies go, it's a two-fer.Now I'm firmly in the camp of \"keep your expectations under control and you'll have a better chance of enjoying the film.\"  But, much as I believe that another Kurosawa film, Rashomon, illustrates human truth (one truth per person), I think Ikiru illustrates, in a wonderful story with no preaching, the meaning of human life:  it's what we put into it.",

Akira Kurosawa directed and co-wrote a film many critics agree in how it's among one of the best films, it's also Kurosawa's favorite. Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 1996, saying, \"Over the years I have seen Ikiru every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us.\" Those words are 100% true, I think I'll do the same thing when I rewatch this film in five years time, it will probably move me as much then as now.The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. Takashi Shimura starts in the main role as Kanji Watanabe and though he doesn't have many lines of dialogue, his acting is truly memorable and even mesmerizing at times, brilliant performance.Kurosawa's long time work relationship with Asakazu Nakai is one of many reasons why his movies always look so excellent, for Ikiru, the cinematography is brilliant and so is Kurosawa's direction. The story is simple but it's his writing, his vision, his direction, that ultimately makes this film into the masterpiece it is. It isn't a movie you'll find entertaining and it never strives to be that kind of a movie, but Ikiru makes you think, truly ponder about its themes, and it moves you with its emotional story of a dying man and his final quest for meaning. Ikiru came out back in 1952 and that's 70 years ago now, it was a masterpiece then and it have stayed a masterpiece until this date, a movie that will live on for 70 more years.",

It was a bit distant from the rest when it began but then it turned out to be the most exquisite part. Some of the shots from the last 20 minutes might be some of the most iconic shots I've ever seen. The only negative if any is the unnecessary narration but its scarce presence helped to ignore it anyway.",

A little taste of living, in the company of strangers, enables him to find purpose in the creation of a park for local kids. At last, the sobs of worried local mothers have reached his eardrums.As we get to know this soul-in-rebirthing, instructive, inspiring words come our way via the voiceover:* \"The best way of protecting your place in the world is to do nothing at all.\"* \"You were slave to your own life. Now you are its master.\"* \"You can't blame it all on your son.\"* \"Why don't you try making something, too?\"* \"It's not too late! I have to find the will.\"* \"It's not impossible -- not if we set our minds to it.\"* \"Won't you please reconsider the proposal?\"* \"In the last 30 years, I've forgotten about sunsets.\"* \"I can't afford to hate people -- I don't have that kind of time.\"* \"Any one of us could suddenly drop dead.\"This movie makes wonderful use of music. We hear \"The Parade of Tin Soldiers\" as Watanabe shares with another person that he is dying. Indeed, we are only as sick as our secrets. (How sad, upon consulting Wikipedia, to discover the fate of the composer of the \"popular, jaunty march,\" Leon Jessel.) As Watanabe takes first steps toward his goal, strains of \"Happy Birthday\" accompany him.This film is highly recommended for youths of all ages.",

Middle-aged bureaucrat after the discovery of his remains because of a serious illness a year of life, he decides to spend the remaining time to make up for all that in life has failed. It actually looks for his life meaning, because he does not want to spend the last days of life, referring to the failures and terrible disease.This movie is really fascinating in a somewhat strange way. A touching story includes a bit pathetic old man with that in certain parts of the film a lot of people can relate to. A \"last\" year is filled with life. Loneliness, challenge, search, knowledge, purpose, peace and tranquility.Drama that causes progress and strength of character. A lone man in a deceptive world, without friends and family support searching for the meaning of his life. Death is closer with each passing day and she is inevitable. Life is dynamic in spite of everything, the end is ironic. Nobody's there to lend a hand, hug, kiss or encourage in difficult times. After death, they are all here to discuss, ask questions and seek answers.Director patiently studied the people. Somewhere based and on society as a whole. The goal is one, to present human nature and characteristics, strong emotions and way of life in a realistic way. Maybe a little taunt at the end. Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe is incredible. He gave us a deep and exhausting picture of his character.",

For me, the choice to convey the story second-hand in the second half of the movie didn't quite hit right. I was so immersed in Watanabe's story, I desperately wanted to see what happened to him, first-hand.

            "content": "My introduction to this movie occurred at a particularly poignant moment in my own life, so I believe it resonated deeper than I could have foreseen. It is a message that bridges the gap between despair and hope. The main character Watanabe, upon finding out he will be dying of stomach cancer (in a vague, clearly paternalistic way as far as the medical system is concerned), puts his life into perspective and struggles with how to proceed during his final days. This struggle is seen very viscerally during the night club scene, when everyone around him is dancing with reckless abandon, \"living their lives\", as it was, yet they do so without direct recognition of their own mortality. When the idea of death comes piercing through the night in the guise of the melancholic tune Watanabe sings, dancing stops and what is translated is how difficult it really is to enjoy life when its end becomes transparent.He is led through the maze of self-transformation, through the auspices of \"a good Mephistopheles who seeks no reward,\" and the ever-empowering feminine presence, the Anima (in Jungian terms). He desperately seeks to adopt the persona of those who are not sentenced to a more imminent demise, turn them into an eternity-conferring selfobject. But, alas, it is not to be, but rather than admit defeat and wither into the grave as a defeated wretch to the whims of time, he builds upon the energy instilled in him, and in a poignant moment new consciousness is born as a group of adolescents sing \"happy birthday\" just as he is descending the staircase. The transcendence of his passing manifests through the retelling of his final days during his wake, he has managed to cheat death in remaining in the hearts and memories of the ones he left behind. His ultimate demise represents his knowledge of inevitable annihilation and rebirth, the never-ending cycle that besieges all living creatures; he, in essence, \"fuses\" with nature and allows himself to be reintegrated into it. The meaning of life is truly that it goes on, and you can in effect conquer death by understanding what lies behind life. And that is something Kurosawa did beautifully in this film.",

            "review_title": "Kurosawa, the humanist !!!",
            "content": "In 'Rashomon', Kurosawa went back in time and used a period setting to tell a simple story about the mysteries and perspectives involved in deciding what's true and what's not. But what Rashomon also succeeded in doing, was underlining the general paranoia and cynicism prevalent in post WWII Japan. In 'Ikiru', Kurosawa does something similar, but this time in a contemporary setting, with a little more intimacy. The protagonist Watanabe's quest to find a purpose in the last few days of his life directly reflects Japan's quest to find a new identity after the war.But having said all that, what makes 'Ikiru' the special film that it is, isn't the discussion it lends itself to in terms of the broader historical context. What makes it special is the fact that 'Ikiru' is a deeply personal film whose themes will resonate with every viewer. The character of Kenji Watanabe is incredible, because he transcends geographical and racial boundaries. Each and every viewer has either known someone like this or is someone like this irrespective of which nation they belong to. In Ermanno Olmi's 'Il Posto'(which is a film that deals with the dehumanisation of people in the growing industrial setting of post war Italy), for a few minutes, the film shifts the perspective from the protagonist Domenico to the older employees of the corporation to underline the pointlessness of their lives. Watanabe could easily have been one of those older men in 'Il Posto'. I have known many men like Watanabe. He is a man who allowed himself to get trapped in the bureaucratic maze. In the scene where we first meet him, Watanabe is in the middle of the shot, while the rest of the shot is crammed up completely with official documents. When the devastating news of the stomach cancer hits Watanabe, we can't help but feel immensely sorry for him. Kurosawa then gives us a insight into the world of this old man. We get to know that he has a son and daughter-in-law who remain distant to him(which reminded me of Ozu's 'Tokyo Story'). We learn that he is a widow and had decided to not remarry for the sake of his son. We see laminated certificates on the wall symbolising Watanabe's slavish dedication to his job for decades. But as he stands at the brink of death, his job, his sacrifices, his life as a whole, everything seems pointless.I really loved how Kurosawa patiently devotes a lot of time towards Watanabe's existential crisis, his search for a purpose, a motivation to achieve some mental satisfaction during the last few days of his life. We see him seek the company of different individuals and try out various activities to initially enjoy himself and loosen up a bit, which he realised he hadn't really ever done. But even then, something always seemed to be missing. We as a viewer also feel his frustration during this struggle. This is why when he identifies his calling i.e. when he identifies exactly what he needs to devote the remainder of his life to, we completely understand his decision, his motivations and we rejoice in our own way for him.The screenplay breaks the narrative of the film into two distinct parts by playing around with the timeline. Although the 2nd part of the film (which to a great extent reminded me of Lumet's '12 Angry Men')flirts with the prospect of becoming a little too didactic, it never crosses that line, because Kurosawa doesn't make the theme completely overshadow the character.It is needless to say Kurosawa's frame composition and use of movement(of both camera and actors) is just imperious. As is the case with his other films, Kurosawa characteristically uses space incredibly in every frame in terms of the visual juxtaposition between the foreground and the background. He might cram a particular shot with numerous characters or objects, but even then you'll automatically focus on the movement of the one character that Kurosawa wants you to focus on due to the beautiful choreography and extremely fluid camera movement.Of course one has to give all the love to Takashi Shimura. His use of a hunched posture while walking, along with his facial expressions make it impossible for a viewer to not fall completely in love with him. Kurosawa uses Shimura's face brilliantly in various close-ups and these close-ups are really expressive. There is a moment where a colleague watches Watanabe walking alone down one of the corridors of the City Hall again with his hunched posture with his back to the camera. This is a wordless, haunting moment and that image of the solitary Watanabe in the corridor will stay with me for a long time.'Ikiru' is an exploration of the cynicism in post WWII Japan, it is a damning indictment of the uselessness of the bureaucratic system(which again is a universal issue), but more so than anything else, it is a touching tale of a man who desperately seeks fulfillment in the final lap of the marathon called life by devoting himself to a worthy cause. It is a film that has the power to make someone care, it is a film that has the power to make someone learn to 'live'.",

People being too self-centred, departments more interested in maintaining their continued existence by evading their responsibilities, it all still rings true today.Yet, lest one wallow in the cynicism that pervades parts of the film, he/she should remember that individuals can still achieve meaningful feats even in the face of such adversity.

            "content": "Ikiru, or \"To Live\", is a 1952 Japanese movie made by the legendary director, Akira Kurosawa. Considered by many to be Kurosawa's magnum opus, this film dives deep into what it means to live a fruitful life and what one's purpose should be. Ikiru is another film that just further contributes to Akira Kurosawa's legacy as it is another masterpiece. Keeping up the consistency of excellent works, Ikiru is nothing less than magnificent as it creates such strong feelings of despair and an overarching idea on what it means to truly live.\nIkiru is based off the Leo Tolstoy book, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, which portrays a high-court judge who is struck with a terminal disease and knows he will die soon. Ikiru follows Mr. Watanabe, an eldery bureaucrat who has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and is only given 6 months left to live. Falling into despair over the fact that he knows when he will die, he reflects on his life and realizes he has never experienced life for what it would be. The journey of the movie is Mr. Watanabe trying to find a purpose in a life full of regret and despair before he meets his unfortunate end.\nThe beginning scene of this film is one of my favorites. It shows the roundabout way the government deals with problems as women who come in with a complaint are referred to branch after branch until they eventually give up their request and go home. They never show anyone in the government doing actual work for people but simply muddling around their workplace. A disdain for bureaucracy is one of the primary themes Kurosawa employs in this film as Mr. Watanabe cannot even seem to remember anything he has accomplished while working. After Mr. Watanabe finally finds out what it means \"to live\", every bureaucrat sees the opportunity to rise in social status and tries to take credit for what Mr. Watanabe had accomplished. This film's depiction of bureaucracy is nothing less than bleak, ineffective, greedy, apathetic, and almost criminal.\nMr. Watanabe journey to find meaning in his life starts in his own indulgences. After he finds no satisfaction in partying or alcohol, he begins to try and make friendships that he once saw as pointless. He feels nothing until he comes to the realization of his worth. Mr. Watanabe, and Kurowsawa, both exert that the best way \"to live\" is to help others who are in need of assistance and compassion. Mr. Watanabe finally begins to push for something in the government to help out the local people. He is met with heavy resistance and everyone seems to be in the way. Mr. Watanabe shows incredible determination and is what Kurosawa expects people to be, the ones who show compassion to others and try to provoke chance and growth in a community.\nTakashi Shimura, well known for his portrayal of Kambei in Seven Samurai, is nothing less than impeccable in the emotions he is able to express and make the audience feel. The pure loneliness and despair is almost tangible. An incredible performance that is nothing less than making one come to tears at points in Mr. Watanabe's life.\nThe direction of Akira Kurosawa is breathtaking as usual. My favorite use of using all of the frame is a scene in a restaurant where Mr. Watanabe has his self-actualization of a goal. In the time that Mr. Watanabe is coming to the realization of his meaning in life, a birthday party is celebrated in the background. This symbolizes the rebirth of Mr. Watanabe and his renewed interest in staying alive. Just a beautiful use of symbolism and the superior direction of Kurosawa.\nSome might find the first half of the film mundane or uninteresting. There is nothing but unadulterated loneliness and sets up a very desperate feeling for the movie. There is no overarching conflict or problem that must be solved but simply following a man in his day to day life. This is like the works of directors such as Sergio Leone or Quentin Tarantino as the film simply follows the characters in his day to day life without some broad goal.\nAn audience must be vigilant as this movie is in Japanese so be okay with reading subtitles (you are missing out on a lot if you do not). Ikiru's overarching message is applicable to anyone as it tries to answer what is truly the purpose of one's life. Come into the film with an open mind and find a clear masterpiece in cinematic history.",

When do you feel full of life?In terms of the overall environment, whether it is the bloated ZF system of Japan in the 1950s or the small greenhouse effect, I feel that it is not outdated at the moment.After the war, Japan was completely westernized. Young people began to chase their personalities, seeking fashion, and the entertainment industry was thriving. This is a flashy society. 70 years have passed. Although the form has changed, many internals have not changed. Such flashiness further contrasts the inner emptiness of the head teacher. Money can't make people feel satisfied from the heart.From the beginning to the end of the story, the director spared no effort to satirize the inertia of the ZF personnel at that time, the complexity of the ZZ system, the \"lazy politics\" of the ZF personnel, the system nourished a group of busy people, and this group of people supported this system, the two formed a symbiosis Relationship, and in this calm, the male host is like a small stone thrown in, causing an instant ripple. This made me curious about the ZZ system in Japan, because for the time being, although ZF officials have authority, they are all constrained. They need votes, so they must have political achievements, just like this time in response to COVID-19 The governors of Hokkaido, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the prime minister, and officials including suicide, all of them are under tremendous pressure on the work at hand, which has not yet been clearly shown in the film. Has there been any significant change since the 1950s?Speaking of the characters, Section Chief Watanabe is hailed as \"Mummy\", a typical symbol that represents most of the people in the system. Like Watanabe, to support his son for a salary, he was trembling all his life; there were some like deputy mayor, typical politician, who sold his name and reputation; and Kimura, who understood everything but still compromised on showing; other wines had three trips People who change their words, get a good night's sleep and everything goes as usual. Who did they lose to?Section Chief Watanabe devoted his life to Xiaojia, but he was completely desperate after he was not understood by his son in his later years. Money cannot be exchanged for inner joy and calm. The change of Oda 's career as a female clerk is very happy to produce toys that children like. Watanabe began to realize what he really wanted. In order to complete the construction of the children's paradise, he ran across multiple departments to ask for help, his body became weaker and weaker, but his eyes were bright and determined. Not for fame or for profit, for the peace of mind. As Gao Xiaosong said: People who care about Jianghu will not forget you.In the movie, it used several contrasting techniques and birthday songs to show the sublimation of the characters. In \"Love, Girl\", the male lead sang this song twice, once in a lively and flashy social field, and once in nothing. One person's children's paradise has two completely different states of mind. When the funeral was switched back and forth, bystanders showed the facts objectively, and their emotions gradually sublimated. In the end, everyone unanimously acknowledged the hero 's credit and vowed to make a change, which also formed a gap with the next 180-degree change. Once again was deeply convinced by the director's dazzling technique.If everyone had to wait until they had cancer to think about doing real things, when did they know they had cancer?

While this obviously sounds like depressing material, there are many uplifting aspects to the film as well.Akira Kurosowa's film is about both life and death, as examined through the experience of man facing a terminal illness. The film is also an examination of the stagnancy of a bureaucracy, where change or positive action only results through almost heroic individual action in the face of resistance. Our protagonist admits that he has spent his entire career and also his life effectively doing nothing. This is the expectation of the government bureaucracy and now with time running out he must find a way to circumvent these obstacles. Another related theme, which is touched upon is the post-war reconstruction and the resulting changes to Japanese culture and society.The title Ikiru means 'to live' and one of the primary messages of the film seems to be that you should live your life to the fullest and don't let it just pass you by.The film has a very strong story and production values, as well as a number of great performances. In particular the performance of Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe the films central character must be mentioned.

Despite its serious premise, Ikiru balances sorrow with clever touches of humor, such as an early scene demonstrating effectively the bureaucracy at which Watanabe works.

It can be added shamelessly, or it can be used to reveal amazing depth of how an individual strives regardless of how severe the affliction. \"Ikiru\" (To Live) is an extremely admirable effort that quite possibly stands as my favourite Akira Kurosawa picture. It's sorrowful and unflinching, but it also keeps its hopes and optimisms dignified.Mr. Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) hasn't missed a day of work in his entire life. There he sits at his table with a never-ending mountain of paperwork to file, and his peers questioning his health and eating habits of late. A trip to the Doctor unfortunately reveals the worse, he has stomach cancer and not long to live. His uncaring family remains oblivious as Watanabe escapes into Tokyo's nightlife to find solace. There and along the way he meets the individuals that will see him make use of the remaining time he has.The pacing in \"Ikiru\" feels very well thought out and while the unique approach to the 3rd act has it's ups and downs, it still feels like something no one has attempted since. Takashi Shimura is absolutely wonderful. His face says it all when it comes to realising both the predicament he starts in, and his final thoughts and intentions. The main theme is a haunting and soft lullaby, whilst Kurosawa's camera-work is fearless in it's portrayal. That stunning minute of a man singing whilst on the swings will never leave my memories, and the great little subtleties like when the frame drops down a couple inches on an office worker and his stacks of paperwork is wonderful emphasis.Final Verdict: With ever passing year \"Ikiru\" feels more and more mature when I see it. I would happily revisit this film as often as possible, and it's another one of those timeless works where you look forward to growing old with it. 9/10.",

            "content": "It's about Kanji Watanabe, a quiet, ageing bureaucrat who is diagnosed with stomach cancer. With not long to live, he chooses to abandon his mundane existence, vowing to make his final days meaningful...The film is told in two parts. The majority of the film follows Watanabe in his worst moments of depression and reflection. The realisation of his limited time left dawns on him as brutally as it would anyone who's ever contemplated their purpose in the universe. He makes some connections with those around him instead of isolating himself in perpetual misery, and it's pleasing to see someone embrace the good inside themselves. Themes of humanism and existentialism are common in Kurosawa's work, but 'Ikiru' is perhaps the strongest example - and most relatable.The second part is set at Watanabe's wake, as co-workers try to work out what could have caused the sudden change in his behaviour and realise the positive impact he made on the neighbourhood. Again, it's the weighty themes explored which lend the film its emotional power, leading to a memorable ending.Overall, 'Ikiru' is exceptionally well-made and written, with a story that, at its core, contains a profound message for us all.",

            "content": "Ikiru is a classic piece of cinema about a man who starts \"to live\" when he finds out that his days are soon over, directed by non other than the great Akira Kurosawa.\"Ikiru\" is a tragedy about a man named Kanji Watanabe (Shimura), who works as a bureaucrat. Kanji spends his whole working life doing nothing, just like his colleagues, and finds out one day that he has stomach cancer and will die in few days. Knowing that life will end very soon, he tries to live.\"Ikiru\" is very radical in its style of narrative, for its time. The film starts with a third person narrative, that tell us about the character's situation, It simplify the story, so we don't have too use to much time, or put too much effort, to get into the protagonist's dilemma. Another example is a scene where we see how the officers reply the people who come in with questions and complaints. The scenes are shot in a very \"documentary\" sort of way, where it looks like that the officers are replying to the same question, a technique later used in documentary shows.The plot of the film is new for it's time, and starts right on the subject. The script is a bit confusing though, because the story focus on the character, and then goes to the world he is living in, where it makes you think that it changed it's focus to the \"system\", on the society, and not this particular individual, and then it comes back to the protagonist. It gives the character more dept and makes him more real, that makes sense, until a part of the film ,where it jumps back to the society again. Other than that, the sequences are set chronologically in order , with a few flashbacks that gives the protagonist, and other characters a lot of development. It gives us a better understanding of relationships between the individual characters.The cinematography, and usage of the camera gives a lot development and dept to the protagonist, and his situation. Throughout the film there are several close-ups, and extreme-close-up-shots, of Kanji. Showing us his facial expression, that shows depression, emptiness, illness, loneliness, and delivers an overall tragic feel. An example is during a conversation with a female colleague at a restaurant. The film also have a scene, just after he finds out about his illness, where shots fades into each other to create a disturbed atmosphere, this effect is used by other directors in later films, an example is the opening scene of 1980s, \"Tetsou\" by Shinya Tsukamoto. The flashback scenes are very clear, again thanks to the cinematography, where the picture dissolve to the flashback, Visually the story is easy to follow.Most of the characters in this film are \" types \", instead of individuals, for example you got the \"happy girl\", \"the mean boss\", \"the selfish son\" , and so on. The characters are developed in a very \"Henrik Ibsen\" sort of way (a famous Scandinavian dramatist). The actors portrayed the roles very well, but the only well developed character is the protagonist. Takashi Shimura, who portrays Kanji Watanabe, menages to express Kanji's feelings through facial expressions. Because the character itself talks very unclear. That gives us a disturbing feeling of, that this man can't express his pain. The character is so real, that we actually sympathize with him. Antoher impressive thing with his character is how he develops through the film. Everything from his voice to his ability to talk, gives us an view of his condition. Shimura's acting was also appreciated internationally, and he was nominated for BAFTA award for best foreign actor (1952). The cast of this film is seen in almost every Kurosawa film, to name up a few examples : Seiji Miyaguchi, Minoru Chiaki, Daisuke Kato, Isao Kimura, Katamari Fujiwara, Takashi Shimura etc., but their roles are very different from the other films, that underlines their versatility, and is maybe the reason why Kurosawa works with them frequently.The setting is very different from Kurosawa's atmospheric samurai films, that made him so famous. The story is set in a \"westernized\" Tokyo. Everything from the characters's clothes and hairstyles, to the music they listen to, and the clubs they go to, is pretty western. An example is a scene, where Kanji, visits a club, the girls are wearing western skirts, are listening to jazz, and dancing in a way like they did in the US, back in the 50s. In a early interview with Kurosawa, he mentioned that one of his autheurs in his films are \"the theme itself\" ( Ref. \"Reading A Japanese Film: Cinema In Contex\", by Keiko I.McDonald ). A question, that \"Why can't people live happy together\"?. He claimed that this question is raised in all of his films, there are \"places\", in this film as well, where this question is raised, an example on that is, the relationship between Kanji, and his son.Overall the film offers some wonderful effects, and great performances, and an interesting plot, on the contrary side, the focus of the film is a bit unclear, what or who, it is about. The protagonist or the society he is living in?",

            "content": "I think some of the gushing reactions to this film may be just a tad overdone. I mean, it's a good film, entertaining, but also at times tedious and lacking in any kind of real character development. Takashi Shimura as Watanabe tends to lay the angst on heavy without actually expressing the sentiment or emotion that one would expect from a man in his situation, especially as it relates to his son. His son and wife are mere caricatures, central to the plot but given short shrift as the film spends an inordinate amount of time on unnecessary development, for example the wild binge night that he spends with the novelist and his relationship with Miki. It does speak to issues of life and death in some roundabout way, and it can be forgiven for being a bit mawkish in terms of Watanabe's transformation; that would be standard for cinema of the period. Still, it is just a tiny bit trite to think that a man who's sold himself so completely into a life of oblivion suddenly finds a passion for service, because... well we aren't sure why. It seems to be the influence of Miki, but hers is anything but an example of service. Its a sweet thought, if not a bit saccharine, but ultimately dubious. In addition, in taking on as much as it does it doesn't always succeed. The critique of Japanese society is always present and reinforced in various ways, but sends the narrative off in too many directions, ultimately diluting the central story line. Enjoyable in many ways, but often discursive, it's a good film but not a great one.",

The first half is purely amazing, showing us the introduction of the character we are going to witness for the rest of the film. It shows how a character can transform from one situation to another, one mindset to another and how a single piece of information can change altogether of how a person has lived until that moment, and how he starts living post gathering the information.\nWhat I observed here is the person who discovers he has a cancer, doesn't share it with those who he has blood relations with, rather he shares it with an unknown lady in whom he finds solace. However, he actually starts living after knowing he has a cancer, all he is shown to do is go with strangers and have food/drinks at affluent places. But he just never feel confident enough to share those moments with his son.\nThe later half is a bit weird where his life is shown as perceived by people he knew at his workplace. Those last 40 minutes converge with mixed opinions about Kenji Watanabe. As his life is analysed by others, it gives us contradictory views upon his life which ask us questions with tough answers. We are made to feel that if Kenji Watanabe was alive, we would have gotten the answers so easily. But this is what it is all about life.Life asks us questions whose answers are not easy, but rather complicated and contradictory for others. We perceive life from others' eyes, whereas Kenji shows us that he lived his last few months by mastering his choices. He tried to answer those tough questions in tough manner, in a sense which don't usually appeal to his children, his colleagues, or even us as spectators. Who would not spend his last part of life with his own children and have leisure with others he rarely knew before he had cancer.\nWell, as long as Ikiru is concerned, it is a film by Kurosawa in his early days. He has made better films in his career. Films like Seven Samurai or Ran made him a maestro in Japanese cinema. But Ikiru is a story which can be seen with a keen interest. There are a lot of innuendos which make Ikiru a sublime watch. I still find it, rather not so captivating as his others, but I'll surely give it another chance.P. S. It is said that Indian film Anand(1971) was loosely based on Ikiru. This film showed a complete different take on the situation which Kenji faced. Anand may seem a bit loud, but it is more subtle, more energetic, more emotional and its dialogues carry more weight than Ikiru.",

These scenes have the feeling of Sidney Lumet's version of 12 Angry Men, which was originally written around the same time and released in theaters several years later. Much like the defendant in 12 Angry Men, I got the feeling the bureaucrats have put Watanabe on trial in a way.

We follow the main character, Mr. Shimura as his life is completely subverted when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.One of the most remarkable aspects of the protagonists performance (Kanji Watanabe) were his facial expressions. as the dialogue was kind of simplistic at times, the director relied on the actor's facial expressions to convey how he felt about the cornucopia of events taking place. Coupled with relatively interesting editing, these still expressions seemed to stick with the viewer for long after the scene is over. The sets were varied and enabled to characters to evolve by interacting with various elements of their environments. Personally, I found the music to be mostly gloomy which is in perfect accord with the movie's general mood.This is what usually call a \"thought-provoking\" movie, which might suitable for older audiences as they're more aware of the issues at hand and can, hence, appreciate the messages beyond.In a nutshell, This movie aims at changing the viewer's perspective and approach to life and the way it should be lived. And I think it succeeded to a certain extent, as it will certainly leave you pondering long after the ending credits roll up.",

After that, I caught myself thinking about it for the next few weeks. I thought, well, I was wrong so I came back and gave it an 8. After many months I decided to watch it again, just cause I liked it that much. The second I finished it for the second time I thought that this movie is an absolute masterpiece. I can understand why some people don't like this movie. It's slow paced. But Kurosawa does something that quite a few directors can do. Every shot has a beginning, middle and an end. Every character just feels alive, different. \u0395very action has an underlying meaning and above all, Takashi Shimura acting is superb!I don't want to go into much detail about the movie itself. The less you know the better. It's one of this movies that does an excellent job at making you feel empathy and understand the motives behind the protagonists actions and emotions. Simply.. Beautiful!",

Storyline has missing parts, it could give the messages in a better way. What I mean by that is the actors are so overacting that you find it silly. The main character starts to mumble after some time and you just cant focus and continue on watching the movie.",
