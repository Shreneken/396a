            "content": "Really, people? I mean, I saw the movie. I saw it just to see how bad it was. Oh, I was not disappointed. And it seemed like at the time everyone else agreed on how bad it was, considering it had a 1.7 rating here on IMDb. About three quarters of a year later, here we are with 4.9? How did this happen? So people just decide to up and suddenly praise this movie? Yep, seems likely. I did a little research on a lot of these \"reviewers\", due to outrage and a bit of summer boredom, I'll admit that right there. Here are my findings: Many of them were not only posted within a span of four days or so, but most of them have \"The Oogieloves\" as their only review ever made. Also, those accounts were made exactly one month and three weeks ago from today. What are the odds? Not to mention their usernames follow the format FirstnameLastnameNumber. Is it possible for everyone to just up and decide that? Poorly executed cover. Maybe this is true, and maybe it isn't, but to me it looks as if Kenn Viselman, the \"marketing visionary\", is getting desperate and is asking people to give his \"film\" good publicity. How else do you explain this sudden spike in votes and reviews? And if this really is true, then maybe Kenn was lying through his teeth when he said it \"wasn't about the money\". I mean, seriously. If it's not about the money, why the heck would you credit yourself as \"marketing visionary\" in the trailer? Does anyone see the irony in that? We're not that stupid. (Funny, I can imagine kids all over the world saying that to their parents when they saw the trailer.) Not to mention, if this is Mr. Viselman's way of compensating, then he must not be very good at his job. When you have to literally hire people to like your movie, then quit your occupation. That's like paying people to cheer you on at your baseball game. That's a bust. You've hit rock bottom, Kenn. And this film truly deserves more bad views than it already has. Three over-sized, fully-clothed Teletub- er, I mean Oogieloves- go on a quest to find five magic balloons for their friend Schluufy. After all, it is his birthday (it is a he, right?). Okay, that's not a bad set up. It's simple enough. But we need to keep the parents entertained. Let's spice it up with some C-list celebrity cameos! I watch them sing and dance in this movie, and I bury my head in my hands, wondering \"Why, Prince Wesley, why? Detective Kujan, what are you doing with your life? Doc Brown, if only you had your DeLorean to travel into your future and see this pile of dung!\" It's sad, really. However, even when watching the movie, I think to myself \"So what's so bad about this movie?\" It's not how poorly-made it is, how badly-written the songs are, or how embarrassing the cameos are. It's the fact that they think this is what kids need. Do children really need three crudely designed gigantors talking down to them (literally) as if they were stupid? This is WAY past pandering, it's babying. Many people would respond to this, saying \"Oh abrown975, you've gone too far. It's just a kids movie. It doesn't have to be perfect.\" Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. \"Oh come on, it's just a toy. It doesn't have to be perfect.\" \"Lighten up, it's just a baby swing. So what if it's shoddily made?\" \"It's okay, it's just a pacifier. Why would it need to be child-safe?\" Let me put things in perspective if I haven't done that accurately. Is \"Barney's Great Adventure\" a kids movie? Yes, and it was horrible. Is \"The Lion King\" a kids movie? Absolutely, but it's currently rated the #1 animated movie of all time on IMDb. What about \"Mac and Me\"? How great was that? Not at all. What about \"Up\"? Um, nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, need I remind you.Just because it's a kids movie doesn't mean quality has to be abandoned. Using \"How can children tell?\" as an excuse is just a blatant cop-out. It's laziness, no matter how \"revolutionary\" the idea is.THAT'S why \"The Oogieloves In the Big Balloon Adventure\" is not only a horrible children's movie, but just a movie by itself.And that's exactly why I say you should definitely watch it. WHAT A TWIST! Yes, that's right. Watch this horrible piece of poo. Watch it with your friends. Make fun of it. Have fun. This is the \"Troll 2\" of our generation. \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" has prepared us for this exact moment.Huh, maybe this was Kenn Viselman's plan all along to get viewers. Perhaps he really is a successful \"marketing visionary\" after all. Well played, Mr. Viselman.This movie still sucks though, no matter how many PR people are telling us otherwise.UPDATE: 6.3!UPDATE 2: 7! This is unbelievable.",

            "content": "The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is the worst kind of film you could ever show your young children. It's unsubstantial, witless, lacks anything in the way of a lesson or a moral, too kiddish for even the youngest viewer, and largely comprised of things that have been proved unhealthy for your visual and auditory senses. It has been reported by Box Office Mojo as having one of the worst opening weekends for a film opening on more than 2,000 screens, with a dismal $102,564 and a final gross of $1.06 million. Against a $20 million budget (and an extra $40 for marketing), this makes this one of the worst performances for a film ever.Our story is concerns Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofie, the three Oogieloves that exist in their own world, which is so colorful that is borders along the lines of nauseating. They are celebrating their pillow Schluufy's birthday, and plan to give him five bright gold balloons for his surprise party, which they plan to set up while he is sleeping. When J. Edgar (their vacuum cleaner friend) accidentally frees the balloons outside, they become scattered all over the whole mythical land, leaving the Oogieloves no choice but to get them back. They bounce in and out of colorfully artificial sets, running into people like Rosalie Rosebud, Dottie Rounder, Marvine Milkshake, Bobbly Wobbly, and Lero Sombrero.That's all well and good, but would you believe those characters are played by none other than Toni Braxton, Cloris Leachman, Christopher Lloyd, Chazz Palminteri, Jamie Pressly, and Cary Elwes? If one thing is guaranteed to make your jaw drop when watching this film, whether it be the stunningly frothy atmosphere, the corny singalongs, or the inept nature of the characters, it will be the list of talent involved with this project. What could've been going through Chazz Palminteri's mind when he signed up for this film? He was the driving force behind the film adaptation for A Bronx Tale, an amazing coming of age story I'm sure those who attended The Oogieloves won't go on to see. To give him credit, he plays his role with convincing motivation, but witnessing him batting dopey milkshake puns and dancing around the milkshake diner, concocting cockamamie shakes filled with peppermint, chili, pickles, and other ingredients is one of the most dreadful things I've ever seen a talented actor succumb to. And I saw Movie 43, mind you.Let's talk about the box office performance of this film. Normally, if I catch a film on DVD, when all its financial information is already public and mostly complete, I shy away from explaining it because it usually has nothing to do with the quality of the film at hand. It's not worth mentioning, per say. Yet we need to talk about how The Oogieloves performed theatrically. I already wrote an entire blog when this film was in its theatrical run about how this film's dismal performance was either an indication of the end of August being a generally poor time to release a film (kids are going back to school, adults are generally rushed, and time is fleeting) or a smart public. Both of those, I believe, are big factors, but one of the biggest ones is the lack of an introduction on these characters or \"Oogieloves.\" Think about it. Films like the Rugrats trilogy, The Spongebob Squarepants Movie, and The Wild Thornberry's Movie succeeded largely due to their name and familiarity amongst elementary schoolers and maybe those of selective age groups. The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is marketing characters nobody knows to a demographic that still can't completely influence their parents to take them to the cinema to watch the film of their choice. Usually, the parents decide the film and see if the child has any dissenting remarks. The Oogieloves were not introduced to the public prior to this unexpected movie adventure, and with no prior consumer knowledge via an album debut, a TV special, a TV show, books, etc, this was a project doomed from the start. Why was $60 million invested into this? The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure was marketed as an \"interactive\" movie feature, allowing children to fearlessly speak to the characters in the film, get up and dance on que, or openly talk during the picture. During the course of this eighty-one minute endeavor, ten songs are played, hoping to get children out of their seats and on their feet dancing. What is played are some of the most redundant, idiotic, monotonous songs that showcase nothing but maddening tedium. If there was any prior music released by the Oogieloves prior to this film I'd hate to hear it. The theatrics, too, never stem past costumed-humans dancing robotically back and forth to the music, and in a day and age where computer animation can create an army of one-thousand characters to dance and sing simultaneously, this return to primitive style is lame and relatively bland.To bring things to a simple close, The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is a harmful, harmful film to show young children. Films like this give kids nothing but a shorter attention span and an energy level that can easily be adopted off of caffeine and fast food. Taking your child to see this film will do nothing to make them smarter, better, and will do nothing to further them in any way shape or form. Taking them to see films like Brave, Cars, Shrek, Toy Story, or Wreck-It Ralph fuel their minds with creative energy, giving them a lust for life, adventure, and fun. This is one of the most appalling films released in some time for all the wrong reasons.",

            "content": "If it weren't for the talented actors and the notorious positive reviews and ratings spamming, I wouldn't have known that The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure existed. After seeing it to see if it was as bad as all that, a big part of me wishes it stayed like that. The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is really as horrendous as everyone says. The colours are bright, but not in a good way, the whole movie has a garish feel that only accentuates the movie's overall tackiness. The costumes are so creepy that they induce nightmares, Barney and the Teletubbies are tame in comparison, while the songs are some of the worst I've heard, the lyrics are incredibly childish and the tunes will leave you cringing. That they're badly sung doesn't help though. The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure isn't fun, educational or endearing in the slightest. The writing is as childish as the songs, with the humour and gags being enough to insult a 5 year old and traumatise children younger than that. They are not funny at all, and can be seen as inappropriate. Education value is low on the radar, people will almost certainly be saying \"why am I being being \"taught\" something I already know?\" and they won't appreciate that it's done in a way that talks down to them rather than engage. The story is full of repetition and goes nowhere a lot of the time, there are stretches where there is a strong temptation to nod off. 5 year olds won't even need to see this movie to do and learn the stuff that is shown in the movie, so that makes The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure pointless as well as repetitive and dull. Don't expect Christopher Lloyd, Cloris Leachman, Cary Elwes and Chazz Palminteri to make The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure watchable. They are saddled with characters that are impossible to like or engage with, dialogue that shows even them looking embarrassed and they are poorly utilised, they try but just can't do anything with what they're given. It is a waste of real talent, which is one of the worst things a film can commit in my opinion. And the less said about the truly obnoxious titular characters the better. In short, a horrendous movie, which along with Foodfight! is one of the absolute worst movies seen by me in a fair while. It fares terribly as a family movie, and is even worse for its main target audience too. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

Dora can be a little annoying at times to me, but I can see it's educational value and that it has a plot, a point, some thought went into the episodes.The Oogieloves had a bad plot, bad writing, bad songs, bad acting and was quite frankly and insult to your average pre schooler.One of the reviews here said it was for 8 years and under, and I say to that NO WAY IN HECK! You will not find a kid above 5 wanting to sit through this garbage.It makes the lack lustre The Lorax (of which most would say the book was far superior), seem like it should have garnered numerous Oscars.If I was a writer on this project I would have told them they didn't have to put my name in the credits, it's THAT awful.NOW, to the bogus reviews - there are 5 here as of this moment - 1 is a good review by someone who has written a lot of reviews, so I can respect that they found something appealing in this pile of dross that I obviously didn't see. 2 are awful reviews like mine, written by people, like me, who have written other reviews.Two of the reviews are bogus in my opinion, probably written by someone in connection to the movie, since neither of these people has EVER written a review on ANYTHING before. Does that scream fake review to you? Even with the bogus reviews this movie is only on a 2.2 so far, that should tell you it's just plain bad.Don't even rent it from a Redbox, it's not even worth that much! Parents everywhere hear me, you're going to be happy in a couple of weeks because Finding Nemo is coming back to theaters, save your money and take the little guys to that - they haven't seen it on the big screen and it's even going to be 3D too, now THAT is a movie worth your movie ticket bucks.I would have given this a zero with no qualms at all, except that there is no option for a zero out of ten!",

            "content": "The Oogieloves In The Big Ballon Adventure is not only one of the worst movies i've ever seen, it's the worst children's movie i've ever seen! It's everything that's wrong with children's shows wrapped up into one movie. Having left the theater, i'm still incredibly shocked that a film this terrible got a theatrical release. First off, this is some of the laziest writing i've ever heard for a kids film. Just look at the characters names! Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofie! And if you think that's bad enough, just wait until you hear some of the supporting cast characters names. Rosalie Rosebud, Marvin Milkshake, and the worst of all is Carey Elwes character's name Bobby Wobbly. The saddest of all is Christopher Lloyds role which is just embarrassing. You can tell for the most part though that none of the supporting cast wanted to be there because they aren't even trying at all. The plot of the film is as simple as it gets. The Oogieloves have the collect the 5 magical balloons they've lost and get them back in time for this big party they are about to have. You can pretty much figure out the whole movie from just that one sentence. What ensues is some of the worst jokes i've ever heard in a film and a bunch of lame dance/musical numbers. Now the Oogieloves is being marketed as a \"revolutionary interactive movie-going experience\". However, there is nothing revolutionary or original about it. If you've seen Dora The Exploreor or anything show similar of that, then you've seen everything that Oogieloves has to offer. There is nothing new here to see, except the material being taken to a new low. The writing is some of the worst i've ever heard for a kids film with all of the jokes involving some sort of gross out gag or flatulence jokes. The musical numbers are also very bland and the songs are not catchy at all. However, I can't really say the film bored me because it just kept irritating me and making me more and more angry by how awful it was. The fact that this is what people are accepting for children's entertainment is shocking and is exactly why all kids entertainment these days sucks! Oh, and don't buy into the \"Academy Award Nominated Director\" crap either, Matthew Diamond was nominated for Best Documentary for a film that nobody saw. I really can't think of anything else to say about this film besides how awful it is. Please Parents, do not take your kids to see this film!",

            "content": "I do not understand the marketing decision to create the Oogieloves. This sort of thing clearly would interest very young children--with its bright colors, catchy music and deliriously happy characters. However, I cannot honestly see a child older than about 3 enjoying this in the least. So, it appears as if the target audience is 12 months to perhaps 36--a very, very narrow window indeed. So narrow that many parents wouldn't take their kids because who wants a film that ONLY kids this age would like? You couldn't bring the older sibs to the movie, as they'd be suicidal or would be bouncing off the walls throughout the movie. And, if your older child DOES like this, I question their sanity and maturity! As for everyone NOT in the target audience, you'll probably find the Oogieloves both annoying and incredibly creepy. Their faces are only barely animated--with their dead-like expressions and facial movements. And the music is clearly the sort of simplistic stuff that would annoy as well. The bottom line is that I can see NOTHING about this film that wouldn't turn off the viewer unless they are very, very young.I am not giving a numerical score to this one. I don't have a tiny child to ask what they think and it's not fair to rate a film for tiny kids when I am an adult. But I am very annoyed with IMDb because they don't do a very good job of policing the reviews or numerical ratings. \"The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure\" HAD a score of about 2.0 for several months and some group apparently bombed the site--flooding the film with 10s (why, I have no idea)--hence it's very respectable score of 7.5. Additionally, there are many positive reviews that clearly must have been put there by the filmmakers. You can tell since the reviewers have not reviewed any other films and their 'reviews' are made up of single-line blurbs--as if they were lifted from a press release! Unfortunately, I've seen this same sort of thing happen with a few other films--such as the reviews on \"Just Another Romantic Wrestling Comedy\". Someone is going to need to start policing these things or of what value would IMDb be if this get out of hand?!",

            "content": "Well I just finished this film. Full disclosure, I lost a bet on whether the Pittsburgh Pirates would go above .500 this season and for some crazy reason they actually finished above .500 so I had to watch this film. With that said, I can say that at times I was thoroughly entertained.Let's start with the acting, it's hard to imagine why some talented actors chose to work in this film but then it's not that hard to imagine when you think about the one day of shooting for the significant pay day. Listen, every actor or actress was just horrible in the film. Tony Braxton was so self centered that it was almost uncomfortable for me to watch and not one time do I remember her stating who she actually was in the film. Was she playing herself? I'm still left wondering about this one.Cloris Leachman was the first respectable actress to appear and she essentially played a crazy person. Her character was obsessed with circles. If you just read that sentence and re read it because it didn't make sense then let me spare you the third re read, yes...she was actually obsessed with a circular shape. When the Oogielove trio enters her home and begins speaking with her they mention nothing about this psychopathic problem. If I entered a situation like that, my initial thought would be something like \"What the hell is wrong with this woman? I gotta get outta here. This woman is crazy and I legitimately need to be worried about my safety.\" Instead Cloris's character induces the trio into a disturbing dance about circles that is sure to leave the audience questioning their sanity.By the way, let me interrupt my character and acting assessment to quickly explain to you the plot of this film. The Oogieloves wake up in the morning and it apparently is their pillow's birthday. Once again, you read that correctly, it is their pillow's birthday. Now there is no explanation for why there pillow is alive or whether it can even speak at this point, as a viewer you just have to go with it and as I tried to immerse myself in the Oogielove world, just for a second I was able to believe that the group was really excited about there pillow's birthday.Now we are introduced at this point to our first supporting character in the film, a window with a woman's face on it. Think Snow White mirror but a beautiful woman instead. I wish I could say that this talking mirror is the most unique and weird character in the film but frankly it probably doesn't even approach the top three. The talking mirror speaks with a southern accent for really no reason whatsoever. I'm not sure where the accent comes from but it is just accepted despite no one else in the film having that accent.The window wakes up the Oogieloves and they look into her. She has the magical ability to see anywhere in their mysterious land so she shows them an approaching character. What character you may ask? Well this character is hands down the most unexplained and unbelievable character in the film, it's a talking vacuum cleaner. Why a vacuum cleaner? I repeatedly asked myself that question while watching the movie and came up with no good answer. I'm just going to assume they simply thought of a household object and for some reason believed a vacuum would make for an interesting character. They were wrong.The talking vacuum accidentally lets go of some helium balloons for the surprise birthday party for the talking pillow because I think he tripped on the sidewalk. (There is a sentence I never would've believed I would've typed in my life.) So the Oogieloves trio set out to go and find the balloons for the party. Now at this point my spidey senses were tingling. I had a ton of issues with their decision making here. So you're telling me they can't just go buy 5 more balloons? The talking vacuum has an answer for that question. No, these are the last balloons in their world. Hmmmmmm...well played director, well played. Well truthfully, we learn later these are magical balloons that can sing but their song was really stupid and basic and I don't really think the talking pillow enjoyed it but I don't want to give away the ending for you all.So the Oogieloves go from place to place and meet the celebrities. The worst acting performance (and believe me this was not an easy decision) had to go to Christopher Lloyd. In about 10 minutes of screen time he had 1 line...ONE. I mean really? He just blankly stared at the camera and then made weird threatening faces towards the Oogieloves when they stared at Jaime Presley the wrong way. And yes, we were to believe that Christopher Lloyd was hooking up with Jaime Presley. The sad fact is that this was not the most unbelievable subplot of the film.Listen there is other characters in this film and other terrible story lines that are worth discussing but I think I've talked enough. It was a disturbing film and really entertaining at times. It was an awful film and I don't believe for a second that kids would actually enjoy it (kids aren't stupid) but from a satirical standpoint I somewhat enjoyed it. View at your own risk.(As a side point you have to love the people that come on here and are hired to write reviews. They are so blatantly hired to write positive reviews and frankly it is comical.)",

Of course, it probably didn't help that advertising for the film seemed to be nonexistent but make no mistake, this movie stinks.The movie starts with Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofie, who can charitably be described as the unholy spawn of a troll doll and a Teletubby explaining the movie's audience participation gimmick. How they do this is a mystery as their mouths barely move. The rest of their costumes are not much better, as they're only slightly more convincing than the guy in the Goofy costume at Disney World.We also learn a little about them. Goobie is the smart, analytical one, Toofie is basically the slacker of the group, and Zoozie is a girl who talks to animals. Except for the animal whisperer deal, none of this amounts to anything.Then we meet their friends, a talking vacuum cleaner named J Edgar, a talking windowpane with a bad Southern accent named Windy Window, a literal fish out of water in a bowl named Ruffy, and a sentient pillow named Schluufy. They set up the plot, which is that the pillow is having a surprise birthday party and J Edgar is tasked with getting five balloons for it. He does this, but loses them all during some spontaneous epileptic fit. Since these balloons are somehow magical, it's up to the Oogieloves to get them back before the party starts even though the pillow seems stoned out of its mind and probably wouldn't notice anyway.If that sounds bad, just wait. There are five humiliating guest star appearances tied to the retrieval of each balloon. Each of them is dressed like a clown (except Toni Braxton), is forced to act like an escaped mental patient, and sings an irritating repetitive song meant to inspire audience participation. Everyone here is making such big fools of themselves (except, MAYBE, Toni Braxton) that I spent the entire movie feeling sorry for them.Guest appearances include Cloris Leachman, as a deranged woman in Raggedy Ann make up who's obsessed with circles and lives in a teapot. Next we have Chazz Palminteri decked out as a fifties soda jerk trying his hardest to channel Jimmy Durante. Then we have Toni Braxton, who is somewhat spared by the costume department as she gets to wear a sparkly yet revealing evening gown and her natural singing abilities keep her song from being a total disaster. Though it is puzzling why she sings a slow R&B ballad in a movie designed to encourage children to dance.After Ms. Braxton's ode to the sniffles, we get to see Cary Elwes in perhaps the most degrading, bizarre performance in the film and that's saying something. It can best be described as a psychotic cowboy who walks bowlegged and bounces up and down while wearing a creepy smile on his face that doesn't say \"Hey kids, let's dance,\" so much as it says, \"I dismembered several young girls and buried them in my backyard.\" The final balloon is held by Jaime Pressly and Christopher Lloyd who pretend to be Hispanic for some reason and live in a sombrero that only moves through the power of dance. At first, Lloyd mercifully doesn't have to speak but he later loses his dignity in a flamenco dance set to Benny Hill speed after bellowing out a loony Tarzan yell.And so we have a movie trippier and weirder than anything to come out of the mind of Hunter S. Thompson. That aside, its failures are almost too many to count: bad costuming, bad acting, bad singing (except Toni Braxton), bad writing, and boring, uninspired music. It's also annoyingly repetitive. Not counting the songs, which repeat the chorus until you want to drive a nail into your skull, every time a balloon is retrieved we must endure a chant from J. Edgar to summon Windy Window, another chant to phone Goobie, and the Oogieloves' stock chant.The last balloon in particular is agonizing to sit through as it takes twenty minutes more for the movie to end and it seems to grind to a halt while they try to get the sombrero moving. When Ruffy complained that they were going so slow that they wouldn't even make it to Schluufy's retirement party I sympathized. I can understand the repetition if it were a TV show divided into several episodes, but in movie format, it comes across as the filmmakers thinking their audience has the memory of a goldfish. Did they really expect kids to sit through this? This is a movie that truly deserves its reputation as the biggest flop of all time. It's irritating, boring, garish, cheaply made, sickeningly cutesy, and sometimes creepy even. I know I'm not the target audience for this film but there are plenty of kids movies out there that can entertain both kids and adults so it can be done. I truly feel sorry for the few parents who had to sit through this thing to appease their kids and maybe even some of the kids as well.And as for Cloris, Chazz, Toni, Cary, Jaime, and Christopher Lloyd, my condolences on all your careers. OK, Cloris Leachman will probably survive this disaster cause she'll appear in anything (this movie is undeniable proof of that), but the others still stand.",

It was really Peter Simon, I suggest you filter it as \"Chronological\" and look through pages 2 - 6. When you go to page 6, you'll see his username under batnerdavid, meaning that Peter Simon was the FIRST user to write a bogus review when this whole mess first happened (The day was June 14, 2013, the other 2 in 2012 and the one earlier in the year don't count).

Perhaps the glow stick had something to do with the beginning that we missed, but she kept asking me what it was for.

            "content": "Talk about a movie that is so incredibly pandering that it is insultingly stupid, right down to the plot which is about the Oogieloves retrieving magical balloons for their pillow friend's (yes it's an actual talking pillow) birthday party and coming across cameo stars whose talents get wasted in the worst way possible. It's so hard to take down each fault all at once, so let's look at the top five problems one by one (if you can stand it).First off: THE PLOT IS ENTIRELY POINTLESS AND KILLS HALF YOUR BRAINCELLS! They lose the balloons and spend a whole hour looking for them individually. Why don't they go to the store to get more? Because these balloons are magical. What makes them magical? They're talking balloons (Groan). When they gather the balloons together and almost lose them again, they blow kisses at them to make them come back and it works. Could somebody please get me a mallet so I can smash my head for saying that? Not to mention, this is all for a stupid pillow's birthday party. I'm all for a friend's birthday, but of all the characters this movie had to pick the pillow as the character we were hoping would get the best birthday party ever? Really? What is also irritating is that the plot stops at every cameo and every song. Kids are going to be anxious for the plot to move on. How about the Oogieloves themselves? They're all one dimensional: one is scientific (not really), one is fluent in any language (except for you know every other language aside from English and Gibberish), and the other is a complete idiot, right down to the point where he doesn't want to wear a belt and his pants constantly fall down and is told to pick them up by the other Oogieloves and the silent children from the other side of the TV. Their songs are also obnoxious! It's basically singing the word \"Oogieloves\" over and over. Also I should mention that this movie does what it can to try to get kids actively involved with the Oogieloves by dancing to their songs. How will they know when to get up and dance? By having butterflies fly across the bottom of the screen and the Oogieloves telling them that it's time to get up. How will they know to sit back down? By having turtles walk across the screen and the Oogieloves telling them to sit back down (you know, in case they didn't see the turtles). I already hate that I had to explain this situation in detail. Not only was that waving keys in front of a child's face stupid, but that was just telling kids to do this in the middle of a movie theater when they're suppose to stay seated. Even if it was at home, does it really matter if they're dancing or not? The movie still goes on without them doing anything. And once again, we have a \"kid's movie\" that actually should be censored. What are they trying teach their kids? Don't wear a belt and it will be okay if your pants drop because kids will tell you to pick them up? A stranger says, \"follow me in the trailer\" and it's okay because he has bubbles? Sexy dancing is for all kids to see and dance to? Kids are going to pick up on these \"morals\" or whatever they are and think that it's okay. Even the annoying Disney Junior shows were smart enough to show kids what's okay and what's not okay in life. This movie just doesn't care. Finally, let's talk about the cameo stars. Now clearly most of the kids won't know who these people are (like Cloris Leachman, Chazz Palminteri, Toni Braxton, and so on) with a few exceptions (Cary Elwes and Christopher Lloyd), but anybody who knows these actors are in for so much pain as their dignity is taken away from them by having them play a circle obsessed weirdo (Cloris Leachman), a milkshake bartender owner (Chazz Palminteri), a sneezing engrossed singer (Toni Braxton), a bubble freak who should be investigated by the police for stranger danger (Cary \"as you wish\" Elwes), and two Mexican stereotypes (Christopher Lloyd and Jaime Pressly). I thought seeing Hilary Duff and Christopher Lloyd in Foodfight was painful, but you know what, this movie makes a great effort to make it more painful to see your favorite celebrities get butchered, than even Foodfight (it's still one of the worst films ever by the way). I still wonder how they got roped into this crap storm. What more can I really say about this abomination? It's like if the Teletubbies became five year olds, kidnapped celebrities, and somehow made a movie. This is one of the worst \"children's\" movies ever and not worth your five year old's time. I don't care if it keeps them quiet, it is a movie that tells them \"You're stupid\". Disney movies have more respect for their intelligence than this film ever will.",

            "content": "That's right guys, I actually found and viewed this...thing. Is it as bad as everyone says? Is it as bad as the trailers make it look? Is it as bad as the 1.7 on IMDb? Is it as bad as the mere $411,050 it grossed on its opening weekend? Well...yes.The story involves three....three...\"things\" that have to throw a birthday party for their talking pillow, but they are waiting for their talking vacuum cleaner named J Edgar (I'm serious about that name) to deliver some balloons to make the party complete. However, the vacuum cleaner trips like a dumbass and accidentally releases all of the balloons into the air. Now its up to our three friends to go on a wild and quirky adventure to find the balloons and meet some new pals along the way. Other than some bright colors and poorly written songs, Oogieloves offers nothing for children at all. The plot is extremely repetitive: the Oogieloves bump into a new character, sing a song, get a balloon, then move on to the next character, rather rinse repeat. The costumes for our protagonists look like they could've been bought in a Halloween store. I mean, the mouths move like an old kung-fu movie dubbed into English, and they all have severe camel toe. And also, why the hell did they name the vacuum cleaner after the head of the CIA? Is it some sort of inside joke or something? Did they think toddlers would really know who J Edgar Hoover is?The characters and their actors are very...interesting. Clorice Leachman plays Dottie Rounder, an old lady who is obsessed with circles. She doesn't seem genuine at all, as if she was dragged out of bed and forced to dance. The same can be said with Christopher Lloyd, who doesn't even talk at all (except for the line \"Oooooooogie!\"). Cary Elwes as a bubble-spewing, ADHD cowboy truck driver seems likes he's having fun on the set, but he cant sing worth a damn, unfortunately. Personally, the worst of all is Toni Braxton as the singer who has a cold. Trying to describe her performance here is like trying to describe a dragonfly sexually assaulting an elephant with a coloring book. Simply put, her acting is just pitiful, and the song her character sings is one of the worst songs I've ever heard in a movie; its in my top 5.The ONLY character worth sitting through in this movie is Chaz Palminteri as Marvin the Milkshake Guy. Wow, is this character fun! I'm not a kid, but if I were, I would've jumped outta my seat and started dancing along with his song. His acting is over-the-top, which is perfect for this movie and perfect for the role too. Not to mention, Chaz has the best line in the movie: \"Oooh! Mah favorite!\"Overall, Oogieloves And The Big Balloon Adventure is not a movie I'd take a kid to see. There are no lessons at all for one thing. At least something like Dora The Explorer or Barney teaches lessons like sharing, being kind, speaking Spanins, etc., but this movie teaches kids squat. This is the kind of movie that would lower a kids IQ. I'm not sure what to rate it, but it wont be a high rating because this movie was just flat out awful.",

While Pixar creates family fare that adults can enjoy with their children, no amount of alcohol could possibly erase the stain this garbage leaves on the mind. Simple plot regards three people dressed in what amounts to mascot costumes and trying to obtain five magic balloons for the birthday of what appears to be a snoring pink pillow. While these three morons and their talking fish go fetching balloons, they keep in close contact with a talking vacuum cleaner and a magic window. While Matthew Diamond directs better than this turd farce deserves, it must be noted that too much of this could drive a parent insane. Not only are the characters all costumes in the Barney school of quality but we also have cameos by celebrities who come across as on the end of massive punishment. Cloris Leachman is probably hoping that this isn't her \"last picture show.\" And certainly Christopher Lloyd would like to go \"back to the future\" and fix this career travesty, and maybe \"frame Roger Rabbit.\" Cary Elwes was ankle chained in Saw and probably views this as a task even Jigsaw would not dream up. Toni Braxton appears as a singer with allergies to roses, but obviously not bad scripts. Jamie Pressly puts in the best effort and the most spirit yet cannot render this garbage worthy of her time.

A good kids movie won't talk down to its audience and treat them like an idiot, just because they're kids, it doesn't mean they're stupid. A bad kids movie treats them like an idiot because they're a kid.

There is no single good thing about this dreadful movie, all about it sucks.This movie is nothing but toddler trash with silly songs, just nothing but silly songs. The story is bad. The characters are lame.The special effects were quite poor.The music was bad.BTW, just because this is on 7.2/10 right now, doesn't mean this movie got positive or mixed reviews. The reason why it is on 7.2/10 is because of a bot who created and used so many accounts just to abuse the 10/10 star button just so ''The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure'' could have higher than 2/10. I know as it is mentioned in 70% of the reviews of the film, and back when I heard about the Oogieloves in Early Sep. '12, I saw that the Oogieloves was on 1.9/10, then a couple of months later, it was on 1.7/10. Then it kept increasing non-stop, until I found out once last year, it was on 7.6/10. The movie was STILL panned by critics because of that. Besides, on Metacritic, it is on 32/100, and on Rotten Tomatoes, it has 27%. The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is an awful movie, without any single redeeming value.0/10",

This movie relies heavily on the trope of parents sitting their children in front of anything because it's \"made for\" kids. Don't do this, parents. Look for quality movies and shows. Things like Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends or Disney movies (Note: Ken Viselman did nothing for TTTE&F. He was head marketing.). This movie made me cringe of how bad it is. The first minute or two of the movie had to explain in song and dance what stock images of ducks or insects meant. The plot is so flat. The Oogieloves need to get a balloon for their friend, a pillow. They go across the U.S. I suppose and get a balloon for their friend, a pillow. That's the story. It's bad. Bad, bad, bad. Luckily, no more movies of this series will be made, as they won't know how to advertise, and it was the biggest box office bomb of a movie like this. We're saved! The oogieloves are No more!",

            "content": "I have no point of reference here. Not being a parent, the Oogieloves are a new experience for me, and at first glance they seem to be no more or less irritating then the stuff I pass by while flipping channels on my way to something else. My knee-jerk reaction is to call their movie \"harmless\" yet something troubles me. At the very beginning of The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure the titular characters inform the kids in the audience that this movie requires an interactive response. When the movie signals you \u2013 by way of butterflies floating across the bottom of the screen \u2013 that you are to stand up and dance and sing. In other words, the movie is asking your kids to do the very thing that we have been taught all our lives not to do. It can only be hoped that this does not become a trend.If you've heard of The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure then you've probably heard of it's now famous legacy, released on August 29th 2013 on 2000 screens it quickly became one of the worst selling movies of all time taking in around $500,000 on it's opening weekend on a $12,000,000 budget.Not knowing what I was in for, I did a quick internet search and discovered that the movie is based on a TV series called \"My Bedbugs\" featuring the adventures of three colorful child characters called Gooby, Toofy, and Woozy. To be honest, I have no idea which one is Gooby, which one is Toofy or which one is Woozy and I only finished the movie 20 minutes ago \u2013 not that I was struggling to keep up. I have no idea how this movie ties in with the show, but having seen the movie, I'm not exactly killing myself to investigate further. I can see from an IMDb search that \"My Bedbugs\" was only on two seasons and ended its run in 2005 which means that the intended audience for this movie probably wasn't even born when the show ended. Are the parents flying blind? The story of the movie is basically a hanger on which to hang a bunch of musical numbers and songs and interactive bits for the kids in the audience. The journey follows the Oogies as they are preparing to celebrate the birthday of Schluufy, the pillow that sleeps on their couch. But the magic balloons they bought for Schluufy float away and we are told that they are the last magic balloons to be found. The rest of the movie is a song and dance journey to find the five balloons before Schluufy wakes up. The journey takes us through a malt shop, a traveling sombrero, a bubble truck etc. etc.The world the kids live in is not a million miles removed from \"Pee Wee's Playhouse.\" Their guardian is a vacuum cleaner named J. Edgar (who bears a nearly litigious resemblance to The Rug Doctor) and a window named Wendy who is their view of the entire world. The look of the movie seems to be a distant cousin of the Sid and Marty Krofft style of the 1970s most notably \"The Banana Splits\" only without the zaniness or the aura of the 70s groovy time capsule. The characters are adult-sized costumed actors with big eyes that move and mouths that barely move when they talk. They look like lesser versions of The Muppets and inspire you to wonder why this movie wasn't animated.Naturally my own reaction was kind of indifferent, though I was surprised by an incredible amount of celebrity cameos, some of whom looked game but many of whom looked baffled and confused. There's Cloris Leachman, Toni Braxton, Christopher Lloyd, Jamie Pressley, Chazz Palminteri and Cary Elwes. Elwes is the most baffling, playing a guy named Bobby Wobbly who looks and acts like Jim Carrey. None of these actors appear as themselves, and none is on-screen for more than a minute or two. They are there to sing a song and move along. Will the little ones enjoy it? Probably. It's bright and it's colorful and it has a lot of motion and music. But it's not anything you would need to see in a theater. It's a perfectly serviceable DVD where the kids can interact with it in their living room. Again, I'm not sure I am comfortable with the idea of a movie that requires children to sing and dance and act up in a movie theater. And again, I'm not a parent. I would be more comfortable putting a child in front of The Wizard of Oz or My Neighbor Totoro or Toy Story or Mary Poppins. Those movies will stay in your kid's mind for the rest of their lives. Oogieloves will stay with them as long as the DVD is still running.",

            "content": "This movie tries too hard to appeal to kids using a lot of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes from many children's show, to the point that it seems a parody. This is the greatest flaw of the film and the reason of many of the other problems.Another problem is the conflict of the \"Big Balloon Adventure\". It may be OK to maintain a short chapter, but is too weak to maintain a feature film. The problem is made more obvious with all the filler scenes and repetition. Therefore, the storytelling is terrible. The first minutes of the film feel like an eternity, the pattern quickly gets predictable and when you think there is going to be a good scene, there isn't. The film also keeps treating as linear a mission that isn't.The characters do not fare any better, being barely more than bland stereotypes. In the case of the \"puppets\", the unappealing designs do not help. The three Oogieloves are too bland to be sympathetic or engaging, the Vacuum is annoying, the fish feels like a load (it is inappropriate for an adventure, the pillow is unlikable, Windy Window feels bland, the animals are useless and only serve as filler, and the human characters feel embarrassing being only utilized for humiliating roles, all them failing to be entertaining. Even if they tried their best on the film, the script ridicules them too much to let them give a decent performance. Talking about the script, it is utterly shallow. It keeps treating children as stupid and has little educational value, which is things that their audience has already learned or could learn easily in other sources. The running gags feel forced and fail to cause any laughter. The Special Effects look mediocre, but tolerable; while the jumps of the Oogieloves feel too fake.About the music, all the songs were cheesy, superficial, generic and lazy, keeping the underrating of children. Many of them were badly sung, maybe with the exception of Rosalie and Lola. And they did more harm than good to the film, due to their irrelevance.To finish, I recommend this film as involuntary comedy, rather than a product for kids.",

I know this is a children's movie and kids movies are easy targets for awful movie reviews, but honestly, if I were a kid I'd feel insulted from this. The movie's story is your basic kids story stuff, some big party is being arranged, all's going well until one of the Oogieloves looses the magic balloons required to make the party all wonderful (I think, honestly the plot is too stupid for me to even follow). So they have to go on a quest to recover these balloons and along the way they encounter many creepy people (Usually played by B, C or D list celebrities) who help them with getting these balloons and who usually sing extremely painful and stupid songs when the Oogiloves get said balloon. Honestly, this movie is just plain stupid. Again, i know this is a kids movie so the plot is meant to be incoherent, but it's just terrible and generic as all hell. Also, I have to complain about the cast. Why is it that this movie is full of actors who honestly deserve better then this? Seriously, you have a cast consisting of Cary Elwes, Cloris Leachman, Chazz Palminteri, and, good god Christopher Lloyd? How far you've fallen, yet out of all the possibilities and comebacks you could give to these people, you make this trash. So yeah, you have a stupid plot, a cast consisting of actors that are slowly watching what's left of their careers waste away. Combine those two together, and you have this pile of garbage. Truth be told I can't recommend this at all. If you're a parent looking for something to keep your toddler or preschooler occupied stay as far away from this as possible and maybe rent them some Disney movie or something. I suppose the only group of people I could recommend this to are druggies. In fact, they should have made this a stoner flick and called it \"The adventures of Cary, Christopher, Cloris, Chazz, and Jamie in Drugland\". That and they should have cast Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, and Lil Wayne as the Oogiloves, but at this rate I'm just fantasizing. So yeah, if you're a pothead or anything along those lines looking to watch something for kids whilst high as balls and Yo Gabba Gabba ain't doing jack for you, I suggest giving this a look, I'm sure watching this movie while high is a 100 times better then watching it while sober.",

Now, if you're thinking \"don't be so hard on it, it's for little children\"; toddlers are not stupid. While shows targeted at them\ncan be annoying at times, preschoolers can recognize when they're in real danger and this movie is a danger to the psyche. The plot is paper-thin, the colours are so bright they're almost nauseating, and the costumes are right in the uncanny valley. Our story concerns Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofie, who are essentially just ripoffs of the Teletubbies (they even have a vacuum\nsidekick). Anyway, the Oogieloves are planning a birthday party for their friend Schluffy, who just happens to be a pillow, but accidentally lose the balloons (our more accurately the vacuum loses the balloons). So essentially, the entire plot consists just of the Oogieloves going from place to place to find the balloons and along the way meet guest stars such as Chloris Leachman, Cary Elwes, and Christopher Lloyd (all of whom probably only agreed to be in it for the money). Overall, just skip this one, it's just not worth it (besides, the DVD is impossible to find). Instead, show the preschooler in your life something like Little Bear, Little Bill, Kipper, Bob The Builder,\nDragon Tales, Peppa Pig, to name but a few.",

I thought the movie looked so stupid that it would make the Teletubbies look as confusing as Inception. Recently, however, I saw all of the good reviews on IMDb for this movie. There was someone who said that in a world with Dora the Explorer, touch-screens, and Wii (as much as I love the Wii, was it relevant in 2012?) this movie was different. I thought to myself, similarly to Fight Club, Vertigo, and the Shining, audiences were considering this a masterpiece while critics would eventually hate themselves for panning this movie. And then I decided to watch..... The movie features the Oogieloves; Goobie, Zoozie, and Toofi, a vacuum named J. Edgar, and a fish that wants to be in this movie as much as I wanted to be watching it. Instead of character development, they decide the beginning of the movie is the perfect time to tell the audience of the movie. In the movie, it is a pillow's birthday. Unfortunately, J. Edgar lets go of five balloons for the pillow's birthday party. After hearing this, the Oogieloves go on their journey. Even though I gave you the basics for the movie's characters, everyone in this movie is an idiot. The human characters are even more stupider than the ones in costumes. Every time, the Oogieloves finds one of the five balloons, they are given a gift from one of the people in gratitude for the pillow even though they don't know f**king s**t about him. Surprisingly, somebody in the movie has the guts to say why the Oogieloves can't get other balloons. One of them answers that they are special balloons when they don't even know the real reason why they went on their journey! There's also a character who says the words \"totally\" and \"square\" in every sentence (are we sure this came out in 2012). On the quest for the first balloon, the Oogieloves decide to dance with this old drug-addict woman instead of telling her their situation first. The acting is horrible. The only reason I said the woman was a drug addict two sentences ago was because she acts like she's exhausted and just snorted three pounds of cocaine at the same time. Christopher Lloyd is in this movie (Emmet Brown agreed to do this movie, just let that sink in) but he's so embarrassed to be in this that his only line is \"Good luck on your big balloon adventure!\" Throughout the rest of the movie, he just plays bongos and dances with a stereotypical Mexican. And by stereotypical, I mean stereotypical. Her name is Lola Sombrero for god's sake. The tone of the film is awful. It treats the audience like they're all under two years old and shows no respect for the adults who paid to see this instead of waiting for Finding Nemo 3D or Wreck-it Ralph to be released in 2012. It's fair to do this for a children's television show, but a whole 90 minute movie is just insulting. What bothers me is that the Oogieloves never had a T.V. show. Nobody knew what they were, so why would they make a f**king movie based on them? The worst part of this movie is the constant songs. Usually I don't mind musicals even if they don't stop singing like Les Mis\u00e9rables, but they made that movie seem as musical as Schindler's List. All of the songs are completely unnecessary. There's a whole three minute song about being sick in bed, just so Toni Braxton can pretend that she's Adele or Beyonc\u00e9. There's even a song about how to get a milkshake at a diner. I wish I was making this up. I wish I was making this up. And now the end of the movie. It's the stupid pillow's birthday party. At the end of the party we see all the characters the Oogieloves met giving gifts to the pillow. Yeah, if I had a birthday, I would definitely want a bunch of gifts from people I know nothing about. The pillow already received presents from those people, is he turning 18 or something? This shows that the balloons we've been searching for singing Happy Birthday. Why did need to search for these balloons if they just sing? Why not let the Oogieloves sing, they've been singing the whole movie? And guess what, they even sing at the end. I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!! In my opinion, this is bad as Batman and Robin (1997). A movie that I called the worst movie ever for a long time. I can't tell which is worst. Now I see people realizing how horrible this movie is. Surprisingly, I am angered. I sat through the Oogieloves only to find out, I shouldn't have wasted those 90 minutes of my life. To all the parents in the world, do not watch this with your kids no matter what.",

Creepy! I can't believe so many children were in that theater, especially when-Wait, this is a children's movie? Oh, alright.This is one of the biggest disgraces to children's films I have ever seen. Many people try to claim that, \"It's just for little children, don't take it so seriously\". There is plenty of amazing children's content, such as the recent film, Inside Out. The most painful part of this movie was when Chazz Palminteri played some overly happy waiter (Side note, I wouldn't be so happy playing in the Oogieloves) and kept going, \"OOH!\". I think it's him going through the realization that he's a character in the Oogieloves.But in all honesty, if I was offered a paycheck for starring for, say, 20 minutes, I'd be the first in line for that role.",

            "content": "I almost always watch these awful movies online, usually to avoid giving money to these horrible film makers, but sometimes because I can't find a copy in my video store. This movie was both. The basic 'plot' starts with a man in a horribly disturbing Oogie- suit loosing balloons because of his creepy pillow friend. Him and the gang then have to find the balloons. That's it, they might meet a celebrity who will sing an awful song here and there, but that's literally the whole plot.The editing is all over the place, mainly in this one scene where Christopher Lloyd is dancing to a sloppily edited mix of music, one second he's moving his knees, then he's in Egypt, then doing a tango.All the jokes fall flat, it's not Foodfight style humour where they have someone fart on someone's face, or put a random food item in a movie quote, but it's pretty bad. In one scene for example, Chazz Palminteri keeps stopping to say \"OOUGH!\" every five seconds, probably to amuse kids because it sounds funny.This movie had a massive ad campaign, but as the trivia page says, they set a world record for the lowest grossing film showing in over 2000 theaters. The creators eventually got so desperate that they got people to right positive reviews on sites like IMDb, probably through the use of money or brain washing techniques- Goofie Toofie, PICK UP YOUR PANTS!!!!What just happened... THE OOGIELOVES IN THE BIG BALLOON ADVENTURE IS THE BEST MOVIE OUT THERE! I SAW IT IN A PACKED THEATRE ON ITS RELEASE DAY, AND EVERYONE WAS APPLAUDING AT THE END. WITH INTERESTING CHARACTERS, RICH PLOT AND HILARIOUS COMEDY THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN ENJOY, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE OOGIELOVES ON BLU-RAY TODAY!!seriously though, this is one of the worst movies out there.",

I'm glad I never saw it when it was released. The month of the release date on the poster has a terrible pun. The acting is poor, the writing is poor, the humor is poor, and in other words, just cheap. I hate this movie. Why does it exist? Why does it have a rating of 6.3 out of 10? Why not 3 out of 10?

            "content": "For some reason, the last time I've walked through Times Square in New York City still sticks out in my mind. Surprisingly, it wasn't from all of the flashy advertisements of Coca Cola, McDonalds, the stage show Wicked, or the Hard Rock Cafe. Instead, it was the giant advertisement pasted over Toys R Us, which advertised that a movie called \"The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure\" would be releasing in theaters on \"Oogust\" 29th. Being curious as to why something that resembled Teletubbies was being created in the year 2012, I couldn't help but look the movie up, only to find that several people who were involved with Teletubbies created the movie. Knowing the infamy shows like Teletubbies and Barney have, I kept checking on the movie until it got released, not being surprised that it was panned by critics, but ultimately being surprised at it becoming one of the worst box office bombs of all time. At that point, I began to realize that the Times Square advertisement was the only ad I ever saw for the movie, with no other ads in sight during frequent two hour drives and train rides I had to make and while visiting websites on the internet. Even when the movie was added to watch instantly on Netflix, I noticed that it quickly disappeared from Netflix's recommended movies, requiring you to search the movie's name in order to find it. Finally, the question as to how a movie could fade into obscurity so quickly got the better of me, and I sat down to watch the movie on Netflix. After it ended, my main reaction was this; \"Thank god this movie bombed\".First of all, the movie's main selling point is the fact that it's an \"interactive\" movie, in which the audience is encouraged to sing, dance, and talk alongside the characters in the movie. I find it kind of funny at how the movie treats this gimmick as an original idea, when in fact it was being done by many educational shows (both good and bad) including but not limited to Sesame Street, Blue's Clue's, Dora the Explorer, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Barney & Friends, and even Teletubbies. Not even the argument of this being the first interactive movie holds water, because movies like The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland also encouraged audiences to interact with the characters on screen.But enough ranting about that, let's move on to why I hated this movie. The premise of the movie is that the Oogieloves, three \"things\" that look like a cross between a Cabbage Patch Kid and a Teletubby, want to celebrate their pillow's birthday with five magical balloons. But when their talking Vacuum Cleaner J. Edgar (get the reference?) ends up losing the balloons, the Oogieloves and their talking fish embark on a quest to reobtain the balloons in time for the pillow's birthday party, encountering stereotypical characters played by celebrity guest stars along the way. It's a simple setup, and admittedly most movies with a simple setup could work. However, this is not one of the movies.Perhaps the biggest problem with the movie is that it contains a lot of unnecessary filler, no doubt to increase the run time of something that feels like it should've been a 40 minute TV special (and giving how cheap the movie's special effects are, I wouldn't be surprised if this is what the movie started production as). I could go into how most of the song sequences come almost out of nowhere and serve no purpose to the plot, but giving how simple the setup is, I suppose there's nothing else they could've done but waste the time of those who watch this. It doesn't help that the most of the songs themselves are aggravating to listen to (the only decent sounding one coming from Toni Braxton, which is kind of ironic since it's the only song in the movie that doesn't seem to encourage singing and dancing), and the movie even feels the need to throw in as many random sound effects as it can, believing it's entire audience to have ADD or something.But the worst problem with the movie, is that not only does it talk down to it's child audience, but it leaves an incredibly bad influence on them as well. I say it's a good thing that this movie bombed because had it succeeded, it's likely we would've seen more kids allowing their pants to drop in the general public, it's likely we would've had kids getting hurt by trying to create a trampoline out of a sheet and suitcases, it's likely kids would've of went around trying to make handicapped people walk because all it apparently takes is \"a little encouragement\", and it's likely that kids would've been more trusting of strangers who invite them into the back of their truck, among many other surprisingly damaging and offensive influences that the young children this movie is targeted towards could pull from it. Suddenly, it seems like \"It's just a kid's movie\" isn't a really good argument to use when trying to defend this movie.Is there anything positive I could say about this movie? Well, I did like the fish's character, but that's because I could relate to him, in that he wanted no part in the songs and the other shenanigans performed by the Oogieloves throughout this movie. Well, I'll give it this, at least there was a character for me to root for...",

Finally, they decided to visit the Midwest on a tour, which included a stop in Detroit. I was quick to get a ticket, but somewhat appalled when I saw the movie they were going to put us through was The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure. This is a truly painful movie to watch. Even having no kids of my own, I've seen some bad children's TV shows, but this is like the worst of those all stretched out to be feature film length. The entire thing is so slow and tedious, with no educational value whatsoever. It doesn't teach any real life lessons, and at best can get kids to count up to 3. It's almost the opposite, in that it teaches kids they can safely jump from high places holding nothing but a balloon, and it also displays some mild racism.What might be the most shocking about The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure is the cast of human characters that show up to embarrass themselves. Chazz Palminteri, Christopher Lloyd, and Toni Braxton are just 3 of the faces that are dancing and singing as horribly goofy characters. I will acknowledge that it seems they are giving their all in these performances despite how stupid the characters are writtten. Speaking of that, the writing is what I find most obnoxious about this film. It's one thing for goofy puppet characters like Barney to talk in very simple words so children can understand them, but these creatures say utter nonsense half the time. The songs are somehow worse. I've heard improvised lyrics that are better than this drivel. And if there's one thing I can't imagine parents wanting when they bring their kids to the movie theater, it is for a movie to encourage their kids to get up and start dancing and running around the theater. What can I say other than never watch The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure?

One must not forget that this movie is G rated, you will not get a lot of action sequences or drama from a movie that is G rated. The previous review was reviewing the movie the way an adult would view it. For someone like me who has actually taken my kids to see this and to be able to report that my children loved it is enough for parents to take a deep look at what they are allowing their kids to watch. This is for the parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and others that want to take their really small children to a children's movie without having to worry about shushing them and making them keep still. It's a movie that has simple story lines and characters with a lot of repetitiveness because as my daughter's kindergarten teacher has stated, with 5 years olds, you repeat a lot.This is a movie that teaches kids how to identify a situation, formulate a plan, follow the plan and find a solution. There is a message in this movie that not every situation involves some dramatic tragedy, killing or murder to teach a moral lesson in the world. Sometimes situations follow a sequence of events and the colorful characters and the simple language teach a lot to your young children. You will not get this in other children's movies or animated feature films. I really liked Cloris Leachman's character, my 5 year old remembered her as Grandma Dottie a lot. In fact my 5 year old would wear polka dots and comment that she was just like Grandma Dottie. My children also kept singing the theme song in the car. That was after just seeing the movie once. The 80 minute movie was short and my 2 year old was able to watch the whole thing.The best part about it is that the kids can get up and participate in th e movie by singing, dancing and following a long. Don't we want to teach our kids how to follow instructions? This is a great learning tool and I hope more families take their kids to see it. As a mom, I'm taking my whole family again because I don't have to worry about my kid being shushed in the theater.I did give it an 8 because as an adult, the concepts are so simplistic that yes, you will get bored as an adult. However, if you bring your child you will love interacting with your child and following along with what's going on in the movie. Parents will get more out of it if they participate with their kids, ask their children questions about what they see on screen. If you're just going to sit there, it will be long.",

We brought our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter, and she really enjoyed it. It took her a little while to warm up to it, but by the end, she was dancing & clapping along with the show. Is it a great movie? Of course not, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be fun for the little ones.It was funny seeing people like Cloris Leachman and Christopher Lloyd in it....funny and a little sad. Would a 6 or 7 year old like it? Probably not... but great for preschoolers. It would have been even more fun for her if there would have been other people in the theater.",

From all of the movie I watched, this is one of the most terrible movies I ever seen. It has no villains or anything, unless if it's just to \"make the kids happy\" and bored.If there was a character I feel bad for the actor for playing as, it's Rosalie Rosebud (Toni Braxton). If I were her, I get rid of all of the roses if I'm so allergic to them.If I have a nickel for every time Jubilee say \"Like\" or \"Totally\", I'd be Scrooge McDuck.Zoozie suddenly knows all of the languages in the world, even animal language? I'm Hispanic from a Salvadoran family and I barely know Spanish. (y/n vibes)I feel like slamming my head onto the wall from watching this.Between you and me, J. Edgar is a simp... A simp for a mirror...And at the search for the last balloon, it's a little bit r@cist to Mexicans (not a snowflake, just pointing out) Wait, just realized it's a little r@cist, not very. My apologies. Wait it i- Nvm IDK It's probably because back then, they don't know what they wereI only watched this film to see if it's bad like everyone said it was, and they did. I wasted 1 hour and 4 something minutes of my life. I'm so glad I didn't go to watch this movie in 2012, cause then I'd wished for the world to actually end. But now I chose to watch it... F my life...And Toofie, get a belt...",

But however, there are at least some good stuff, the costumes were decent and the performing and voice acting was brilliant. The songs were so so, but the comedy was, meh. But I laughed quite a bit throughout the movie, like the gag were Toofie's pants fall down. And Ruffy is a pretty funny character. Overall, is this movie REALLY that bad? In my opinion, no. But that doesn't mean it's any good. I can agree that it's not the best movie, but it's obviously not the worst. I think this would be better as a TV show then a movie.",

The kids around me were having the time of their lives, that was very cute to watch. The energy in the theater was great. I loved the characters, especially Ruffy the Fish! I loved how he was always a bit grumpy, but usually ended up saving the day. Those lips are wild! I liked the combination of actors & characters. Jamie Presley was great! I say go see it & get ready to have some serious fun! Clearly some people have some strongly negative opinions about this movie....but it's meant for kids & families.

I have seen a lot of films with my kids\u2014I have always loved going to the movies\u2014and this is a CHILDREN'S film. I haveseen other films which have received better reviews and have been describedas \"witty\" or reaching an adult audience, but I never would have seen themunless my kids had wanted to go. People, children's films are first and foremostdesigned for CHILDREN. No sense in getting all upset about a children's film thatdoesn't appeal to your adult sensibilities, since that isn't the point.That said, we bought the movie to watch at home with our kids. We saw it atwalmart and our son was immediately drawn to the DVD's bright packaging. Theprice was nice, so we figured, why not?My kids liked it, but for me and my husband it was great seeing some of ourfavorite stars (new and old alike) in different roles. Obviously, Toni Braxtonwas there and looked beautiful. Jaime Pressly is also looking good. And seeingChristopher Lloyd (\"doc\" in Back to the Future) was a blast from the past!All in all, Oogieloves in the Great Balloon adventure is a fun, summer flick. Don'tread too much into it, just sit back and enjoy!",

Children have a logic all their own, and live in amagical world where something like this could really happen to them if only theylived in Lovely Loveville. Actually, on a personal note, when I was little I alwayswanted a surprise party myself, and helped plan many for friends (I did thiswhen was older than the suggested 8 years old for this film's audience) but noone ever made me one. So who knows? Maybe my kids will throw me one afterseeing this film (hint, hint!)",
