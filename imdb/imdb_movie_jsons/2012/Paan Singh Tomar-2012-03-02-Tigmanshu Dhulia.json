            "content": "I saw this in a theatre.\nThe acting in this film is the shinning point. Especially the main actor Irfaan khan made a great impression on my mind by his excellent acting skill. Irfaan excellently potrayed the emotion of a \"runner\" who is suffering from pain, frustration and exhaustion, but he is not giving up. The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart. The screenplay is brilliant. Being a biopic of an army guy/athlete who turned into a dacoit won't b a happy/fun movie. It's a very sad movie. But Irfann did manage to evoke some light moments by his sheer one liners n acting. Imagine an athlete who's very good in running has to run away from police. The direction was good n the cinematography was good capturing the harsh, dry, rural difficult terrain.",

            "review_title": "A great film by Tigmanshu Dhulia about an issue which needed to be told",
            "content": "India is probably one of the few countries in the world with various distinct cultures and their own history. In such a nation there were (and are) innumerous people whose life contains all ingredients for a nail-biting tales but sadly biopics are hardly explored in the country. Tigmanshu Dhulia showed guts to pen a script on one of unsung heroes of Indian sports Paan Singh Tomar and end result is a captivating cinema that explores many facets of our system. Paan Singh Tomar is an interesting journey of a loyal soldier and a brilliant athlete (infact a national pride) who transforms into a notorious \"dacoit\" thanks to the 'system\". In a flashback mode the movie deals on the drastic transformation of this loyal army-man into a notorious dacoit (Baaghi as referred by Paan Singh himself). In a linear and simple story PST tells about the plight of an athlete who had brought honours for his own country. Negligence of system is highlighted through his sad tale and the story revolves on framework after independence when seeds of corruption & anti establishment were germinating in full swing. In one sequence Paan Singh tells a journalist that how he was ignored by media when he won medal in steeple chase race in an international army sports meet but now when he was in the other side of the law playing hide-and-seek with the police the journalists are pouring down to get interviews. Another pain stacking sequence shows Paan Singh going to local police to lodge a complaint but he was humiliated by the inspector and even insulted the gold medal which he won for his own country. Tigmanshu dhulia' eye for detailing needs to be acknowledged. While writing the script Dhulia ensured that the audiences identify with the character and gets involved with the proceedings. The crowds were cheering in the initial reels when Paan Singh's potential as an athlete was displayed following which his cry for justice which was put down by the corrupt system. As the film reaches the climax the neglected scenario of athletes indeed touches the emotional chords of the audience. Dhulia's execution makes you think as you leave the theatre. In terms of technicalities Editing and Art department deserves mention. Dhulia's direction is complimented by Irfan Khan who played the role of Paan Singh Tomar with perfection. His nuances, dialogs, expression, body language speaks about a perfect army men. Brownie points should be given to him for his efforts to shape his body at this age and mould himself as the young energetic athlete. His dialogue delivery in the later reels reflected the strive within as he becomes a rebel with a cause. \"Bihad mein baghi hote hai, dacoit toh parliament mein bante hai\" \u2013 this dialogue will be remembered in from now on. A performance that deserves full marks and demands awards, this one is easily one of Irfan's career best performances. The supporting casts were appropriate in their roles. Mahie Gill as Tomar's wife gave a good performance again. Vipin Sharma was a treat to watch in role of Major Masand, a senior to Tomar and one who believed in his potential. Brijendra Kala is as usual dependable and brought a comic flavour as a journalist. With the current scenario of the nation movies like Paan Singh Tomar needs to be made and promoted which injects \"thoughts\" inside audience in an entertaining way. It's when the movie ends, and the names of four Indian national champions who died penniless are shown, \"Paan Singh Tomar\" hits the most. Indeed a fitting tribute to unsung heroes of Indian sports. This movie needs to be watched and pondered upon. Tigmanshu Dhulia : Take a bow.",

After watching a number of dumb movies released recently, Paan Singh Tomar is like a boon for every Indian movie fan. The director Tigmanshu Dhulia is successfully able to tell the biopic how a former national champion athlete is turned into a Dacoit in a cricket obsessed country.

            "content": "Paan Singh Tomar, national steeplechase champion, nephew of a Dacoit or \"Baaghi\" as Paan prefers to call it, an army soldier wants to be in army sports because they don't have restriction on eating food. The interesting plot builds on it and takes you to a whirlwind journey of his life, which tickles you, inspires you, and ultimately asks you some very uncomfortable questions.Tigmanshu Dhulia paints the canvas with natural but vivid emotions, he has surely pulled it off. All characters have color of their own, but Irrfan, has just delivered a performance which will make him stand in league of extraordinary men. He is convincing as middle aged dacoit, and it is pleasant surprise that he looks as convincing as young army soldier running on track in shorts, which his wife thinks he shouldn't wear as women stare at them.Mahie Gill has restricted territory but like in all her previous films, she has supported the scenes well. All other characters have just beautifully fallen in place. Director has not compromised with authenticity and has retained the language as spoken in the area where movie is set, don't worry English subtitles are there to help you out if you miss some of the dialogs.The romance between husband and wife has been handled with gentleness, with sequences such as the couple sends their children to buy \"lemon-choos\" so that they get some time alone. The movie could have been crispier and shorter n second half when plot moves to Chambal as Paan plans to exact his revenge. Director has sensibly not inserted any songs in the movie as they are not required at all, compliments to the team for this common sense. The background score, especially during races compliments the beautiful cinematography.Overall the movie is a treat to eyes and ears. A must watch ! Compliments to Tigmanshu as he just builds on the skill and craftsmanship he displayed in Haasil and Sahib Biwi aur Gulam. Dhulia leaves you with credits to forgotten heroes of sports who died penniless and without any recognition.",

Irrfan comes into his own, well immersed into his character...he takes the audience on a trip which brings out a range of emotions from patriotism, guru bhakti, helplessness and finally revenge. Though the language is thick Chamabl dialect but Irrfan bridges that gap with a masterful display forcing you to laugh, cry and feel his pain. Tigmanshu Dhulia is among the rare breed of bollywood directors along with Anurag Kashyap who have the knack of picking up great scripts and turning them out into movies which have the right mix of real acting and appeal to please both the masses and multiplex audience. The movie is a must watch...go out and enjoy the wonderful experience of watching the haunting Irrfan in action...bow your heads to the person who has grown from Salaam Bombay to Haasil to Maqbool.",

            "content": "Somewhere in the sandy and hilly terrains of the Chambal where a normal human being never wished to visit even in the nightmare there lies a Man - an athlete \u2013 a sports person from soul- And a Dacoit now whose winning run for the great nation called India went unnoticed due to crippled ,undemocratic, corrupt political and administration system and forced him to taken his own route for justice- A path which make which more noticed and more popular amongst the country's newspaper, radio and Parliament than winning his gold medals Indian National Games seven times in a row.The Movie opens up with a journalist who wants to interview the most terrible dacoit of the region Paan Singh Tomar and as the interview moves the story went into flashback. Paan Singh Tomar (Irrfan Khan) works in Army but his dietary supplement requirements moved him to the sport division of the army because there is no limit on diet in sports. Thou luckily his race talent got noticed by his senior to whom he delivered the ice cream at his home in just four minutes Unmelt. Soon he become National Champion in \"Indian National Games\" and later in \"International Military Games\" in 1967.But gradually his personal life takes over his Professional life, and the incidents after him changed the course of his life which tuned him from an athlete to a dacoit The movie touches some serious issues of the Indian sports and Indian sports persons. In a scene where Pan Singh participated in Asian Games at Tokyo , the organizer gave him new spike shoes which become the cause of his defeat because the athlete never practiced with those shoes earlier and sponsors want to show that India can afford spike shoes shows the level of training in the country even applicable today .In a second scene where the coach requested Pan singh to withdrew his name from 5000 mts race else coach's kin would have been lost that race shows again that the super sportsman you know may not be the best because the best was never given the chance. In a third scene where a villager was given bribe in terms of recruiting the villager's son in the Indian army again shows that all in the Indian military may not have joined the army to serve the nation but to serve their selfish motives. Fourth and very important the scene where the Paan Singh Tomar went to police station to file a FIR against his relatives who has grabbed his land unlawfully and beaten up his son helpless and was insulted and rejected shows the system's efficiency to tackle an issue which turns a common man into a rebel \u2013 A Dacoit Paan Singh Tomar also helps to think deepens into the political arena and government arrangements for the promotion of SPORTS not cricket because cricket is so over-hyped and overpaid that sponsors in the previous past has marketed it as a religion and few players as Demi- GODs that the other sports in India per say are lying on the stretcher waiting for the medicines of hope and support from the sponsors and government.Paan Singh Tomar may not celebrate the spirit of win like 'Chak de India' or \"Jo jeeta wohi sikandar\" But it does celebrates the spirit the True Sportsmanship and it does it perfectly & flawlessly-Kuods",

Apart from great cinematography, which really brought the Bhihad of MP alive, its the dialogues and the ease with which Irrfan Khan carries off the character which really makes the film work.But the single most appreciable fact about the film is that it considers the audience intelligent. The film in a way is an excellent way to understand what is wrong with India, without being preachy.Apart from the most obvious one i.e. How India treats its athletes, the film also sheds light on broader national issues. The scene when the village sarpanch (headman) who betrays Paan Singh is ratting out to the police is a grim reminder of how deeply entrenched the Caste system is in our country & the hypocrisy of the upper castes. Also, the whole film is an excellent critique of how outlaws are often a result of a corrupt and immoral society - nation, which could put into perspective a lot of our views on Naxalites. It's only rare that a film so honest and gritty comes out of Bollywood. For the amount of senseless cinema we produce, Paan Singn Tomar redeems Bollywood.The director Tigmanshu Dhulia goes many notches up with this film, and for me he has joined the ranks of Vishal Bhardwaj, Anurag Kashyap & Dibakar Banerjee for making good cinema",

I hand my hat to Tigmanshu Dhulia for crisp dialogues, subtle humor and bringing out the Chambal live to you. You can actually feel the grime and dust of the infamous land. Needless to say Irrfan Khan has delivered superlative performance. He has defined what is called as an 'Effortless Performance'. I hope that this movie brings him the most deserved laurels as he brought the same to the movie. 'Irrfan Khan is Pan Singh Tomar'. Period.",

The Rest of the cast also does a very good job in making this into a very well acted movie.The Director does a decent job in making this film into one of the sensible movies made in bollywood, and good job from him for giving Irfan a perfect role in the movie. The Story which is based on a true story about the same man, is great and shows how many extremely talented athletes in India are neglected by the government and how they can become notorious at times. Overall this movie is great due to mainly an excellent performance by Irfan Khan and a great story, to make this into one of the better movies of 2012 till now.My Rating: 7.8/10",

            "content": "I shall attempt to write a review about the movie. But I must confess that vocabulary needs to be reinvented for writing a review about such a movie. The word Brilliant, Cult will be an understatement.The story rips apart the callousness of our mediocre society and bares the ugly trust of being a sportsman in India.Paan Singh Tomar was a national record breaking sprinter who became a rebel. He had an illustrious career as a sportsman in the Army but the chores of his village life forced him to retire early to tend to his fields. The serene life of village proved to be more challenging than the task of defending his motherland. His own cousin brother who had now become a local muscle-man with the help of police took over Paan Singh's field without any remorse. Paan Singh tried every possible way to make our legal system attend to his woes but to no avail. Finally he resorted to his own personal strength to bring justice to the wrong doers. The story begins with a writer (Brijendra Kala) going for an interview with the Subedar (Irrfan Khan). Brijendra Kala has acted to perfection; it cannot get better than this! Most of the story is in flashback but it keeps you clutched to your seat. Story telling had never been better than this. Paan Singh aka Subedar, a rank which he got in the Army narrates his illustrious career as an athlete in the Army. However the career of a national sports hero does not translate into a successful place in the society as he struggles to keep his farm safe from his own cousin. Tomar who has been taught that Army men are guardians of the country believes that laws and system would protect his farm & family. His belief is shattered when the cops refuse to acknowledge his complaint even after his son is beaten to a pulp by the hands of his cousin. Later when his cousin attacks Tomar's house and kills his beloved mother Tomar sets on another race only this one will be in real life with guns, goons and cops. A quote from the movie, Paan Singh Tomar says \u2013 'In a race there are rules, rules which state that once you have started the race it doesn't matter if you are ahead of behind or how much time it takes you have to reach the finish line'.A must watch for all the sports lovers.",

How many such stories have we heard of. Having gone through what Paan goes through its really easy to understand and empathise with the character Paan especially since he picks up arms when all else fails. He approaches all the govt machinery disposable to him..the army , collector and the no good bribe taking , dishonest, lazy unscrupulous Indian police who instead of protecting the citizens instead loots and harasses them and don't we all know that. One wants to run in the opposite direction when one has to deal with police in India and that's the truth none can deny. Paan knows that the unlawful path will lead to his death but to live under such suppression was just not acceptable to him anymore. In my mind Had it been me, i would have taken that coaching job that being an Olympian offered along with cushy discounts at army canteen and a peaceful retirement life on army pension with family.But in my mind I also want to shoot these stupid police guys who tell me not to take the route to my own home at the Aarey Colony.

But then he was pushed. Pushed beyond his limits. And then he turned into a revolutionary, what we call a dacoit. The irony, that he got more recognition as a dacoit than a sports person representing his country in international events, never stopped to boggle him. Does it bother us though? Then, why hasn't the situation changed in the last 40- 50 years?Even now, the plight wouldn't have reached us if it were not for Irrfan Khan who plays Paan Singh Tomar. He completely bowls us over with his simplicity and then, frustrated aggression. Moreover, after Paan Singh turns into a dacoit rebel, the pride of a military personnel and a national-level sports person never leaves his eyes. He is very rooted in his cause and yet reminds you where his heart lies, time and again.Mahie Gill provides wonderful support by showing us why she is Paan Singh's vulnerability. And this must be that rare film when a character who plays a prominent part in the first half of the film disappears later and the disappearance seems justified. Paan Singh had to forgo his family life including his wife, after all.Paan Singh Tomar invokes your curiosity by exposing the rebel Paan Singh before telling us about how he was as a sports person. That created just the right amount intrigue because as the flashback progressed you wanted to know how this simple, straightforward person took to becoming a dacoit.Paan Singh's achievements as an athlete is shown in good detail and so is his transformation into a person who had to take the law in his hands. The part where he becomes feared and successful as a dacoit is sorely missing. And that according to me is the film's biggest letdown. The meek and largely submissive Paan Singh suddenly becomes a dreaded outlaw and we are asked to take that as a given.And despite this major gap in the writing, Paan Singh Tomar is commendable and recommended watch because of the issue it tries to address. If there is one thing about sports in our nation that needs dire attention, it is the condition of and apathy towards our non- cricketing sports people.Detailed Ratings (out of 5):Direction: 3.5 Story: 4 Lead Actors: 4 Character Artists: 3 Dialogues: 4 Screenplay: 3",

            "content": "Since having found the 1974 \"Curry Western\" Dacoit film Khhotte Sikkay to be pretty enjoyable,I became very intrigued,when I read a good amount of praise on the IMDb's Indian movie board about a recently realised movie which took a look at one of India's most successful athlete's:Paan Singh Tomar,who later became one of India's most infamous Dacoit's.The plot:1980:Getting information from his informants which could lead to him getting the biggest story of the year, a newspaper reporter rushes to get a relative of his, (who is also taking care of his young niece) to come along with him to the very outskirts in the city,in the hope of finding one of India's most famous Dacoit's:Paan Singh Tomar.Arriving to the location,the reporter is met by a group of men who claim to be members of Tomar's gang.Due to the group being unsure about how genuine he is,they decide to keep the niece and uncle as a \"safe guarantee\",and tell the reporter that he is the only one who they will allow to meet Tomar.Taking him to their hideaway based at a run down building,the reporter finally gets his chance to come face to face with Paan Singh Tomar.Tomar shows a strong dislike for the reporter,due to him deciding to get straight to the point and making his first question be :\"How did you become a Dacoit?\"Fearing that he is about to lose the scoop of the year,the reporter does a hasty back track,and instead decides to make his first question: \"When did you pick up a gun for the first time?\".Feeling that the report may actually be here for more than just a \"cheap thrill\",Tomar begins to tell him,how he went from being a 7 time Steeplechase champion surrounded by people whose tradition he deeply respected,to finding himself chewed up and spat out into a world filled with betrayers of any tradition,which lead to him deciding that the only one who could do the right thing and show that corruption did not decay everything around people:was himself.View on the film:For the handful of cars and motorbikes that appear in the film,director Tigmanshu Dhulia shows them right at the very edge of the frame,to give a strong feeling that they are about to drive off to a completely different era miles away from the movie.Despite the very best attempts from my DVD players to stop me from seeing this film, (the first player jammed at the half way point,and ended up constantly bringing up the sign \"No DVD in player\",whilst my spare DVD player would only play the film in black and white!) they were thankfully unable to stop Dhulia's tremendous directing from shining.With Dhulia choosing specific moments in Tomar's athletic career and Dacoit period to use a slow-mo effect to show Paan gaining the respect of his peers in the athletic ranks,to slowing down the moments when fatal shots are fired during a number of terrific,tense gun battles, (with a stand out one being a shoot out that Dhulia beautifully sets in the middle of a river) to show that the applause Tomar use to hear during his moments of glory,have now been replaced with the sound of people taking their final breath.Looking at the fantastic screenplay of the film, (which IMDb has weirdly not credited) Writers Dhulia and Sanjay Chauhan brilliantly take the traditional Wild West \"baddie\" role,and spin it into a new exciting direction.Using Paan Singh Tomar's (played by a great.focused Irrfan Khan) athletics training as a place filled with \"old guard\" traditional soldiers and police officers,who teach Tomar skills about concentrating and being determined,which would also be given to any lonely gunslinger,who finds themselves to be the only brave enough person to protect a town from being taken over.Getting away from the athletics,Dhulia and Chauhan use Tomar's family farmland being taken over by a ruthless gang,as the moment for when Tomar calls for the cavalry to arrive and save the day.Sadly for Tomar, Dhulia and Chauhan expertly show that the era when \"the cavalry\" and other figures who are meant to stand up and protect the \"common man's\" town from being over run with outlaws,and to also wear a badge of authority (such as a sheriffs badge) with honour,instead of seeing it as just a cheap piece of silver.Getting Tomar to see all of the corruptions and tragedy's happening around,the writers slowly show Tomar relies that he is the last person left,who strongly keeps to the tradition of knowing what good and evil is,which leads to him having to make an unimaginable decision of leaving \"the cavalry\" and everything he has valued for his whole life,to become the thing that he has hated most,in the hope of having the chance to do the right thing.",

            "content": "Beginning with a confession, I really felt both proud as well as ashamed after watching this honest well crafted film revealing the bitter truth of our Indian Social System through its powerful narrative.PROUD, because the film perfectly proves to be a true example of CINEMA made in the right manner for the overall benefit of the society. CINEMA, as per my understanding is a powerful medium of expression which basically needs to serve two main purposes. It has to entertain as well as enlighten its viewers about the various important issues prevailing in the system which need to be addressed urgently. To be precise, how many of us ever knew about this character called PAAN SINGH TOMAR who actually existed in our society a few decades ago? We all love Cricket so much, remembering all its record makers and breakers on our tips. But how many of us ever knew about this seven-time NATIONAL CHAMPION in steeplechase (obstacle) race, a born athlete who later had to pick up arms and became a hard-core WANTED rebel (not Dacoit) of Beeharh? The film enlightens us all about Paan Singh's sad life-story and thus fulfills its duty of being a \"True Cinematic Effort\" made by Tigmanshu, Irfan and the team. It also made me remember another proud product of our Indian Film Industry, BANDIT QUEEN directed by Shekhar Kapoor in 1994, which is till date considered to be a major benchmark in the history of Film-making in India. Interestingly, (as reported) director Tigmashu Dhulia worked with Shekhar in this project only in his early days.Before moving on to the acidic part of this write-up, I would like to say that as a movie, it's a gripping experience which works majorly in its first half with a pinch of comic moments too, added brilliantly in its screenplay. The second half expectedly talks about the transformation part which can also be considered as just another 'Vengeance Saga' by many critiques. Well supported by a spectacular cinematography, sharp editing and an award winning performance by Irfan Khan, it's a worth watching gem striking a difficult balance between the life of a sportsman and a rebel. Though as I felt, the background score could have been better but still it serves the purpose well while watching the film. But here instead of giving you a review, I would like to mention a few dialogues of the film, which should be enough to prove the precious value of this rare gem coming out of Bollywood after a long time.As the film starts off, Paan Singh informs his officer saying, \"Hamaar Mama Beeharh Ke Baaghi Thhey, Dacait Nahin\u0085..Aur Bahut Izzat Thi Unki Purey Ziley Mein!\"On being addressed as a Daku by the reporter in his interview, Paan Singh comes forward and says, \"'Beeharh Mein Baaghi Hotey Hain\u0085..Dacait Milte Hain Parliament Mein'.In the last meeting (after becoming a rebel) with his supportive Military Officer, the Officer leaves Paan Singh saying, \"Ab Main Tumse Kabhi Nahin Milunga Aur Yeh Hamari Aakhri Mulaqaat Hogi\"\u0085\u0085..but to this Paan Singh replies, \"Par Khabrein Milti Rahengi!\"And lastly, on hearing the radio, broadcasting the news of Paan Singh Tomar's search by the Police all over, he laughs in anger and says, \"Jab Desh Ke Liye Bhaaga, Tab Kisi Ne Nahin Poocha\u0085\u0085\u0085, Ab Beeharh Mein Bhaag Rahey Hain To Saaley Sab Naam Jap Rahey Hain!\"So, if the above few dialogues cannot convince you to watch PAAN SINGH TOMAR as soon as possible then I seriously don't know what else can.Now coming to the harsh part of this write-up, I felt ashamed after watching this flick due to more than one reason related to both Bollywood as well as the political social system we are living in.Taking up Bollywood first, it was really a shame that this well-made film was lying in cans, waiting to get released for more than one year for some undisclosed reasons. The word CINEMA is complete only if we keep on making films on diversified subjects related with its various genres. Otherwise it will be just like eating the same dish in dinner every day leading to boredom. So if films like PAAN SINGH TOMAR will continue finding difficulties in getting released then Who will like to make them in the near future?The next was the bigger shock which came in the end when they showed a whole list of names on the black screen, who were NATIONAL Champions in OLYMPICS and other games but had died eventually either due to lack of medical treatment or being penniless. Reading the list scrolling on the screen I asked to myself, \"Are these talented people, the NATIONAL TREASURES of the country only till the day they can perform on the field?Don't they remain the same NATIONAL TREASURES once they get retired? And Isn't this a NATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY of the Nation's Government to take care of all these gifted personalities after their retirement, till their last breath and give them a honorable farewell in the end?\".The same principle applies to every art form including the Film Industry, where we have recently seen veterans like A. K. Hangal in a sorry state asking for monetary help on the national news channels. So this is not a review of the film PAAN SINGH TOMAR but a humble tribute from my side along with Tigmanshu and Irfan Khan, for such blessed souls who were sadly not treated well by our own society. Paan Singh may have opted for a wrong or debatable path in order to fight for this own rights. But had the Government been there to take care of him in those difficult days, considering him as A NATIONAL TREASURE, we could have got a great COACH instead of a REBEL running in the Beeharh.",

            "content": "Paan Singh Tomar, based on a true story of an athlete-turned-rebel , was an encouraging , sit-up and make-you-think movie which ends on a sad note. An athlete(Irrfan Khan) joins the army to serve for the country but is encouraged to participate in distance running in international competition because of his great stamina, high energy and good running speed. Soon he brings laurels for his country after winning several gold medals and appreciation. But his success is short lived when he enters into fight with his relatives in his village over a land feud. Though , he wins the fight in village panchayat , he and his family are threatened for life. He goes back to army and even approaches police for help but his efforts goes in vain. Unfortunately , he had no options but to pick guns to protect his family which turns him into a dreaded dacoit. Paan Singh Tomar is directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia (Haasil , Sahib Bibi and Gangster). It takes a great effort to make a film of this stature. The director has not only handled the hard-hitting true story of a rebel but he has also portrayed the forgotten sportsman in an outstanding way. The screenplay is executed superbly along with some fantastic dialogues. Cinematography was eye-catching which captured the rough terrain of Chambal valley. There were couple of scenes which stands out particularly the sequence at the police station where Irrfan blast the cop for not following his duty diligently. On the flip side , I thought the race sequence could have been made more thrilling. But the brilliant performance by supremely talented actor compensates for it. Irrfan Khan plays the role of Paan Singh Tomar to T. He is just perfect fit for this role where he had to emotes the character of a sportsman and brilliantly turning into a rebel. He has done it all. Vipin Sharma was effective , Mahie Gill was good. So ,overall , a brilliant movie in all aspects. Watch out for the superlative performance of Irrfan Khan and splendid direction. But most importantly , the movie gives out a message to us \u2013 Have the government done justice to the Indian Sportsmen who have brought laurels and medals for our country ? Watch this flick \u0085 highly recommended : 4/5",

After getting retired, there is a dispute that sets against his family. Even a national asset is not supported by officials, this in turn makes him a dacoit. The story goes further, he and his associates kill several people for wealth, helping poor. Gradually he dies at the hands of police and story ends.A movie is now made for suffering national assets, an extra mark for that. Even the Olympic champions sometimes do not gain the deserving respect from officials (in the form of making a living at ease). Government must arrange for certain ways that this doesn't happen at least to people who are nation's pride. I personally did not like Irrfan's acting, a negative mark for that. Somebody who's more flexible physically, would have been well suited for the role. A movie worth a watch, because of the message it sends.Rating: 8.0/10",

It is worth a watch just for Irfan Khan.I have not heard of this man, till I knew of this movie, its good to know of such sportsman and sad to know the tragedy. The fate of the country is such that a national champion is forgotten but a dacoit is made news easily. This is an ironic story and is told really very well. Dialogues are written extremely well. The dialect is just great, It brings out rawness to character and a flavor of its own to the whole script. The cinematography is done well, and the director sure has an eye for detail the way he has shown a few things, like a steeplechase race, dacoit's backdrop and the feuds in villages. Mind you this is a biopic and has to be handled in way to tell a real life character, there is no much added drama, at few places, it might have fallen bland too of course life is not so very interesting all times either. But all are pu together effectively to bring out a story that has a heart. We may not be in favor of Paan Singh by the end for what he has done, but fir sure he shall live on in the minds long after the movie is over.Watch it for Dialect/Dialogues and yes for Irfan Khan who may be sweeping many best actor awards for reprising this role and living it in a way thats so tough to do in terms of controlling emotions and thus exhibiting them at rare times.Liked it and I recommend such biopics be watched to know India and its diversity in a better way too.

            "content": "A rural setting, horses, dacoits and guns or so was the popular Bollywood theme during the 70's and the 80's. With the typical good guys vs. bad theme, 'Sholay' ranks highest on recall. But, Tigmanshu Dhulia's 'Paan Singh Tomar' differs from the rest. It presents the other side of the story, a disturbing tale of a disciplined soldier and a national athlete who is dumped by the system and forced into a path of violence. While the makers don't call it an exact biopic, the film is reportedly based on the true story of the soldier turned rebel and that Dhulia heard about that story while working as a casting director on the sets of 'Bandit Queen' in Chambal. What follows is intense research, including interviews with Paan Singh's surviving family members.The tale begins with a journalist (Brijendra Kala) interviewing the Chambal valley's much feared 'baaghi' Paan Singh (Irrfan Khan) who reminisces his life. Cut to early post-independence era, Paan Singh is a young army recruit with a gluttonous appetite. Although disinterested in sports, he joins the sports division, the clincher being that there would be no restriction on food there. Soon, Paan Singh's talent as a runner is discovered by his coach who trains him for the 3000m steeplechase culminating in the protagonist becoming the national champion and record holder who represents India in the 1958 Asian Games and gold at the International defense athletics. Over time, he grows in rank and becomes a 'subedar'. Success apart, personal commitments lead him to early retirement and he also denies a coaching job for the services athletics team. But, fate has different plans for him as a family feud leads him to take up arms and turn into a rebel who operated near the borders of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during 1979-81. Since the story traverses through decades, from early post-independence days to early eighties, recreating the setting is a production nightmare. The director responds to it by restricting all scenes to village lanes, athletic stadiums and the rugged terrain of Chambal. The focus, nevertheless, remains on the lead character and never does the film lose itself in sub-plots or item songs, which is otherwise typical to this genre. Script and direction apart, what keeps the movie together are the gripping performances by the lead actors. Irrfan Khan is said to have trained with athletes and even nursed a sports injury, the results are visible on the screen as he looks the part. He is ably supported by Mahie Gill who plays his wife and Vipin Joshi, better known for playing the demanding dad in 'Taare Zameen Par' plays Major Masand.Befittingly, the film ends with a tribute to India's unsung athletic heroes who died penniless including one who sold his gold medal. Indirectly, the film critiques our country's poor sports administration and takes a massive dig at the lacunae in law enforcement which could turn a sportsman/ soldier into a criminal. It goes without saying that in our country, we hardly know any sport outside Cricket. I'm sure that before this movie released, most of us never cared to know what 'steeplechase' was. As an aftereffect of this movie, hope somebody wakes up and chooses to train talented sportsmen from interior parts of the country! As of now, the film is already successful. If you haven't seen it yet, make sure you watch it before it exits the big screen. Irrfan Khan makes it totally worthwhile!",

Paan Singh Tomar is based on the life of a national steeplechase champion who did not get the recognition that he deserved and eventually became a dacoit in order to have his name printed in newspapers.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which was based on the life of Milkha Singh, has borrowed some elements from this magnificent movie which has managed to restore my faith in this genre. Paan Singh Tomar is played by Irrfan Khan who gives a career-best performance which is quite impressive considering the number of notable movies he has made. He plays the character in a nuanced manner that incorporates the unique dialect from his native place in Madhya Pradesh. The dedication to his role is palpable as he transforms himself, both physically and mentally, to play someone who has a lot of anger inside him due to the apathy of the Army and the Indian Media for not giving him his due recognition.Paan Singh Tomar epitomizes the struggle of athletes in India to gain recognition despite endless hard work and complete apathy from the government. There are a lot of changes that must be implemented to ensure that these athletes get proper training and diet to give their best performance.This movie is one of the finest to have come out from Bollywood. The producers must be given credit to back such a film in which the protagonist was largely unknown to the masses. The film accurately depicts the lifestyle in villages and the authenticity is further escalated by the unique dialect that all the characters use.

The well done research and time proved the right ingredient for the cult classic. India has one good movie which deals with sports (exception of Chak De! India), which is highly unlikely in bollywood portrayals. The steeplechase race was another unlikely sport, but on silver screen the first half was marvelous. Dhulia and Irrfan right from Haasil was a good Jodi altogether. They both had their due finally. Right from being the assistant Director from Bandit Queen and the association with Shekar Kapur proved this movie worth of its salt. A word of mouth story melting with the glitterati of glamor world was significantly fantastic. Irrfan delivered its another best, totally involving in the character. The races and practice never looked superficial and had content till the depth. While irrfan transition from an Athlete to that of a dacoit in the middle ages man was brilliant. All credit goes to the actor himself. He is such a silk, crease-less.The screenplay by Dhulia was another remarkable feat reached to the zenith. The movie had its touch of emotions raking the nervous right till the end of credit roll. It will keep you glued to the fact of unjust poverty our athletes face. The raw and bitter facts were introduced and a subtle take on today's IPL and Cricket frenzy nation was very obvious. Did anyone know of Paan singh or the Steeplechase race sport ever? I bet !!The rustic approach as always of central and eastern India could not be better than this. The chambal valley was shown with villages had a sense of accomplishment. While the army barracks and story was very close to the real story. The steeplechase running sequence with a flashing editing was a stealer. You can notice the hand swirl before every jump. The expression and deep eyes of Paan singh was the keystroke of Irrfan captured very well. The story of dacoit and its ply was smooth and explained the unjust system of Indian politico. Even the caste system deeply rooted and supported by police and politics was well directed. Dhulia was excellent in portraying the small details of a subedaar's personal life and his love towards his lady. There was humor in all the movie. The end could have been no better. The chambal became steeple- chased for Paan Singh Tomar. Making the story out of interviewing Tomar's surviving family members and visiting his native village, Dhulia was really Intrigued about Tomar's largely forgotten several records is an achievement in itself. India and its apathy towards the Olympians are a food for thought. A powerful film made into a cult.",

For the uninitiated: the movie's dialogues are not in Hindi but in a very rustic UP language, which is the true USP of this masterpiece.Irrfan Khan has risen as an actor and how! I first saw him in Dhulia's debut - Haasil in 2003 and since then Irrfan has only bettered himself with each of his roles. Obviously some credit needs to go to Dhulia for extracting the best from him. Irrfan really gets into this character of Paan Singh and delivers stupendously. Some sequences are an absolute delight to watch, like when the reporter meets Paan Singh for the first time, and almost all the scenes between Paan Singh and his wife. Mahie Gill also delivers beautifully as the shy village girl.Not much has been written about Paan Singh and what he did for the country. The movie is an eye opener of some sort about unsung heroes of Indian sports. The disappointing part is, such heroes come to light through cinema only when they die or are converted to goons like in the case of Paan Singh Tomar! Nonetheless, an excellent piece of cinema. We want more such movies.",

            "content": "When you have a powerful script at hand, you do not need a 'SRK/SALMAN' to sell it ....Bollywood is back with one such script.The story is about Paan Singh Tomar. A national record breaking sprinter who became a rebel. He started his career in the military, was one of the best that there was. One fine day, he delivers an ice cream to a general in 4 minutes and we have an athlete in the making. He does a fine job at National level of sports. When he returns to his village, he tries to battle with the police to get his fields back from one of the villagers and all his attempts to do things the right way fail miserably. When one of his very own is hurt, he cannot control it any longer and decides to take the law in his hand. This marks the birth of a goon and we all know how their life ends.The dialog even in the dialect: \"When I ran for my country, hardly anyone knew me,but now that I am goon, I have become the talk of the town\" creates stirs throughout the movie.Mahie Gill hardly gets to act, but is OK in her parts. However the movie solely belongs to Irrfan Khan; from a soldier to an athlete and from a national champion to a goon, he is top notch. This actor deserves a standing ovation for this role. Tigamanshu Dhulia (after Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster) is emerging as one of the few under-rated and fine directors that Bollywood has (Vishal Bharadwaj, Anurag Kashyap).The movie does get a bit dull in parts and hence would not tag this as a 'masterpeice' but Tigmanshu surely leaves his mark with the film depicting the unsung heroes of Indian sports.",

He broke the national record, a feat that was unsurpassed for 10 years! A series of life changing events however forced Paan Singh to give up athletics, pick up the gun and become the scourge of the infamous Chambal Valley in Central India. Filled with deep emotions and fateful twists, Paan Singh Tomar is a gritty, no holds barred action-adventure set in the heart of India's gangland, Chambal.This is probably one of the best movies of Indian Cinema... tight script, great direction backed up by some fabulous acting by Irfan Khan.. he has to be one of the best actors of realistic cinema... through out the movie there isn't a single frame which looks unnecessary and a single scene which is boring.. it will keep you glued to your seats...i suggest its a must watch for fans of some good cinema...",

            "content": "Paan Singh Tomar is a good film, with some excellent moments and definitely worth a watch. Having said that, there are aspects of it that stop it from being considered in the exalted company of great cinema.For one, the editing is a choppy in bits, moving from one scene to another rather abruptly. The titular characters motivations after achieving his main objective as a 'Baaghi' was not sketched out with one having to wonder, why does he keep doing this, what is the end goal. He's shown in too much of a positive light, which is a stark contrast to his actions. Probably, those bits were left on the editing table to make the film compact, but given the other wonderful aspects of the movie, you do wish that it was included somehow to give the story a sense of completeness.Now coming to the good parts. Irrfan, excellent as always. The way he emotes through his eyes and body language is probably the best in the industry, if not one of the best in the world. You can feel Paan Singh's pain, anger, fleeting joys and viciousness radiating out of him, even in silence. Although, I did express qualms about the choppy editing and missing bits, the overall story is well paced and told, at no moment, lagging in pace. The side characters do a good enough job in sketchy parts, but the movie about Paan Singh Tomar, sticks completely around the central character throughout the duration, and with Irrfan playing it to such excellence, I doubt if anyone would complain.Overall, it is a good film, that could have been an excellent film but for a few minor blips. Given the usual fare of movies, this definitely rises above the crowd.",

            "content": "Some people make cinema to make money..some for hobby and some people are born to make cinema..I consider Tigmanshu undoubtedly falls in the last category. What he has made including this movie is the \"real\" cinema. As a matter of fact, this movie must be nominated for Oscars to show the real talent which exists in Indian cinema. Tigmanshu has taken a very bold step without worrying about the commercial equation for this movie which is dedicated to the sportsmen in India who were totally ignored even though they made India shine in International Sports. Each frame of this movie is worth watching for it's detail, dialogs, acting and expressions. Tigmanshu infuses life into every actor however small their role is..take for instant, Paan Singh's mother..she is probably a non-mainstream actor but she has acted so well for whatever scenes she was in. This is true for every actor who comes on the any frame. The police inspector, the rival relatives, coach, military officer..I mean, every character leaves a mark and does so effectively. Then, the age progression..there is such a clear demarcation between the young Paan singh and the middle aged Paan singh. The local dialect..oh boy, these actors must have gone through so much of training to speak the dialect so well and so naturally..Irrfan is an institution..even Acting should learn acting from him..This guy is the best actor India has today after Naseeruddin Shah..I am not talking about commercial cinema here people - talking about Real cinema. Irrfan fits to his character like a glove and he sticks to it throughout. I feel that when he is shooting, he just lives and breathes the same character on screen as well as off screen..He goes far beyond the expectations..Mahie Gill- what an amazing actress, you cannot believe she is the same girl who was in DevD or \"Not a Love Story\" or \"Saheb Biwi aur Gangster\". She has portrayed very nicely and deserves top honors for her work. Don't listen to me now and watch this movie to make your own opinion. Truly brilliant.",

            "content": "Paan Singh Tomar on being termed a dacoit by a nervous journalist 'Beehad main baghi hote hain, dacoit milte hain parliament men\". The moment I heard the above dialog in the trailers, I knew Paan Singh Tomar will definitely strike a chord with the audience, given the clouds of corruption shrouding the Indian landscape. In fact, PST is more than your usual story of a common man standing up against the system. The flick on the whole showcases the travails and twists and turns in the life of the notorious outlaw, Paan Singh Tomar who from ruling the roost in the Indian athletic scene goes onto become a feared Chambal Valley dacoit .The famed Dhulia Irrfan duo, from its \"Haasil\" days is known to deliver some cinematic masterpieces and boy do they take it another level with Paan Singh Tomar. Irrfan has been Bollywood's torch bearer of sorts in Hollywood in recent times and with his turn as the famed but now forgotten dacoit, Paan Singh Tomar, he has just proved why he is one step ahead of his contemporaries. In PST he effortlessly adorns the gear of a frail athlete who to begin with, gets on the race track just for that extra dose of food. The first half shows PST's rise to an all-conquering athlete who can do no wrong as he represents India in the Asian games in Tokyo as the Steeple chase national champion. We see an inspiring sequence of events as Tomar rises to the pinnacle of success from his humble beginnings in the dusty terrains of Morena. Coupled with rib tickling dialogs and the well-orchestrated track and field scenes, the first half of Paan Singh Tomar makes you sit up and take notice of a talent that once scorched the Indian athletic scene. Smartly edited and mixed with the right amount of emotions and humor, the first half whizzes away just like a whiff of pleasant air. Then in a dramatic turn of events Tomar has to leave the glory of the track behind and return to his native place as his pestering cousins get him involved in a feud over a small piece of land. Shunned and ridiculed by the local police and at the nadir of his life, Tomar decides to take law in his own hands as his cousins launch a vehement attack on his family owing to the feud mentioned earlier. Dhulia effectively puts forth and underlines the failure of the state to not only maintain law and order but also the plight of sports persons who are treated like specks of dirt in this country . PST's tumultuous transition from a proud army man who once considered a brick of ice cream as his greatest honor into a revenge seeking and conniving outlaw is complete as he utters\" No one gave a damn about me when I won medals for the country. Today when I'm a rebel everyone wants to know about Paan Singh Tomar\" with a sense of irony and sums up the apathy of a person who has been failed by the very system that he trusted and cherished .In subsequent scenes, true to the celebrated and legendary style of robin hood he becomes the b\u00eate noire of the rich whilst being celebrated by the poor, by not only escaping the clutches of law every now and then but also by making mockery of the police and ridiculing them into meek surrender. Not only does he gain revenge on his cousins but he also achieves a cult status of a dacoit at the top his trade, meticulously deploying his military training and techniques (an example being the famed \"scout formation\") and in the process instilling discipline in his pack as the world falls to his feet. What prevents the film from reaching insurmountable dizzying heights , is that the flick tends to drag a bit towards the end and is a bit too lengthy as it reaches its climax. There are moments in the second \"revenge\" half where one yearns for the slickness and the pace of the first half. Otherwise, Irrfan delivers a rock solid and one of the best performances by an actor is recent times. His honest and heartfelt performance as Paan Singh, both the athlete and the renegade, combined with his command over the local dialect and his rustic demeanor is really commendable as he portrays a challenging role with aplomb and is well truly the high point and USP of the film. Mahie Gill, Dhulia's muse these days, has a small role but she excels in it, true to her burgeoning reputation .The rest of the cast blend perfectly into the demands and vision of the director to firmly put a stamp on the veracity and class of this masterpiece of a movie. Paan Singh Tomar to sum up isn't one of your run of the mill biographies flooding the \"biography\" genre these days, but a fitting tribute to a common man who stood firm against all odds to uphold the pride of his country and ultimately his family.",

I hand my hat to Tigmanshu Dhulia for crisp dialogues, subtle humor and bringing out the Chambal live to you. You can actually feel the grime and dust of the infamous land. Needless to say Irrfan Khan has delivered superlative performance. He has defined what is called as an 'Effortless Performance'.

But the bigger message is \"\"Are we remunerating sport icons enough of what they deserve, after the laurels they bring to our country with scarce facilities?\"Irfan Khan has given a stellar performance in the title role of Paan Singh Tomar. His ever protruding eyes have done most of the acting. You could feel the emotions during certain scenes viz. when he went to meet his his coach Major Randhawa portrayed by Rajender Gupta after giving the newspaper interview & when he annoyed over Indian society which doesn't bother when you win medals for your country but lauds when you trick the police of 3 states.Mahie Gill, Rajender Gupta, Vipin Sharma have given an able support to Irfan. What binds you to the mood & tone of the movie is the excellent cinematography while capturing the era of 60s & 70s.Also the dialect & diction of Madhya Pradesh just keeps you connected to the characters.The soul piercing performances of the actors, excellent cinematography, tight & crisp plot, memorable dialogues especially \"Kaho Haan\" are just the perfect ingredients for a movie.Overall a 9/10 movie.

The transformation is so pure and natural that we all ended up feeling I would have done the same in the situation. That's the strength of the story and the character.The movie goes on at an amazing pace without a dull moment, the one liners are so witty that even while empathizing with the situation you can put a curve on your lips, and the entire supporting cast just gels around the story as if its their story too.

Right from the location, the sets, the costumes, the lingo, the performances is perfect. The performance of the lead actor, Irrfan Khan is award winning. He has (once again) proved that he an actor par excellence. The narration of the movie is done at a speed which is just perfect. Once you see this movie, it leaves you sad for the great Indian athletes who have to struggle in pathetic conditions. They have to face politics and favoritism at every step of the way. And most of all, they receive no appreciation or recognition from the society. Like the character said in the movie, when he won gold medals for the country no one recognized him and now that he is a Chambal Valley dacoit, the whole nation knows him. Very sad indeed. I wont reveal any story details, I leave it to you to go and watch this movie. 10/10.",

That that never could have been is grub for challenges forsaken in the interest of undoing undone to keep challenges alive in their wake. While the story of a famed athlete finding his calling in black might seem exotic thematization of a non-prevalent zeitgeist, its tenability as fallout of subjectivity in a License Raj is contemporizing licenses as licenses engendered in licenses whether you like it, or not!",

This man seems to hit it out of the park again and again, consistently blowing the expectations of Indian Audiences to smithereens. This movie is carried on the broad shoulders of Irrfan, who like Ken Watanabe has become face of his country in Hollywood -- and very deserving. This movie is made as well as it could have been made. It deserved to go to the Oscars, but the naive Indian Film authority has chosen a far inferior film called Barfi to represent India at Oscars. It is my Opinion that Indian films can never grow if every year only a big star is given Best Actor Award. If you are a big star, and you had a moderately good performance, then boom, you win the best actor for the year. I hated how Ranbir Kapoor chosen as best actor over Irrfan Khan....In Bollywood,stardom and parental influence reigns.The movie is about an athlete, who represents India at National and International levels and win many medals and honors for the country. This disinterested sportsman slowly unravels in him a streak of immeasurable success consistently over the period of 15 years. When he retires, he falls into the dark world of Indian corruption and police, when his relative grabs his piece of land and police just wouldn't help him. In times of desperateness, Paan Singh Tomar takes up a gun to fight for his own. And the rest of the story is about what steps he takes to win over his land and take over those who oppose him. It might seem like Art Film, but believe me, this Film is TOTAL FUN. Never a dull moment, never a clich\u00e9d scene, and not one useless dialogue. This film is a triumph.",

Other sports in the past were not given much attention, such as steeplechase running in this case. This is the story of one of the best steeplechase runners in India who became a dacoit due to circumstances in his life. Paan Singh Tomar is an army officer who joins the athletics division as his performance wows his army seniors. Soon he becomes a steeplechase runner for India and achieves national stardom. Soon he is involved in a dispute in his village which eventually leads him to become a dacoit. Tomar went from a national level athlete to a dacoit. His transition and his life as a dacoit form the rest of the story. Tigmanshu Dhulia directs, in my opinion, a soon to be cult classic that tells the true story of one of India's forgotten athletes. The story is well written and as a result, the acting is flawless. Irrfan Khan is exceptional as Paan Singh Tomar as he plays the performance with ease. His transition from an army officer to an athlete to a dacoit make it all believable. As a result of his acting, he won the National Award for Best Actor for films released in 2012. In the end of the day, I truly recommend this movie to film goers out there, whether you like sports or not. It is a film no one should skip out on.",

            "content": "To begin with I am a big fan of Irrfan as well as Tigmanshu, hence I may sound bit partial. They have come together after so many years to bring forth such a riveting story. This movie is way ahead of their last movies i.e. Haasil and Charas in all aspects.Movie starts with a reporter who puts his life in danger to interview a dreaded outlaw Paan Singh Tomar(Irrfan Khan), aka Subedar. The nervousness and fumbling dialogues by the reporter adds humor in a very subtle way. Paan Singh takes him through his past and provides answer to each and every question that reporter has with him, to that matter the questions which as an audience we have in our minds. First half takes you through the life of young Paan Singh Tomar who can run and run faster than anybody else. He is a jawan in Indian army and has a great appetite for food. He tries to join army sports team only because there are no restrictions on intake of food. First half also takes you through the lighter side of Paan Singh where he interacts with his wife, played by Mahi Gill. There is a feel of innocence and romance in the way those scenes are picturised. Alongside all these, a story is also built in parallel providing the reason why Paan Singh changed his life path from being an athlete to an outlaw. The second half is all about his rise and fall; it shows how Paan Singh builds a big gang and takes revenge. How he puts together his army expertise to train his gang for dire situations. Finally getting betrayed by one of his gang member and being killed.Irrfan Khan shows in this movie that how much underrated he is in Bollywood and what he is capable of. He effortlessly portrayed all the emotions that Paan Singh went through, be it love, anxiety, happiness, innocence to rejection, frustration, betrayal and hatred. This movie completely belongs to him and the director. Tigmanshu as director has completely understood Paan Singh's character as well as Irrfan's as an actor; hence he was able to strike an awesome equation between them. The dialogues of this movie are majorly Bundelkhandi but at the same time are very humorous as well as realistic.In totality it is an awesome movie and this type of stories should be told more often. Once the movie ends you will be forced to think whether the athletes in India are treated fairly or it is only cricket which people as well as our government take seriously.",

The exciting scenes get lost in the mass.\nAfter watching this, I didn't feel good or excited or sad. The main character's life seems to be a nonsense, a wastage.Overall:\nIt's nice they produced a movie about this historical drama in India. It gives an idea about how things were going on back then. But it ends flat and I was expecting more thrills from all this twisted story.",

Apart from great cinematography, which really brought the Bhihad of MP alive, its the dialogues and the ease with which Irrfan Khan carries off the character which really makes the film work.It's only rare that a film so honest and gritty comes out of Bollywood. For the amount of senseless cinema we produce, Paan Singn Tomar redeems Bollywood.Paan Singh's achievements as an athlete is shown in good detail and so is his transformation into a person who had to take the law in his hands. The part where he becomes feared and successful as a dacoit is sorely missing. And that according to me is the film's biggest letdown. The meek and largely submissive Paan Singh suddenly becomes a dreaded outlaw and we are asked to take that as a given.",

            "content": "#MAR\nActivity no:-24(d)A Bollywood screenwriter might blush to come up with the story of a national champion runner who becomes more famous as an outlaw. But Tigmanshu Dhulia's uneven, absorbing Hindi film \"Paan Singh Tomar,\" based on real events, falls into the category of truth is stranger than cinema.Paan Singh Tomar (Irrfan Khan) comes from the Chambal Valley (south of Delhi), a stronghold of professional bandits, or dacoits. (Dacoits, he says - and the film seems to agree - are what you find in Parliament; rebels are what Chambal breeds.) He joins the army, where his running talent is discovered. A champion, he quits to return to his village, where a land struggle has turned bloody. When the corrupt police and corrupt government won't help settle the matter, Paan Singh picks up a gun and embarks on a life outside the law.The film's first half has some of a sports movie's excitement, made more interesting by its details and milieu: India, the army, the competitions abroad. (Given his first pair of spiked running shoes right before a race in Tokyo, he pulls them off midway through and finishes barefoot.) The second half, following his outlaw career, may seem more familiar; it plays like a western (and looks like \"Sholay\"), with Paan Singh and his gang operating from the rocky countryside.Both halves are elevated by Mr. Khan. Without romanticizing Paan Singh, he shows his basic honesty and gives him real depth. As an actor Mr. Khan rarely does the expected. You can't take your eyes off him.",

He was a seven times national steeplechase champion during the 1950s.As a subedar with the Bengal Engineers at Roorkee, he represented India in the 1958 Asian Games. His record in the 3,000 m steeplechase stood for almost a decade. According to Joginder Singh Saini, former chief national coach, at 6 feet high, Paan Singh Tomar could cross water jump in a single movement, whereas other athletes stepped on the obstacle to regain balance and add momentum. Paan touched his athletic peak during the four-year period between 1958 to 1961. He won consecutive national titles, eventually taking the place in the national team. In the village where he was born there was a land dispute between Paan Singh and his relatives. He turned to banditry and soon became notorious. He had a reward of 10,000 rupees to his head. Paan Singh was killed in police ambush in 1981.Movie : Directed under Tigmanshu Dhuli ,staring Irfan Khan stayed true to the facts and become successful in creating a good movie you don't watch to miss .First half : the movie start in real good pace ( with little glimpse of Tom Hank's 1994 Forrest grump). It focus on the athletic carrier of Pan Singh Tomar . Tomar is a happy guy love his wife in his own way and his country.Second Half : Acc. to me movie gets slow. I was expecting more some action and funny scene while the training of bandits. it should come in the movie after the first close encounter of Tomar's gang with the police ,when some of them died and get injured .This would gave Tomar a stronger motivation of \" Why bandits need to be fit too\" ?? IN THE END :Movie focused on the small things in very amusing way .Like Tomar's fond of food and ice-creams . Thinking of national coaches back in 1960's who Wanted medals with limited sources given to athletes at home . How he learned from his passion to run . Life is like a race you don't look back and never forfeit till the end. Most of the characters were naive but had a proper accent and looked convincing in their respective roles . Pan Singh Tomar is a sad story of a sports personal who died because of all the wrong decisions.",
