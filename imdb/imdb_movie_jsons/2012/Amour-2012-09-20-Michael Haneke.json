            "content": "I thought I was going to be deeply affected by \"Amour,\" based on my experience with Michael Haneke's \"The White Ribbon\" and the film's premise. My wife and I just recently watched her father degenerate physically and mentally over the last few years until his recent death, so the closeness to me of the subject matter combined with Haneke's uncompromising approach to filmmaking made me feel sure that I would be deeply disturbed by his film.And while I was watching it, I felt like I should be feeling that way, but never really did. It's by any definition a formidable piece of filmmaking, but it left me cold. The events depicted in the film count among my worst nightmares and are even more terrifying for the significant likelihood that I will have to experience them in some fashion. But I never forgot that I was watching actors performing in a movie. There's something about Haneke's style that's cold and clinical, and the same quality that can make his movies deeply disturbing can also make them inaccessible.To be honest, I'm kind of glad Haneke's style kept me at an emotional distance from the film, because I think it might otherwise have been unendurable.Grade: A-",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Amour",
            "content": "If I had watched this film no less than 5 years ago, I'd probably wouldn't think too much about Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or winning Amour, which made him one of an elite group of filmmakers who had won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival at least twice (and within a span of three years too). But I suppose having to live through some of life's experiences, both pleasant and those that are not, would have opened up one's horizons, connect and identify with the many elements about terminal illness and suffering, love and the quality of life, being affected in more ways that I would have normally allowed.As in most of the Austrian filmmaker's movies, this film centers around the characters of Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva), an elderly couple whom we see are enjoying the twilight of their lives, and their companionship with each other, since daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) is away overseas most of the time. Unfortunately Anne suffers a stroke and more, rendering her paralyzed on one side, gradually relying on the primary care provided by Georges to get through day by day. And given Georges' age, being primary caregiver is also something of a challenge, and a stress both mentally and physically, having made a vow to Anne that he is adamant in keeping, of having no further hospital visits, or to put her in a home.The many things that Haneke had put into his film are the hard truths revolving around the dedicated attention given to the patient, from things like feeding and the changing of diapers, doing the household chores which include enlisting the help of others in grocery shopping, to hardware requirements like the commode or the adjustable bed. There may be a certain level of shyness involved during cleaning up, and in every step of the way you want to maintain the dignity of the patient, because the last thing you want to do is to have a drop of morale. The deterioration is painful to witness, as Eva goes from having strength to being completely bedridden, with the ability of communication, a very key thing, taken away when speech impairment rears its ugly head, when therapy can only do so much. Haneke doesn't gloss over the necessary aspects of suffering, even if under the hands of uncaring home nurses, and probably introduced a little tinge of fear as one grows old, gets sick, and get put under the mercy of others.Georges gets the periodic visits from his daughter, but you can almost feel a distant rift between the two each time they try to sit down and communicate. What Haneke's story and screenplay brilliantly achieved is to be able to say so much without saying much at all, directing the actors to bring out ideas and back-channel communication through their acting craft, making it a very fulfilling experience watching, and dissecting the human relations and condition in each of the characters, even when Eva had to spend most of her time in bed, and portraying the limited range of emotions a stroke patient can muscle together. Perhaps I too felt some guilt each time Eva returns home to check on the latest status of her mom and dad, as it mirrors how I would have loved to be able to do more, if not for modern day commitments, or what we would like to think of as commitments.Being a Haneke film, we'd come to know some darker moments to sort of jump through when we least expected, especially so when the title is one as benign as Love in its many forms. While what was shocking wasn't something narratively new in films done by others, it still made one heck of an impact, lingering for some time which I thought was quite wicked, leaving things rich and open to post-screening debate. Haneke makes you work to come up with your interpretation of events, never telling you verbose details unnecessary to spoonfeed, preferring that you experience and take away something from it, though this was perhaps one of his less obtuse works.What made this film was also the performances of Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, who hardly put in a wrong foot. Trintignant returns to the big screen after an absence of 7 years, with a role specifically written for him, which he duly delivered. His Georges came across as heartbroken and exasperated rolled into one. Emmanuelle Riva may seem to have gotten the easier role having to be in bed, and sometimes absent for the most parts as Georges keeps her Anne locked away, but credit to her fine acting without having the need to over-act or over-compensate for the condition she has to flesh out. The make up department also deserves mention for being able to realistically age her on screen as well.Amour continues in its winning of the minds of various critics and chalking up awards in the festival circuit, as well as year end accolades. It should be interesting if it does culminate in walking away with the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar statuette next year. Recommended!",

            "content": "The retired piano players and teachers Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) live in a comfortable apartment in Paris. Their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) is a musician in tour through Europe. One day, Anne has a stroke that paralyzes her right side, and Georges nurses his wife and promises that he will send her neither to a hospital nor to a nursing home. Soon Anne's life deteriorates and her mental and physical capabilities decline very fast leading Georges to take a tragic decision. \"Amour\" is a depressing movie about the end of a journey of a retired couple of about eighty and something years old. \"Amour\" has impressive performances of Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant and is developed in very slow pace, almost theatrically, and is sad to see the elder wife losing her dignity due to her physical and mental problems. I recall Emmanuelle Riva very young in movies like \"Hiroshima, mon amour\" or \"L\u00e9on Morin, pr\u00eatre\" and Jean-Louis Trintignant in the unforgettable \"Un homme et une femme\" or \"Et Dieu... cr\u00e9a la femme\" and seeing them now seniors make me think how short life is and made me sad. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Amor\" (\"Love\")",

            "content": "What introduction could this film possibly require? Any film enthusiast recognises the name of Haneke instantly, whatever their opinion of him. His latest film, Amour, finally arrives in the UK this week, having won the Palme D'Or at Cannes (Haneke's second in a row) and the appraisal of most of the cinematic world. Horrible feelings accompanied me into the Friday screening of Amour \u2013 would the film live up to the hype, could Haneke really better his recent works, Hidden and The White Ribbon?I realized about a quarter of the way into Amour that this was the wrong way to think about it. Haneke is renowned for his chilly, detached style and merciless lack of sentimentality in exploring the darker sides of human nature. Although his ruthless devotion to all things challenging and unsentimental is still evident in Amour, we must at least recognise that this represents some kind of turning point in Haneke's oeuvre. Georges and Anne have been married many years, and have grown old together. They are both piano teachers, now retired. When we first meet them, they are attending a concert of one of Anne's old students, now grown and making a name for himself. They applaud, congratulate him and then take the bus home, smiling and talking to one another in snippets as they come closer to their apartment. If it hadn't been for a masterful, disquieting opening sequence (which I will not describe here), we would not suspect anything was wrong. Yet after this wonderful outing, which they have obviously been looking forward to for a long time, their spacious Parisian apartment will become their entire world; we shall never leave it. There is a brief moment, masterfully shot, where the couple's adult daughter (in a beautiful performance from Isabelle Huppert, who played the self-harming protagonist in Haneke's formidable film, 'The Piano Teacher') stands by the window, and through the translucent material of the curtain we see the street outside and the vehicles moving slowly along it; the outside world remains completely impervious to the painful ordeal which is taking place on the other side of that curtain. The ordeal begins one morning over the couple's breakfast. The two are having a conversation. Georges tells Anne something, and she suddenly becomes unresponsive. She snaps out of it, and she insists she has no memory of it; yet we sense in Anne, as Georges tells her about this strange event, a fear of something starting within her, of doctors and hospitals; there is even, glimpsed on her face for the briefest of moments, suspicion directed at her husband. It is the first event in a downward spiral, and from the moment Anne returns from the hospital afterwards, and a farce of a funeral that George is forced to attend alone, both will be condemned to this apartment. Anne begs Georges never to take her back to the hospital; thus, it becomes a prison and mausoleum; the sense of oncoming death pervades the coldly lit rooms.Georges and Anne are played magnificently by those acting gods of yesteryear, Jean-Louis Trintignant (star of Bertolucci's masterpiece, The Conformist) and Emmanuelle Riva (the female protagonist of Resnais' Hiroshima Mon Amour). Hand-picked by Haneke himself, these two bring a lifetime of experience to their roles; their performances are breathtaking. Riva in particular, whose character loses her independence and her own sense of dignity increasingly throughout the film, is magnificent, not afraid of baring all to the camera. Anne's condition is not the ersatz tragedy, infused with humour and considerable taste, that Hollywood would have us believe; it is ugly, painful, degrading. The claustrophobia of their lives, increasingly shut off from the rest of the world, is intense. Characters (including the couple's own daughter, selfish on the surface but nursing deep hurts) will come in and penetrate temporarily the organic, defensive webbing that Georges and Anne are now forming for themselves, but both the guest and the host feel that the couple's lives are being intruded upon. Theirs is a holistic, private world that outsiders try to break into; there is a great piece of symbolism, early on in the film, after Georges and Anne return from the concert, where they discover that someone has tried to break into their apartment. This couple, in the face of oncoming tragedy, hide within themselves and within this space, their own, where they have spent so many years and built their lives together. I believe this to be the best film Haneke has ever made. Yes, it is gruellingly unsentimental, but unlike all of his other films, there is warmth, tenderness and genuine humanity to be found here. We are greeted by two highly intelligent people, who have been and remain deeply in love, and we are challenged now \u2013 not to watch the beginning of this relationship, but its end. Georges and Anne are not perfect human beings; they become frustrated, even angry. The wounds that each can inflict on the other, knowing each other inside out, hit the audience like a punch to the gut. It is part of the searing authenticity of the film, and that makes the more tender moments even more special. Amour is a film about the disappearance of a human being; of what one man does in the face of losing the woman he has loved his whole life, every day, little by little. It is a psychological drama, tinged with philosophy and moments of exquisite, heartbreaking poetry. But it is also a luminous love story \u2013 one that is genuine and recognisable, between two characters that we fully believe in and sympathise with. Georges and Anne have spent many long, happy years together, and now, slowly and sadly, their happiness is coming to an end",

We see Mrs Laurent transforming from the graceful lady to a person completely unrecognisable at the end. The husband loves her and cares for her patiently and demanding nothing in return. It is the ultimate love that people long for. The performances of them are superb, especially Mrs Laurent. I was so surprised and impressed that she could even play lower facial nerve palsy (speaking only with one side of the mouth).It is a superb film, with amazing performances and an unnerving story. However, I could not get into the film. Maybe it is because of the barren nature of the film. The minimalistic nature of the sets and soundtracks echoes the fading of Mrs Laurent. Or maybe it is just too raw and too threatening to think that this could be our future, that my unconscious mind rejects the content of the film.",

            "content": "Amour (2012) is a French film written and directed by Michael Haneke.This powerful drama is basically a two-person film. Emmanuelle Riva plays Anne, a retired piano teacher, and Jean-Louis Trintignant is Georges, her husband. This elderly couple are still healthy, independent, and financially secure. When one of them becomes sick, it sets off a chain of events that is grim, realistic, and disturbing for us to watch. The film is basically a two-character tour de force. Riva and Trintignant are on the screen in almost every scene. Other characters enter and leave the apartment from time to time, but the movie revolves around the two leads. Both of them act so well that after a while you forget they're acting.Incidentally, Isabelle Huppert, in a supporting role, plays Eva, their grown daughter. She's also a fine actor, but the film belongs to Riva and Trintignant.We left the theater with the realization that we had witnessed a truly great film. However, I have to admit that we were shaken by the harsh and sad reality that was portrayed.So, if you admire great cinema, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a lighthearted romp about aging, choose a different film.P.S. Amour actually starts in media res. It's important to see the pre-credit beginning of the movie. Be sure to arrive early so you don't miss that scene.",

            "content": "There's a scene in Michael Haneke's latest film (the winner of this year's Palme d'Or, AMOUR) in which one of the main characters talks about a film he saw long time ago. The main characters are an elderly married couple: (the music teachers) Georges and Eve (Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, respectively). So Georges is telling Eve about a film that left him a big impression \u2013 now he can't really recall the film itself (name, its story and stuff) but only the huge emotion he felt with it not only while watching it but also while later telling someone about it. AMOUR is a film about that emotion. If Jean-Louis Trintignant's character can only remember now, as an elderly man, what that film made him feel, then Haneke only wants that you (and his characters) feel something. AMOUR ain't a film with a big, intriguing story. In fact, it opens with the conclusion of the whole thing, which is certainly about that mentioned married couple \u2013 there's nothing much going on, besides some music concerts, until Even begins to show serious health problems (she suffers a stroke actually and soon of paralysis). Obviously we know that there won't be much hope for her.I don't think none of these are spoilers, hell, you already guessed the conclusion to the story of Eve. Like I said, Haneke decided to go a bit non-linear with the very first shot of the film \u2013 he's telling the audience something like \"yes, she dies, I'm not going to give you any hope and I just want you to feel something\". And it's really impossible not to; certainly the main performers are the principals responsible for that. If anything, Emmanuelle Riva gives one of the very best performances of the year (perhaps the best). It's a daring work that shows her huge dedication and commitment. Think in the following words that, at least according to IMDb, the Mexican director Carlos Reygadas (POST TENEBRAS LUX) said when asked about the nudity in his film BATALLA EN EL CIELO (2005): \"We are all naked when we go to the shower. At least twice or three times a day we are naked. And most of us have sex, once a week or more. It's a thing that occurs often. But it's not represented ever on film. So the normal thing to do would be to ask every other director why they don't have sex in their film and not ask me about it. I am the only normal one\".In AMOUR we deal with the whole process of a terminal illness: the preoccupation, the desires of the patient, the care giving, the desperation and well, just day-to-day issues. And Haneke is just as normal as Reygadas; therefore if you think he is not going to show a day-to-day activity like taking a shower in its pure form, well, you better think again. This is part of the reason to say Emmanuelle Riva did such a great, daring work. Not many people are interested in watching the latest film about a terminal illness. That theme alone makes for a very difficult experience, certainly, and well, this one is even more than the average; it's almost a horror film, with truly terrifying, thought-provoking material. It left me shocked even when, like I said, you know everything right from the very beginning. You better find out why! *Watched it on 14 November, 2012",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. I have often defined an entertainer as one who delivers what the audience wants, while an artist creates what he must. Writer/director Michael Haneke strikes me as a true artist in cinema. And an exceptional one at that. Known for such unusual films as The White Ribbon, Cache', and the original Funny Games (1997), Haneke often has a way of showing us things about ourselves that we prefer not to see.Amour means love, and this film could easily have been titled Love and Misery, as strong and indescribable feelings mount when a life partner begins the inevitable slide downhill ... a trip which often starts with something as bland as a few moments of blankness at the breakfast table.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant, A Man and A Woman) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva, Hiroshima Mon Amour) somehow draw our eye as they sit in the audience as seen from the stage of a soon-to-begin piano concerto. It's a thought provoking shot when paired with the familiar quip \"All the world's a stage ...\". Next we see this octogenarian couple chatting over breakfast, clearly comfortable with each other in the manner that only two people who have shared decades together can become.A trip to the hospital confirms Anne has had a stroke. And then another. The rest of the film revolves around Georges keeping his promise to Anne that she won't be put back into the hospital. It's a real life situation that so many face, yet the answers remain cloudy. So Georges proceeds to become caregiver to the increasingly incapacitated Anne. First wheelchair bound with paralysis on one side. Next she's learning to operate a motorized chair. Then it's speech therapy. Finally, she' bedridden and devolving into someone who can't express simple emotions. No, this is not typical Hollywood entertainment. This is life's realities through the expressive acting of two of France's best.It would be easy to say not much happens in the two hour running, but in fact, it is filled with the daily moments that make up life. The moments become an obstacle course when we must assist a loved one in the performance, or if we are the one being assisted. Nurses who may or may not be caring, friends who are struck helpless, and even family (played here by Isabelle Huppert, The Piano Teacher) who feel the responsibility to help, but are caught in the responsibilities of everyday life.Death is a common occurrence in movies. Dying is actually quite rare. Haneke doesn't shy away from any aspect of this sorrowful and difficult journey. He forces us to consider the multiple sides of so many questions, and he certainly feels no obligation to provide us with simple solutions or happy endings. Georges walls off society from doing \"what is best\" for his wife. He prefers to honor her wishes.These are two extraordinary performances from two of France's all-time best actors. Ms. Riva was rewarded with an Oscar nomination and Mr. Trintignant was just as deserving. Mr. Haneke has been nominated as Best Director and the film is up for both Best Foreign Film and Best Picture. Don't mistake any of that recognition as a sign that this is a mainstream movie. It's exquisite filmmaking, but many will find it difficult or impossible to watch. You best be ready to analyze death versus dying.",

            "review_title": "French-language masterpiece of the year",
            "content": "The fact that Amour is an instant classic in the art-house world is as indisputable as the emotions presented by the protagonists of the film are bewildering. This picture is Haneke's minimalistic yet mightily expressive homage to love as we know it, showing the feeling's overpowering force and heartfelt, altruistic nature. While remaining a thoroughly unsentimental and provocative picture, Amour delivers a most-demanding portrayal of an elderly couple's last days together. Those cultivated, sophisticated characters need to evaluate their long-lasting marriage and come to terms with their own emotions, and, simultaneously, discover the true meaning of love in itself. Decisions need to be made, and some of them might be shocking to say the least.It's a beautiful but considerable piece of filmmaking, where a sombre atmosphere and touching yet disturbing imagery permeate every scene. Haneke's steady and visionary directorial hand promises many moving and heartbreaking sequences, while still providing a poetic exemplification of a well- lived life's concluding moments. It's impossible to find neither a plausible sense of redemption nor an authentic touch of consolation, no. The film displays a marvelous character-driven narrative, where loving individuals diverge from the seemingly familiar path and start arguing with their own opinions and ideals, leading to some truly perplexing choices. In the most unexpected manner Amour touches the controversial topic of euthanasia, emphatically depicting how difficult it might seem to even consider such a harsh decision.Amour is a tender, scrupulous, demanding, two-hour visualization of a romance well beyond boundaries, and through its difficult notions it shows human existence in its most intimate and most elegiac state. That death seems inevitable from the very first minutes is certain, but the way Haneke chooses in order to finally arrive at this intensely upsetting conclusion is an uneasy one. Amour is definitely a cinematic powerhouse, which will leave the audiences in a most pensive, quiet - even downcast - mood, still astounding with its ubiquitous beauty.",

            "review_title": "A sensitive and honest depiction of a profound and devastating love story",
            "content": "In 'Amour', we delve into the deepest, and most profound type of love seldom explored on screen, examined to it's uncompromising end. It is one of the most moving displays of love, in recent memory. That the couple at the heart of this film are 80-plus year old, bourgeois, retired French-speaking music teachers is surprising. That their story speaks to so many audiences worldwide regardless of their age and culture should not be, it simply reflects the universal emotions at the core of this film told with great honesty and sensitivity.Ironically, as the title suggests, this is (not) another love story. In his most classical and refined film yet, Austrian master Haneke has once again asks questions of the audience in his own subversive, clinical, uncomfortable methods, yet (in what many see as a departure) with profoundly moving results. Some of the signature Haneke 'shocks' still remain, but this time they also carry devastating emotional weight.Paradoxically the emotional force of the film comes from Haneke's characteristic clinical style of filmmaking: static shots, framed in mid to long distance, no score, economical and direct screenplay, however assisted by an always crisp sound design, sharp lighting and cinematography courtesy of Darius Khondji (Midnight in Paris), and naturalistic and honest performances. This time however, the approach feels gentler and respectful without the standard disdain and nihilism one expects from Haneke.Yet there remains a palpable sense of the unknown and danger as film progresses (ironically almost exclusively in their spacious and comfortable apartment) ratcheting up a claustrophobic sense of fear. The film also spends it's time almost solely on the two leads, the emotional weight they carry and the connection to the audience evidenced by genuine laughter, gasps and tears (laughter or sorrow I won't disclose) was incredibly moving for two (real-life) octogenarians that few would admit, they have more in common than they would believe. I've not said much about the film's story - an elderly French couple live in a Parisian apartment until an unexpected event causes them to reevaluate their life - it is simple in it's construction and execution, and the emotional peaks are best experienced by yourself with a friend or family member and a receptive audience. I watched this at the Sydney Film Festival in June, about a month after it's premiere in Cannes in May for which it deservedly won with enthusiastic reception. The theatre was comparatively (and undeservedly) under attended, yet the reception was attentively silent, collectively moved.Following the visceral and subversive Cach\u00e9 and the more refined and sprawling White Ribbon, it appeared that Haneke had reached a creative zenith. Almost inevitably however, and especially given with the subject matter, he has restrained his somewhat acerbic style and delivered a film that is superlatively honest and sincere in all it's creative aspects. He has given an honest appraisal of a tender human relationship that should move even the most dispassionate viewer by the often unflinching humanity displayed on screen. One of the greatest and profound achievements seen on screen in many years, this is film at it's purest and most powerful form.",

This is a film of quiet sophistication and respect and will likely stand as one of the greatest love stories ever placed before the public in a film.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a couple of retired music teachers enjoying life in their eighties, attending concerts where Anne's pupil Alexandre (Alexandre Tharaud) is performing the Schubert Impromptus. In their comfortable home they enjoy each other's sensitivity and pleasures, but one morning at breakfast Anne suffers a TIA from which she seems to recover rather quickly. The moments of Anne's silence and lack of response trigger a sense of panic in Georges, and despite the fact that she recovers, he takes her to the hospital. Anne undergoes a carotid endarterectomy but the surgical result is a failure (she is one of the 5% of failure rates). Returning home with a right hemiparalysis begins Anne's harrowingly steep physical and mental decline as Georges attempts to care for her at home as she wishes. Even as the fruits of their lives and career remain bright, the couple's hopes for some dignity prove a dispiriting struggle even as their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert), also a musician, enters the conflict. In the end, George, with his love fighting against his own weariness and diminished future on top of Anne's, is driven to make some critical decisions for them both. The couple's bond of love is severely tested but then breathtaking conclusion radiates the power and durability of true love.Both Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva offer impeccable performances, and Isabelle Huppert adds a superlative supporting role as the daughter who does not seem to fathom her parents' love. The musical score is devoted to Schubert's Impromptus Nos. 1 and 3 and Moment musical No. 3, Beethoven's opus 126 Bagatelle No. 2 and opus 33 Bagatelles Nos. 2 and 4 and the Bach-Busoni Prelude Chorale 'Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ' - performed by pianist Alexandre Tharaud who also plays himself in the film as Anne's pupil. Every aspect of this film is treasureable. It is one of the most beautiful films of the time. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 13",

            "content": "According to Robert Sternberg's triangular theory, the paragon of love is \"consummate\"\u2014complete, ideal, perfect. In this fashion of love, a couple delights in each other while defeating hardships with grace. Some might argue that aseptic concepts don't translate in the ebb and flow of reality; they would be right. Except Sternberg never said consummate was truly sustainable or permanent. Amour surpasses consummate and escalates the inquiry; venturing into end-stage by showing us the bits that come before \"death do us part\".When the movie begins, firemen break into a foul smelling apartment. A bedroom door, shut and sealed with layers of tape open to reveal the lifeless body of an old woman laid at rest. She was dressed in the finest, adorned with flowers. We are then introduced to main protagonists; ex-piano teachers Georges and Anne. Retired octogenarians with a long history of marriage who have settled comfortably into middle-class existence. The couple is shown attending a concert performed by one of their ex-students, and having a pleasant evening together\u2014that was the last scene filmed outside their apartment. On returning home, Georges discovers a tampered door lock. What appears to be a burglary attempt by strangers in the present, alludes to the change about to intrude at dawn. At first consideration, Michael Haneke is an unlikely choice for stock sentimental genres. His blank, minimalistic, expressionless style of film-making; famous for detachment and cold neutrality would only aggravate the treatment of dry complex material. When one walks into a Haneken feature, expect neither theatrics nor emotions. Still shots, basic camera movements overlayed with monotonous ambient sounds only. But realistic mise en sc\u00e8ne accentuates the intense deliberation demanded by his films (Cach\u00e9, The White Ribbon). This is the principle behind those introspective pieces. We are living in times of antipodal controversies. Pro-life campaigns against palliative medicine in the Liverpool Care Pathway saga is just one among the many that surround euthanasia debates. Rather than hanker over mission statements, Amour grazes the back door stance without overtly fixating on any specific message. And it would be perceptive to withhold from believing the central theme concerns itself with human rights because it doesn't.This is a story about a common man and woman, what their romance is capable of enduring, and their burning departure from blessed peace. Amour makes observations behind mysterious doors; allowing you to watch as two human beings gradually abate into claustrophobic indignity. Tender, humane, poetic and heart rending.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",

            "review_title": "Grim documentary-like exploration of stroke victim's journey is raised to realm of true art with surprise twist ending",
            "content": "I didn't like Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon' as it was a fable that had little basis in reality. Haneke is on much more solid ground with 'Amour' as the story is based on experiences Haneke observed with one of his own relatives. A story such as 'Amour', which involves the deterioration of a stroke victim and her husband's valiant efforts to care for her, becomes problematic when true-life events are reproduced almost verbatim. Fortunately, Haneke mixes things up enough to keep our interest, and then throws in a twist ending of sorts, which will come as a surprise to most viewers, who likely won't be expecting such a turn of events.The stroke victim in question is Anne, who lives with her husband, Georges, both retired music teachers. When Anne blacks out at the breakfast table one morning, Georges knows something is wrong but Anne doesn't seem to have any memory of the incident. It turns out she has a blocked carotid artery but after undergoing surgery, Anne ends up paralyzed on one side.The first half of 'Amour' involves Georges' efforts to help Anne with her rehabilitation. He holds her up out of her wheelchair and she takes feeble steps, using her one good leg, and dragging the other. Eventually, Anne has another stroke, which reduces her to a child-like state; often, she talks in gibberish. Georges becomes more frustrated as there are moments when Anne refuses to swallow the soft food Georges is trying to spoon feed her.Outside visitors occasionally impinge on Anne and Georges' depressing world. Early on, before the second stroke, one of Anne's students, a well-known classical pianist pays a visit and asks Anne what happened to her. She understandably doesn't want to discuss her situation, merely stating that her condition is a result of 'old age'. Later, Anne and Georges' daughter, Eva, pays a visit, and argues with her father, recommending that she put Anne in a home. Georges' reacts angrily and considers Eva's suggestion callous. It eventually comes out that the relationship between daughter and parents is not good, primarily due to her British-born husband, who apparently the parents did not care for too much.After Georges decides to hire a second nurse, he discovers that this particular woman has been mistreating Anne (in a particularly upsetting scene, the nurse pulls Anne by the hair, lifting her face to a mirror and mocks her to the effect, 'don't you want to see your pretty face'?). Georges fires the nurse but she indignantly claims that she's never had a problem before with any of her employers and rudely curses the old man, before leaving.It's interesting that the family doctor is never seen during the entire film. The visitors to the apartment, however, serve to break up the monotony of Anne's deterioration, not only for Georges but for the audience as well. While Haneke has managed to hold our interest until the second act crisis, he's treading in dangerous waters, as it's at this point in the film when the audience's patience is tested. Just how much more of this chronicle of Anne's downward spiral, can anyone take?SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT A TWIST ENDING! 'Amour' suddenly morphs into a crime drama of sorts when the caring Georges, suddenly decides he can't take it anymore, and smothers Anne with a pillow. He prepares the body so that when the police finally arrive, Anne appears in a dignified state. He also seals the door with masking tape, presumably to prevent the foul odor from permeating the apartment. Then Georges pens a final note and while it's not entirely clear, it appears he commits suicide, to join his wife in death. Right before the note, Georges captures a pigeon that has flown into the apartment, but lets it go, perhaps symbolizing that he finally has let Anne go, by effecting the mercy killing.If you've ever read any newspaper articles about mercy killings, where the spouse who does the killing, ends up committing suicide, 'Amour' pretty much explains why these things go on. The mercy killing also provides food for thought by bringing up the issue of keeping a comatose patient alive while in a vegetative or extremely debilitated state. It's easy to take a 'holier than thou' attitude, but when you're in a situation like Georges, do you completely condemn him for 'snapping'? And would you have been so self-sacrificing for a family member as he was? Many of us would probably have went along with the daughter's advice to place the debilitated relative in a home, thus leaving the care to others, who might have ended up as caring as the second nurse, who Georges was forced to fire. Veteran actors Emmanuelle Riva as Anne and Jean-Louis Trintignant, are excellent as the tragic couple. I understand that Trintignant came out of retirement, to play this role (he hadn't been in a film for 14 years). 'Amour' is not an easy film to watch but it's important to remind people that illness in old age is a reality and it could happen to anybody. With its jarring ending, Haneke has managed to raise this documentary-like feature to the higher realm of true art.",

            "review_title": "once again a calculated art-house bore with offending undertones",
            "content": "I guess I'll never understand the infatuation of the art-house crowd (and the Cannes festival in particular) with Michael Haneke, a director who did bold and ground-breaking work in the 90s but has since slipped into eclectic mannerisms that this reviewer has found increasingly unbearable. It's not just that nothing happens in Haneke's films, it's that he has been passing off artificial renditions of admittedly stylistic mastership as presentations of actual social dilemmas. If you realize, however, that there's always one particular scene in a Haneke film that the whole story has been carefully engineered to carry, then you will find yourself rather unimpressed by the stories they tell; you'll just wait two hours for it to finally happen, and feel tremendously bored in the process.In 'Love', the subject dealt with is caring for a loved one impaired by a stroke, and it's one that I'm personally familiar with, having taken care of my paralyzed father during his last years. That's what prompted me to view it in spite of considering 'The White Ribbon', notwithstanding its laurels, one of the dullest films I've ever seen. While this doesn't make me an expert on health care, I found the ultimate 'solution' in the film offensive, even though I more than less expected such a conclusion; it's offensive because this is what intellectual people with enough money to take psychoanalytical tours of their oh-so-interesting subconscious consider the logical outcome of immense stress. And yet millions of people worldwide feed their ailing relatives with spoons or change their diapers without thinking of - I might as well relieve you of the suspense - suffocating them. Situations like these tend to take you along with them, rather than giving you Othelloesque airs.To be sure, until that point in the film there were a lot of situations I found myself familiar with: explaining what you do to relatives who think you should do a better job while staying away from the work, trying to make sense out of doctor's comments, telling off private nurses rushing through their routine, and most of all, watching a person you were close to all your life fade away. Yes, there are moments when you crack. But not only is the breakdown - in an otherwise wonderful performance by the great Jean-Louis Trintignant - a rather obvious 'hommage' to the climax of Jean-Jacques Beineix's 'Betty Blue' (in which it's much more appropriate and hard-hitting), it's also a completely unnecessary sensationalist twist to an otherwise straight-laced, no-nonsense account of what happens to an elderly couple.Had it not been for this, I would have left the film thinking: 'Good, Haneke is back to his original strong story-telling, even though it's 30 minutes too long'. But as it is, 'Love' is one of his calculated, constructed bore-offs catering to an elitist audience who probably put their parents in homes, and transform their guilt over such neglect into admiration for a film dealing with the subject. 'Stopped on Track', which won the Un Certain Regard section at Cannes in 2011, is a much more honest, less calculated look at a family dealing with the prospect of death. It also has what 'Love' most distinctly lacks - heart. For that is what makes me bash Haneke's films so often: they may have brains, but no heart to go along with.",

            "content": "Amour (2012) Dir. Michael HanekeJust when I thought Michael Haneke could surprise me no more, he comes along with a film like this. A film for which the jury at Cannes gave him his 2nd Palme d'Or in four years. And nothing less than this film deserves.The story of an elderly French couple, their deteriorating health and devotion to each other is the basis, and allows the Austrian auteur to inject something rarely if ever seen in any of his films to date, heart.Some of the typical Haneke touches are still there; the suffocating sense that something terrible is going to happen being his signature. His previous film, the 2008 Palme d'Or winning The White Ribbon keeps up this omnipresent dread for almost its entire runtime (also see the deus ex machina in Funny Games and continuous sense of dread in Cache). With these films Haneke has proved himself to be the biggest audience manipulator since the greatest of them all, Alfred Hitchcock.But there's nothing artificially manipulative in Amour. And there's none of the sentimentality that less able directors would fall back on given the film's subject matter. The acting and characterisation is so strong that added sentiment is never needed, and is in fact the very last thing you'd expect to encounter in a Haneke picture.The emotion felt towards the two protagonists as they struggle with coming to the end of their lives actually gave me a crushing sensation in my chest by the end of the runtime. This is an extremely tough film to watch at times, and on more than one occasion I had to look away from the screen.The biggest compliment I can give this film, is that it made me want to call my parents.5/5 stars. #1 film of the year so far.",

            "content": "It was bound to happen. A film encompasses the soul and meaning of love and executes the physical and emotional demand it requires to be told effectively and correctly. That film is Michael Haneke's Amour. Haneke steers the film effortlessly, as if he were telling a shot-for-shot story of his own experiences. He constructs and creates two real and authentic people, Georges (Jean-Louis Tringnant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva). It's wonderful to see Haneke allow the powerful leads to feel and interpret these people of their own accord. It's one of his finest writing efforts of his career. Tringnant's heart is visible and available for all the viewers to see. He's fearless as he walks through the film frail and broken yet confident and composed. He challenges the audience to empathize and question our own reactions and reality. Same goes Riva, who does everything right that was wrong with similar performances like Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby (2004). Riva goes above and beyond the call of duty, wearing Anne on her skin with vulnerability. It's one of the great performances of the year by any woman in any category. The two leads together is even more brilliant than when they're apart. Adding in the talents of Isabelle Hupert as Eva, the daughter of our married couple who finds her own love tested, is wonderfully operational. While many will chalk this film up to depression and elderly inevitability, I don't share the same sentiments. The film is front to back about love, pure and simple. The events circle a morose and saddened sequence but Georges and Anne is the great love story of the year. The film dares you to find someone you love that much, in both perspectives. Haneke focuses on the couple with no outside stories of their neighbors, life before these events, or extra characters. He puts them in the spotlight, front and center. Amour could be the best film of the year and is the best film of the New York Film Festival so far.",

            "review_title": "A spontaneous reaction to Haneke's \"Amour\" without the words 'boring', 'overrated' and 'pretentious' ...",
            "content": "I've just watched the most acclaimed foreign film of the year, and when I say \"watched\", I mean \"endured\" for even the word \"experienced\" is too weak to describe \"Amour\"'s effect. Michael Haneke, the Austrian director, tunnels our senses into the cruel world of \"old age\" through the story of Anne and Georges, an elderly couple, octogenarians like the actors who play them, Jean-Louis Trintignant, who bares a strange resemblance with Laurence Olivier, and Emmanuelle Riva.And speaking on her Oscar-nomination: it almost undermined my personal enjoyment of the first act. Knowing that the actress gave one of the best performances of the year, I put my expectations so high they were sadly deceived in one scene or two. Riva is generally terrific, her body language, her eyes communicate something deep and sincere, until she speaks. During the heart-breaking breakfast scene when she suddenly froze into catatonia while Georges was telling a story, she was perfect, but then, when she regained her emotions, I felt she was 'reciting lines'. I had to check the scene again, same feeling \u0085 needless to say that her performance as soon as she sat on the wheelchair redeemed this one flaw, but still. While watching Emmanuelle Riva, many other performances came to mind, Ellen Burstyn in \"Requiem for a Dream\", Gena Rowlands in \"A Woman Under the Influence\", both women victim of their own good nature and gradually descending into a hellish madness. I thought of them, maybe for the realism to a slap-in-the-face level of their performances. I looked for this 'truth' but found some bleak coldness in Riva's delivery that confined to unnaturalness, the feeling didn't last but it was painful not to feel the emotion when she was in a 'normal state'. I saw the film with my wife, and she felt the exact same thing, and we both agreed that Trintignant was more credible and absolutely incredible. At the end, Riva's performance was in the same vein than Hillary Swank in \"Million Dollar Baby\" and Harriet Anderson who played an agonizing bedridden woman in \"Cries and Whispers\" and I guess the level of pathos she admirably transcended justified the nomination. And while Swank could walk after the film, and Anderson didn't suffer from cancer, Riva's performance is the bravest because she doesn't cheat while playing an old woman devoured by senescence and handicap, when she's naked while the nurse showers her or puts a diaper, her eyes don't lie. She might end up like that, and her eyes reflect our own fears: being dependent, belittled by careless nurses, treated like children or be patronized by ours.I'm sorry to fill the review with Oscar considerations, but since they are giving the film the very publicity it deserves, they fatally affect people's expectations, if not opinions. And while we're talking 'awards', I sincerely believe Trintignant didn't get the credit he deserves, because when you think about it, what does the title refer to? The titular \"Amour\" is the driver of George's life, a man who dedicates his efforts, his focus, to make the last days of Anne more comfortable, being more than caregiver, for there is more than care to give, there is love, but also respect, attention and consideration. I also referred to \"Cries and Whispers\" because Bergman's influence is striking, through Haneke's constant static shots on domestic interiors and sober direction, one of the Swedish master's trademarks. A tactful editing took enough time to show the pathos but cut it at the right moment before it would lead to a damaging reverse voyeurism. Haneke's influences are obvious but at times, when all the movies rely on homages, I can't complain when it's the style of Bergman or Cassavetes that is imitated and not without the substance. The power of \"Amour\" is to to explore the soul of a man, torn between the true love he feels for Anne and the devastation he witnesses, watching her body, her mind slowly degenerates. George's torment reflects what life is all about: conflict, and since Anne can't defend herself, she's virtually dead. In a very satisfying scene, Georges dismisses an incompetent nurse by telling her \"I hope that you have the misfortune to be treated exactly the way that you treat your patients when you are helpless.\" Helpless, that's exactly the state of Anne, and Georges is the only one to understand that she needs someone who treats her like an adult. One of the most devastating scenes occurs when Anne refuses to drink, George's reaction is shocking but realistic. Indeed, we'd never harm those who love, except if they try to harm themselves. The slap Georges gave is a sort of defensive mechanism he applies in the name of Anne's soul, because she can't respond for herself. Literally, Georges embodies Anne's agony. And he's in such a symbiosis with his wife's soul that he embraces her suicidal impulses, and suddenly grabs the pillow to \u0085 like \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the ending elevates the film to another dimension. \"Amour\" is about sparing someone we love the pain and the agony, just like Haneke, who spared us the same torment, to follow Anne until the very last breath. The film reminded me of my grandmother, she lives with her unmarried daughter who approaches the 70's. My aunt truly loves her mother but can't stand her repetitive cries for help, (like those haunting \"Hurt!\"), she wishes God would allow her to live the world in peace, but the cruelty of life doesn't rely on the imminence of death, but on its uncertain delay. Haneke chronicles the conflict inhabiting a man who waits for things to come naturally and does the best to ease the pain, par \"Amour\", but wonders as time goes by, if it's really worth waiting and suffering, still par \"Amour\". I'm not sure which of Anne or George's state is the more enviable",

            "content": "\"You are a monster sometimes.\" - Anne Michael Haneke directs \"Amour\" (aka \"Love\"). Like most of Haneke's films, the story revolves around characters named Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emanuelle Riva), now portrayed as an elderly couple living in a spacious Parisian apartment.Reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman, particularly \"Cries and Whispers\" and \"Music in Darkness\", the film watches as Anne slips into dementia and then the grip of a severe, life threatening illness. Georges tries to hold back Anne's demise, but his attempts seem futile. Unable to stand the sight of Anne suffering, Georges suffocates his wife with a pillow. The film then launches into its big philosophical subplot: are Georges' actions motivated by love? Is his decision to kill his wife an attempt to end her misery or his? Is love itself a form of psychic violence, in which man attempts to deny, bury and deflect away from the corporeal? Always the pessimist, Haneke's answer to the last question is \"yes\". For Georges, love has become a means of preserving a very specific idealised image, his means of asserting fantasy over a reality that seems inherently inhumane.Fittingly, Haneke's entire film is filled with bourgeois characters fawning over music, pianos and paintings. Elsewhere they're constantly patting themselves on the back for being patrons of the arts. Long before death comes knocking, these characters are indulging in their own escapes, staving off the universe with piano strings and canvases. Later Georges makes it clear that there are certain tales from his past which he strategically \"keeps to himself\" and refuses to \"give over\" to Anne. He then recounts a childhood story in which he cried over the \"memory of the emotions caused by a film\", a film which he \"no longer remembers\". The power of memory, Georges then says, is more important than the objects from which these memories originate.In keeping with this theme, the film opens with Anne and Georges realising that their home has been burgled. Fearful of being murdered in her sleep, Anne stays up all night. Georges, meanwhile, sleeps comfortably. \"Imagination and reality have little in common,\" Anne later admits. This portrayal of Anne as hysterical and Georges as pragmatic will reverse as the film progresses. Georges will become Anne's murderer, the one she fears, but also the idealist who kills to preserve what now resides only in his imagination.The film's key murder is itself not only Georges' selfish means of preserving his wife as he and he alone sees fit, but a means of eradicating parental guilt and paternal failings. Indeed, it is the tale of a mother who is unable to care for her child that prompts Georges, suddenly, to kill. For Haneke, love is compassionate, real and generous, but also always a fraud which contains a kernel of violence; the reductionist in Haneke sees love as a transaction in which self-interests collide, a shared fantasy that is always imported from and built outside of both parties. The film then ends with Georges walking away from his dead wife, choosing instead to eject the decaying body she now represents and hold on instead to how he wishes she were. The film's last shot is of Georges' daughter, similarly abandoned.Aesthetically, \"Amour\" is dull and familiar. This is material covered fully by Bergman and Manoel de Oliveira. Elsewhere the film's little sermon on \"love\" pales next to Antonioni's \"Beyond the Clouds\", and Haneke's style, distant and abrasive, echoes Bresson's austere brutalism, but replaces the French director's compassion with a smirking tone reminiscent of many New French Extremists (Bruno Dumont, Gasper Noe). At its best, \"Amour\" captures a certain existential horror, Haneke's frames dead, cold and silent, every image pregnant with menace. The film's promotional poster is a stroke of genius, Georges reaching for his wife in a gesture of compassion, but also like a horror monster, about to strangle.6.9/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.

            "content": "\"Though lovers be lost, love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.\" - Dylan Thomas In Michael Haneke's Amour, Palme d'Or winner at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) watches over his loved one, Anne (Emmanuelle Riva), as she gradually loses control of the precious attributes of body and mind after a series of strokes. In his usual austere style, Haneke avoids sentimentality and even outward displays of emotion to present a carefully controlled, almost clinical picture of devoted caregiving, concentrating on Georges day-to support for his fading companion: convincing her to take food and drink, helping her go to bed, to walk, go to the toilet and countless other mundane tasks.Both retired piano teachers in their eighties, Anne and Georges live in an upscale Paris apartment surrounded with a huge library of books and a baby grand piano in the living room. After a brief opening scene that shows firemen breaking into the apartment, in flashback we see the devoted couple as they attend a piano recital of Alexandre (Alexandre Tharaud), one of their most promising students and both return home in good spirits. The first jarring note occurs when Georges and Anne discover that the lock on their front door has been broken and realize that there has been an attempted break-in.The scene is harrowing because of the anticipation of one of Haneke's visceral shocks but everything seems in order. The next morning, however, when they sit down for breakfast, Anne suddenly freezes and loses awareness of Georges' presence in the room and is oblivious to his questions about what is wrong. He knows something is definitely not right when she suddenly regains her faculties and has no memory of what took place. When she pours tea, the liquid misses the cup and lands on the kitchen table. Anne has suffered a stroke and, after an unsuccessful operation to remove an obstruction in her carotid artery, her left side is paralyzed and she forced to use a wheelchair.Shaken by the hospital experience, she makes her husband promise that he will never bring her again to the hospital. As Anne's condition seems to stabilize, a second stroke robs her of the ability to speak coherently and, concurrently, of her dignity. A visit by their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) who fights against acceptance of the inevitable only adds to the distress. Another visit by Alexandre is awkward and unsettling and the appearance of a pigeon that flies in from an open window seems to signal the growing feeling of being trapped. Though Amour largely avoids disturbing shocks, a dream sequence with Georges standing in the hallway with water up to his knees and a hand reaching out to grab him is a reflection of his growing terror. His patience challenged, Georges looks for a way to end the suffering.For a film about death and dying, the subject hardly ever comes up in a meaningful way except in Georges' negative comments about a friend's funeral he has just attended. Though without an overt spiritual context, the cumulative affect of Amour is powerful and touching. Without physical displays of love, or even the voicing of the words \"Je t'aime,\" the love between Georges and Anne is palpable in its expression of kindness and mutual support built over a lifetime. Though the film has Hanekean aspects of being a horror story of the ravages of old age, it is also a celebration of life, a haunting odyssey of two entwined souls who refuse to \"go gently into that good night.\" Though we view it from a distance, the masterful performances of Trintignant and Riva ensnare us and conjure up in our mind the dread of our own loved ones going through the same experience. As my wife and I celebrate a birthday and our 37th anniversary this week, Amour not only brings us face to face with our own mortality but causes us to look at life in a new way, reminding us in the words of the poet Rumi that, \"This is now. Now is all there is. Don't wait for then; strike the spark, light the fire\u0085dance the way branches of jasmine and cypress dance in a spring wind.\" Every minute. Every day.",

            "content": "Just watched this movie, which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, with my mom on Netflix disc. It was quite a touching story of this elderly couple with the wife slowly suffering her declining years and the husband doing all he can to avoid taking her to a home. There was no music score and the pace was slow but it was quite compelling to watch, just the same. When the husband makes his decision of what he decided, you feel something and understand and hope he doesn't feel too badly but he might have, just the same. We also see their daughter and a former student of theirs who's now a successful musician. Anyway, if you're the kind who wants to be constantly entertained, this is probably not for you, but if you want something that makes you think, Amour comes highly recommended.",

            "content": "Watched this newly-crowned Palme d'Or winner in KVIFF, from Michael Haneke, whose two successive Palme d'Or laurels in Cannes (another is THE WHITE RIBBON, 2009, an 8/10) have propelled him into an unsurpassable status as the most acclaimed auteur in our era. Pronouncedly contrary to THE WHITE RIBBON's before-WWI village complex and Black & White austerity, this contemporary modern tale of aging and death has a rather tiny-scaled tableaux, most of its scenes are exclusively enclosed in the senior couple's Paris apartment, and the tempo is dragged prolonged to cater for a detailed depiction of the deterioration of the wife's health condition and the husband's long-haul chore as her caregiver which finesses superbly the process from responsibility to liability.The film generates multitudes of cogent reverberations to build a deeply poignant aura with miraculously arranged scenes, some of which even could be fairly disturbing (namely one in a dream world and one in the real world) and some of which seem to overstay its welcome in some skeptical extent. From a more award-hyping slant, the two French octogenarian veterans, Jean-Louis Trintignant (from A MAN AND A WOMAN, 1966; Z, 1969; THE CONFORMIST, 1970) and Emmanuelle Riva (from Hiroshima MON AMOUR 1959, LEON MORIN PRIEST 1961) should and will be garlanded with more plaudits both for the excellence in this film and their under-appreciated career trajectory (for Riva particularly, a heartbreaking rendition which exhausts one's thorough dedication as her disease ). Isabelle Huppert, on the other hand, precisely restrained in dealing with the vulnerable emotions as the devastated but helpless daughter. It's definitely a tough film to wallow in in spite of its superbness in almost every angle and its acuity in reflecting the status quo of the awkward recognition and inadequate measures on geriatrics (which if we are lucky enough, we will all inevitably encounter). The ending of a fictional vanishing into the void is a well-concocted outlet, but as we all know, most of the time, life is much crueler.",

            "content": "We see: a concert audience from the perspective of the stage. Expectant faces, old and young. In the midst of all this, just parts of the crowd, two older faces, a man with receding hair, cautiously interested, an older woman with a glowing expression, Their eyes are on the stage but in reality their focus is on each other. They are what they have and that, one can glimpse from this long shot near the opening, is quite a lot. In the end, so the beginning of the film has told us, at least one of them will be gone and it is this long process of death and the most ultimate of all separations that Michael Haneke puts in front of us for the next two hours and he does so in the most unsentimental of ways. What he shows is love when it matters most, love that turns into pain and loss but is worth so much more than what these can take, love that is strongest when it destroys and which destroys because it is so strong. Amour is both a devastating portrait of what cannot be avoided as well as Haneke's warmest and most humanistic film. For those who only want to see one film this year, this should be the one.Amour has all the hallmarks of the Haneke cinema. The long stills, the quiet camera movements which always keep a distance and hardly ever move into close-up, the laconic sound, the slow pace, the quietness without any dramatic outbursts, the absence of music, the subtle acting, the sense of mystery. The look at old age is harsh indeed, there is no mitigating factor to the relatively rapid decay and dissolution of a human being and the helplessness of the one left behind. Those long camera shots are relentless, they conceal nothing, neither externally nor internally. Indeed, it is the very distance Haneke creates that does not allow the viewer to hide behind sentimentality or shock, that throws what is happening straight in our faces.And above all, it is the normality that hits hardest, for this is the normal way of life, this is how it must end, it is what we know will eventually happen to all of us and yet which none of us is prepared for. Jean-Louis Trintignan and Emmanuelle Riva play the long-married couple with astonishing dignity and warmth, a stinging tenderness and a subtlety that makes them almost painfully real. We can see the life, the enthusiasm, the knowledge gradually disappear from Riva's character and we are left as helpless as Trintignan's.There is a constant sense that he cannot survive this loss of so much that he has been and yet, again Haneke does not employ any dramatic tricks and techniques, he just unfolds the growing emptiness in this large and aged apartment in which the film, which the exception of the concert scene, never leaves. And as the life gets sucked out of it it is filled with a stifling heavy emptiness which makes the big space feel somewhat claustrophobic, the absence getting stronger and stronger and swallowing all there is until there is nothing else left.As hard as Amour is to bear at times, it also carries more love and warmth and affirmation of life than most of his other films combined. For the loss only feels so unbearable because it is so much that is being lost. In a way, Amour is a relative of Andreas Dresen's Halt auf freier Strecke, a totally unsentimental portrait of death and loss that is first and foremost also a celebration of love and life.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com",

            "content": "It's no surprise that Amour garners strong and polarized emotions from viewers. As both a director and writer, Haneke plumbs the dividing line - often the gulf - between what do and say, and what we feel. As someone about to turn the corner into what some consider to be old age, and perhaps overly daunted by the subject matter, it took me some time to build up the courage to watch this film. As a good friend said after he'd seen it, Amour is a film that you must see, but that you will probably only want, or need, to see once. But see it you must.The genius of this film lies in the fact that it doesn't rely on any cheap cinematic or emotional shortcuts. We see this elderly couple for what they are: refined, often distant from one another and from their daughter and their star pupil, perhaps a bit smug, even snobbish. Their relationship is not the stuff of teary-eyed sentimentality.For virtually the entire film we live with Georges and Anne in their comfortable but decidedly stuffy Paris apartment. The claustrophobia that they must feel, confined to a small space by Anne's deteriorating health, is reinforced by the fact that we never even see out their window, though the window does play a pivotal role in the film symbolic motif. Contrast that with another one of cinema's greatest apartment-bound films, Rear Window, in which we spend virtually all of our time looking out onto other people's lives. Here, we're forced to look relentlessly inward. We asked, in effect, to examine our own feelings towards love and death, to decide what we would do, how we would respond.Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva give astonishingly restrained and sensitive performances. There are lengthy passages in this film in which they live their lives in utter silence, but what eloquence there is in that quietness. There is not a single false note, not a turn of the head, or a word of dialogue, that rings false.Haneke has made three of my favourite films of all time - Cache, White Ribbon and now this. They couldn't be more different. Amour is the work of a true artist.",

The direction based on fixed, sometimes endless shots, doesn't help either dynamizing an already poor ensemble.But there are two points particularly shocking. The first one is the dialogues: how did Haneke managed to write such stilted, pompous and unnatural dialogues ? Nobody in real life speaks like this, but you have to be French to realise that flaw. The second one is the poor acting, specifically of Emmanuelle Riva at least in the first part. She was just reciting all her lines like a kid at school, with the exact same dumb intonation. Incomprehensible. The moment she is unable to speak in when she becomes bearable ! In fact, everyone just missed the target, except maybe Isabelle Huppert whose role in anecdotal anyway.Amour is therefore extremely disappointing considering the raving critics the movie receives.",

I had the pleasure of watching this piece of art in and nice Art House theatre in NYC as an assignment for school. With the ambiance set I was ready to view the gem of European cinema. Having only seen one other film by Director Michael Haneke was not prepared however for the film itself. Amour is a fantastic work deserving of its nomination of best picture and best foreign film. It is the story of and elderly couple at the tail end of their golden years and the challenges that old age can present. Is there anything you won't do for love? I give kudos to the director for this film two main characters are in the golden years, it is completely dialogue driven, it takes place in one location and there is no soundtrack or real score. It survives totally on the dialogue and interactions of it leads. It is an extreme challenge to keep it interesting and Michael Heneke does with its stark and sometime depressing subject matter. It is a beautifully written and shot film. However it is real in its depiction in the challenges of getting old and how we deal. I would say this film is an excellent film with a pace,direction and storytelling style more accustomed to European audiences. A great film that I would probably never watch again. 8/10",

            "content": "2012's Palm d'or winner, and Haneke's second one in a row (after The White Ribbon). Much like The White Ribbon, I was fairly disappointed with this one, though it is, indeed, a very good movie. It's a very powerful story on the indignities of old age and death. Emmanuelle Riva (Hiroshima mon amour and Leon Morin Priest) and Jean-Louis Trintignant (My Night at Maude's, The Conformist) play a married couple in their 80s. One morning, Riva has a stroke. After a stay in the hospital, she makes her husband promise her that he'll never take her back, that they will deal with anything that comes their way from their apartment. This is a very straightforward and unflinching look at the subject. I expected to be deeply moved by it. I was, I suppose, but I certainly wasn't devastated. It's just - too straightforward, I guess. If you've read the plot description, that's pretty much what you're going to get. If you've ever gone through the experience firsthand, it'll probably bring back some awful memories. I was just kind of left wishing there was a little more to it. Unlike all of Haneke's other films, I don't know if I'd ever bother to rewatch it. I doubt there's anything left to get. The one big reason that the film's a must-see is the performances. Emmanuelle Riva is receiving the lion's share of the praise, and prognosticators are pretty sure she'll be an Oscar nominee, an uncommon honor for a foreign actress. I have to say, as impressive as Riva was, Trintignant surpasses her in every way. Really, it's his film. Riva's got all the crippled acting, but it's Trintignant who has to deal with it all, and he's probably got twice as much time on screen. I've frequently been bored with his work in the past (even in movies I love, like The Conformist), but he's tremendous here.",

The wife, independent and intelligent, is reduced to a gibbering ghost of herself - treated with unwanted pity and undignified abruptness. Her husband, frantic that not only has he lost the woman who means most to him, cannot bear to see her suffer either. He is torn by the enormous responsibilities he feels.

            "content": "Although I am only 65 years old, most of the people I was close to as a child have died in the past four years, including my closest first cousin (only a month older than me), both of my parents, and my mother's two sisters, who were like auxiliary mothers. We were a very close extended family, all living within two miles of each other until I left home at 18. With the exception of my father, all of those people died in much the same way as Anne did in this movie, but in a much more nightmarish setting, in hospitals and hospices rather than at home, and with an extra kick of morphine at the end instead of a pillow.But dying for all of them was ugly, protracted and humiliating, no less awful than it was for Anne... and FAR more expensive. The worst was my mother, who had Alzheimer's for 21 years before she died and went through for all those years what Anne went through in the few weeks or months this movie covers (note that the season doesn't change). If my father and others had not spoon-fed her (exactly as Georges did with Anne) every meal every day for the last fifteen years of her life, she would have died much sooner and much more humanely.The effect of all that horror on me was to make me determined that I was NOT going to end my life that way. I'll spare you some of the tiresome details and just say that I did everything I could to prevent it, including a health care proxy, a living will, a very restrictive MOLST form (a wonderful, sort of expanded \"Do Not Resuscitate\" form available to New York State residents - a legal document which specifies what kinds of treatment medical professionals are legally allowed to give me) and making clear to my remaining relatives and friends that I did not want to be resuscitated or ever receive any kind of life-extending treatment, but be allowed to die as quickly and as naturally as possible.I got DNR bracelets, lanyard things so I can wear my MOLST around my neck 24 hours, in case I collapse in a supermarket or somewhere, and a bunch of other crap. I got pretty paranoid about being kept alive after my body wears out, which is the norm in today's world. I've had a wonderful life, but I have no desire at all to extend it. Sixty-five years is plenty.Despite all my efforts to ward off the kind of death I saw around me and later in this movie, I never could relax and quit fretting about it. I was just sure something would get screwed up and I'd end up just like all the rest, lying mindless and helpless in diapers in some motorized bed with tubes stuck in me everywhere and people all around trying to keep me alive until they got tired of it and upped the morphine. What this marvelous movie did is take away that anxiety. I don't know how, exactly, but it did it.After seeing what happened to Anne in this movie, and through that remembering in a different way what it was like for my relatives, I realized that I'm okay with it now. It's okay now if I DO end up like that - because, even if it lasts for decades as it did with Mama, eventually it'll be over, and that's all that really matters.If it takes me ten seconds to die or twenty years to die, I'll still die, and nothing can prevent it. That is profoundly comforting to me, and it allows me to scrap the MOLST and all the other voodoo fetishes I had gathered around me and relax. I have no idea how watching this movie gave me this totally unexpected freedom, but I have no doubt that it did.--------This review originated as a post on the IMDb message board for this movie, in a thread titled \"Do elderly people like this movie?\" Since it expresses very well how I responded to the movie, I have decided to reproduce it here practically verbatim as a review.",

There are a few extraneous scenes that make the 127 minute film feel longer but, though the story takes place almost entirely inside their apartment, I never felt the sense of claustrophobia. There is an intimacy that at time's made me feel I was watching the couple from across the courtyard from my own apartment. It is a true statement of love between a husband and wife.I must say I felt a little betrayed by the trailer.

            "content": "You've heard the hype about Amour right now. Not only one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, but a foreign film that gets a Best Picture and Best Director film has to be great, right? Not so fast. This film to me is a colossal failure and misstep. Let's start with the most obvious reason. The film is called Amour, translated to Love in English. As a film about a man holding onto his mentally and physically fading wife, one should expect a lot of love shared from him. But the opposite is true. Amour is a totally emotionally detached and COLD film. In fact part of me wonders if Haneke intended for his title to be ironic, by making his characters NOT have much love between them, as emotionally disconnected souls. Certainly their weak relationship with their daughter would fit into this theme. Regardless though, the two principle characters being cold and clinical made this a very unenjoyable watch to me. I did not like these people very much and I did not feel a strong relationship between them. Obviously in a film with this plot, a strong emotional relationship between its characters would seem critical and this film misses in that area.But as a whole, my main problem with Amour is how clinical it feels. I always felt the presence of Michael Haneke in this film and I don't mean that in a good way. I always felt like I was watching the film being directed and filmed. The dialog felt rather forced and unorganic to me as well, a major problem in a film that aspires to realism. To give an example of a microcosm of the film's problems, a few times in the film the Jean-Louis Trintignant character George has a pigeon fly into the apartment. The first time he chases it away, but when it comes back after his wife had died, he catches in a blanket and embraces it. Get it - the pigeon represents George embracing his wife's and his future death, first he doesn't want to accept it, then he embraces it! If this sounds forced and eye roll worthy to you, it's because it is. Now the pigeon scene doesn't hurt the film that much, in fact it's kind of fun to see JLT chasing it around, but the entire film is made with the mindset of that film. Haneke calculating his cinematography and dialog to try and force his 'relationship' between the leads on you and his messages about embracing death. Despite great performances by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, it never gets past the less than natural way Haneke films this But as a whole, my biggest gripe with the film comes down this: IT IS BORING. IT IS VERY VERY BORING. In part because of the lack of emotional resonance I suppose, I did not feel involved with the story much. I'll even admit that as someone who watched it on a screener on my laptop, at times during the film I was surfing websites online just to make the film go by faster. That's the sign that the movie failed. Amour could've been a great film but in the end it's a calculated, on the nose bore that I have no interest in ever seeing again.",

Michael Haneke's AMOUR isn't the easiest film to sit through since you are pretty much watching someone slowly die while the person who loves her has to pretty much stand by without much he can do to help her. The film certainly is going to have a limited appeal but those who can make it through the subject matter are going to see two of the best performances of the year. Oscar-nominee Riva really does an impressive job with the physical nature of the role. This includes how her body slowly begins to fall apart after a stroke and everything that comes with it. The way Riva handled herself early on with half her body paralyzed but she's even more impressive once the condition gets worse. It's really too bad that Trintignant is getting so overlooked because in my opinion he gives the best performance in the film and I think he has the much harder role. The actor does an incredible job in the way he tries to hold back his emotions as he watches him wife slowly die. I thought he was very believable in the part but he's also so raw with the emotions of the situation that you can't help but be impressed. Isabelle Huppert is also good as their daughter who isn't always there for them. I will admit that I didn't feel the film was quite the masterpiece that many are making it out to be. I thought the first thirty-minutes were rather too slow for their own good and things didn't really pick up until the woman's condition got worse. I also thought there wasn't anything overly original in regards to the screenplay but Haneke's direction is certainly very good and helps carry the film. The reason to see AMOUR is certainly for the two terrific performances.",

His technical mastery is here, his ability to have a clean scene with no stylistic tricks and made it work because of the riveting acting and dialogue. The two leads are fantastic here, although I'm not as crazy for Riva as everyone and their mother seems to be. The film isn't easy to watch, and on the contrary, I once again found a coldness and emotional detachment to a lot of it.

Riva and Trintignant are wonderful actors and credible in the way they play there roles. Huppert as daughter is rather vague and I didn't feel her despair of what was happening with her mother in her performance. I am a big fan of Huppert, but i have seen her acting much better than in this movie. In fact I am rather surprised that she accepted this role. But as far as i remember she was also producing this move, that is probably the reason. First of all i want to add that i think that Mr Haneke is one of the most overrated directors of his generation. Nevertheless i wanted to see this movie after the fantastic reviews in the media. And once again I was disappointed in the outcome. I realize that my review will not be taken seriously by the people who loved this movie and even bring a sort of angry reaction. The same reaction Mr Haneke gives me over and over again. I was not the only one who didn't like this move. We went with a few people and at the end they all had the same reaction; ' this is not a love story, this is a movie who could easily have been finished in 1,5 hour.' I totally agreed with them, i was waiting and waiting, when is this film gonna end? I know, you don't go to a Haneke movie to have fun. We all know that, but for me it looks more like a trick the way he feds his movies with his negativism and i don't buy it.Everybody is astonished about the beauty of the way the love between two people that is showed in this movie. Which love? Two very selfish, dominant people where one takes care of the other due to painful circumstances. I don't see any love at all between this to people, i found them rather unpleasant as people, and without telling whats happens at the end of the movie, there were many points Trintignant could have taken the decision earlier. Where do you see & feel this deep love between them? Can somebody explain me. Because they share there love for classic music? The way they have breakfast together? He is talking, she is complaining, even in the beginning when there is nothing wrong with her. They are unpleasant towards there children, rather selfish towards there successful student who is now on top of the world. What about the over the top scene with the nurse? Is shows his real character. It's the other nurse who shows her the mirror and than her fires the other nurse for what? One of the other things i really hate about this work is the way that the camera's are used. It looks that Mister Haneke wants to express his knowledge how to use a camera. May times during the films i was annoyed by his long shots from a distance. Why? To make the film longer than necessary? And this symbolic crap with the pigeon, the paintings his dreams, come on.. does he want us the audience to show us that you need to be intelligent to understand his symbolic way of expression. It's arrogant and more important totally unnecessary. But yeah the happy cultural scene loves this way of directing. For me work of Haneke is like going to an premiere of an art gallery with a lot of free drinks. Nobody looks really to the works, everybody wants to be part of it and at the end everybody is full of joy about what they in fact have not seen.There are two moments in the film I love, the subtile humor when Riva receives her electronic wheelchair and the subtile funny way the old photo book is showed with a picture inside from another movie in which Trintignant played. This is a nice joke of the director and the actor.At the end you can ask yourself the most important question. What is the need of making a movie where you can watch the degeneration of a woman?They are for most people familiar processes. What is the need to make a movie of 2 hours and 7 minutes with no pleasant people. It would have touched me much more with likable characters and without the unnecessary crap.",

We all dream of finding the perfect soul mate with whom we can grow old together, and many times Hollywood has painted this beautiful romantic portrayal of it, but Haneke shows us what it really means to grow old with the person you love and how difficult it can be to see a loved one go through a slow and painful death. Haneke decides to paint us a different picture of love as he takes us through the indignities of becoming old and seeing the person you love slowly facing death. Amour is a remarkable film and it shows us how love can be severely tested at times, but I also found it to be very pessimistic and difficult to watch. You can enjoy the film for its craft and artistic value, but it is not one you can sit through and say you enjoyed it. The problem I had is that the film is a little too pessimistic as we see this old couple who obviously love each other very much being tested by a severe illness. I have personally experienced a similar disease in my family as my father suffered a severe stroke and was paralyzed on his right side in the same way the main character of this film was. He still can't speak, but has confronted his illness with a positive attitude. In the end, life can throw harsh things our way and love can be tested, but how we choose to confront those difficulties is what makes love stand out above all. I preferred the much positive French film, Intouchables, where the main character faces his disabilities with a totally different approach. Old age is tough and comes with several indignities, but love conquers all. The plot is very minimalistic and simple as we are introduced to the everyday life of an old couple in the early 80's who seem to be enjoying each other's company. Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are retired music teachers living in Paris. They live a pretty simple life as they spend most their time in their home talking about life. They have recently been to a theater to listen to a former student of Anne's, and seem to have enjoyed it very much. Georges mentions that the next day he wants to buy his CD now that he has become so famous. While he is talking, Anne seems to black out for a couple of minutes. Once she comes back to her normal self she has no idea of what happened and Georges decides to take her to the hospital. The doctors decide to operate her, but things don't turn out well. When they return from the hospital several days later, Anne is on a wheelchair and has her right arm and leg paralyzed. Georges watches out for her with a great amount of love and patience, but she feels like a burden on him. She makes Georges promise that if she ever suffer another attack, he mustn't take her to the hospital again. As Anne's illness begins to take a toll on her, the couple's love for each other begins to be tested.The film is mostly shot in long and static takes and is very silent at times. There isn't much going really as we see how slowly old age and illness begins to disturb their daily routines. The film can be upsetting for some viewers and emotionally draining. Michael Haneke is known for making some strong films (Funny Games, The White Ribbon, and Cache) and has received several awards including Academy nominations. In Amour he has received a nod for best director, original screenplay, and best film. He will probably win for best foreign film, but is competing against Hollywood's top films as well. This is probably his most critically acclaimed film to date as many critics are calling it his masterpiece. It might be simple, but at the same time he uses plenty of poetic imagery (like the scene with the pigeon which many people have made different conclusions about). I really don't like his dark and pessimistic vision of life, but he does have a talent for stirring up debate and tackling difficult subject matters. I have to mention that the two lead actors were absolutely phenomenal in this film. Both Riva and Trintignant were mesmerizing in their realistic portrayal of this old age couple. They carry the film and make it tolerable despite the material. Riva has also been nominated for her powerful performance here and could upset Lawrence in the Oscar race. I'd like to quote a critic who best describes this film as \u00a8a graphic portrayal of the unfunny endgame we're all fated to play.\u00a8 I can't really recommend this film, it 's not easy to watch, but I can see why many critics liked it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "\"Haneke makes a film about love and how this example of love can survive through anything life throws at the pair including disease and death\"Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke is mostly known for making cold and horrific films most present is his 2009 film \"The White Ribbon\" about children who grew up to be Nazi's, but with his palm d'or winning film Amour he has made a film solely around love two people can share. Anne (Emmaunelle Riva) and Georges (Jean-Louis Tritangnant) are a couple whose life is shaken up when Anne gets a stroke leading to her being half paralyzed. Georges then has to take care of his wife in her final days while their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) believes he is unable to handle Anne and should but her in a hospital.Anne the one who gets the disease around half way throughout the film spends most of her time lying down because she is unable to stand up. As Anne develops more into this depressing state we feel sorry that she must go through this even though she is well looked after by some people. The film was very horrific for me because the way the story develops and this couple go through these hard times I started to feel more emotional towards these people especially in Anne who starts the film making all the jokes but ends the film not having any resemblance to her previous self.Jean-Louis Tritangnant plays the husband Georges and his character is was one I felt a lot of sympathy for because no matter what happened he stayed with his wife keeping the promise to her. Tritangnant plays it so well and his performance is more toned down compared to his wife because he has to take care of his wife and has to go through these hidden emotions but still is able to play it beautifully. Emmanuelle Riva plays Anne the wife who is just heartbreaking from start to end because her character starts off so normal but from when she has her stroke I could not help but feel all my emotions go towards her. Riva's performance is subtle at times but near the end she does not say anything leading to her face selling her character more. She looks so unhappy that she has lost her spirit and has to live her life like this. Isabelle Huppert plays their daughter Eva and she only has small scenes which are mostly spent fighting with her father about her mother's care. She is also great in her role even though her character is likable then her parents because she is presented as an unlikeable daughter that tries to rule her parents life. Huppert plays it very well and it's sad to see this women have to lose both her parents the way they go.This story of love and commitment is one of the best I've seen in some time and the way these characters go through trials of depression was very horrific and emotional. Presenting two performances that are very realistic Haneke makes one of his best films I have seen in some time.MOVIE GRADE: A (MVP: Emmanuelle Riva)",

An ache here, a wrinkle there... they add up until one day you catch your reflection unexpectedly in a mirror in the mall and wonder \"Who the heck is that old fart looking back at me?\"This film captures that phase of life, taking us from the meandering comfort of growing old together, to the sudden shock of coming face to face with our perishable faculties and existence. None of us want to dwell on thought of how to deal with the slow loss of someone you love, especially in old age, and any movie that tries must tread carefully. This one never puts a foot wrong, the touchy subject is handled with grace and elegance. In doing so, it raises questions that have you thinking for days afterwards as to how you, yourself, would deal with the circumstances. And it's not just idle speculation, especially when there is someone in your own life who you love deeply and you're both getting on in years.The cold reality is that we don't know, and the beauty of this harrowing film is that it gives us one of the pathways.Of course under the law you don't have the freedom of choice to do what's best, but this story brings perfect balance to the line between moral and legal decisions. Unless you're a piece of rock you will be a changed person after seeing this artistic masterpiece. The acting is so good that the story is allowed to outshine the performances.

            "content": "Most movies portray love at a time when the participants are young, healthy, physically attractive and just starting out in life, filled with promise and hope for the future. Rare indeed is the movie that focuses on love at the point when the participants are old, sick, frail, and keenly aware of their own mortality. And does love take the same form in those distinctly different periods in life or does it evolve into something new, and perhaps richer, over time?In Michael Haneke's \"Amour,\" two icons of French cinema - Emmanuelle Riva (\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\") and Jean-Louis Trintignant (\"A Man and a Woman,\" \"The Conformist\") - portray Georges and Anne Laurent, two octogenarians who have been married for so long they probably can't remember a time before they were a couple. When Anne's health begins to decline rapidly due to a series of strokes, Georges assumes the role of full-time caregiver. Like all of us facing this situation, Georges is confronted with the dilemma of keeping Anne at home where she can be cared for by the man who loves her, or of placing her in an unfamiliar facility where she could be looked after by professional caregivers who would, however, be strangers. Georges chooses the former, despite the tremendous physical and emotional burden it places on him. This is clearly a couple who takes their \"for better or for worse...in sickness and in health\u0085till death do us part\" wedding vows to heart. We aren't made privy to the kinds of trials Georges and Anne's love has had to endure over the years for them to have arrived at this point. But something has held them together all this time, and we sense that their life experiences and their commitment to one another have prepared them for this final challenge. Anne's illness becomes the crucible in which all lingering impurities will be burned away and out of which their love will emerge as solid and unbreakable. For only in times of utmost suffering and pain can love be manifested in its truest and purest form. And that is the message of Georges and Anne's story: true love is the ultimate act of selfless giving.The stars certainly understand this. Now in their 80s, with all traces of youthful vanity long gone from the scene, Riva and Trintignant together deliver an utterly raw and fearless portrayal of the debilitating effect aging can have on the mind, body and soul. How Riva lost the Best Actress Oscar that year is beyond mortal comprehension (like the good Lord, the Academy often truly does work in mysterious ways). Without a hint of histrionics, Riva turns suffering into a palpable thing, and Trintignant, who was not even nominated in the Best Actor category, is no less astonishing. In many ways, because his is the less showy role, he may actually have the more difficult acting challenge here. Either way, you really won't find better performances anywhere than you'll find in \"Amour.\"Because he knows he can rely on Riva and Trintignant to convey the beating heart of the story, Haneke has the good sense to make his presence as unobtrusive as possible, using long takes, stationary camera-work and a scoreless soundtrack to bring out the actors' work. He allows the scenes to play themselves out with minimal interference from anyone or anything that might distract from the performances (Isabel Huppert has a small but crucial role as the couple's daughter).It would be foolish to deny that \"Amour\" is a difficult film to sit through, that it is spare and unflinching and pulls no punches when it comes to portraying the ravages and sufferings of illness and old age. Haneke is relentless in making us stare directly into the ugly face of all that this couple is going through, to the point where even the audience can come to feel as trapped in the situation as Georges is in the apartment and Anne is in the body that has become her prison. Yet, that doesn't make \"Amour\" an experience we should shy away from. On the contrary, we should embrace it, for \"Amour\" never lies to us about the subject it has bravely chosen to explore. It assumes we are grown up enough to face the harsh realities of what it is showing us, and it is that respect for the audience that motivates us to respond in kind.There's an amazing scene in which Anne flips through a photo album of the couple's life together, and it is filled with pictures of Riva and Trintignant as we all remember them - when they were young, beautiful and full of life. It's a poignant reminder of not only how much they - and we - have changed over the years, but of what a special treat it is to be able to see them still acting at this late time in their lives, and still at the peak of their power. So many stars seem to fade from the scene long before their actual deaths, only to become a small news item or a blurb tucked away on an obituary page when death finally comes for them, often prompting us to exclaim, \"Oh, I didn't even realize that so-and-so was still around\" and to wonder what their lives were like in the interim between their deaths and the last time we recall seeing them. For more than any other reason, \"Amour\" is an invaluable treasure because it allows us to be a part of these two beloved actors' lives almost to the very end.",

            "content": "No title could be more apt for a film like this than Amour -- literally the French word for \"love\", so ubiquitously uttered that it may as well mean \"love\" in every language. Unlike the movies that most romantics would seek out, however, this is one of the most gut-churning experiences of Michael Haneke's already depressing catalog (from the suicides in The Seventh Continent to the home invasion in Funny Games). But the devotion it depicts, even during its upsetting finale (or perhaps especially during it), is human affection at its utmost. Amour is, by far, my favorite love story.Anyone who knows me, particularly through the web, will suspect that I have some doubts about \"love\" -- not so much the concept of harboring affection towards someone (despite how it may seem, I love most people I meet), but rather the idea that discovering a true soulmate is the be-all-end-all of existence, let alone feasible. However, I do believe in that sort of love; the kind that seems something more than a temporary effect of oxytocin. And the only people who make me believe in it are people like my grandparents. Having just passed their 60th anniversary, they still take out the two Santa figurines that each of them has carried since their respective childhoods every Christmas.Some would say it is because they are of a different time, when that impossible-to-explain-with-science connection was more valuable than getting the Tinder high score. They say we used to be concerned with simply spreading our genes like wild animals and were then conditioned into becoming something similar (except now we simply get bored with and ditch those who no longer meet the conventional requirements for \"young and hot\", and crotch goblins are rarely a part of the equation). Somewhere in between, then, is where something magical must've happened. If soulmates exist, perhaps the concept is more like Tamagochi -- pretty neat but went away after a while.My point is that Amour, in focusing on two people -- one connection -- that stood the test of time, beats out all stories of glamorous young love that we've been force-fed. As I mentioned, this is not one for the romantics, at least on the surface. It isn't a horror film either, despite the fear it may periodically inspire. It is simply a truth.The movie follows an octogenarian couple in Paris, retired piano teachers Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) and Georges Laurent (Jean-Louis Trintignant). One day, Anne suffers a stroke; she sits silently at the breakfast table, unable to respond to anything Georges says. Anne is like most pensioners; not only does she not remember the stroke, but she refuses medical care. As things worsen, her daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) urges that she be put in a home, but Georges swore an oath to his wife after their first emergency appointment -- Anne is not to set foot in a hospital ever again.Shortly, the consequences become too real. No matter which chapter of life you're currently on, you shall recognize the scenario (the denial, the stubbornness...) too well.To be sure, Haneke regards it all with a certain fear. Pushing 70 at the time of the film's production, he was no doubt pontificating the closing chapters of his own life; the inevitable nightmare of deterioration we all endure until some of us may envy those who \"went too soon\". And yet, at the end of the day, what we see is a beautiful thing; the final test of those who truly know how to love. Georges' final action will raise some discussions, but it is impossible to construe this moment as anything but an act of mercy.In terms of filmmaking, there is nothing immediately striking about Amour. There aren't any astonishing sights, ambitious set-pieces, or impressive effects. But its technical mastery becomes obvious if you know where to look, and all the more impressive when you really think about how meticulous and frankly perfect everything is.Amour.Haneke is known for his complex crowd shots where each solitary extra is given clear instructions on how to act and where to be; similar mastery goes into prop placement, framing, set design, and other things that either have a thematic or aesthetic purpose (or both). When I said that he isn't concerned with special effects or trickery, that includes music -- all the music we hear is diegetic and performed on piano by the characters. Even when there are effects, they are so subtle yet meticulously implemented that we don't register them as effects (one of my favorites is the fake vomit in The Piano Teacher). And some images, like the pigeon that appears at pivotal moments, do hint at something more fantastical.Amour is simply one of the most devastating tales of aging ever created, yet also one of the most wonderfully honest and vulnerable -- for Haneke as well as Trintignant and Riva. Artists like Florian Zeller owe much to it, even if films like The Father view dementia from the patient's point of view. Here, we see it through the eyes of one faced with the difficult task of being there for them.I've had this film on my watchlist for a long time. When writing my Favorite Films of the Decade list, knowing this was one of the films that would make the cut, I was quick to check it off my watchlist. For that particular marathon, I recall it tying with Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, Denis Villeneuve's Incendies, and Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master as my absolute favorite. At this point, it may beat out all 39 other films on that list.When I say that this is my favorite love story, it's not simply because I love the movie; it is because the story it tells is THE love story.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I totally agree with Gersh Maes review of this movie. It's hard for me to imagine that anyone with eyes and brain would call this a masterpiece. It was a HUGE disappointment for me after all those positive opinions . One of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, but also a foreign film that gets a Best Picture and Best Director Oscar nomination and wins at Cannes festival. To be honest I don't really care about all those movie awards . They don't really mean anything to me. I have my own opinion which is often completely different than what critics say. This movie is a perfect example that the lovers of \"artistic\" cinema will watch any piece of s*** that pretends to be real art and call it a masterpiece without even thinking about the real quality of what they saw.\"Amour\" is a simple story of two old people. Old man is taking care of his sick old wife. Love and death. Two great themes that I was interested to see what director Michael Haneke has to say about them. I was sad and angry that he didn't had anything to say , but only pretended to be smart and delicate. A homage to love ? A movie about embracing death ? Don't make me laugh.\"Amour\" is a cold and emotionally detached film. It makes you wonder if the title isn't ironic. The relationship between two old people here is completely mechanical, formal, and unnaturally polite. There is simply no chemistry or love between the two people , only concern. I didn't saw two people devoted to each other , only actors playing their parts. What is worse that we never do really learn anything about them , their past , their dreams. There is no emotional connection between the viewer and the characters. There is no character development for any of this characters through all (2 hours long) movie. They were complete strangers for me to the end of the movie . The movies feels clinical. I felt Haneke's presence through all the movie. I was watching a movie where people were directed and filmed , not experiencing a real life .The plot starts off shallow and deepens only marginally. There is no real conflict , despite the fact that Haneke tries desperately to include some with the character of the daughter of old people. The ending is obvious from the beginning and makes me wonder if the pro-euthanasia message of the movie is the reason why the critics loved \"Amour\" so much ? It was basically a propaganda film for assisted suicide. Oh , and the scene with the pigeon is just cheap symbolism.There are scenes that are just a cheap way to manipulate audience into any kind of emotional reaction. Haneke for example shows old woman urinating in her bed or receiving assistance to go to the washroom. It's an empty shock value. If Haneke wanted to show the trials of old age he could and should be subtle.There are also scenes that aren't anything else , but a filler from the beginning shot of the audience sitting in the theater. Man opens a window , man washes the dishes , man writes a diary or last will, man cuts flowers. ALL of these scenes are 3 minutes long . Why ? It's completely pointless. 5 seconds for each of these scenes would be more than enough. There is no need to make them so long ! The whole movie could have been 1 hour long , maybe even 30 minutes long. \"Amour\" is slow and long , because EVERY MOVIE which is slow and long is ART , right ?! This is a movie for all those pretentious snobs who like \"artsy\" movies and watching them makes them feel better than rest of the world. This is just your usual art-house TOTAL bore. For me it was the biggest disappointments of 2012 and in my whole life. I give it 1/10.",

            "content": "After everyone had sat down and were ready to watch Amour, in the theatre I was in, I realized I was in a full house. There were very few seats left that were not vacant. A lot of people had come out to see this film. Perhaps because of the major awards it had won such as at The Academy Awards or The Cannes Film Festival. I have been a fan of writer/director Michael Haneke's films and have seen everyone one so far except for Cache, but I doubt a lot of people will be going because they were Michael Haneke fans, simply for the reason that prior to this and The White Ribbon, his films have always been very dark and disturbing. I have always admired them, but they would appeal to a certain audience demographic only and would probably not be the audience that went to Amour. I was expecting as the end credits rolled for Amour, that the audience I was with, would get up and applaud because the film was a work of sheer genius and for me at least was one of the best films I have seen of all of last year. The audience didn't get up and clap though, and as I saw people walking out and hearing their reactions to the film, a lot of them seemed quite indifferent towards it. My guess towards this is because of the difficult subject matter of the film that will be sure to hit some audience members more personally then others. Yet while it is a heavy and sometimes sad and disturbing film, it is not like any of Haneke's previous works. This much like The White Ribbon, his previous film suggests more and does things in a much more subtle way. When dealing with the subject matter of Amour, the film does not go the Hollywood route and loads the film with sentimental and sappy music and melodramatic acting. While, I did not cry at all during Amour, or felt a deep pit of uncomfortable ness, or was really disturbed by what I had just watched, I do have to say that I could really empathize and have compassion on these two characters. What they go through in this film is something I do not think any of us would ever want to go through, but as with many things, events such as that are out of our hands, so to speak. Everything just felt so real and natural when watching Amour. As, I was watching it I often wondered what I would do in a situation like this and when you watch the characters and how they handle it, none of it seems unbelievable, or a stretch of the imagination. These are characters who are put into a situation, that whether they like it, or not they will have to deal with. And much to their credit they deal with it the best that they can. I so appreciated that this film was not done in a Hollywood way, trying to get us to cry, or choke up and any moment they found to be appropriate and the fact that the acting and the writing was believable and real, really added to the film. Amour is a bit of a slower paced film, but I found myself drawn in almost immediately because of the great storytelling on display here and the great acting as well. Jennifer Lawrence who won this year's Academy Award for Best Actress for Silver Linings Playbook, was extremely deserving of it and I do not have a problem that she won. Emmanuelle Riva, who was also nominated in the same category for Amour, could have just as easily won the Oscar, because she goes through so much in this film to deliver a tour de force performance. It must have been so draining mentally and physically to do this part and yet have it all feel so real and to allow us to care for this character as well. An absolutely brilliant job. Jean-Louis Trintignant who is the lead actor in this film has not been as rewarded for his performance in this film, perhaps because it is not quite as complicated, or demanding a role as Emmanuelle Riva's, but it is equally as good and he should have been nominated for Best Actor. As a man going through these difficult decisions and doing his best to cope and lead an ordinary life and be optimistic while going through it, he is fantastic and believable as well. We do not question his intentions, or what he does once because he loves his wife and what is happening is absolutely agonizing to him. I am so glad that Amour won Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, seeing as it was so worthy of it. It could have won Best Picture, Screenplay and Director as well and all that would have thrilled me. As a fan of Michael Haneke's work, I have to say he is getting better as the year's go by and this feels, so far at least like his definitive masterwork. I eagerly look forward to what he has next. For the people reading this, if you aren't easily disturbed and like to be challenged, moved and to think about what you just saw then Amour is for you too. Along with The Master and Silver Linings Playbook, these are my three favourite films of 2012.",

It reminded me how everyone was raving about what a 'great comedy, great social commentary' the \"Death of Mr. Lazarescu\" was - when in fact it was the sad tale of a voiceless man who, lacking nobody to advocate for him, dies alone.Anyone who has cared for a stroke victim or frankly any loved one whose health was in decline, elderly or not, would be advised to think twice before seeing this film. It will dredge up all of the memories. All of them. I have a feeling all the people hailing this film as great art or visionary cinema have not been exposed to that kind of challenge or loss in their own lives. To them I say, your time will come. Watch \"Amour\" again then, and see that Haneke is rubbing our faces in misery. If his goal was to, like Anne, get us to seek out a way to end it all - well, bravo.The acting is excellent. The film, visually, is simple. But excruciatingly long scenes of their struggle is, to me, sadistic. Beyond voyeuristic. People should be outraged over this, and not the torture blah-blah in Zero Dark Thirty, frankly.Haneke at least has a clear goal here: to make you feel miserable. Because we all know that ageing, illness and dying are horrible... so let's not pretend that unveiling that to us was his goal. Do the elderly pair love one another? Clearly. But the conclusion of this film is not about love, in my opinion; it's about defeat. Thanks for giving us all a dose of what lies ahead for us, Haneke. My only consolation is that you'll face it sooner than I will. And at least this film didn't leave me with a trail of \"wtf's\" wider than the Danube like \"White Ribbon\" did.",

            "content": "The fact that Amour is an instant classic in the art-house world is perhaps one of the most bewildering phenomena to present itself to me lately. It's difficult for me to even begin to criticize it.Firstly, some will say that this film is a \"mightily expressive homage to love\", which shows \"the feeling's overpowering force and heartfelt nature\". This boggles me. It's simply baffling that this is an opinion people come away with after having viewed Amour. The focus of the movie is to present a couple's relationship in its twilight years, however it does nothing to round out this relationship. The viewers of this movie witness a mechanical, formal, and unnaturally polite relationship between two old people. We are never presented with images of their past nor any obvious sense of devotion they feel towards each other. In fact, we never understand very much about them beyond the fact that the wife is dying and the husband is burdened with taking care of her. The plot starts off shallow and deepens only marginally.The fact that the couple's relationship is not well presented undermines every other aspect of the movie. I found it impossible to feel any deep connection or pity for these people who were strangers to each other as well as myself. The only emotion present for the duration of the movie is concern. This becomes unbearable to watch after the first half-hour.Some will say that the director has a \"visionary directorial hand\". This was not apparent to me. This movie has no vision and presents nothing that cannot be found outside of a rest-home. Is it \"visionary\" to show an old woman urinating in her bed? Or slowly becoming senile? Or receiving assistance to go to the washroom? It takes no insight or \"vision\" to show these things and I cannot imagine why such displays enthral viewers. A truly good film-maker would have insinuated the trials of old age, and the oncoming of death, without needing to display them explicitly. A good film-maker would create emotions that hit home without the tactics that Haneke employed.The old man eventually makes a point that these characteristics of old age are the things no one wishes to see. Why would the director ignore advice given in his own movie's script? Did he think he could create something \"profound\" and \"artistic\" by simply going against the norms? Did he think he could create a masterpiece by presenting unconventional, uncomfortable scenes which do nothing but cause the audience to feel queasy, or inclined to look away? Such empty shock-value will never be a benefit to a movie. It is not a tool which a good director implements. Do the people who endorse this movie also stand behind movies containing graphic violence? Or extreme sexual scenes? Do other critically-acclaimed movies rely so heavily on shock to produce emotion?The plot of Amour is simple and could be fully explained within a paragraph of writing. The director inflates this plot to the point that it runs for over 2 hours. This is accomplished by inserting countless long- lasting shots of dull scenes. I watched a man cut the head off of every flower in a bouquet for 3 minutes when I had gotten the gist of it after 2 seconds. I gazed at an open window for 2. I watched a woman turning her head to resist being given drinking-water for 3. Again I ask, is such a reliance on filler-content the sign of a good film-maker?Overall it strikes me as profoundly odd that a director can create a movie lacking any and all instances of character-development, drama or intrigue; a well-developed thesis; and only containing bountiful amounts of shocking imagery (scenes that any person avoids witnessing in their day-to-day life) and drawn-out, still camera shots, and become critically acclaimed. It is simply baffling. Haneke is really on to something.This movie is meant for the type who likes to go to a theatre, watch a piece that is intensely \"artsy\", and then give a standing-ovation afterwards without thinking beyond the \"artsiness\" of the movie, and without considering the fact that it may be deeply flawed in any (or perhaps even every) aspect of film-making.",

            "content": "Michael Haneke's wildly overrated and misunderstood \"Amour\" may be his cruelest joke to date, right down to the film's sarcastic title. I am a huge Haneke fan. His icy, emotionless, almost sadistic approach to filmmaking is perfectly suited to black- hearted thrillers like \"Cache\", \"Funny Games\", \"Benny's Video\" and \"The White Ribbon\". But when he applies his surgeon's knife to such human subjects as aging, illness, and death, it comes off so sour, so mean-spirited, and so surprisingly * boring *, that it's difficult to sit through. Having recently experienced the illness and death of my own parents (my mother was half-paralyzed after a stroke much like \"Amour\"'s heroine) I was afraid this film would be too unbearably painful for me to watch. I shouldn't have worried. I felt nothing (but boredom). The characterizations are so thin and shallow, the Old Man and Old Woman such ciphers, that they barely seem human. They're symbols, or archetypes. Having the woman's mind gone felt like a cop-out too, a way to avoid emotional truth, as did the clinical portrayals of caretaking. Everything feels so distant and calculated that I can't help feeling the title (\"Love\") is the director's idea of a joke. Many critics and viewers, however, seem to find \"Amour\" to be deeply emotional, compassionate, and devastating. But I think they may be filling in the blanks of Haneke's bone-dry script with their own experiences and issues \u2013 which may be Haneke's real intention here. I believe he is, once again, playing the scientist and we the audience are his test subjects. (He shows an audience at the beginning of the film; it's us.) So while I must congratulate Haneke for pulling off another interesting experiment, I have to scold him this time for being even more heartless and manipulative than usual.",

            "content": "Since the beginning of the film we know how the end of the story. However, it doesn't meaning that the film is predictable \u2013 but the contrary idea: it shows that we must be prepared because it won't be an easy and comfortable experience for the audience.What we have here is a one year story about a couple \u2013 Anne and Georges (both of them retired musicians living in an apartment) \u2013 who suddenly get caught in a terrible and unfortunate fate: Anne suffers an attack and soon develops a degenerative disease which paralyzes half of her body. Then, Georges who could have taken his wife to a hospital and left her there in the care of doctors, decides to take care of her himself. He already knows how everything will end, but his love for Anne is strong and is fighting against all the obstacles and boundaries.The story seems quite simple, but Michael Haneke mastered it. We don't have melodramatic clich\u00e9s and useless sentimentalism, but a realistic story that really changes our mood or at least will make us think about life and even get worried with it. First, because what Anne and Georges are suffering could happen with anyone who is watching the film. Second, does becoming old means being sick and lonely? Well, not necessarily, but \"Amour\" shows this side of life to us \u2013 the disease is terrible, but having to face it in a cold environment makes things even worse. The only thing that still exists in the couple's life is their love for each other.The couple has a daughter (Eva) who is also a musician. When she visits her parents, we feel a distant relationship between them. She is a cold person and even crying sometimes by seeing her mother dying, an empty space between her presence and what is happening with her parents is always there. As Michael Haneke said: the fact that a person is a sentimentalist doesn't mean that she or he have emotions. This is what happens with Eva.Even knowing what will happen to Anne and having no hope for her \u2013 Haneke makes it clear throughout the movie \u2013 we keep watching it as if we were expecting at least a comfortable ending for both of them probably because we are used to this kind of plot in which people dye, but always in a melodramatic way.\"Amour\" is a terrific film not only for showing us a reality, but also for the environment created by Haneke and the strong interpretations for both Emmanuelle Riva (who is on the verge of perfection playing Anne) and Jean-Louis Trintignant (who unfortunately was forgotten by the Academy, but had a fantastic time plating Georges).After watching this film, if you leave the theater in silence, don't worry: it means that the film has worked for you.",

Overall I'm glad I did. It's a very 'stately' film possibly badly maimed by an isolated sequence at the beginning before slipping into flashback mode with none of the usual signposts. The film proper begins in a concert hall seen from the point of view of the stage. Two elderly people - who are in fact our protagonists - are seen for the only time as part of a community of kindred spirits (lovers of classical music). After this they are their own community as we never leave their cavernous, well-appointed apartment. Around about the end of the second reel Anne, the wife (Manu Riva) suffers a brief spell of paralysis after which she deteriorates progressively. The main thrust of the film is how the couple, not least the husband, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) deal with the situation. The acting of all three principals is beyond praise - we know, of course, that Isabelle Huppert is exceptional but not so the other two. Not necessarily something I'd hurry back to see again but I won't begrudge anyone involved a nod come Oscar time.",

            "content": "Old age is one of love's toughest, most unrelenting challenges and Amour doesn't sugarcoat it in the slightest. It tells the depressing but simultaneously thoughtful parable Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva), a pair of aging musicians well into their eighties, but still enjoying life and not being cynical about it. One day during breakfast, Georges is talking to Anne when she goes into a daze, not responding or reacting to anything he is saying or doing. A few minutes later, when Georges has reached a confused panic, she snaps back into it, only to be puzzled at her husband's nervousness. She recalls nothing of the last few minutes either.He consults a doctor, who performs surgery on a blocked carotid artery immediately only to leave Anne paralyzed on the right side of her body and confined to a wheelchair. Feeding her, bathing her, and comforting her has now become a physical and mental strain on Georges, who, while simultaneously recognizing his wife's loss of independence, must now bare the weight of two people's lives instead of just his own. The couples' daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) suggests moving her mother into a mental hospital, only to be met with strong opposition from her father with emphasis that he wants to keep his promise of always being there for her. The glimpses we get of Georges' life are of an independent, sort of selfish man who expressed love through actions and not by utilizing three commonly overused words.Georges, in many ways, reminds me of my great-grandfather, who I've constantly heard about since my childhood. He was the kind of husband who never said the three words to his wife, but always showed his love through the way he did things for her. As she became older, he perhaps felt a bit of an obligation to remind her more liberally, but always maintained the \"show me you love me by your actions\" mentality. When she asked him one day why he never said the three common words, he replied, \"I come home everyday, don't I?\" This relationship philosophy is almost dead and gone, as we live in a world that expects to be loved by everyone they encounter. We consistently need to be reminded, even by those we know already do. Furthermore, writer-director Haneke illustrates this mentality and the transition of an independent man suddenly having a dependent soul attached to him beautifully. This transition at hand almost overshadows the depressing reality of the entire situation at hand.Trintignant and Riva beautifully portray an aging couple, whose love may be eternal but whose time on earth is unfortunately not. Riva, whose performance snagged her an Oscar nod (along with the film itself, the film's screenplay, the foreign film category, and the film's director), especially does fine work as a woman who must cope with her loss of independence just as her husband is gaining the load of both of theirs.The only remote drag in the film is its inherent coldness, which is shown throughout the film in a stunningly unexplainable way. The film just feels rather cold in spots, particularly when Georges is caring for Anne, and this makes it hard for an emotional resonance with the material, what with such a commonality in relationships and life itself. I think part of the reason for the emotional coldness also relies with the fact that we know what's coming and the question is resorted to \"when is it coming?\" I laud filmmakers who can make the inevitable shocking and pretty affecting in a big way (other Oscar nominees of the same year such as Argo and Lincoln did so beautifully, with a story almost everyone knows). Despite notable effort, Haneke never makes the inevitable very surprising or even very engaging.Regardless, this is still a beautifully depressing picture, one that compliments itself by having strong performances, a beautiful score, and a consistent tone throughout. If you didn't have a reason to seek out a foreign film before reading this, you certainly do now.Starring: Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva, and Isabelle Huppert.

            "content": "Every age has it's love films. A long time ago, during my late my teens I resonated together with the millions of young folks at my age in between the age of the hippies and the age of the yuppies to Erich Segal's book Love Story and the film made by Arthur Hiller staring Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neill. It was a sad story with two young people falling in love, getting married against the social conventions, then she falls sick, and she dies, nice music and a smart slogan that made my teen heart beat strongly (yes, I remember the girl I was with at that movie, where is she now?). Now I have seen Michael Haneke's Amour, probably the most awards-gathering non-American movie of 2012, a superb film, and a very different love story. I resonated again, I was moved and even more than that, but if I am to chose which one of the two films I want to see again I will chose the older one. Actually, if I think well, Amour may be one of the rare films, maybe even the only one, I will give a grade of 10 at IMDb but I do not believe that I have the strength and in any case I do not have the will to see it again.Michael Haneke is known for the cold approach towards his stories and heroes, sometimes at the border of cruelty. He does not spare us the viewers in Amour either, telling us the story of an old and well established couple of musicians who are hit at the end of a life of love and shared experiences by the tragedy of the malady of the woman (Emmanuelle Riva) leading to the decay of her physical and mental health. No details are spared, and the painful and inevitable process made even more pressing by the fact that there is no improvement and no chance of recovery is described in quite a lot of rather explicit details. And yet, there is no overall sense of repulsion because all this process is dominated by the dedication of the husband, who dearly takes care of his wife although the woman she was mentally disappears with everyday that passes. Riva was a candidate for best actress at the Oscars (she did not win), but it's Jean-Louis Trintignant's acting that impressed me most, because it's not spectacular, but it conveys better than everything else in the film the message in the title. It takes a lot of courage for these two actors whose career was followed by the French and international audiences for almost half of century to face the camera in a film that deals with such bluntness with the theme of the disasters of aging. They took upon the challenge and the result is strong and moving.The whole story takes place in the interior of a Parisian apartment, and it's amazing to see how many interesting things can me made with the camera in these few rooms. The fine acting however takes precedent and will hardly be forgotten by anybody who has seen this film. The relation between the aged couple, their shared experiences, their small conflicts, their tenderness are described in all their complexity, as well as the relation of the two with their daughter dominated not only by the gap between ages and generations, but also by the lack of power of the younger woman to help in face of the inevitable. There is one final decision, one final act of love to be made, we guess it from start, and when it comes nobody is surprised. A final scene shows the daughter entering the apartment now empty, which remained only an empty space gathering things reminding of the love that was. There is no happy end to this Love Story either.",

So we get overly-long scenes of spoon-feeding, carpet-vacuuming, bird-catching, nothing really very interesting, and nothing we couldn't visualize in our heads from a written work. It really was just too dull and too long. I related to how we all will find it inevitable to care for an ailing loved one, but that doesn't make a film a work of art. Another failure for me comes from not feeling emotionally engaged. I did not well up with tears like I would have liked. The acting was spare but good enough.

One lonely, miserable Sunday afternoon, I decided to try to cheer myself up by going out and catching Amour before it leaves the cinemas. I don't normally find depressing films depressing, if you see what I mean. Being a depressive person, I tend to find solace in films that inhabit the darker side. But this was actually depressing. This was like being punched in the ribs for a couple of hours. I came out feeling mentally bruised. This film is about the end of our lives. Most of us will face this situation at some point (if we're lucky and make it into our 80s). It's also about how current Western society deals with ageing and death. This is a film about us - indicated by the opening long and wide shot of an audience sitting in a theatre: we're an audience looking at an audience; we're looking at ourselves.Georges and Anne start the story as a healthy couple in their 80s, with no real drama in their lives. Pretty soon, ill health hits Anne and for the next two ours or so we are with Georges, witnessing her gradual and relentless decline.The performances are magnificent and touching. Emmanuelle Riva is uncompromising in her portrayal of an elderly woman in a failing body. Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the helpless and hopeless onlooker, performing his duty for the woman he loves, without much emotional support from those around him. This is the final slow dance at the end of life.The photography is subtle, tasteful, gentle even - as if not wishing to intrude on the simple life and death story. There's nothing to get excited about or distracted by. Just watch.Ultimately, the film asks questions about how we deal with a slow death in old age, and how we deal with those dealing with it. I came out of the theatre feeling pretty hopeless and went to bed to sleep it off. Strangely, by the morning I felt an inner calm.

Now, living in retirement in their cozy and spacious Parisian apartment, they show an easy approach to living their remaining years together. After a night at a concert by one of their talented students, they are sitting to breakfast comparing notes on the program. Anne suddenly freezes, one realizes she is experiencing a stroke as Georges does all kinds of things to get her to react. Nothing prepares Anne and Georges for what life has in store for them. What follows is a detailed account in how Anne's life is about to undergo a tremendous change. Georges becomes his wife's caregiver, a labor of love which renders him unable to make life better for his life companion, and lover, who deteriorates in front of his eyes. Nothing had prepared either one for how this twist of fate will alter their lives. Eva, their musician daughter, comes to check on the mother, although she offers no tangible solution, or help to her older father, much less to Anne, whose body begins to be unresponsive to what is being done to it. Somewhat it does not take us by surprise the solution Georges decides to help Anne of what she is experiencing. It is pure and adulterated love for his ailing wife what moves Georges to consider what he has already determined in his own mind. Michael Haneke, the creator of \"Amour\" knows a thing, or two about the indignities a person must endure when afflicted my a critical, and irreversible disease such as what Anne experiences. Having gone through a somewhat similar situation with a loved one, we could not help but identifying with Georges and his impotency for assuaging what his beloved Anne is suffering. Mr. Haneke shows a boundless compassion for this couple who have loved each other passionately. He achieves a triumph and a great insight into a human mind going through a difficult moment in his life. The director shows a keen sense of understanding for what Anne is feeling and for Georges infinite love in taking care of his beloved wife. Most of the accolades for the magnificent acting in the film has gone to Emmanuelle Riva, an actress whose work in the French cinema is legendary. Her Anne is a character study on the difficulties of a person whose life is coming to a tragic end. The Georges of Jean- Louis Trintignant is another amazing creation of an excellent actor whose career expands more than half a century and appears to be on top form, as though he has not aged at all. The love and compassion one sees in this man is beyond words. Isabelle Huppert shows up on a supporting role as the daughter of the couple at the center of the story. Eva is self- centered and cannot comprehend the tragedy being lived by their parents.Michael Haneke shows he is at the top of his craft in one of the best films he has given us.",

            "content": "Amour is a film for film-makers and is a film student's dream. It is the kind of movie that demands analysis over and over for its dense symbolism and wonderful structure. It makes some really odd choices, but overall writer/director Michael Haneke knows exactly where he's putting the camera and why, and every shot on the screen oozes purpose. Foreign films don't often gets nominated at the Oscars outside of the best foreign film award, let alone for best director and a best actress nomination for star Emmanuelle Riva, but Amour is moving, brutally honest cinema about love, life, sacrifice, and death. NOTE: Spoilers to come. A lot of them.The aforementioned Emmanuelle Riva stars in the film as Anne along with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant as Georges, a couple of retired music teachers in their eighties enjoying their quiet little life together. The film takes a turn when Anne suffers a stroke, paralyzing her right side and forcing Georges to take care of her. The attack puts a strain on their relationship, with Anne falling increasingly ill and wanting more for her husband than to take care of her, and with Georges ever-loyal and willing to do anything to make her well again.The performances by both Riva and Trintignant are simply spectacular. There is a love and devotion between these two characters that goes beyond words and it is bright and alive in the air between them at all times. Most enjoyable are the scenes between the two just looking at one another, such as Georges attempting to feed Anne and give her water; the look on Anne's face is one of such excruciating pain. The real crime is Trintignant being overlooked at the Oscars for his amazing performance; he is every bit as spectacular as Riva is, and their performances compliment one another perfectly. Truly, one would not have been possible without the other.The film co-stars Isabelle Huppert as their daughter Eva, a far smaller role but a character just as large as the other two. It is fantastic to see her evolution as a character, and how her mother's deteriorating health commands more and more of her attention as the film goes on. Alexandre Tharaud plays Alexandre, a former student of the couple's who has gone on to great success and fame.The amazing acting, however, is only a small portion of the very large picture that is Amour. It owes everything to the script from Haneke and to his careful direction. The camera-work is a bit jarring at first; shots remain steady for quite a long time, looking at characters from behind or from the side, keeping things out of focus, and keeping its distance; an interesting choice that serves to truly isolate Anne and Georges. In some scenes the camera-work is deliberately meant to make the viewer almost uncomfortable; others, it serves to illustrate the slow, stagnant lives that the two of them live. The viewer is only allowed certain access to these moments, the minutes that make up these lives. Georges and Eva have a discussion about her relationships and career- Georges has his back to the camera, while all the viewer can see is Eva. Haneke closes the audience off emotionally from Georges, forcing them to wonder with him at what happened to Anne in the prior scene.Amour also uses beautiful symbolism, in many ways but most specifically in the form of a pigeon twice arriving at Georges and Anne's home. The bird finds its way in through an open window, popping about the apartment- the first time through, Georges shoos it away, chasing it back to the window and out of the apartment. The second- after Anne has already passed away- he captures and cradles closely in his arms. In both of these instances the pigeon represents death, passage into the afterlife- he wants more than anything to keep his wife alive, and make her well again, and chases the bird off. Once she has passed, however, there is little left on Earth for Georges, and he embraces death to join his beloved Anne.There is too much to say about a film so richly layered and this review barely touches the surface. Amour is a moving film about real love and real life and the struggles that love must endure. It certainly isn't a blockbuster, it can be a bit slow and a bit jarring at times- the camera is unforgiving, and the characters grow more and more haggard as the movie goes on.

            "content": "Amour (Michael Haneke, 2012) 4/5Love. This is an emotion that affects us all, where we give it unconditionally to those most dear to us. At its core this is the bedrock of Haneke's new film Amour, as we follow the elderly couple Georges and Anne as they battle with illness, depression and coping with the outside world. The universality of the narratives concept has swept audiences around the world, which has resulted in it attracting a much more mainstream audience. The film has been nominated for 5 academy awards including Best Picture and Best Actress for Emmanuelle Riva, meaning that at 86 on the night; she will become the oldest nominee in the history of the category (Sorry Mrs Tandy).In classic Haneke fashion everything is stripped away to the bare essentials, including the music, d\u00e9cor and performances. The film becomes an empty canvas where we place our own opinions and value systems onto what is occurring on screen. A knowing reference to this is at the very beginning of the film where the couple are seated in an auditorium waiting for a concert to begin. The camera is situated in front of them, capturing the entire audience, rendering the main characters almost invisible. By placing the apparatus in this position Haneke is reinforcing his most used trope of communication and surveillance. In a sense the audience that is on the screen is us and as such we become embroiled with the action of the screen.Georges and Anne are the epitome of a loving couple, however when Anne has a stroke and becomes incapacitated, their relationship becomes strained. It is here that we see the power within the performances of Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant. As Georges helps his wife change her soiled clothes and cut up her food, his love for her fills the screen in an extremely understated way. If we were watching a quintessential Hollywood film, there would be an emotional musical score at every turn. However what Haneke has done has turned mundane activities of the everyday and has turned them into an examination of relationships. There becomes nowhere to hide from the camera as Georges desperation of his wife's condition worsens. The cinematographer Darius Khondji, whose credits include Wimbledon (2004) and Funny Games US (2007), holds the entire film together. The several long takes creates an uncomfortable atmosphere, whereby we become forced to watch Anne's deterioration, which further highlights the raw emotion of the film.It has to be said that throughout his career, Haneke doesn't make films to entertain; instead he deconstructs the very idea of entertainment and genre forms. In Hidden (2005) it was the thriller, The White Ribbon (2009) the mystery and with Amour, the love story. As such, those wanting a film with set rules and regulations won't find it in his work. As the narrative continues, their actions can make quite uneasy viewing, especially in light of the climax. However as you sit, witnessing their relationship unfold in their darkest hours, the experience will stay with you, forcing you to face the true meaning of amour (love).",

            "content": "I saw the review for this film getting very positive comments on Film 2013 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, and of course it was prominent during awards season, so I had to see why this French language film was rated to so well, from Oscar BAFTA nominated director Michael Haneke (Funny Games, Hidden (Cach\u00e9), Funny Games U.S.). Basically the film opens in Paris with an apartment door broken down by the fire brigade who find the corpse of elderly woman Anne (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Emmanuelle Riva) covered meaningfully with cut flowers, and the story goes back several months to see what happened to her. Anne is a retired piano teacher in her eighties, so is her husband Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), they one night attend a former pupil's performance, and the next morning while they eat their breakfast Anne suddenly pauses and does not respond to any communication or physical touch by Georges, she has suffered a silent stroke. While she is sitting in a catatonic state he dabs her with a wet cloth, but still no response, and when he walks out to go and get help she comes around, turning off the running water, and when he asks what happened she has no memory of any of the last few moments, he thinks this may be a prank, but she is unable to pour herself a drink. With a blocked carotid artery Anne undergoes surgery, but the operation goes wrong and it leaves her paralysed on the right side of her body and relying on a wheelchair, but she has Georges promise her that he will not place her in hospital or in a nursing home, so he becomes her caretaker at home. As time passes and he looks after his wife Georges becomes slightly irritated, and one day Anne does tell him that she no longer wants to go on living, he is given hope by the pupil they saw the performance of that the condition is temporary, but she suffers a second stroke that leaves her demented and unable to speak coherently. The strain of looking after his wife increases, and he starts employing a nurse for three days a week to help, even though their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) wants her mother to be put into care, but he does not want to break the promise he made, and he employs a second nurse, who ends up fired for mistreatment. There is a breaking point for Georges when he ends up slapping his wife for her incapability to communicate or respond, he naturally regrets this immediately after and asks forgiveness, and more time passes and he feels almost no bond with what used to be his wife at all, he feels like he is letting her down as well. One day he sits with his wife by her bedside and starts telling a story from his childhood to calm her down, then all of the sudden he picks up the near pillow and smothers Anne to death, and leaving her body in the bed he returns from buying some flowers, and he washes and cuts them ready to be scattered later. Georges picks a dress from her wardrobe and starts taping the bedroom door shut, and writing a long letter he explains about releasing a pigeon, nothing about his actions towards Anne, while doing this he imagines her alive and in the kitchen washing dishes, and she is there gazing at him as he prepares to leave the house. The final moments see Anne telling Georges to bring a coat, and doing this he follows her out of the door, and it returns to the present when her dead body is found, and we see daughter Eva wander around the now-empty house and settling down in a seat in the living room. Also starring Alexandre Tharaud as Alexandre and William Shimell as Geoff. Trintignant gives a great performance as the husband suffering through the trauma, stress and despair of looking after his severely sick wife, but as the poor woman who suffers a life-changing stroke and slowly gets worse in physical and mental condition she really is convincing and deserves all the attention. The story can certainly be seen as a tragic romance between an elderly couple, while the wife is still able to communicate it is sad and compelling, and then when she gets worse and worse it becomes much more bleak and tragic, all this combined adds up to a truly emotional and unforgettable film, a brilliant drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Haneke, it won the BAFTA for Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated for Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

            "content": "The foreign film \"Amour\" has been celebrated with much amor by many critics worldwide. It even received several Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress. I do not share that profound amor that many have for this movie, but nevertheless still found the movie very gripping and impactful. \"Amour\" stars Jean- Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva as Georges and Anne, a married couple in their 80's who face a challenging situation when Anne suffers a stroke. Georges cares for Anne, but the stress of seeing his amor's health worsen take its toll on Georges. This is not an easy movie to watch, there are many moments that could be very disturbing if an older family member of yours is very sick or has just passed. Director Michael Haneke's orchestration of \"Amour\" is definitely worthy, but not to the epitome of a Best Director Oscar nomination; Kathryn Bigelow and Ben Affleck just called, they want their Best Director Oscar nominations back. And this is not to downgrade how effectively Haneke set up the difficult subject of dying within an older couple in his picture. I just think his direction received a bit too much amor from the Academy. Haneke's screenplay was very touching and emotional, and I am sure Haneke's words will cause you to take out the Hanekerchief. Both Jean Louis-Trintigant and Emmanuelle Riva were brilliant in their portrayal of Georges and Anne, and Viva for Riva for being the oldest actress ever to receive a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Isabelle Huppert's performance as George & Anne's daughter was another thing to love about \"Amour\". I do recommend \"Amour\" but with a heavy heart. **** Good",

I did not know beforehand that it was a Michael Haneke film, whose reputation for horrific emotionless movies like White Ribbon (which I did not like) would have stopped me from watching this today. However, its winning of the Cannes Palme D'Or and its multiple nominations in year-end lists including the Golden Globes and possibly the Oscar made me want to watch this.Georges and Anne, an elderly couple whose serene life was turned upside down when Anne suffered consecutive strokes leaving her bedridden. You already know that you should get yourself ready for one depressing emotional ride for the next two hours.Senior French stars Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva play their age here very naturally. Too good in fact, we feel they are actually our own parents going through this ordeal. We get carried away by the jumble of emotions that Georges must be feeling seeing his beloved Anne caught in such a helpless situation. In my line of work, I see couples in this same predicament, and they really try their best to carry one with dignity, without much sentimentality. I felt this was captured very well.The film was shot with unmistakable skill. The photography and camera angles were so good, contributing much to the drama unfolding on the screen. Of course, there are those nebulous \"symbolic\" scenes with pigeons and paintings we see in art films.As a film, technically this is clearly a winner. Ultimately though, the climax is what will make or break this film. Will it make you feel love or feel the total opposite? I did not see it coming, and I wish something else happened than what was shown on screen. Personally I think only European cinema can come up with something as frank as this. I would rather remember the whole film without that climactic (anti-climactic?) moment.",

The trouble for us is that the characters are simply not likable. Now, it's also true that one isn't supposed to say this, in line with current standards of political correctness. The prevailing, I should say domineering, character is a woman in her mid-eighties who suffers a stroke. One is supposed to like her because she's elderly, distinguished, a woman, and rendered vulnerable by illness. But in her core she's immensely unlikable. She's peremptory and defensive; she cuts people off; she has created misery in her relationships; and yet people do not simply put up with her but revere her. Indeed, she belongs to the Simone de Beauvoir brigade of liberated French women who are universally admired but who are, at best, an acquired taste. She runs roughshod over everybody else in the film -- especially over her long-suffering husband -- who takes her guff with dedication and decency. The dialogue (at least as far as we saw) never digs into this character to create a rounded portrait; it is as if a female version of King Lear were allowed to rampage across the drama, never being challenged and never taking a hard look inside. The creators of this film then become Frankensteins who are buggered by their own creation. But since the rest of the world is showering praise, they'll never come to terms with it. As for my wife and me, we are done with French films of this kind; having met the syndrome a couple of other times in recent years, we will only watch newly-made French movies if they are farces or romantic comedies. Did I forget to say that no one in \"Amour\" cracks a smile, and that humor is nowhere near? Well, perfection is expensive.",

Bad things happen, and the way people deal with those determine if we as an audience sympathize with them. We want characters to make the right decisions, behave well, be good people.The bad thing in this beautifully shot movie is a double attack that hits the retired piano teacher played by Emanuelle Riva, and makes the end of her life a sad affair. Though they have lived a good life, with art and family life and live in a spacious Parisian apartment, the couple acts as if the greatest injustice has been inflicted on them. The woman, even healthy not really sympathetic for her strict composure, becomes unbearable, not appreciating when a former student, now a world renowned pianist, visits them and even plays her favorite piece of music. She acts moody, demanding, victimized. During all this I wanted to shout to them: yes, this is life, this is what happens when you age, you get ill, incapacitated, and then you DIE! But they keep behaving as if it's a great burden for them, so rich and beautiful and cultural, with such a difficult daughter (who they raised themselves to become this way), and even to deal with a second nurse that treats the Mrs. too harsh. A second nurse! There are people in the same situation that are not nursed at all in this world, even in Europe, even in Paris! The most perverted part is when the burden becomes too much: the man kills his wife. An easy way out if there was one, telling the audience: it may be hard for a few minutes but it saves a lot of trouble, discomfort and grief in the long run. His consequent suicide, leaving the house as it is, taking no precautions, is even more selfish and inconsiderate, and is a sign of amour, but only for himself and his wife, and not for his fellow men who are left with the mess these so important people leave.Such amounts of egotism are seldom displayed, but I doubt if that was the point Haneke was making, for that the characterizations are too veracious and unironic.",

            "content": "Why you shouldn't see it:The obvious reason that jumps out at you is that Amour is a foreign language film, leading you to (unless you know French) read your movie. I'll take this opportunity to go off on a tangent addressing that very point. It's not that foreign languages bother me in and of themselves, or that I consider reading to be all that laborious. The problem that I frequently run into is that I am a slow reader. Accordingly, if I'm watching a movie with subtitles, I find myself spending too much time reading and not enough time taking in things like, oh, say, the movie that the dialog is really just supposed to supplement.The story revolves around a very old French couple who live in an apartment in Paris. Through the course of the movie, you meet, to the best of my memory, three other characters, but each of them are little more than afterthoughts. And the plot advances entirely within the confines of the aforementioned apartment. So if watching two old people do nothing all in one place for two hours sounds to you like a boring affair, watching this most likely won't do anything to dispel you of that opinion.Aside from all of the set pieces being tailor made for absolutely nothing happening, the way that the film was made also plays a large part in making the viewer feel little to no excitement. I'm sure you're familiar with the kinetic style in which movies these days are edited, creating fast pacing by cutting quickly from one shot to the next. Well that doesn't happen here. Shots go on for minutes at a time, unbroken and unchanged. Just two old people looking at each other. Or not looking at each other. I don't remember where they were looking, because I was too busy reading. Another element that creates a sort of dead atmosphere is the lack of a soundtrack. All of the sound in this movie comes in the form of foreign language speaking and - very occasional - piano music that the characters listen to.I don't know if it's standard for people to act like these do once they get old, but everything on screen came off to me as stilted and formal. All of the dialog strikes me as very appropriate when speaking with strangers, which is strange, because almost all of the dialog is exchanged between a husband and wife, their daughter, and a former prized pupil. It's possible that the French just didn't translate well into English, leading me to think that there's an emotionless disconnect that isn't actually there. But then that wouldn't explain why everyone also acts (in their tone and manner) appropriately cold and distant, unless there is also a mistranslation between how French people and American people act. Regardless, when two people were interacting with each other, I couldn't tell whether they were complete strangers or dear relatives.Why you should see it:\u0085\u0085\u0085I'm honestly having a real hard time with this part. See, I know that (REVIEW SPOILER!!!) at the end I'm going to recommend that people not watch this movie, and then I have to give exceptions to that recommendation afterward. But I'm afraid that if I say anything positive about it here, I won't have any material left for the bullet points.I'm staring, right this moment, at a couple of ratings for Amour. IMDb has it at an 8.0, while Metacritic has it at a 94.I'm speechless.I won't say that I always agree with every assessment of a movie. I know full well that I like some movies that other people don't, and vice versa. But there is a pretty big difference between agreeing with something and understanding it. I don't agree that Angelina Jolie is all that pretty or the earth is flat, but I understand why someone might think so. Here is an instance where I literally go cross-eyed whenever someone mentions how \"good\" or \"brilliant\" or \"watchable\" this film is.In Short:Amour couldn't be a much less exciting movie. If you are looking for something to keep you entertained, interested, or even awake, look elsewhere. To be perfectly honest, the only thing that really captured my imagination was the concept that there were sufficient people in the Academy who considered this their favorite film of the year. I guess I could, somehow, understand a rather morbid individual possibly appreciating this film, but to declare it their favorite would seemingly require an exceptionally special person. Apparently I'm wrong though, and people do like it. I don't know what to tell you. Regardless, I will happily give this movie a 3 out of 10 and suggest that everyone remember there are no ways for them to get these 2 hours of their lives back.",

After Anne has a stroke and becomes infirm, Georges must act as her caretaker. Their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) lives in England; when she visits, she questions whether it is best to move Anne to a facility even though Anne is strongly against this.Whether or not anyone has been directly involved in such a family matter or been aware of one, one thing is certain: this film is relevant in focusing on a serious situation facing many people today as well as the not so distant past. It is also a difficult topic that is eloquently played out in this brilliant film. Among the many acts of courage is casting legends like Trintignant and Riva who were both in their eighties at the time the film was made. Most filmmakers would have chosen younger actors and used make-up to make them look older. \"Amour\" also explores openly a debate that is happening privately: while medicine has advanced to the point that people are living longer, how can we handle it when someone's quality of daily living has deteriorated so badly while living longer?Director/writer Michael Haneke uses a very quiet, Bergmanesque style in the story-telling leaving the actors the task of filling in the gaps with powerful subtlety. Trintignant and Riva live up to the task superbly. During the first viewing of this film, Riva stood out for her heartbreaking depiction of pain, illness, and deterioration. While her performance is no less grand in a second viewing, it's worth noting that Trintignant's great work is more noticeable the second time around. His role may be less showy than that of Riva's, but he more than ably represents numerous caregivers living out an exhausting yet thankless role especially when it is a senior looking after another senior.While the film's basic story is grim, the love implied in the title still comes through. It is clear that Georges and Anne have lived a good, long life together and that love is the reason for trying as best as possible to meet Anne's wish of avoiding a care facility.Also notable regarding a second viewing of this film: the climactic scene remains gripping and heartbreaking. It is probably one of the most powerful climaxes in cinematic history. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing/writing by Michael HanekeActing by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva",

This year \"Amour\" continues to show the same depth and strengths of the other movie, but the emotions are different and that might lead to voters to see things different. It has already earned major awards all over the world, and now it has surprised many (though I can't believe such reactions since this is a film that has earned its support since it's been out for nearly a year and more than proved its worth). The emotion is studied, analyzed, and depicted at length and with superb skill in almost all areas of cinema: acting, directing, writing, editing, and we can go on for days praising its qualities is a simple but complex feeling: love.Love is what the film is about, and it's powerful, heartbreaking, beautiful, painful, a raging force that can build and destroy, that will sustain and bury you, depending on what stage of your life you happened to be experiencing. \"Amour\" is a story of the last days in a relationship. Circumstances are changing, but the bond that the couple shares is as powerful as ever, and through minimalistic but gripping storytelling and directing, we are treated to one of the most accomplished films ever. His other films have given us a taste of what Heneke can show on the screen, and most important of how he can make us feel. In \"Funny Games\" I had to turn my face away from the horrors of the story. \"Ribbon\" exposed me to the festering of a society on its way to even more devastating problems. \"Amour\" is very difficult to watch in some of its most powerful scenes because love can manifest itself in so many ways, never losing its intensity. People say that love becomes hate, and that its absence is indifference, and there is no indifference between the older couple. That shows in the way other people express their \"concern\" through the film, and it only reinforces the dedication between the protagonists.Georges and Anne are facing the biggest crisis of their lives, and it becomes clear from the beginning who is the stronger one of the pair, but it surprises us how much of a match the other one is, and this is where we get to witness some of the most heartbreaking moments of the film because the question becomes what do you do to help the being you love the most when things take a turn for the worse? After a couple of strokes, Georges continues to provide all the support he can muster to give Anne some relief, and the attention to detail given to the story development by Heneke and its two leads borders on the unbelievable. The camera watches closely, neglecting nothing. The actors' faces and simple but insightful dialog gives much to learn about how well these two know each other, and there is plenty of realism without any of the artificial devices we have seen in recent films. The sadness is real, the despair presses on your heart like a vise, and we could swear we see into these people's souls as there becomes apparent that Anne can't articulate her words anymore, but she tries so hard to let him know that it's time with a look, with a moan, with a push...Emmanuelle Riva is a wonder throughout the film, from the early scenes where we see her wisdom and affection for the people in her life, to the way she demonstrates the decay in her condition without histrionics that are more distracting than appropriate. There are single tears, clenching of teeth, frustration in the way her atrophied limbs tells us how awful she feels. She is a master using her face, eyes, words, intonation, her entire body gives an understanding of how her hell on Earth, particularly in the final scenes. Trintigant has an equally difficult role, and he doesn't have the \"flashy\" part, but watching him had me in total admiration because I knew exactly how his world was changing in front of my eyes. This cinema at its best. We're not waiting for pyrotechnics, for that big scene, for that fancy dialog. Real life is not like that. We don't need big loud special effects, nasty four letter words to show strength or frustration, no loud jarring scores or unnecessary love songs. In fact, there is barely any music here, and yet... I felt I heard the music of love.A few weeks ago I thought \"The Impossible\" was the best of the year. It's an amazing film, but not as grand and perfect as this film has proved to be. It's a treat, sweet, bittersweet, as good as it gets.",

            "content": "Amour opens in a way that suggests you may be about to see a police procedural film of some kind. You aren't - but there is something of that genre to this remarkable film as after the first few minutes we go back to understand the series of events that have led us to find an aged woman lying dead in her bed, surrounded by flowers.The film is replete with lengthy shots from a stationary camera, meaning that we start to feel as if we actually live with the central character, and also to allow us to meditate on small details as opposed to simply focussing on grand gestures. The couple' life together is reshaped when the wife has a stroke and we witness the gradual deterioration of her health and her concurrent forced dependence on those around her. In showing this dependence, the film is almost unbearably sad in its portrayal of the frustrations and indignities that all (not just the one who is sick alone) experience in these situations.But it's not just sad. It's also incredibly beautiful; these multiple times a day indignities come laced with small, almost sacramental acts of devotion and love, even as the family's relationships are stretched to near breaking point.As we near a conclusion, the film becomes shocking and upsetting; but it has earned the right to be this by the unflinching honesty and compassion with which it has shown us all that has gone before. There will be sharp divisions in how viewers react to the last 30 minutes or so; but in showing us so much with such care, we find ourselves led to somewhere very few films manage to get to.This is a profoundly empathetic film, one that has the rare courage to give us real insights into what ageing is and is not, a group which is so often voiceless in the world of the arts, and socity as a whole. It's a film I'm glad to have seen and would encourage many to see, but we should do so aware that this is no comfy watch, one that both upsets and yet also has profound insight into love in later life. Glad as I am to have seen it, I may not see it again; but whether I rewatch it or not, it will stay with me as long as I have a memory.",

            "content": "Amour is a French/German/Austrian co-production in French with English subtitles. Set in a Paris apartment, it's about an elderly French couple \u2013 retired music teachers \u2013 in the last stage of their lives, when the wife becomes seriously ill after suffering two strokes, and how the husband looks after her until she dies. This may sound like a grim idea for a movie, but the director, Michael Haneke, is a cinematic master, and with the aid of two superb actors has managed to make it absolutely as riveting as any thriller. He directed from his own script, which was based on an actual life experience he himself had when his aunt passed away. The couple is played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva, both in their 80's, and both of whom are terrific - and completely convincing. Riva's depiction of a woman suddenly going through the most horrific physical decline is harrowing to watch. This is very difficult subject matter but it has been handled with sensitivity and taste, and is never either overdone nor sentimental. It's called Amour because of this happily married couple's love for each other, but what it explores is how this love can survive when the one partner becomes a real burden to the other. All of this is played out with meticulous attention to detail and a vast range of emotions, and thanks to Heneke's astuteness, the film maintains an amazing, almost clinical ability to soberly grip our interest yet never arouse our emotions to the point where we are overwhelmed. Full kudos go to the supporting cast and the rest of Heneke's team, most notably Isabelle Huppert as the couple's bewildered daughter, Darius Khondji for his brilliant lighting throughout, and Monika Willi for editing. Of particular cinematic note is Heneke's use of shots held for a very long time, which amazingly don't become static but seem to keep growing in interest. It makes a refreshing change from the fast editing, and rapid flipping from shot to shot, which we have got used to in films in the last couple of decades. It gives one a more theatrical viewing experience, but it works because the angles and compositions are carefully chosen, and because short shots are also included when they are appropriate, so there is plenty of variety. The other interesting point is the sound effects, which I've never known to be used more effectively, and for once the hi-fi digital sound shows some superiority in terms of meaning. In this picture every single sound is significant. To name just one example, even the sound of a person breathing tells a story. Also, Heneke sometimes uses the sound to really startle us, as in the opening scene. Amour is a valid picture of an all-too-common aspect of human life, as well as a reinforcing tribute to the importance of love and caring, all encased in a piece of cinematic brilliance.

            "content": "Sometimes I find it difficult to watch realistic movies mainly because I can't help but place myself in the characters shoes. For instance, 2011's The Descendants. The Descendants felt so genuine, and the situation at hand was a terrible one, and I did not want to place myself in poor Matt King's(George Clooney) shoes. 2012 has found yet another movie that will have that effect, and it is Michael Haneke's Amour, which is even more painful.The film revolves around an old couple (played perfectly by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emanuelle Riva). Both happily married music teachers in their 80's, their lives come to a halt when she develops Alzheimer's. He's basically trying to keep her happy, but she is another story. There is a point in the movie where she tells him that she's done and she isn't going to fight it. That's a very heartbreaking scene.Hell, every scene is a heartbreaking scene. Depression hurts, Symbalta can't help this time. Amour is a gut-wrenching movie that does not sugar-coat death. No siree Bob. I don't think that this movie could've worked without the talent of Riva, who received a well deserved Oscar nomination and soon to be win, and Trintignant, who should've been nominated.At least The Descendants showed us the bright side. Amour does not. It places you in the couple's shoes, and it makes you feel Trintignants pain as his wife is slowly dying. Foreign movies aren't typically nominated for Best Picture. Hell, Pans Labyrinth wasn't even nominated. But they picked a good one this time. Bring some anti-depressants. You're not going to feel good. I know it seems like I don't like it but actually it's quite the opposite. Amour is a great movie that masters loss. I haven't seen loss depicted this better in a long time. Amour will shock you, and you might not even know how to look at it. But it needs to be seen.A",

One day Anne gets a stroke and the marriage between her and Georges is severely tested, a few days after Anne found out she had a stroke their daughter Eva (played by Isabella Huppert) visits their home on a frequent basis though one of the times is with her husband (played by William Shimell) in order to get news of what is happening, as well as news about her current condition.

            "content": "With an incredible opening that calls to mind the closing shot of Cache, Michael Haneke begins his 2012 film, Amour by placing his camera on an audience as they prepare then start to listen to a piano concert. Showing the crowd as they settle into their seats then watch the performance, Haneke allows his subjects to blend into the crowd without calling attention to them. Masterfully, we are shown everyone without focusing on anyone. This beautiful humanist opening seems to communicate to the audience that we all live our existences, yet, experience the world among a collection of people that are also living individual lives. A brilliant bit of foreshadowing to his most overtly humanist film, Michael Haneke also informs the audience from the opening shot that the movie we are watching is one focused on the act of observation. Not only do we begin the journey by observing, we then continue observing our subjects, observing their life, age, and union.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne, (Emmanuelle Riva) a pair of retired music teachers have enjoyed their long lives together living blissfully for themselves. Their daughter Eva, (Isabelle Huppert) enjoys success as a musician, traveling through Europe while on tour leaving the couple to enjoy the life they have built together. However, an intrusion into their cultivated lives interrupts their well-manicured existences. On the evening of the concert, they arrive home to find their front lock disrupted as it appears someone attempted to break-in. The two take the incident in stride vowing to call someone the next day to fix the lock. The audience watches the couple change their clothes, put their shoes and coats away, and commence their nightly bedtime routine. Likewise the next morning, Anne prepares breakfast as she always does, Georges remarks that the salt shaker is empty before refilling it, and the morning commences, as mundane as any other. That average day comes to a crashing halt when Anne freezes in what she is doing at the table and Georges in unable to get her attention. We soon find out that Anne has suffered a stroke, and just as an unknown intruder interrupted their lives the previous evening, so has another black cloud encroached upon their lives. This unwelcome guest in the form of a stroke takes its toll on Anne as the audience watches her begin a steep decline physically and mentally. Georges shifts his role from partner to caretaker, resolved to keep his wife's wishes to remain in her home. Preserving his wife's dignity in this way also means Georges must lose himself in the helpless observation of being unable to help Anne recover, only able to keep her comfortable through her decline. The close observation Georges experiences of watching Anne's decline reminds the audience that the inevitability of death spares none of us. The film also dispels the notion that there is any death that comes easy. We fool ourselves into believing that the older we are, the more we are accepting of death we become, and as the deterioration of our bodies progresses, accept the end of our lives more so than in our youth. That, of course, may be true for some, but on the whole human beings avoid accepting their mortality at all costs. The idea that it is easier to accept the death of an older person because we can comfort ourselves and say things like \"they lived a full life\" is a misconception. Georges shows a decline, just as Anne does, but his is from dealing with the heartache and despair of watching his lifelong partner succumb leaving him with an inevitable void. There is no sense of ease in Georges' preparation of the loneliness he will endure in a life without Anne, simply because she's in her 80's. Georges still loves her, and is completely devoted to the life the pair has created. Often in end-of-life care, we neglect the fact that the person responsible for the caretaking is also losing someone and facing the reality of preparing for a life alone. In the most subtle ways, Haneke shows the weariness grow on Georges' face the longer he cares for his dying wife. Still, though, Georges' commitment to his wife's wishes and desire to fulfill them illustrates to the audience that the bonds we form through our relationships make life worth living. Just as Ingmar Bergman is often cited as being too world-weary and bleak, so too is Michael Haneke. Amour stands as proof that Michael Haneke makes his films from a deeply humanist place and cares profoundly for both the characters he creates and the audience that watches his films.The future and one's mortality has an interesting relationship with the past. Amour does a brilliant job of expressing how comforting it is to reminisce about the past when the future looks bleak or uncertain. As the stroke occurred, Georges was sharing with Anne a story from his past that she had never heard before. The tale Georges shared was one that reminds the audience that observation is the cornerstone of the film, as the story he shares recalls the emotional response he had to seeing a particular film in his youth. Each time that Anne shows a new decline in her health, Georges comforts her with a story about his past. Rather than recounting stories about their marriage, Georges recalls memories of his youth, driving home the point that he is uncertain and uncomfortable with his future and is also finding solace in returning to thoughts of the past. When Georges tells his daughter Eva about her mother's health woes, she immediately recalls a memory from the past, and remarks that it brought her comfort. Repeatedly returning to the past proves a comfort to Georges, Anne, and their family exploring the link between mortality and the past in an interesting way.\nI've spent many months marveling at the directorial mastery of Michael Haneke, and I was just as impressed as I have been through this entire project through my viewing of Amour. I am enchanted by the way Haneke revels in the day-to-day life of his subjects, both making them more relatable to the audience and driving home the impression that life is made up of mostly everyday activities that rather than the significant events we often reminisce upon. In Amour, this attention to the small aspects of the day makes the impact of Anne's stroke even more potent as the disruption to their lives is made even more apparent. An element of Michael Haneke's films that I find most absorbing is his limited use of a score. Haneke doesn't rely on music to charge his audience's feelings; instead, he abandons all emotional manipulation, solely using the story for narrative impact. The casting in Amour was brilliant giving the pedigree of the two leads. Jean-Louis Trintignant has been in a number of films that rank among the best, including acting as the male lead in my mon b\u00e9b\u00e9's (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut) final film Confidentially Yours. Likewise, Emmanuelle Riva has a full resume which includes a starring role in the seminal Alain Resnais film, Hiroshima Mon Amour. Taking such notable actors who have filmed evidence from their prime and placing them in a film about aging, Haneke furthers the reality that aging is universal and even people as radiant as classic actors cannot avoid the cost of aging. Calling to mind the backgrounds of two of the finest French actors of their time was a brilliant addition to the reality of aging in Michael Haneke's Amour. Much like his 2009 film, The White Ribbon, Michael Haneke creates a Tarkovsky inspired film in Amour. Much of Haneke's framing and shots are reminiscent of the extraordinary Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky throughout his entire filmography, but especially so in both of his Palme d'Or winners. Such clear Tarkovsky inspiration works well for both of these films due to their somber look at human malevolence in The White Ribbon, and mortality in Amour. The ways in which Haneke can communicate the themes of his films through such subtle cinematic language is why he stands at the top of the list among the best working directors.Amour represents a departure from the type of film I've grown to expect from Michael Haneke; it is overtly sentimental, touching and heartwarming, and effortlessly beautiful. Haneke completely disappears, creating almost a documentarian view on end-of-life care and commentary on aging. As someone who has immersed myself in his films, I find all of Haneke's filmography incredibly Humanistic, though, to the average viewer or someone new to Haneke, his humanism is most evident in Amour. The collective conscience Haneke brings to life in the film acts as a stunning reminder that each of us shares our experience in the world with each other, and no matter how upsetting it is to consider, we all will meet the same fate at the end of our lives. Michael Haneke also honors his subjects, revealing that growing old with another person isn't the horror it's made out to be. If only each of us could be so lucky to find a Georges or an Anne to traverse our lives with; someone who could remain so devoted to our wishes even at the most trying times and do anything in their power to stay with us until the end. Beautiful, heartwrenching, and captivating, Amour disproves the notion that Michael Haneke is a cold, emotionless filmmaker.",

            "content": "Amour (or Love) is a 2012 film by Michael Haneke and won a 2013 Oscar for Best Non-English Film, and I must mention that the film still has an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, Best Leading Actress, Best Original Screenplay and Best director. The film also won numerous other awards and nominations.In preparation for this film, I decided to watch a few older Haneke films (three to be exact) that have pretty good reviews and I absolutely didn't like any of them, but not at all. The director's signature is visible in all the films, which in principle I think is great because he has his own vision and direction, so he sticks to it. I appreciate originality. However, longer shots, trivial conversations, reduced number of shots, lack of emotions, generally looking at an artsy approach and necessarily a shocking dose of a disturbing event is a recipe that is not for my taste.Given the numerous awards and generally great reviews, I thought this film would be a little different. I was horribly mistaken.The film begins with a scene that chronologically takes place at the very end. That in itself isn't a bad thing, but it creates some kind of expectation throughout the film. The main characters are Anne and Georges, an elderly couple who are in their eighties, retired music teachers. During breakfast together, Anne simply \"froze\" during the conversation, as if she had wandered off with her thoughts and returned after a few minutes of \"absence\" without remembering what had happened. She had a stroke and they go to the hospital for an operation which unfortunately worsens the condition of our protagonist, she remains deprived on the right side. Georges returns her home, caring for her for 24 hours (since she is now disabled) and must promise her that he will not take her to the hospital. Of course, this event irreversibly changes their lives.My biggest problem with the film lies in the title. I absolutely never felt any love. The film definitely belongs to some kind of art genre and you can see that. The script is much shorter considering that the film lasts a full 2 hours, there are not many shots (the whole action takes place in their apartment), the scenes last a relatively long time (for example a scene with a pigeon). Many call this a masterpiece, but I don't see anything spectacular or interesting here. It's not a problem to admit it's up to me. The relationship between the two spouses at times seems robotic and devoid of emotion so at one point I didn't care at all because I didn't connect with them. Scenes that were annoying to watch or that contain something shocking (Btw this director's film has by far the least disturbing and shocking things) don't touch me emotionally because I don't care about the main characters. For example, if I watch a horror movie where a villain catches and / or kills a person, the fact that the scene is tense does not make the film quality for me because they are ordinary characters that I don't care about. Here is a kind of parallel to give a little idea of my perspective.The positive thing about this film is that Haneke has remained true to himself, his technique and style, so if you love his films, this one will definitely be (at least) good for you. Although his films, given the plot, can easily last (at least!) half as long. The main actors carried the burden of the film well, but I don't think they had any room for characterization and progress.The point of the film deviates from my thinking, but even here I see that the director stayed true to himself because each of his films ends so it should shock (if I were rude I would say wake up, but I won't write it) viewers, and I don't see any point in that .A big disappointment remains in me after watching the movie because I didn't feel any warmth from the movie called Love.",

The film revolves around an elderly couple in which the wife is struck severely ill by a stroke and the husband is required to painstakingly take care of her (which takes it's toll on both of them). The film was written and directed by Michael Haneke, who experienced something similar in his own family. It's extremely slow moving and sad but it's sure to touch almost anyone, especially those who've experienced similar emotional drama and suffering.Jean-Louis Trintignan stars as Georges and Emmanuelle Riva plays Anne, a couple in their eighties who are retired music teachers. Anne suffers a stroke and needs surgery. The surgery goes bad and leaves her partially paralyzed and unable to walk. Georges promises to take care of her and never put her in a hospital or nursing home. As Anne grows more ill and less and less coherent the promise becomes very hard for Georges to keep and both their lives become miserable. Things are further put to the test by their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), who keeps showing up to check on them and insists Anne be put in a hospital.The movie is very depressing and I didn't care for the ending much at all (but it's understandable in some ways). The film is also painstakingly and deliberately slow paced. I think Haneke wants to put the viewer through the same kind of mind-numbing experience that the characters are going through but it certainly makes it hard to sit through. Haneke also wrote and directed the outstanding thriller 'FUNNY GAMES' (the original and it's American remake), which was deliberately slow paced as well but that really served the creepy mood and tension of the film well. 'AMOUR' is very emotional (at times) and a great tale of love (which is the English translation of the title) but I didn't find it nearly as moving or as impressive a film as some. I don't think I'm it's target audience though. For the right viewer I'm sure it's a much more impressive film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk",

            "content": "I watched Amour (Love) yesterday morning at the Cannes Film Festival, though an eight am screening every seat of the massive Palais auditorium was filled, expectation was so high that I found it impossible to get a ticket for the evening screening. It was the hottest ticket of the festival so far. For those that love Haneke's style of filmmaking, this film will not disappoint, the camera never moves, locked tripod mounted shots roll for several minutes whilst characters walk in and out of frame, action takes place often off camera, this all forces the viewer to concentrate more, in a similar way to Hidden we look around the screen searching for meaning and intent. All the three main performances were realistic, believable, exceptional, the son and all other characters appear only in one scene. Was this a great film, sadly no. Though the run time was just over two hours, in my opinion time was squandered on needlessly long running locked camera scenes with little or no action or meaning communicated whatsoever, again on a slow montage sequence of the rooms of the couples paintings in their residence, a similar one of the empty rooms of their flat at night, a view of an audience sitting down and the preparations till a musical recital to begin, all simply wasted so much time that could have been much better filled with more narrative and dramatic sequences that could have fleshed out the spartan build up the dramatic final scenes, given them more foundation and depth, this left me both disappointed and unsatisfied. For example, a sudden violent reaction seemed brutal and completely unjustified in reaction to an act of passive defiance, I understand that every member of the audience is capable and willing to fill in the missing scenes but Haneke one again does not even attempt to portray a satisfying narrative, so the violent act seems therefore completely out of character, simply because no effort had been made to show a dramatic build up to justify such a savage reaction, I was shocked for all the wrong reasons, rather than empathise with a person acting out of character through despair after their love had eroded after long period of time, I instead found myself initially reading the violent act at mean and cruel (I'm sure this wasn't the intent). This was simply clumsy and completely unnecessary given the time that could been used more productively, time was repeatedly squandered wastefully on slow shots previously giving little or nothing in the way of information, simply poor story telling from someone fully capable of doing so much more. Therefore the result...no White Ribbon, probably my least favourite of his films so far, a big disappointment and a missed opportunity, wonderful actors, totally relevant subject matter, though poorly handled.",

There is a reason why this movie is being hyped and raved about at this particular time given the current political climate. It was basically a propaganda film for assisted suicide. It's called \"predictive programming\". All films are made for a purpose ( not just entertainment), to introduce memes into the public that they hope will one day be accepted as \"normal\" and quite acceptable, and this film was no different. I think one reviewer mentioned that the main character wasn't even likable. Exactly. It would have left the viewer with ambiguous feelings about the idea of early termination vs prolonged palliative care if this elderly womans character had been developed into a a lovable, likable, effervescent one.I say stay away from this flick, unless you want to watch a cold, flat , depressing disguised documentary on aging.",

A ride that has a few things to deliver that you may not expect (a nightmare, a somewhat philosophical/dream sequence) and some other things, that do break with the realness. But not in a bad way.

            "content": "This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I went with a friend and both of us generally enjoy French films. There were six other people in the full size theatre with us. Towards the end of the film, Georges buys flowers and returns home. He then dodderingly starts cutting the heads off the daisies, one painstakingly slow flower at a time. The scene goes on ... and on ... and on ... This scene typifies the main problem with the movie. The director thinks that these long, long, long shots with nothing happening in them are 'art'. When the movie finished shortly afterwards, my friend turned to me and said 'Did you see that there were another 3 bunches of flowers in the bucket? I was petrified!' After two plus hours of grindingly depressing misery, the two of us started laughing hysterically. We got filthy looks from the other six people in the theatre, as the credits rolled, but we were still laughing 20 minutes later over coffee.So maybe it's actually supposed to be a comedy and just not too many people get it.The two lead actors are totally convincing and are rightly revered as legends in French film. They're the reason that this film gets at least one star. But they need to be reprimanded strongly for signing up to this miserable excuse for a film. The 'arty types' who profess to 'love' this film supposedly about 'Love' don't realise that they are quite possibly the victims of a massive practical joke. There is nothing remotely entertaining about this movie. Other than potentially twenty minutes of hysterical laughter after it's (finally) over.",

I had heard two things about the film going in. One group saying it was nothing more than a snoozefest and another saying it was a masterpiece. After around 45 minutes I feared the former was going to be the case. But after that point it had me hooked. Two amazing actors telling an amazing story. What more could you ask for? Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva had me absolutely captivated throughout. They had patience, they had class and they made it believable. They made me feel and understand the situation they were in. Their performances never varied in consistency for a single moment, which, performing at that age, I'd imagine is an extremely tough thing to achieve. Bravo to the two of them and I'm so glad Riva has been honored with an Academy Award nomination. Her performance had shades of Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream, who in my opinion was robbed of an Oscar win. Maybe Riva will have better luck.The story itself is simple, but so so effective. We follow a couple in their eighties after the wife has a series of strokes, and how they come to deal with this unfortunate situation. Michael Haneke takes us on a powerful journey which is anything but easy to watch. He shows his ability to put us in the characters shoes and think about our own mortality, while never wavering from the story before our eyes. He shoots in a unique style and shows the utmost patience with every scene. He basically says to the audience \"Bored? I couldn't care less.\" Finally he delivers quite possibly the most powerful scene I've ever witnessed. I was stunned by it. I don't think I'll ever get that scene out of my mind as long as I live. Bravo Mr Haneke! If you have the patience (it does take a little bit) then you will be greatly rewarded. Love stories in film come and go. Some stick with you, others not so much. Generally we're used to seeing two attractive, charismatic, twenty-somethings in our modern love stories. Amour is different. It's unique. It doesn't cave in to clich\u00e9s. It's not trying to give the viewer a heart- warming feeling. It's showing true love amongst tragedy. What would you do in the given situation? It's something you might find yourself asking yourself afterwards. It's probably impossible to know without really experiencing it, but it's interesting to wonder all the same. I have a feeling I'm going to be thinking about this beautiful film for a long time to come.",

            "content": "A friend recently sent me a PowerPoint file \u2013 one of those that are regularly circulating the Internet. At first glance, it contained some relatively good black and white photos. In the end, however, there was a revelation that left the viewer speechless: these were not photographs but drawings made by hand! My initial, spontaneous reaction was, \"what an artist\"! I then thought it over: Is it really the purpose of Art a faithful and accurate depiction of reality? If so, then what necessitated such a painstaking effort on the part of the sketcher? Even a moderately talented photographer would have undoubtedly done a better job! Imitating the perfection of photography is not a matter of Art; rather, it is a matter of technique! Similar comments apply to the cinema. Thus, for example, the creation of a film that mimics the (often hard) realism of a documentary, without the necessary symbolic intervention of a more personal philosophical or ideological filter, may be the work of a good technician but hardly that of an artist. These were my thoughts as I watched the end credits of Michael Haneke's \"Amour\" (France-Germany-Austria, 2012). Using two brilliant veteran actors (Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva) and taking advantage of his directorial perfectionism where even the slightest detail counts (the first scene with the pigeon, whose shadow is momentarily visible on the glass as the bird flies off the window, deserves an Oscar in itself!), Haneke succeeds in creating a perfect representation of \"next- door misery\". However, where exactly is Art in all this? Many viewers may have hastened to recognize a \"humanitarian\" transformation of Haneke since the notoriously sadistic \"Funny Games\" (1997). Please allow me to question the \"humanism\" of \"Amour\". Personally, I detected a more elaborately disguised sadism toward the viewer, whom the director continues to \"punish\" for seeing his films! In a sense, the feelings of horror in \"Funny Games\" are somewhat softened by the totally unrealistic nature of the plot. In \"Amour\", on the contrary, the director plays almost malevolently with the worst fears of everyday people, notably, their vulnerability to illness and death... I continue to believe that the main purpose of Art is to create beauty \u2013 even when representing the ugly and unpleasant sides of life. Art, therefore, is expected to function as a therapist of the soul. The cruel \u2013even if technically masterful\u2013 imitation of harsh reality, without the balsam of catharsis so desperately needed by the soul, constitutes, in my opinion, a deflection from the primary objectives of Art. I might even call it a forgery of life!",

            "content": "I very much appreciated this film because it deals courageously and directly with incapacity and death which, despite their universality as human experience, are rarely given any media attention. That such difficult terrain is almost never explored by films or television is hardly surprising given that our culture is obsessed with escapism and addicted to consumption as if, quite literally, there were no tomorrow. Because of our culture's pathological avoidance of truth and its abuse of truth tellers, this movie, with its laser-like focus on the many indignities and the awful trials that await so many of us in our final years, could never have been made in the United States.\"Amour\" features fine performances by the two main actors, Trintignant and Riva, who make the pain and sorrow of their rapidly deteriorating lives very palpable to the viewer. The story line and cinematography are, for the most part, quite straightforward and lacking in any extraneous adornment or complexity. There is, so to speak, no gilding of the lily of decrepitude and death, and this is very much to the film's credit. Here we are given, with admirable economy, the facts of life for adults.My one quibble about this movie is its inclusion of Isabelle Huppert, playing the role of the daughter of the elderly couple at the center of things. Huppert is a very fine actress and it is understandable that a director might want to cast her with the hope that her star power might make an otherwise unpalatable film more appealing to a wider audience. Unfortunately, Huppert's performance is unremarkable at best -- although, given the modest size and conventionality of her role, it is surprising that she manages to pull off a credible performance at all. For those who dislike the movie studios' heavy reliance on \"stars\" and go to see films based on their themes rather than the personalities who animate the themes on screen, Huppert's presence in this movie is likely to be more of a liability than an asset.",

            "content": "Finally, a film about love. That is, a film that isn't about romancing, sex, relationship troubles of the humorous or tear-jerking kind and combinations thereof resulting in sappy sentimentality's all around. All that you easily get delivered in the typical entertainment film package where a breathtaking beauty plays the unnoticed girl next door searching for eternal love, enhanced by an overblown soundtrack to get you emotionally involved. None of that, not even a glimpse of any of that, can be found in Haneke's tour de force that is \"Amour\", a demanding and brutally honest look at the consequences of a relationship that is being lived to the fullest.\"Amour\" focuses on a couple of music teachers in their eighties who have known each other for a lifetime. Step by step we are invited to explore that painful process of letting go when the person you've gotten used to and learned to love turns out to be terminally ill, transforms into someone else before your eyes. The realization eventually strikes that death is on the doorstep. One partner feels worthless, a burden and the desire to end it grows, the other tries to provide support and compassion every way possible - and both feel that way because they respect and love each other. Haneke's portrayal of dying and accompanying this death is a harrowing, visceral close to borderline experience that goes far beyond a cinematic achievement and has to be valued as such. Undoubtedly it leaves ourselves with existential repercussions, poses hard questions, initiates dialog. Above all \"Amour\" feels very real, due to the typical hallmarks of Haneke's mise en sc\u00e8ne countering everything else that contributes to what Haneke labels the \"dis-empowerment of the spectator\": The film lives from its simplicity, the camera is merely observing, supporting music is entirely lacking, emotions and suspense build naturally. To pull such a difficult picture off full dedication of both principal actors is necessary, and veterans Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva fit the bill to perfection, conveying tenderness, warmth and dignity - if we are in fact looking for what is so often buried in day to day business. It's rare for filmmakers to unflinchingly address an issue a broad audience has no intention of seeing at all, and even rarer to make no compromise whatsoever when filming it. Here's a brilliant example.",

            "review_title": "A tough but beautiful film about the universal themes of life, love and death",
            "content": "With a near forty year career, Michael Haneke has earned the title as one of the most important filmmakers making cinema today. He tells stories which many would shy away from, all containing a bleak critique on contemporary society as he sees it. You get as much from his films as the emotional baggage that you bring in with you, and his latest Palme d'Or winning Amour is no exception. Performed in his adopted-French, it's an unflinching look at a married couple coping with disease, age and the brevity of life. But we aren't voyeurs to the tragedy, we are vicariously experiencing it.Amour's premise is simple, but resting underneath is a film of great depth and heart. After a stroke leaves her left-side paralysed, former piano teacher Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) is cared for by her doting husband Georges (Jean-Louis Trignant). Much to their daughter's dismay (played by Haneke regular Isabelle Huppert), Georges promises that she will never be transferred to a care home or hospital, content that she will die in her home, in her own bed, surrounded by the books she once read and the piano she played so beautifully. Anne's deteriorating health puts a stress on their relationship and soon Georges' unequivocal love he had for his wife of many years turns into a burden, further destructing his own grip on reality and reason.Before all that, Amour opens with Anne's body being discovered by the state officials and apartment block residents. Just like real life, Haneke wants us to know exactly where the film will terminate; but - again, just like life - we have no idea how we'll get there. It's a masterstroke of reflexivity, made even more pertinent when the following scene swoops in on a packed opera house, with the audience transfixed on the stage - AKA the camera and right into us - and waiting for their production to start. Maybe it has already begun.The smallest scale Haneke film of recent memory, aside from the above sequence, it's shot entirely from the Parisian apartment. Through his quintessential lingering long-takes, we see the remnants of a better time: with extravagant paintings, photographs and two lifetime's worth of bookshelf literature. For most of us, we've had to go through moments of grieving in our lives; if not, we've certainly been in the homes' of elderly people just like this one. So many fond memories, there's still some dark, dank corners and unopened doors, reflecting that this is not only George and Anne's sanctuary, but also a sort of self inflicted prison sheltering themselves from the outside world.With his last major film appearance in Kieslowlski's masterful Troi Colors: Red from 1994, Haneke begged Jean-Louis Trignant to come out of a seven year retirement for the role of the stoic, considerate Georges. And for good reason. The stoney-faced rock in the relationship, he embodies a strength and wiseness which cements the film's emotive impact. Whilst his 86- year-old co-star Emmanuelle Riva is devastatingly good as the debilitating Anne. She's also beautiful too, going through the realistic degradation which Haneke puts her through, she still has that bejewelled glimmer in her eye. It may sound crass to determine their performances as methodical but, both approaching the final twilights of their life, Trignant and Riva bring a brutal sincerity to the film which could never have been faked. If the Academy Awards judges have any sense, they'll give both acting gongs to these fading stars of French cinema, from new wave to the present day.It's not Haneke's most \"entertaining\" film (that's still 2005's Cache), but it's perhaps his most impactful. It really is a tough two hour experience, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is suffering from a recent bereft. But the film is oddly cathartic too. Whether we go willingly or not, Haneke forces us into Georges' shoes, and we listen in to every one of Anne's screams and incoherent ramblings as if she was our own family. Ultimately, she is a burden for Georges, but his determination right up to the shocking end is proves that the beneath Haneke's stark surface is a core of humility and humanity, just like all of us.In Woody Allen's classic 1975 comedy, Love & Death, Diane Keaton's Sonja turns to Woody and says \"to love is to suffer\". Move forward 37 years, Haneke has taken this sentiment to heart and created one of the most truthful portrayals of love and death every encapsulated on screen.Read more reviews at www.366movies.con",

Georges takes meticulous care of his declining pianist wife while their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), attempts to thwart the loss of mom, despite dad's gentle, doting care. In this cloistered den, inhabited by book shelves and Persian rugs, the specter of death pervades a genteel home, while Georges and Eva are powerless to stop it.The director's spare style of static camera and slightly cluttered mise en scene contributes to the feeling of mortality among things that promise permanence. Small events like a faucet not turned off and a lock broken by an intruder support that sense of impending loss.Like Sarah Polley's Away from Her, which treats of Alzheimer's, Amour is an uncompromising depiction of aging while it imbues the screenplay with dignity. Writing this review before the Oscars, I can't believe anyone except Emmanuelle Riva will win for best actress. Regardless, she has my vote for best performance of 2012 and one of the best in film history.Georges summarizes the emotional effect this memorable film may have on the audience when he talks of his reaction to a movie he saw long ago:\"I don't remember the film either. But I remember the feeling. That I was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when I was actually watching the film, and that I just couldn't stop.\"",

            "content": "A door is smashed open by police, the smell makes them blanche and inside, laid lovingly upon a bed with a halo of petals, is the body of an elderly woman. But this isn't murder; this is Amour.There are certain aspects of love that one cannot truly appreciate until one owns the experience. For that reason, each viewer's experience of Amour is his or her own unique ratio of shared understanding and involvement to sympathetic, or perhaps wide-eyed, voyeurism. Just as Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) have invested fully in their marriage, so must you invest fully in the depiction of their relationship to appreciate the rewards.Musical, cerebral octogenarians, Georges and Anne, are devoted to each other. Their marriage has survived a daughter who judges them from a safe distance, their own stubborn routines and an untold lifetime of highs and lows. When Anne suffers the first of two strokes, the foundation upon which they built their lives together is challenged and their strength is questioned.Amour is not a film that rattles towards a surprising conclusion but is a painful, meandering journey that we are permitted to witness. Much that occurs has no explanation and no apparent reason, but that is the way of life. There is no explanation given for a scene in which a pigeon struts along the hallway; it is just another quirk of Georges' existence as he nurses his dying wife.There are supporting actors who add texture to Amour, not least of all Isabelle Huppert as Eva, the daughter who is both angry with and incapable of understanding her father or bridging the chasm of her own creation, but this is largely a film of two sensitive, performances. Riva displays the more obvious character evolution from self-assured, no-nonsense matriarch to a contorted, confused husk and her performance is as awe-inspiring as it was demanding. This isn't a mere representation of a woman decaying physically and mentally; this is a window to a very real, very painful death.Trintignant is absolutely her equal, though the progression of Georges' anguish is less obvious. Never once does he bellow or cry or scream at an unseen God. Even when Eva bursts in with another shovel full of accusations, his reaction is quiet determination fused with resigned exhaustion. His own physical demise is palpable but not accentuated in the way Anne's must be. His annoyance is understandable and, on the one occasion he vocalizes it, his subject is entirely deserving of more venom than he cares to inject into his argument. He is outwardly stoical, but quietly suffering his own agony and his own gradual decay as he ambles along in his hopeless cause.Michael Haneke's sensitive direction doesn't pull punches but rather allows us to understand the complete story of their lives and draw our own conclusions. He does not attempt to tell us everything because, as mere observers, how can we ever truly know the intricacies of other's lives? Six times nominated, Haneke collected his second Palme d'Or for Amour (his first was for 2009's The White Ribbon) and will surely gather an armful of awards before the season is out, as will his principal actors. Whether Amour includes Oscars amongst its haul, at the possible expense of the harrowing Jagten, remains to be seen.The impact of Amour is gentler than that of Jagten and one emerges from the screening room more thoughtful than moved or outraged but it haunts the mind equally and Schubert's Impromptu will conjure fresh emotions and images in future.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",

The story concerns the final months of life of an octogenarian couple living in an apartment in Paris, France. The woman suffers one stroke, then another and her husband struggles to take care of her. Their well-off daughter, while outwardly distressed at her mother's plight, reveals her own self-centred concerns when she confronts her father with the level of care he is providing to his wife of many years.Make no mistake about it \u2013 this movie has been beautifully written, directed, filmed and acted. There is no doubt that Amour is a masterpiece of the genre; there are moments that will shock you and others that will bring you close to tears. But there is no slushy sentiment here. The film deals matter of factly with the harsh realities of life, of human frailties, of immensely strong and also sadly shallow characters. You become immersed in the fortunes and struggles of this ageing, loving couple and everything they say and do is utterly believable.For those of you who enjoy a movie full of action, blood and guts, this French film noire is not for you, but for those who are tired of the formulaic nonsense that is churned out by the Hollywood moguls, you might want to try something different \u2013 something that is thought provoking and takes you out of yourself for an hour or so.

Almost all of the eligible voters for the Oscars are Baby Boomers (age 65 & up), or they are caring for declining Boomer parents. This makes the French film AMOUR their version of a slasher flick for teens: pure horror. Echoing the plaintive wail of Dorothy Gale which played on TV every Easter during their childhood (i.e., \"Lions, and tigers, and bears--oh my!), these AMOUR fans are cringing at a real-life refrain of \"Diapers, and strokes, and death--oh my!\" This movie could have been worthy of a 10 rating, but it went in for being overly accommodating by dispensing with a musical score (no doubt figuring its target audience wouldn't be able to hear it, anyway, and would appreciate a less cluttered audio background to hear what the geezers are jabbering about in French). If this is stroke lady's first topless nude scene, she probably deserves a special Oscar for breaking Julie Andrews' record!",

This movie clearly has too much space; the film pacing is sometimes excruciatingly slow. The subject matter, how one aging married person cares for his fast declining spouse, is squeamishly dark and bitter. There are some symbolic messages left to your imagination. And the final scene left a foul taste that poisoned the whole experience. In our small art picture theater, the final cut produced a collective gasp of displeasure.Looking at the face of it, however, it is clearly a well-made film on a difficult subject. The acting is superb and there is no doubt this film was artfully constructed. But, the viewer deserves to know this movie is not a touchy-feely type of experience despite the title and picture of a smiling elderly woman. It is very difficult to see the beauty behind the grisly realities.Good movie productions do not always lead to enjoyable experiences. You have been warned.",

            "content": "The scene is harrowing because of the anticipation of one of Haneke's visceral shocks but everything seems in order. The next morning, however, when they sit down for breakfast, Anne suddenly freezes and loses awareness of Georges' presence in the room and is oblivious to his questions about what is wrong. He knows something is definitely not right when she suddenly regains her faculties and has no memory of what took place. When she pours tea, the liquid misses the cup and lands on the kitchen table. Anne has suffered a stroke and, after an unsuccessful operation to remove an obstruction in her carotid artery, her left side is paralyzed and she forced to use a wheelchair.Shaken by the hospital experience, she makes her husband promise that he will never bring her again to the hospital. As Anne's condition seems to stabilize, a second stroke robs her of the ability to speak coherently and, concurrently, of her dignity. A visit by their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) who fights against acceptance of the inevitable only adds to the distress. Another visit by Alexandre is awkward and unsettling and the appearance of a pigeon that flies in from an open window seems to signal the growing feeling of being trapped. Though Amour largely avoids disturbing shocks, a dream sequence with Georges standing in the hallway with water up to his knees and a hand reaching out to grab him is a reflection of his growing terror. His patience challenged, Georges looks for a way to end the suffering.",

            "content": "While I was impressed with the director's earlier works (White Ribbon), this movie to me did not deserve to win the best Foreign Film.Okay, whatever that transpired in the events from start to finish, they may have been based on true accounts, but from what I saw, they are more voided of 'amour' which was the exact opposite of my expectations (even though the movie deliberately gave off a spoiler of the ending from the first 3 minutes of the movie).What I see throughout the whole ordeal was selfishness.Lets start of with the wife. The woman refused hospital treatment at the beginning was understandable. But when she knew later on the sacrifices her husband is doing on her behalf, if she loved him and her family enough, she should have reconsidered her decision before losing away all consciousness through a slow but degrading state of losing away one's mind. If she did consider those options somewhere along the way, the movie failed to show it. Now that is selfish.Lets go to the husband. Now that is another selfish bastard. He may be a stubborn character judging from how he treats the nurses and his own family members who doubted his intentions. That is understandable. But, he knew he was as fragile as she was (what happens if he got into an accident? Or if he ended up in the same fate as her?) He knew he was not qualified to take up such challenges all by himself. And yet, he asked for the barest minimum of assistance from nurses (who are not part of the family, they may cause trouble) and neighbours who helped with minimum chores. Now is that love? Love should have prompted him to seek help from family members - if not, he should at least seek help from his close friends, which I am sure at least one of them encountered such situations and would be able to help him. Doing all of these things alone, is hardly a moral thing to do and hardly inspiring.The daughter. She is also selfish. Based on her conversations with her father, it is clear that she was not taking it seriously. If I am in her place, and my dad refused to convey to me what was going on, I would ASK THE NEIGHBOURS, who knew their situation better than the daughter. i would ASK HIS FRIENDS. I would probe until I find out what was really wrong as soon as I suspected something about it. At the very least, if I cannot spare my own time to come over to the house, I should get myself involved in getting some really competent people (doctors, friends etc) instead of letting my own father HANDLE EVERYTHING. The movie had at the very least showed that the daughter did not care to consider or mention any of those options.Now can you tell me, if this movie deserves such a title? Maybe so, if the purpose is to force us to ponder about what is right and wrong in such situations. To me, the director should have chosen a better title. Not every viewer have the level of maturity to understand the meaning of the movie especially with such a controversial title. While the more intelligent crowd may be in awe of this movie, I feel that he had been disrespectful to the mass audience...we expected more, and most of us have parents and are expected to take care of them when they are old. Now, Haneke, are you trying to give us amour? Or making us senile and confused?",

It felt like an unpleasant content and so I let the chance slip by to see it in the movie theatre.Now a few years later I took the chance to stream it and I was rewarded with something quite unique that was neither overly unpleasant, oversentimental nor boring, another risk which I saw beforehand. The merit of the movie is definitely that it is screening an aspect of life which is usually dispelled from the film industry, that is becoming a nursing case at the very end of life. The fact that this is done in quite an unsentimental way makes the movie even more valuable because it does not try to please the audience by playing on its heart strings but shows the final decline as an unavoidable fact of life without taking the dignity from Anne.It is also very much the concern of Anne's husband, George, to keep the dignity of his wife, which even results in the attempt of shutting her away from his daughter-in-law. George may generally seem overly factual and unsentimental when explaining his wife's health status to his daughter-in-law, but this also has to do with the fact that old people tend to have a much more pragmatic approach to death than the younger generation which still believes that any problem can be resolved.There is a few other scenes that show how difficult it is for the outside world to find the right approach to a nursing case situation. The concierge and his wife really show great sympathy for the old couple and try to be helpful but in the end it turns out that they also almost forgot about them. The first nurse shows a professional approach but also her compassion is just that. No-one to blame here, that's how nurses survive. The second nurse is treating Anne like a little baby, which eventually leads to the great scene of George dismissing her for being incompetent and for undermining Anne's dignity.Technically speaking, the movie is characterized by long shots in the old couple's apartment, which is the by far dominant film location. I kind of liked this because this reflects quite well how narrow the world can become for very old people. A striking feature of the movie, however, are also its direct cuts at rather surprising moments. Quite often the next scene starts before the preceding scene seems to have come to its end. I am not quite sure whether Haneke uses this technique on purpose to demonstrate how inevitably things will take its course.Overall definitely a movie that should be considered if one is interested in seeing something appealing off the beaten track. Renowned actors contribute their share to the quality.",

In the very beginning of the movie, quick paced scenes, abrupt cuts then the camera stays static, \"open image\" focusing on the audience with a voice in \"off\"of a woman welcoming the crowd asking them to turn off their cell phones, etc... The vision we have is the one we would've if we were that presenter, such one we never see no-in one moment, neither we do see what's coming next. The character Anne now is lost in that sea of faces. The spectator awaits all the time (at least the ones whom have watched many movies) for the image to back up slowly to see the presenter that after so many applause entered the scene. From now on the \"great magician and movie maker\" Michael Hanecke \"has got you\" (Cach\u00e9)... Nothing else for you to do but to \"glue your eyes to the silver screen\" and follow the drama that's about to unfold before you, one that you'll become a par of \"that sea of faces\", even just virtually! Not to spoil the surprise that the director has reserved for us, let us approach some of the scenes worthy of figuring in a hall of one of the best scenes of all times: 1) Scene in which Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) has the first cerebral attack, eyes glazed, completely spaced out, leaving totally perplexed her husband Georges (Jean Louis Trintignant) who does not know what is going on (he thinks his wife is just joking); 2) Scene in which Anne's cold and distant gaze, for seconds transforms in hatred, when Georges refuses to perform euthanasia; 3) Scene in which it is heard an indistinctive noise, \"waking up\" Georges, whose equilibrium is already seriously compromised (he tries to get up from the bed, falls down and with much difficulty he stands up); 4) Then the noise is revealed: Anne \"reapears\" washing the dishes and turning to Georges: \"I am almost done, soon we'll be able to leave...\" Metaphoracly: the dishes(plates and cutlery and glasses) something we use to put on the thing that nourishes our bodies, water to keep us alive... Nothing more is necessary anymore... Death came to free them from the slavery; put your coat on to keep you from getting cold (death's cold). 5) Closing this magnetic movie, Eva (Isabelle Huppert) enters the apartment that served as the stage for the tragedy (now the image becomes splendorous, clear, with brighter colors) as if she had left once and for all a psychoanalyst's couch...

He has a voyeuristic style of filmmaking that's both elegant and challenging. Amour is no different and one of his most subtle and simple films. The performances are particular highlights, as it circles around the two main characters. While Emmanuelle Riva is great, an actress who I've discovered from Hiroshima Mon Amour earlier this year which is an all-time worthy turn, it is Jean-Louis Trintignant's heartbreaking performance which is truly staggering. The cinematography and art direction are also fantastic with a delicately dark colour palette. The only thing that holds it back is the pacing, with some scenes too long and some scenes too short for what they're worth, and some very cryptic scenes. Ambiguity is always in Haneke's films but I'm not a fan of the use of dream sequences here. Regardless, it's still a touching and profound film about mortality and compassion, that didn't quite meet my expectations but it's still great.8/10",

            "content": "I knew very little about this film other than it having a good reputation, supposedly being moving, and the rough subject matter. I didn't know it was from Haneke or was in French \u2013 not because I do not pay attention, but mainly because I prefer to avoid knowing too much before I see things. In this case the direction of Haneke worked very well for me. It is cold and detached perhaps, but the observational eye is fine when it has something engaging to observe.In this case it is the strong performances of Trintignant and Riva which fill the screen and are compelling in their honesty and realism. In particular, the performance of Riva is fantastic \u2013 looking back it is unsurprising but yet still frustrating that Jennifer Lawrence won Best Actress tat year for her performance in Silver Linings Playbook. The two are convincing in their very different roles: Trintignant draws our sympathy and understanding, while Riva is utterly believable in her loss of self, and it is easy to feel her pain. The action stays around the flat, using the space well, and having great set design to give the feeling of an entire life in every corner of the space.In all of this the film was moving and engaging, even if the pace was very slow for the majority. The ending of the film gave me troubles though. We know it will end in death, but the manner of the death is the murder of his wife by Georges. The film's observational eye means this very much is allowed to stand without judgment, which therefore has the effect of silently condoning it. This casts a shadow over the role of carer and lover which Georges previously held, and it did turn the film for me somewhat. I liked that it allowed me to think it through for myself, but I didn't wholly appreciate the film keeping its distance in the way it did.Mostly Amour is as good as people say, thanks mainly to the two very strong performances. However, the pace is very slow, and the ending is a touch disturbing in how it is presented and handled.",

It's much too long, with unnecessary lingering shots, sometimes of nothing, presumably to try to emphasise points, but I just found them boring. I was hypnotised by the first quarter of an hour, but that didn't hold up for the rest of the film. One further scene really grabbed my attention which I thought was going to be a really sinister storyline, but it just turned out to be a dream sequence, although a nightmare. Then it faded. Not knowing the storyline, at first I thought it was going to be about dementia, but it was about a stroke victim, played by Emmanuelle Riva. A harrowing performance I agree, but it puzzles me that she had so many accolades tossed at her, including an Oscar nomination, when in fact I thought that Jean-Louis Trintingnant's performance was much superior. All she had to do was sit or lay quietly for most of the time as she slowly acted out her demise, whereas Trintingnant has the much larger role of having to cope and care for her and express his horror and ultimately despair at her demise. He should have got the Oscar nomination in my opinion. The wonderful Isabelle Huppert has little to do as their middle aged daughter other than to add a big name. Gripping in places but ultimately too long and I thought the ending was confusing. I wasn't really sure what happened here, the director's little touch, but if that doesn't quite reach the audience and leaves them wondering, oh! what happened there, I'm not sure that's a good thing.

            "content": "Occasionally in Michael Haneke's 'Amour' you hear the piano piercingly play out the poignancy of its characters. The film is about two retired music teachers but you hardly hear music; instead there is profound silence, a symphony in itself but of pathos that you find devouring the characters. What you yearn for is to hear the voices of Anne and George, happy sounds that leap up at times, like in a scene where a paralyzed Anne attempts to sing along with her husband, who gives her speech therapy, but is only able to coo 'Dance, Dance!...' in French. What breaks your heart is watching Anne, an accomplished piano player, unable to continue her lifelong passion \u2013 music. Not for a moment are you indifferent to 'Amour'; you become a part of the couple's home, which is where almost the entire film is shot, and get such a close access to all the hardships they face that you become more than just an audience member \u2013 you feel what they feel. None of the scenes in Amour are phony even though many scenes may seem familiar, and the film is more about \"bereavement of a loved one\" than it is about \"growing old\" and anyone who has read Byron or Poe knows that the former is the most popular theme in poetry and literature. And Haneke's 'Amour' is poetry at its purest.Amour doesn't begin in silence; in fact the first thing you hear in the opening is a door being broken down by firemen to enter the couple's now desolate house. The camera tracks a person as he moves around the rooms of the house before reaching the bedroom, where he finds the lifeless body of Anne adorned with flowers. After the scene fades out, you see the entire movie in flashback beginning with the Georges and Anne taking seats in the concert where Anne's former pupil is playing. After the couple exits the hall, Anne's pupil Alexandre greets them; here again the camera only moves to track Alexandre walking to the couple. The camera stays immobile during the next few scenes, allowing us to watch them the way we think of our 'grandparents'; think about it, you'll always have a picture of the two old people together who pass the remaining years of their lives silently, undisturbed. It is only when Georges calls out Anne (the first time we hear her name in the film) and she doesn't respond that the camera cuts to a closer shot of Georges \u2013you realize as Georges does that something's wrong. After Anne is admitted to the hospital, a mistake in the surgery paralyzes the right side of her body. She makes Georges promise not to take her to the hospital or nursing home, despite their daughter Eva's insistence, and so is taken care at home by her husband and a temporary nurse. Anne is sharp and curt to Georges whenever he tries helping her as she hates being treated 'as a cripple' (in one scene, she tells him \"not to watch her turn the pages of her book as she's still sane\") but as her condition deteriorates, she is unable to perform basic functions and has to be helped for everything. Her speech, memory, everything fades away slowly until the inevitable moment, which although we did anticipate still remains a touchingly unexpected one because it comes so suddenly.We get very familiarized with the decor in the couple's home, the array of books and files in their living room, the white lamps, the red curtain, the red carpet, the piano, the paintings etc because the camera wants us to be connected with the space. There's even a strongly effective montage sequence of the different rooms and later of the paintings that hang in the rooms. Imagine just how Anne's life, one ripe and lively, slowly ebbed into dismalness here as her home and later her bedroom became her only world, and without Georges' unconditional presence and love, even this world's little happiness would've been taken away. My late grandmother spent the last six years of her life bedridden, suffering from cancer, osteoporosis and dementia, and there was nothing that could be done except give her as much care as possible. Unfortunately, her husband had already died twenty years ago and there was no one who could, in those six painful years, give her love and care that her late husband, despite his weakness, would've given had he been alive. I'm sure the characters in 'Amour' would be very familiar to many people who've seen their parents or grandparents in their final days (and so some people complain that the film is predictable), but Amour is a film that truthfully, touchingly, poignantly and heartbreakingly lowers its curtain upon the fading days of a being. I watched my grandmother lay there silently as long, unending days of pain eroded her life slowly, and I couldn't do anything but watch her fade. I didn't have the nerves to ease her pain, although the pillow just lay there",

            "content": "Amour is the story of Anne and Georges, elderly music teachers living in Paris. When Anne suffers a debilitating series of strokes, Georges becomes her carer as her decline perpetuates. I should explain that from the outset that I have worked as a professional domiciliary carer and situations like that of Georges and Anne are all too familiar to me as is their story. What Michael Haneke has done so well here is two fold. Firstly he has raised an issue that most people choose to ignore until they are forced to confront it by the ill health of a parent if not themselves. Also he illustrates the everyday beauty of devotion. A pigeon flies through an open window, Georges immediately goes to close Anne's bedroom door. As Anne ails George simply continues, he cleans her he tends her personal care even though he is exhausted and broken. Why? Because that is all that can be done in his eyes. As the film unfolds a portrait of two lives is revealed. As Anne's condition worsens guilt, anger, and frustration are examined. One particularly poignant scene for me features George dismissing a carer who treated Anne roughly and unprofessionally, this touched me very much personally and I hope that people realise that this kind of situation is not by any means rare.Amour is not an unusual story, personally I have seen it dozens of times myself and been fortunate enough to be involved in the lives of some wonderful people just like Anne and Georges. However for most this film will be an eye opener, and possibly one they would much rather not think about. Michael Haneke never shies away from the unpalatable or taboo and I feel he must really be commended on this film in particular. It is brave, intimate, very very frank and realistic. All of this is bolstered by an absolutely staggering performance by Emmanuelle Riva as Anne which is worth watching this movie for on it's own merit. I have seen my fair share of stroke patients and nursed several long-term and I can honestly say, if I didn't know for a fact that this woman was acting I would not have been able to tell the difference.Amour is a film which oozes brilliance and true directorial maturity, in this sense it is for cinema lovers, it is impeccably made and scripted. It is a film which perhaps many middle aged people may identify with. It is probably also not a film for the faint-hearted, here you will find hardcore human emotion which again, is nothing unexpected for those who know Haneke. Like Funny Games, Amour is a film that will stay with you for a very long time because it does not just touch on emotions, it plays them like a symphony. As wonderful, impeccably made and memorable a film as this is- whether you watch Amour more than once is another matter entirely, you really have to see it to understand why. 9/10",

            "content": "It is awards season now and like probably most of the film lovers I'm trying to watch all of the serious contenders. The latest I've watched is \"Amour\" (\"Love\"), new work from acclaimed German director Michael Haneke. The film already won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, swept the European Film Awards, and won most of the year's Best Foreign Language Film awards including a Golden Globe, as well as got nominated for five Oscars and a lot more. All of that gave me more than enough reason to view it, and the film itself gave me more than enough reason to review it.After dealing with causes in \"Das wei\u00dfe Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte\" (\"The White Ribbon\"), his previous work, in \"Amour\" Haneke deals with consequences. The causes and consequences are of different things, true, but that is not so important. It is the shift of focus from one to another which is interesting. While Haneke was always the one to ask questions, this time it feels more like he's making a statement. To be clear, his treatment of the subject matter is for the most part equally restrained here as is in his other recent works. He stays an objective observer of the elderly couple dealing with death, not once trying to sentimentalize the situation or lead the viewer towards some specific point of view. Yet the feeling I got is that the whole story is a message how things should be, a message that says the way Georges care for Anne and subjects his life to her is the right thing to do.It could very well be so because of Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant, actors playing the couple. Their performances are so sincere and natural that they without any trouble carry entire film on their own. There are just a few more roles in the film, none of them with serious screen time, though it's worth to mention standardly good Isabelle Huppert and it's nice to see William Shimell in his only second starring role. But Riva and Trintignant are those who deserve our admiration. It's fascinating to watch them depict what could very easily happen to themselves soon, especially considering that some of the things Haneke puts them through are very tough and deeply disturbing.Although it may seem so, \"Amour\" isn't all dying and depression. The beginning of the film serves as an explanation of what's to come. It shows a beautiful relationship full of understanding and compassion between two old people still in love, something we're not so used to see. It is exactly that love and devotion which give Georges the strength to care for Anne and do all that must be done. It is love without any romanticizing. Its purest form. With all the hard work, tough decisions and incomprehension bound to appear between even closest of lovers, but also tenderness, faith and smiles existent only in those who completely embraced one another.Regardless of my praise on objectiveness and naturalness of Haneke's depiction I should bring to attention that it is after all just one of the choices of artistic expression and as such ultimately involves some degree of deception and playing with the viewer. He does it using long, static shots which give us time to feel the full impact of that which transpires. The ordinariness of the shots, which are not composed just to make a beautiful sight, also forces you to think while watching the movie, inviting you to recognize their meaning, which serves as a witness to a great cinematography by Darius Khondji and his excellent understanding with Haneke.While there are probably a lot of people who won't like the film and will blame it for being too arty, my guess is there are also a lot of those who will praise it without fully understanding it. \"Amour\" is a depressing drama only at first sight. When you take a second look at it, you realize it's a tribute to a great and long life filled with love every step of the way. The way death comes in it surely isn't the one anyone would like for themselves, but what is more important, a beautiful death or a beautiful life?More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Talking to a fellow IMDb'er a week before the Oscar show for 2013 was to be held,I started to feel pretty confident that Amour would easily win the best picture award,due to the huge amount of praise that I had seen the film receive over the past few months.The day after the Oscar's:Checking on the BBC's website for the official Oscar results the next day,I soon discovered,that although Amour had won \"Best Picture\",it was not for the main category that I had predicted it to win for,but instead turned out to be the \"Best Picture\" in the foreign language category instead!With being interested in seeing how writer/director Michael Haneke's votes for the \"Best Picture\" category had been spilt,I decided to get hold of.. a handkerchief, (groan!) and find out what the true meaning of Haneke's \"Amour\" really is\u0085The plot:Talking to his wife Anne over breakfast,Georges Laurent begins to suspect that Anne is playing a prank on him,when Anne suddenly frieze's from talking to her husband at all,and not showing even the slightest response,when Georges places a wet dishcloth on the side of her face.Leaving the cold tap running,Georges gets dressed,and returns to the dining room,where Georges discovers to his horror that Anne cant remember a single thing that has just taken place.Fearing that Anne's forgetfulness is an illness that is related to her old age,Georges ignores the advice from their daughter Eva that Anne may be better being taken care of in an old peoples home or a hospital,and vows to do everything he can to take care of his loving wife Anne for as long as possible.View on the film:Inspired by the tragic suicide of his mother Beatrix Von Degenschild,and a pledge which he has made with his wife Susanne that they will each take care of each other for the whole of their lives,and never place the other one either in a hospital or an old peoples home,writer/director Michael Haneke shoots the film in a long- lensed,unflinching clinical manner,which along with stopping any possible melodrama to seep into the movie,also does very well at showing the viewer the unbreakable bond that the Laurent's have with each other,by showing their empty house to be filled with nothing but their love for each other.Whilst Haneke's approach does give the film a realistic appearance,it also sadly causes the movie to sadly feel very cold and detached,due to Hankeke keeping the viewer at a distance from Georges and Anne,that takes away from allowing the audience to get at the centre of the warmth that Georges and Anne have for each other.Featuring in almost every scene together, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva both give brilliant performances,with Riva giving a brave,heartbreaking performance of Anne slowing fading away to the illness,whilst Trintignant gives a strong,raw performance,which shows that Georges will never allow their amour to be ravaged by time.",

Although well-acted, this is a simple and predictable tale of an old woman suffering a stroke, becoming demented and dying, tended by her \"loving\" husband in their Parisian apartment. The movie is too long and besides depressing, boring. You almost wish he had reached for the pillow a half hour earlier. We treat our dying pets better than we treat our dying humans. This side note,the director, Michael Haneke, seems to be in love with unnecessarily long, lingering shots of empty rooms, hallways and stairwells which probably add a good twenty minutes to the film.",

In fact the quality of the craftsmanship behind this movie is astounding. It is classical in terms of every single shot would look great framed and hanged at a wall. The story too is magnificent. The story of an elderly couple and their love is composed into the regular Hollywood formula for a 90 minute film however Hanaeke doesn't stop there. He tells the story to the bitter end. I guess this is unpleasant for many people but I do not see where Haneke would be as shocking and unpleasant as in his other movies. Instead you'll always feel sympathy for the protagonists.There have been some rumors as this film would copy a last years film named \"Volcano\". I have not seen this movie and can not judge upon it. Nonetheless I daresay that this movie is a masterpiece and by far Hanekes best one.",

Still thru it all it proves that true love last and never really dies! The story revolves around a French couple in their 80's both are skilled and retired music teachers and Georges(in a fine performance from Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne(a super performance from Emmanuelle Riva) are trying to settle into their old age. All of a sudden the unexpected in life happens sickness hits the couple in the form of Anne having a stroke. Sadly and slowly but surely her health weakens and goes more and more downhill even leading her to becoming a house bed patient. Still Georges shows his courage and love and determination by caring for her till the very end until he can't take no more. Director Michael Haneke done a wonderful job of showing how aging love is painful yet it stays to the end even in sorrow and tragedy. Overall good film that's a a tear jerker it wounds the heart.",

            "content": "This will be my first review here and I don't think I could have picked a more depressing film to start with. I'm just going to run through the film with a SPOILER filled review so anyone who has yet to see this should stop reading.did this movie entertain me? No it did not, it was a tough uncomfortable watch. Was it a good movie? Yes it was.The movie began with silent credits, I cranked up sound , then images kick in and I get fright of my life when sound booms out my speakers, horror movies should do that, I was not expecting a fright watching an intimate drama.We are shown an apartment that will become our home for the next two hours, pretty nice place, spacious and very tidy, fire fighters force their way in to be greeted by an obvious stench of deathly decay, duct taped doors and an old woman laid out with loving care deceased on a bed.Next scene finds us at a music concert and we are in the recent past with the old woman from the bed and her husband, Anne and Georges, a few scenes establish them as retired music teachers in their eighties with a daughter married to an English guy . Georges is instantly likable and easy to follow and empathise with, and the dedication he shows as Anne has a stroke and becomes paralysed on her right side is admirable.One issue I have with this movie is we didn't get enough time with Anne before stroke to like her more and I found myself not really caring about her, I felt empathy for Georges all through but Anne's predicament left me cold, this is due only to the fact that Anne understandably falls into depression and its hard to care about a person who wants to give up. If we had only more scenes with her and Georges being happy and active together we would have more reason to care and remember why he loved her in first place.The first half of the movie has Anne struggling to come to terms with her disability and making Georges promise not to send her back to hospital, a fate she dreads but its when she suffers her second stroke that this movie becomes incredibly uncomfortable to watch as her body and mind deteoriates. Georges struggles to cope alone, an incompetent nurse comes and goes after a shower scene that is very uncomfortable to watch, Georges and Anna's daughter visit a few times, the second visit demonstrating the degree in which Anna has failed.Georges reaches breaking point and can't bare to see the love of his life suffering anymore and takes a pillow to her face smothering the life from her after telling her a story that I kind of zoned out from, The camera shots are all so free of movement that I was looking at the object on the bedside locker not paying attention when he takes a pillow and smothers her, I was like \"WTF\"\u0085that's the second fright I got in this movie, more than last supernatural chiller I watched.Afterwards its clear Georges starts to lose his mind, he duct tapes doors off, cuts heads off flowers, and writes letters to i'm presuming Anne. We then get our first action scene of the movie, a high speed chase around a room as Georges attempts to catch a pigeon with a blanket, by high speed I mean a slow stumble. I'm making fun of this scene as the movie started to lose me at this point. It wraps up with Georges imagining Anne alive and leaving the apartment with her, the daughter shows up and credits roll silently.I've mentioned I got two unintentional frights in this movie and it is a kind of horror film in a way, through the thoughts that one day the plot of this movie could be the reality of our lives during elderly years or our parents or grandparents sooner.If anyone was really moved by this movie I highly recommend a film called Iris starring Judi Dench and Kate Winslet, its similar to this but I found it far more emotional",

A masterful handling of the camera and the script allows the whole plot to be developed in a small city apartment, simply furnished.

There's little dignity in the process of dying; and in Haneke's sensitive telling of the sad end of an elderly, educated, sophisticated couple, the grim reality of a slow death is painfully apparent. What makes this film brilliant is that it avoids descending into an orgy of pure pathos and pain: there's deep, sympathetic insight into the dilemma of its protagonists, which is considered calmly and intellectually (though in increasing tension with the horrific underlying situation). This isn't an easy film to watch, and its certainly not a film with easy answers (in a very general way, it makes the case against overly prolonging life, but it's hard to conclude what that means in practice). It's arguably a film that everyone should see, however much it hurts to watch it.",

Having survived the brutal hardships of life together, their bonding is once again put to severe test when Anne suffers a stroke which leaves the right side of her body badly paralysed thus ultimately driving George to make some critical decisions about their future.Written & directed by Michael Haneke, it's truly amazing how simple the entire narrative looks, including the way it is filmed & yet the emotional impact it is able to make is quite profound. The film has all the director's trademarks, be it the almost still camera-work, glacial pace, steady editing or muted score, plus as far as the performances go, both actors are near-flawless in their given roles.On an overall scale, Amour works solely on the strength of its script, direction & performances, and is a brutally honest portrayal of old age & how life never stops testing us no matter how far we've travelled or what all we've already been through. Not an easy film to sit through for there are moments that are too painful to watch, Amour is nonetheless a fabulous piece of cinema & a devastating illustration of life.",

The house itself is an important character but it 'plays' its role with the utmost subtlety.

It's Oscar season, and you're the only one who really cares among your friends who won, let alone who got nominated. \"Amour\" had won best foreign language picture that year, and there was already a certain \"allure\" that drew me towards it. Unfortunately it ends up being on a long list of movies you eventually get round to, and I finally did 2 years later. Funny enough it coincided with my viewing of Krzysztof Kieslowski's \"Three Colors Trilogy\" (1993 - 1994), where those movies introduced me to the wonderful talents of this picture Jean-Louis Trintignant, & Emmanuelle Riva.Elderly couple Anne and Georges, are retired music teachers with one daughter (Isabelle Huppert). Anne eventually suffers a silent stroke which paralyses her on the right side of her body, as we then begin to watch how the following events will unfold.It's obvious this films subject matter is old age. Michael Haneke (Now in his 70's) doesn't shy away from what would definitely be considered a very tricky subject to execute, and that eventually our bodies will physically deteriorate and sadly our minds may follow. Mr. Haneke's camera work is as strong as ever, if not the best looking film he has ever done. The dialogue is poignant, and there isn't a second where the pacing feels off or the movie dips in quality. Mr. Trintignant is fantastic even though he hasn't been in a film for almost a decade, and Emmanuelle Riva was absolutely wonderful being firm and present throughout the picture. All of which culminates to one of those finales that really cuts off your ability to speak and leaves you in tears.Final Verdict: Raw, touching and powerful, few of the words that only begin to describe Amour's depths. Michael Haneke leaves no stone unturned, and it's easily the best movie of 2012. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "Love is Death",
            "content": "\"Amour\" isn't so much about love as it's about death. Nor about commitment, so much as it's about servitude and confinement. It's not about what's to love in life; it's about life's pain and suffering\u2014 from its mundane moments to its tragic, slow and eventual end. The opening sequence establishes both this fatal end, as firemen break into the apartment and open the windows to remove the stench, and the ordinary life of spectators rather than any spectacle or entertainment on the stage that we never see. Thereafter, events are increasingly more depressing and, yet, commonplace.For most of the film, the elderly couple is confined to their apartment. After Anne returns home in a wheelchair, from an unsuccessful operation following her first stroke, she never leaves home again\u2014until the symbolic end where she and her husband, Georges, are seen going out. Even Georges largely relies on others coming to him\u2014neighbors bringing groceries, nurses working in their home, friends and family visiting. He only leaves his confinement, as does she, after death. In addition to this shut-in spatial confinement, the characters are confined to servitude. After the opening sequence of their night out, the first and only scene of their formerly ordinary lives is of her serving him breakfast. Her stroke comes as he asks her to serve him more. From here on out, he's to serve her, as her health slowly declines\u2014until he can no longer take it. This confinement and commitment to servitude is even demanded by the promise made to never take Anne back to the hospital and to never leave her in a hospice.What we're confined to see also informs the depressing and unsentimental tone of the picture. The acting is terrific because it's convincingly ordinary. Just as with the lives we see, the colors are drab and the pacing slow. The few scenes of what may bring and show the joy in life are short and end abruptly, whereas the tragic and undignified scenes of Anne's decline and of Georges taking care of her linger in lengthy stationary shots. After the concert not shown, a pupil begins to play the piano in their home in one scene that ends just as he's getting started. Fun with a new electric wheelchair is just as fleeting. Anne rifles through a photo album and comments that life is long. An uncomfortable amount of time, however, is spent on Georges helping Anne stand up out of her wheelchair and onto the toilet, out of bed after soiling it, her crying \"it hurts\" while being bathed or while in bed, and her otherwise being attended to\u2014or on desperate and depressing conversations, such as those with their daughter, Eva. Even trite episodes with a pigeon inside are treated thoroughly, instead of anything that might actually elevate anyone out of the tragic circumstances for a moment.After all of this, it's not surprising that some would consider Georges killing Anne to be a \"mercy killing\". \"Amour\" is consumed by death, and death is assured from the beginning. Anne indicates this earlier than others do, as her health declines after her first stroke. It seems as though she decided long before that she no longer wanted to live\u0085 and, yet, she didn't act upon it. Eva naively bemoans their lack of options and miracle cures, as though not everyone dies. A nurse combs the dying woman's hair, pushes a mirror in her face while jabbing on superficially and vainly about needing to look pretty for everyone. Georges threatens his wife with forced feeding and goes so far as to hit his defenseless wife. And only after Anne declines to the point of not being able to communicate, let alone act upon, her wishes coherently or with convincing certitude, does her husband admit out loud that it's just going to get worse until it's over. And, then, only after she's apparently lost her self agency does he suddenly smother her to death with a pillow. It's more disturbing if we allow that this may've been an act of mercy on behalf of relieving his pain and service caring for Anne rather than to relieve her pain.In the early scene of them arriving home from their night out, they discuss the threat of burglary and how frightening that'd be. Later, Georges has a nightmare about such a prospect. The ever more common slow march towards death that their lives become consumed by is far more horrifying, though. Domestic violence happens without an outside intruder. This simple death leads Anne to lose her dignity, her pride and sense of self worth\u2014living so long that she no longer wishes to live. It's what leads Georges to actions that deny her self agency and, consequently, for him to lose his humanity. This isn't love. It definitely isn't love of life.

At no point does this come across as obtuse as every frame is crafted and exploited to the max. The performances are all in line with the director's meticulous and always precise vision. Due to the incredible commercial success and awards the film received, I wrongly thought that he had finally given in to sentimentality. Not at all!

For me personally this was a hard movie to watch as my grandmother, grandfather and uncle have all suffered strokes of various seriousness so it really hit home. As far as the movie goes you really become involved in the lives of the couple and by the end you are left to question what you would have done in that situation.

Shaw is quite fond of talking about the boredom of eternity. But then in \"Amour\", the predicament is less philosophical, more pragmatic: the relief from suffering.If you ask connoisseurs of Michael Haneke's work to name one scene from the auteur that has left the most indelible impression in their minds, I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of the answer is the entirely un-forewarned slashing in \"Cache\" (2005) \u2013 bloody, brutal, bloody, shocking, bloody, violent, bloody, devastating. You wouldn't find any blood in \"Amour\" (if there is, it would be so incidental that you wouldn't even notice) but there is one scene that is no less harrowing. I'll save this till the end.The storytelling here is blessedly simple and direct, about how a couple in their 80s enjoying an elegant, relaxing life style (exemplified by their attending a classical piano concert) suddenly find themselves progressively going through hell. Anne gets a stroke, and things go downhill from there, with grace and elegance gradually fading into oblivion (exemplified by the first time Anne finds herself losing bladder control). Georges preservers with every effort to cope, giving whatever support and alleviation he can to ease his wife's pain and suffering. With flawless camera work, impeccable timing, and heartbreaking images, Haneke brings the audience into the emotional world of this couple.ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING. At this point, I would like to bring up another Oscar Best Foreign Language Film \"Mar adentro\" (2004), for comparison. The protagonist there (superbly portrayed by Javier Bardem) is also paralyzed, and for even much longer. The difference however is that he does not feel any pain. Anne, however, is cursed with pains that get progressively worse. In one scene close to the end, Georges in the kitchen hears Anne's moaning, goes to her, sits beside her bed, holds and gently messages her hand, starts to tell her a story while asking her to try to quiet down because his own voice is growing weak. It takes a while but eventually her moaning tapers off and her breath becomes easier and more relaxed. Looking at his wife for a brief moment with all the love he can summon, Georges picks up the pillow and smothers Anne.Everybody would agree that Emanuelle Riva deserves to win the Oscar with her portrayal of Anne. Jeans-Louis Trintignant, however, is not even nominated and I venture to suggest that Daniel Day-Lewis should thank his lucky star for that. There is also inimitable Isabelle Huppert whose portrayal of the callous daughter adds another dimension to the poignancy.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful movie, which picks up the story some decades after \"happily ever after.\" People often talk about art being \"universal.\" This is usually a cop out. All art is rooted in a culture, and books and movies make little sense if we don't come to them with the required knowledge. But if ever there was a universal movie, it was this one. Illness, death and love are part of everyone's experience. They are all fundamental parts of bodily experience, and transcend culture in a way that health, life and romance do not.The Taj Mahal looms over the Yamuna River in remembrance of Shah Jahan's lost love. \"Amour\" is a monument no less grand. The heart of the film is the relationship between Anne and Georges, who are played with consummate skill by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva. I found Riva's performance particularly heartbreaking. It chimed with my own memories of similar situations, and her emotional course through the movie is as complex as it is heartbreaking.Haneke has a muted style. The camera is still, the soundtrack is bare, we continually see the same rooms and the same furniture from the same angles. This throws all the emphasis on the warm emotions of the principal characters. Their faces burn through the screen. Their words are crystal clear against a silent backdrop. The little details of Anne and Georges's home become familiar and take on lives of their own. The piano, the books, the kitchen table, the sink, the green chairs in the salon, the white cornices, the parquet floors. I don't think I've ever seen a movie before where I remember such things.It is a slow movie, but if you're not a fan of international art-house releases, this might be the one film you could handle. It is so warm and so real, that I think it really does have a universal appeal.***Having slept on it, I've changed my mind. I still think this is a beautiful movie. And I still think it is true to say that bodily illness is an almost uniquely universal theme.But it is not right to say that this movie is culturally universal. It is filled with contemporary, western themes to do with illness and dying. Should Anne be put into a home? Should she receive treatment? Is euthanasia justified? What responsibility do parents have for their children? What is the value of human life? How important is a person's dignity? How should we talk to and about the terminally ill? Perhaps many cultures pose similar questions, but surely none pose all of them in quite the way this movie does. This is one reason I found the movie so touching. It asked me questions I have asked myself about my own family members. Someone who had asked themselves different questions might not like the movie.Nor would people who find such questions distressing\u2014as some of the other reviews show.My initial response to the movie reminds me of a scene in \"The White Masai.\" Nina Hoss's character has just arrived with her husband, Jack Ido, in her new home among the Masai. She sees an old woman who has been abandoned to die, and tries to save her life. Neither the old woman nor anyone else sides with her. Euthanasia is not a question everywhere, but my strong response to \"Amour\" made me feel for a moment that it was. \"I want more life,\" cries Roy Batty in the most famous scene of \"Blade Runner.\" \"Amour\" brings this cry into question, in a beautiful, subtle, and undeniably Western way.",

Secondly, it is not so slow as some reviewers have stated. Its pace is similar to events of our daily lives which take their own expected amount of time. It is quite natural that various descriptions of this film would be made depending on a viewer's perspective about life. Some viewers would not hesitate in calling 'Amour' a documentary about old age. As the film is about old people, it is be able to give a nice idea about their behavior especially when they deal with their respective partners. It is with sadness one can observe how a patient man becomes violent when his wife starts to change her behavior. The impact of old age has been depicted without any superfluous embellishment. The best thing about 'Amour' is that it enables viewers to discover a completely different facet of Austrian director Michael Haneke's directorial abilities.

When \"Amour\" was released in 2012 it was Haneke's turn to frustrate the film of another director, namely Runar Runarsson. This Icelandic director had released in 2011 the film \"Eldfjall\", also about an elderly couple of witch the woman becomes seriously ill. \"Eldfjall\" is not a bad film but of course was completely overshadowed by a release of such an international celebrity as Haneke.When comparing \"Amour\" and \"Away from her\" we can conclude that Haneke was right in resuming \"Amour\" and that the films are quite different after all. The fact that the woman in \"Away from her\" has Alzheimer disease and the woman in \"Amour has had (a couple of) strokes is the least one of these differences. More important is the fact that \"Away from here\" is situated in a nursing home while in \"Amour\" the man has promised never to take his wife to such a home (against ever greater odds).Ozu has made films about bussy children with no time for their elderly parents (most natably \"Tokyo story\", 1953) and also in \"Amour\" the relative absence of the daughter stands out. The reason for this is kept however rather vague. Tries the daughter to put her mother away in a nursing home just to save herself time, just like the children in \"Tokyo story\" put their parents in a holiday resort in stead of showing them Tokyo themselves? Or keeps the man his daughter at a distance because he is unable to admit that he cannot longer care for his wife himself (and does cannot keep his before mentioned promise) ?The elderly couple is played by two icons of the French cinema. Jan-Louis Trintigant was 82 at the time of shooting and active since 1956 (\"Et dieu ... crea la femme\", Roger Vadim). Emmannuele Riva was 85 at the time of shooting and active since 1959 (\"Hiroshima mon amour\", Alain Resnais). They are both doing a perfect job.",

Although we rarely leave the apartment the camera finds a way to keep it fresh. At points the simple confines become confusing adding to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the characters.The two main performances are incredibly praise-worthy here, most notably Riva, her acting makes her character believable, her struggle becomes all too real and haunting. Trintignant shines too, the few tales he tells throughout the film are encapsulating, you can really imagine yourself in Georges shoes.Amour is perhaps a little high-brow for a general audience but for those who seek it out it's a must-watch.

His masterpiece, 'The White Ribbon', is a sterling piece of work about a village in which the children may or may not be guilty of some things. Nothing gets answered, nothing gets resolved, we just know it has something to do with the war and Nazis. We watch the tension rise and then the film ends, and it is fantastic.Now we have 'Amour', a very different affair, at least in terms of story and tone; there is still decidedly little happening. It is a solid, honest depiction of the end we all face, which has the feel of being made by somebody with a very personal investment in the story. The story, for what it is, is of an elderly couple in love, one of whom has a stroke and the other who takes care of them. There is no spoiler here, that is it. Nobody \"enjoys\" this film, but whether you like it comes down to a simple question: Are you up for two hours of watching someone take care of the person he loves, from the onset of decline to the end? The acting is the drive of the film, with a standout performance from Emmanuelle Riva as Anne; we're talking Day-Lewis level of performances here. A member of cast I felt was a little wasted was Isabellee Huppert, but perhaps I only feel that way because we know how much she can give, and consequently, how underused she is here. Other than that, this is evidence of a film maker who knows just what he is doing, but is so invested in the honesty of the piece, so caught up with putting a very particular sort of heartbreak on the screen, it could be said he lost sight of the audience's need to be engaged. There are powerful, well played scenes; there is absolutely no fault in the film, but you do reach a point where you wonder why you're watching. There is no twist, no added drama, no notable score, no surprise, and it ends up feeling rather sterile.This is not a film to be watched by those who have experience of caring, it will be nothing new and they will have had enough of it in reality, let alone sitting through a film about it. The audience for 'Amour' is actually sadly those who probably wouldn't choose to sit and watch it; those people who have life ahead of them, those who life has not yet slapped hard around the face, the unwittingly selfish, those who take life and love for granted, those who perhaps need a glimpse of what could lie ahead.A fine, sincere film, full of powerful moments, but ultimately of little reward to the majority of its audience.",

So I will tell you about my reaction to the first hour, and why I could watch no further.The movie tells the story of an elderly couple. In the first few minutes of the movie, the wife evidently has a stroke. She is paralyzed on the left side. When she comes back from the hospital, her husband, himself elderly and not in the best of shape, decides that he will take care of her.From then on, we watch her physical disintegration, and his and her quietly heroic efforts to deal with that.Perhaps - and I say perhaps - if you have not watched a loved one go through something like this, perhaps you can watch this on screen. I couldn't. What makes this movie so powerful for me is, among other things, that it almost never seems like a movie: Riva and Tritignant do not appear to be two actors acting. Rather, you feel as if you are watching two people actually going through all of this. Two real, decent individuals who do not deserve to go through this - but then, who does? The lack of any background music, any traditional movie elements, contributes to this sense of watching reality.But the result is very difficult - for me, impossible - to watch. I don't want to go through that again. I've seen it once before, and that was too painful. I don't want to relive that again.So that is how I experienced the first half of this movie. It is unlike any other movie I have ever seen, because it does not seem to be a movie at all. It seems to be two real people going through hell right in front of your eyes.And that is, for me, impossible to watch, much less to enjoy.

Georges can can only sit by and watch his wife of over fifty years in chronic pain. It is pretty obvious how this ends, but we are still heartbroken beyond words when it does.So that's basically what the movie is about. It can be summarized into three lines without much else to say that's very crucial. So it may be a little basic and simple in its story and directing, but it has the power to shatter you. About one or two minutes of the entire film taking place outside their apartment. Most takes are very long. These two elements completely suck the viewer directly into the world of this married couple. I love it when movies take me into their world, but 'Amour' does it much deeper than most. After the viewer arrives into the Laurent apartment, the long takes make the viewer feel as if they are sitting in a chair watching Georges and Anne's lives unravel. And there are some moments of great camera work that is surprising considering it all takes place in an apartment.Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva give performances to behold. Their performances are beyond amazing. Even without the strong immersive quality, I would still have been amazed. Seeing Anne's deterioration and Georges' loss of patience and increase of emotional pain progress makes you feel like you are watching exactly what it being seen. You have to be reminded these are just two talented actors. There's a few other people that come to the apartment (including Isabelle Huppert who plays their daughter), but we focus on the two main characters.Here is a simple art-film that packs an enormous punch.

It's Haneke's shorthand for making a statement that despite all our glorious individuality we are but a single specimen of the human species, perishable in the end.They make their way home basking in the glory of a superlative performance by Alexander Thraud ,a famed French pianist, who plays himself in this film, who was Anne's pupil once.When they reach home they find that their apartment has been burgled, George makes light of the incident, saying they should not fuss and enjoy the remainder of the evening, and he tells Anne that she was looking beautiful.All in a single shot.This constitutes the brief first act of the film which points to a life well lived, of the presence of love, the absence of acrimony,the high probability of relative success that comes with hard work, and above all a state of grace in the true Christian sense.But they are not religious people, they worship only at the alter of the sublime beauty of music.The next morning, while having breakfast Anne switches-off suddenly.George is a trifle annoyed, he quickly understands that something is amiss, wets a kitchen towel and dabs at her forehead.She does not come around.He goes into his bedroom and begins to get dressed in order to get help.The tap in the kitchen sink has been left running, supplying us with an ominous soundtrack.Usually running water provides tranquillity, Haneke finds alarm here.Suddenly the sound stops and George stops changing.He goes back to the kitchen to find Anne has turned the tap off.But she does not remember a thing.She pours tea, but not into the cup.Not once but twice.Their life has fallen out of grace.They are now at the mercy of nature and its brutal forces.We watch with growing discomfort as Anne's health fails.In its portrayal of dementia and paralysis in old age the film is relentless.Nature as a torturer cannot be rivaled by the most extreme sociopath.Anne gets operated, it's an easy operation, the doctors said, but it's not a success. George tells his daughter Eva wearily,\"the 55 failure rate\". Hanekes world is probabilistic, this statistic and its implications make that case in precisely four words.George prepares himself, his daughter and us for the inevitable.But we are never adequately prepared for life, or for that matter, Haneke's absolutely stunning end. There are two intriguing scenes involving a pigeon. We must assume its the same one, its important.If Au Hazard Balthazar was pure cinema in its entirety these two pigeon scenes supply us with a much more concise distillation of the concept of pure cinema.The animal here is a force of nature as well as subjected to it.The fate of the pigeon at the hands of George is a neat \"parable meets fable\" for the manifest randomness of Life and how we animals deal with it.Amour meaning love, in its stressing of the cruelty and inevitability of death points us back in the direction of life and how good it can be if lived in the pursuit of our passions and the company of people who love us. Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant give us two singular performances that work like two intricately carved sides of a rare coin.Haneke has made films which are so icy in tone they can burn us with their touch.In Amour he opens the window and allows in some sunshine.This time the light can truly illuminate our soul.",

            "content": "Fire the nurse Murder your wife A pigeon flies inOh, and someone left the water running.In American film we have a famous quote: \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\" It appears that in Europe, or more specifically Paris, France for this movie, it is \"Love means murdering your wife.\"murder: the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by anotherWhat a sham this movie is. From its title \"Amour\" or \"Love\". Sham. The trivia here on IMDb says that some other suggested titles were \"These Two\" and \"The Music Stops\". Either of those two would have been much better and vastly more honest. The trivia item goes on to state that the subject of the film is love, so some said why not call it that? Sham. The subject of this film is euthanasia. Calling euthanasia \"love\" is despicable. Major sham.(Spoilers for a House, M.D. episode) The House episode, \"The Dig\" s7e18, that I reference in my signature presents the issues of life, death and euthanasia with a fantastic and involving script: A woman cannot deal with having had multiple miscarriages (death and mental health). Thirteen has tremendous remorse after killing her brother (euthanasia). House offers to help her commit suicide in the future if her condition worsens to an unbearable point (life - House actually loves someone). Also, the writers showed that Thirteen paid a price, a jail sentence, for having helped in her brother's death.This movie showed none of the legal or moral consequences of killing another person, save for the husband taping up a door where he then kills himself with gas (presumably from a kitchen stove). And, as others have pointed out, there is no emotional connection for the audience to the two. They do try to provide some background with the husband reminiscing about being at a camp when a teenager and some other stories from his youth, but it falls flat.As far as a movie goes, this was a borefest. Endless scenes of nothing happening. Let's look at a chair. A piano. Bothersome neighbors. Look down a hallway. Look down same hallway. Daughter and somebody else shows up. A window. Same hallway. A nurse bathes an old woman. Pigeon. The wooden floor. Oh wait! Here it comes! Some action! Husband smothers wife. A nonsensical dream sequence. Somewhere in there, husband cutting petals. The end.What has really amazed me is the awards it has won (an Oscar, Best Foreign Language Film) and the very high ratings from critics. I guess murdering old people is \"loved\" by critics.We should deal with euthanasia in a legal, very restricted and respectful manner, but this movie is not the way to show it.For me, this movie has joined the unenviable rating of 1/10 on IMDb, shared only by two other movies: \"Freddy Got Fingered\" (2001) and \"Under the Skin\" (2013). I have not yet seen \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" (1966), so maybe this list will grow.",

            "content": "It seems to set in the early 21st century in Paris. It's the story of love, end-of-life, and death.Anne Laurent (Emmanuelle Riva) and her husband, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), are elderly musicians. At the beginning of the film, we see authorities break into an apartment because of complaints of a bad smell. They discover Anne's body surrounded by flower petals.The movie then goes back several months and picks up the story of Anne's illness (a stroke the morning after one of her protege's concerts), her demand that she be allowed to stay at home (after a botched operation at the hospital), and Georges' care for her as first her mobility decreases. After a second stroke, Anne is no longer able to communicate understandably. Their one daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), does not live in Paris and appears only infrequently and without notice. Georges does hire some nursing help for several hours three days a week, but Anne's primary care becomes more and more onerous.In the end, Georges is overwhelmed by her care and smothers Anne. He leaves a note but disappears with no explanation as to his own ending.I wondered if I was up to this kind of film, but I found it very moving. I could readily identify with some of the caregiver roles. Georges and Anne's personalities and self-selected isolation from friends and public health care were different choices than I made, but this was a really high-quality film. The two lead actors were both in their 80s when the film was made. Emmanuelle Riva was absolutely wonderful as Anne and Jean-Louis Trintignant showed all the ambivalence, love, anger, and helplessness of a man watching his wife slowly die.",

But I was wrong. 'Amour' is really no different than other Haneke films: You're straight-jacketed into your seat for 2 hours and given very little elbow room for self-reflection. It's like gagging for 2 hours before you finally choke. And his cinematic skills of manipulation are as finely-tuned as ever - drawing you in and detaining you indefinitely. In many ways it is his most violent film. Like his other ruminations on violence and depravity, if you're curious about someone else's deterioration, you're going to pay for it, whether you like it or not. And this being a Michael Haneke film, you do. There's no 'amour' here. Away from Cannes, this film should look quite small on a large screen. I gave his film 3 stars for the two principal leads, who were able to translate Haneke's detailed direction into something approaching verisimilitude.

Amour , as the meaning says, shows that love never dies and how far the bond of love can be tested.Very well directed by Michael Haneke, Amour gives a perspective of later life when you are physically weak and you do not have anyone apart from your life to support you. Hats off to Hanke for handling the sensitive subject with aplomb. The movie is slow paced and editing is slippery. Screenplay is tight.It is the lead actors who gives in a very powerful and brave performances.

            "content": "This film starts out so slow I worried but then remembered that European films are different than American ones - stories get told at their own leisurely pace. I wand to emphasis the three phenomenal central performances: Emmanuelle Riva is so interesting because her character is so normal and what she goes through is something any of us could potentially face; Jean-Louis Trintignant is the heart and soul of the movie, in a career-capping brilliant acting performance (I hope he wins the Lumiere and especially the Cesar award for Best Actor); and Isabelle Huppert, my favorite performance in the film - despite only a handful of scenes, she brings a full life to her character, who is in many ways the most sympathetic.This film contains the issue of a mercy killing. Yet, it doesn't belabor it or pass any judgment. I knew it was coming and still managed to be quite shocked by it (it's Trintignant's finest moments in an indelible performance). It certainly makes the viewer think about aging issues.I was struck by the fact that about half the audience I saw it with were elderly. I wondered what they made of it? If it hit closer to home for them? I've seen quite a few Michael Haneke movies. He often has scenes that are quite mysterious (they always remind me of Roman Polanski's direction of Rosemary's Baby). He uses the space of the apartment in such unusual and interesting ways.I am surprised the film is nominated for 5 academy awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actress, Screenplay and Foreign Language Film - it's such an unusual film, slowly paced, and so not American! I do wish the academy had nominated Jean-Louis Trintignant - he so deserves the recognition for an amazing career over the past almost 60 years! I certainly would vote for Emmanuelle Riva for Best Actress.This was an intense, rewarding and fascinating cinematic experience.",

            "content": "This film was so spare that it could not have cost much more to make than the pay of the 3 principal actors, it was that small. Filmed almost entirely in an apartment in Paris, and consisting of 2 actors for over 90% of the film and a couple more for the remaining 10%, this film was about an elderly couple totally, with all else happening nearly incidentally. I cannot think of any other film, perhaps My Dinner With Andre 30 years ago, that was as spare as this one.Not to say that the story was spare, it was complete, detailed and intensely private from start to end, showing the unfortunate decline that happens to all of us who die of old age. And it ended with what may be perceived by many or most as a dying fantasy of the surviving husband, the obviously very short-term survivor of the two who himself was surely on his way out after the death of his wife. And perhaps as suddenly as his wife's death?Director involvement was perhaps too spare for some viewer's taste, as scenes tended to linger long after scene impact was delivered. But, this was a French film, beyond all phony Hollywood contrivances, and was as honest as if it happened to my own parents. What the film may have lacked in power it made up in honesty and acting talent, and that made it to me much more rewarding than anything with phony Hollywood gimmicks in it that are included only to boost ticket sales but serve to ruin any story credibility.This fine and gentle story, with its loving characters and their day to day marital friendship, and their sophisticated dialog was pure gold to the end, even including the metaphor in the final \"pigeon capture\", and as such could have happened to my own parents. In fact, it did.See it not for \"entertainment\", but to be included in a very personal story of decline that happens to all of us eventually, done here in a way that precluded a phony happy ending but was so rewarding in its own tender and unique way.",

Early on Amour shows his concern at inconclusively leaving the proposals - seemingly main - aside, practically expelling them so that the public manipulates the 'logical' side of things. Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) give us the characters beyond the most realistic and palpable 80 years of the history of the cinema, both enter not in dilemmas of morality in the film, being that Georges should take care of his wife Anne after an attack that leaves her weakened, but enter into the part where 'life is life', and love may have different contours than one thinks to become real.",

            "content": "This was a very genuine and realistic film. The character relations fascinated me more than anything, which was most likely the aim of the entire film. This emotional connection between a wife and a husband was amazingly portrayed by Michael Haneke, with a close attention to detail in dialogue and even the choreography and direction of the characters.I'm going to start with the technical work of the film. The setting was chosen perfectly to fit with the messages and tone of the film. Interestingly, the opening starts at a theatre and when it is discovered that Anne is sick the setting switches to only their apartment. For me, this enclosure is meant to make the viewer feel just as trapped as Anne, which automatically creates more sympathy for the character. The only times there is any connection to the outside world during those scenes it when the window or door are open. This could mean a glimmer of hope to escape or see outer world. Hanake did an outstanding job on the lighting. This apartment was actually a studio yet he managed to convincingly create every shade and highlight as if it was a real apartment and a place of living. The camera shots were also very fitting with the scenes. There were close ups to emphasise emotion, and wide shots to make characters feel small, fragile and helpless- the standard and simplistic things that frame a good picture of their lives. The soundtrack was great, and the fact that both Anne and Georges hold music close to their hearts really helped to add emotion. The sound was especially used with great effect in the scene where Anne appears to play the piano only to then see Georges switch off the stereo. This is how emotion should be provoked from the viewer.Now moving on to themes and the writing in the movie. I don't want to speculate too much with the themes as I think it defeats the point of what Haneke actually wanted to say. In an interview he stated- \"the minute something can be described with a single term, it is dead artistically\". There are many variations of the themes he wanted to explore, hell, I still don't understand all the symbolism and metaphors that went into this. But I can say that this is a story about love, emotion and pain. Haneke managed to gracefully explore all three of these things. I spent hours upon hours thinking what the pigeon meant in this film, and I couldn't get it. I realised that the pigeon could be anything the viewer wants it to be, and that is the beauty of filmmaking. Everyone contributes to the art of the work. It is the director's job to guide the viewer, but it is the viewer's job to answer their own questions. After watching this film, it left me with more questions- but what is the point of watching something without provoking a thought? I'm sure as I grow up these themes will change for me and everyone around me, this is the exact reason why I consider this film a masterpiece- it is timeless.One other thing I would mention about this film is that the opening scene with all the extras was beautifully crafted and not one person seemed out of character. Props to Haneke for that. I absolutely loved the work of the actors, the depth of them really made me think that the actors felt what their characters were feeling.GG amour, GG.",

            "content": "When Georges tells his wife Anne how pretty she looks out of the blue one night, and Anne giggles in return like a smitten schoolgirl, we're instantly struck by how odd the moment is for a Haneke film. For a filmmaker of such strict adherence to formalist austerity, and a heavy thematic gavel pushing his cinema of the cruel, it is unusual to see a character exhibit such carefree and willing tenderness. Haneke has now made some half a dozen films around couples named in the same variation of Anne or Anna or George or Georges, and in all of them his grasp slowly but surely closes in, and the audience is left shifting uncomfortably in their seats. And yet now he has made a film that none ever thought his cold fingers would touch, a touching, humanist story about the depths and despairs of life-long love. Anne is played by Emmanuelle Riva, who was a stunning portrait of beauty and vulnerability in Alain Resnais' post-war masterpiece Hiroshima Mon Amour. Here she is eighty five, and those looks have long faded, and yet Jean-Louis Trintignant still makes us believe that he sees a pretty girl by his side. Together they give a bodily performance that speaks great truths of the bond they have created over decades of marriage, leaning on each other when they must, shuffling in and out of the toilet, edging gingerly out of the bed each morning. In one instance, Georges steadies his wife and slowly, agonisingly, shifts her from the bed into her electric wheelchair. That she immediately pushes the stick and zooms away from him is like a slap to the face of her husband (not unlike the literal slap he deals her for not drinking her water), but the moment is made pathetic when she gets stuck and must be once again rescued. Trintignant gives a performance that matches his other half, capturing not only a body made weary but a mind shouldering a heavy burden. He trudges through the mostly empty apartment silently, is visited by nightmares of the decrepit home, and has to grit his teeth and accept the compliments from his friends while secretly wishing to hire a second nurse to lift his workload. When he narrates the details of a funeral that he attended but Anne missed, we realise that he is falling back into habit, recounting his day to someone who is barely listening, and the heaviness of his words hits even harder. Haneke enthusiasts (if there even is such a thing) might be surprised at his newfound humanism, but a glance confirms that his cinematic style has not changed. He is still working through a sterile realism, and although Anne forbids Georges from sending her to a cold, lonely hospital, the confines of their apartment begin to feel the same way. The cinematography goes all the way back to the morbid stillness of Haneke's debut, The Seventh Continent, using heavily diffused natural light through windows to recreate paintings not unlike the ones hanging on their walls. The film cuts periodically to the now darkened, empty interiors, but it is the couple trudging through it that expresses the gradual inertia of their marriage. Haneke's own experiences inspired the story, remembering his elderly aunt who had raised him and spent the final years of her life suffering alone with rheumatism, similarly confined in her apartment. Underlined in the film is his tiny cry of forgiveness, echoing the same sorrows that Georges is put through. To pull the plug is almost unthinkable to a man who has been married for decades. Yet to watch on as the memory of his wife slowly slides into ruin is almost a greater crime. Haneke is never coy; he begins with the end, and makes us sure of what is coming and what must be done. Yes, many will disagree with his actions, but is it really our place to be making moral judgements? What we must witness is the act of a man who sees his wife disappear before his very eyes, first momentarily, then gradually. They have composed and performed music side by side on the piano, and then listened to the fruits of their teaching many years later. They have ate and slept and lived, inseparable. And now they are together again, in memory.",

After a long life together they still seem reasonably content with their union, if not overly affectionate. But their comfortable life together is jarred from its moorings first by an apparent break-in at their home, and then by Anne suffering what appears to be minor stroke. It is determined that Anne needs surgery to correct the problem. Unfortunately, the surgery does not go well and Anne faces continuing and increasing challenges to her health from there. Georges, whose own body is in some disrepair \u2013 as most in their eighties are \u2013 dutifully and valiantly tends to Anne as they both face the most dire of outcomes.There are many things to like and admire about Amour. It is bold and takes chances. The up close and personal view of Anne's mind and body deteriorating is unflinching and very powerful, and Georges's dedication and frustration as her caretaker are palpable. The acting is superb from both of the principals as well as the small number of supporting actors \u2013 particularly Isabelle Huppert as Eva, the somewhat distant daughter of the couple, and Alexandre Tharaud, a French pianist playing himself as a former music student of Anne's. But despite the inherent emotional weight of the situation, the movie surprisingly suffers and eventually succumbs to a lack of emotional connection to or between the two principals. Such little depth or history are given to the characters of Georges and Anne \u2013 much less to their relationship together \u2013 that an emotional chasm is created which leaves the viewer twisting off in an emotionally distant wind. You of course feel for Georges and Anne and their terrible predicament, but it's as you would feel for two strangers more than a couple you know personally. You always feel like you're on the outside looking in despite almost the entire film taking place in the couple's home, because ultimately you don't really know who these people are!I might have forgiven to some degree the protracted, often tedious scenes of Georges tending to Anne, if there had been more to hang onto regarding an emotional connection to the couple. But it's hard to hold onto a thread, and it's difficult to be moved by people you don't know. In lieu of any strong emotional bond to the situation, disparate scenes appear almost willy-nilly in an apparent effort to engage the viewer, but the effect merely feels contrived and hollow.It's puzzling that Amour would devote so much effort to an extensive, almost clinical detailing of a human body struggling to survive, while giving such short emotional shrift to the principal characters, their history, and their relationship. It certainly left me wanting for a little more amour, and a lot less douleur (pain).",

The nihilism is visible in the portrayal as well, the outside world incognizant of the turmoil within and thus the ultimate meaninglessness of it all. The meditation gets as powerful as it could through the lives of Anne and George, whom we we get to know very little of of their past lives except some basic certain facts . This could be due to the fact that death is inevitable and in the face of death nothing even matters, just the emotions of people involved in it firsthand and the seemly/unseemly void glaring back at us.",

But in this case horror is a characteristic of life more than a characteristic of human beings. With a theatrical pace that rarely has succeeded in bringing its quality to cinema like here, the director introduces the spectators to the tortured world of a couple at the end of their way, maintaining his camera at a suspected neutral distance. The movements of the actors, their voices, the light and shadows, the furniture, the pictures on the walls, the wrinkles in sheets, blankets and clothes create an atmosphere of inevitable decline that the two irruptions of the dove could not modify. The precise dialogs, the wise angles of vision, the long shots, the crude cuts of the editing, and sly management of the expected and unexpected, help to make Amour a film hard to forget.",

I REALLY DISLIKED the way it ended and think it undermined the integrity of the film. It was uncharacteristically sentimental. My guess is this was done to give the wider audience a slightly nicer-than-bleak tone? Why else would the director want us to believe that after he (presumably) kills himself (what on earth happens to his body???) the couple are re-united in the \"afterlife\". Hmmm. Sweet, but irrelevant to the story and superstitious speculation at best. The missing body, or the fact it was not alluded to at the start of the movie when her body is found, seems like an unnecessary and contrived ploy \"to make us wonder\", debate the ending etc... In this way it is contrived, perhaps a marketing department idea to create a \"hook\" for cinema goers to debate and therefore promote the movie. This missing body anomaly, and the fact that we are given the \"feel good\" token at the end seems entirely inconsistent with the rest of the movie - which is so beautifully real. So the ending (beginning) is really poor and somewhat spoils what would have been a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This is the third movie of Austrian Director Michael Haneke I watched. AMOUR (Love). It won the best foreign film Oscar. Michael 's direction is many times compared to Alfred Hitchcock. His movie Funny Games is the best example of building mysterious tension. The other movie I had seen was Piano Teacher \u2013 which was also exceptional in understanding unexplored sexual fantasies of a woman. Amour on other end tells the story of an old couple's Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) and George (Jean-Louis Trintignant)'s life. Starts with police breaking in their apartment and finding Anne's dead body. The movie goes ahead with a flashback when Anne and George come back from a concert. With time, Anne slowly loses her abilities and is struck with a paralytic attach on right side and after getting treatment in a hospital is confined to bed and wheelchair. The movie is about the struggle of old couple in a big Paris Apartment, where 3 times in a week a nurse comes to help Anne, otherwise George is the one who has to take care of bed-ridden Anne. It is a mirror to the audiences on loneliness, old-age, helplessness, slow process of decay and death in human body. Brilliantly executed. Though slow and not a flavor for everyone, especially those who are not sensitive towards the fact \u2013 that one day, they too will become old and face old age. Both Emmanuelle and Jean-Louis have acted brilliantly and taken the whole film on their shoulders. Direction is top class. There are moments that make you cry. After Anne gets paralytic attack I saw the rest of the movie with praying hands. There is brilliant musical score especially on piano. It has won 80 international awards and additional 83 nominations showcases its appreciation and acceptability in the type of movie it is. Essential for movie buffs who like good movies.LOVED it!(7.25 out of 10)",

            "content": "I'm a nineteen year old male (straight, before you ask) and I'd never cried in a film before I saw Amour. I even rarely release a tear when I've had one in my eyes, which I do get often during profoundly moving scenes such as the ones in Martyrs and Up, but that tear has never been released. Actually, I lie. I did release a tear when watching Brother Bear aged 10, but that doesn't particularly count. Amour has achieved the impossible and made me cry. And it wasn't just a tear either, it was pretty much full-on blubbing before I had to force myself to stop in fear of looking like a total moron in front of my family who were all weirdly dry eyed.The truth is that old love touches me. Even the scene of Leo and Marion growing old in limbo together in Inception makes me tear up! So when I first saw the wonderfully emotive poster for Amour I was interested. I watched the trailer and was even more interested. To top it all, I read that it was directed by one of my all time favourite directors, Michael Haneke! I was hooked! Then the hugely positive reviews came flooding in, and my favourite critic gave it the fill 5 stars and I became obsessed. I counted down the days of DVD release on my calendar because my stupid local cinema doesn't like to show foreign films and when the day finally came... It didn't disappoint.Amour is Michael Haneke's most human film I've seen. He's wonderful at capturing the harsh realities on film like no other director. His films feature static shots, making it seem like a live stream at times, such as the scene in Funny Games where the camera remains unmoved for 10 minutes. Amour is no different. It's long-takes capture how real and human this film really is, allowing us to focus on the characters and emotion rather than the direction. Long takes of Georges lying awake at night should touch you like no other, as it gives us time to ponder what's going on in the poor man's tortured head. Michael Haneke dares you not to look away as we see Anne's physical and mental health slowly deteriorate almost unbearably. Haneke even shows how degrading it can all be with relentless long takes that dare you not to look away.Right from its bold, horrific opening you know you're in for quite an ordeal. In fact, that opening sequence stayed with me throughout the films length, making everything seem all that more horrifying, as you know how it's going to end. The scene when Anne gets her first attack at breakfast is a startling one. Georges holds her face, which stares blankly and almost robotically past him which contrasts Georges look of complete horror and anxiety. It's from here that we see Anne go downhill and it's the fabulous screenplay by Michael Haneke which makes things all the more touching. He gives a completely un-schmaltzy view of romance making it seem all the more startling. Georges' devotion is so heart-warming and inspirational.The film is all the more horrible (in the best way possible) thanks to the outstanding performance by Emmanuelle Riva. Now, I can't comment on Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar triumph for Silver Linings Playbook because I haven't seen it. However, I highly doubt that it's as masterful and touching as Emmanuelle's. For most of the running time I forgot that she was acting, because she played the role with such powerful realism. The two actors also have a genuine connection together and their romance is totally believable. Throughout the second-half my eyes kept stinging like I was slicing an onion, and tears were welling up as Anne's health reached breaking point for Georges.Amour is full of profoundly sad scenes, but one of the saddest is when Georges is trying to give Anne a drink, but she doesn't drink it and he says something along the lines of, \"You must drink otherwise you'll die. You don't want to die do you?\" and the answer, sadly, is yes. Yet Georges doesn't want her to die so he tries his best to force it down her and his love for her has never seemed so strong. In fact, it was this scene which I was talking about with my Mum when I started to cry (which is ironically like the anecdote Georges tells). Michael Haneke also puts in a shocking scene towards the end that will stay with me forever.I've seen many of Michael Haneke's films (The Seventh Continent, Benny's Video, Funny Games, The Piano Teacher, The White Ribbon) and Amour is right up there with his finest works. It's emotionally draining and ultimately devastating. But this is also it's most profound strength. Amour, for me, is the ultimate weepy and is probably the most touching romance I've ever on film. Haneke proves he's still got it with his best film I've seen since Hidden. It will stick with me forever.",

            "content": "I've always been an admirer of Haneke's work but this film left me cold. It is well made and the performances are terrific (especially Jean-Louis Trintignant); Haneke is certainly a master filmmaker whose formality certainly demands attention. Such is his hold on the viewer that the film doesn't really allow for self-reflection or moments when one might mourn the loss of their own loved ones. It is very tightly contained. I think it is best described as Disneyland for people who've never had to deal with end of life issues.As a gay man who came of age during the AIDS in the '80s, death was always a factor. I felt surrounded by it and supported friends and strangers alike who suffered and died. Even beyond that, I've supported friends who cared for parents who were in declining health and died. (Gay sons and daughters often assume these roles.) It is a honour to care for people and share the last stages of their lives with them. Death is inevitable for us all but it ain't over 'till it's over.Maybe that's why it seems like such an indulgence. We all have loved ones. The couple depicted, comparatively, suffer very little. The have a roof over their heads, groceries delivered daily, you never see them on the phone haggling with insurance companies; she receives the necessary care. On reflection, it seems that Haneke is indignant that we should die at all! To add some drama, he takes an unfair crack at the nursing profession which hardly seems representative in my experience.The whole thing was very unedifying. I was reminded of far superior films on this topic, most notably the 1993 documentary Silverlake Life which records the last months of a documentary filmmaker's harrowing life with AIDS, both the good and the bad days, and is a true celebration of life and love; Kirby Dick's Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist (1997) is another startling record of long term illness and eventual death that manages to celebrate a difficult existence. These are films that truly look death in the face. Amour is just bourgeois old people in formalised decline with a nurse who brushed the old woman's hair too hard. For once, Haneke seems out of his depth; you almost wish the doorbell would ring and the film would lurch into a mashup of Funny Games and Amour. If someone videotaped it, you'd have Cache as well.Have been mystified by the across the board praise of this film. Are people really that distant from death?",

So this is a story about forgiveness. People might think they forgave or forgot something. But if forgiveness doesn't come from the heart then the situation continue to hunt them like a boomerang until the very end. To forgive is very easy. It is like freeing a bird. But Georges was not able to let it go. Haneke is a true genius. In such a short movie he was able to squeeze all the information needed. And I love all the cast - very beautiful performance.

This is a depressing and a thoroughly thought provoking film on death.The movie is named AMOUR that is LOVE in French and indeed it is all about love How distressed you would when your loved one is suffering is what this movie is based on Michael Haneke, one of the most accomplished and a great provocative director has brought to life one of the most inescapable truths in one of the most depressing and yet a thoroughly engaging way. Mind you, this is not a move that is enjoyable to the least, it is something that we must go through in our ripe age before we fall. But the process of suffering to death makes the one who really loves us so very distressed that it is tough even to express or contemplate what is going through. Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) and George (Jean-Louis Trintignant) are octogenarian (in their eighties) wife and husband. Anne has suffered paralytic strokes ad George has to take care of her. Now, he does take care and ensures that though she suffers, he does everything to reduce her suffering and to help her pass away peacefully. Michael Haneke who wrote this film, had his own past attached to such a process, where had to let go of someone he loved so much. Old age is not a great age to be in and especially, the eighties, we must be prepared coz any moment the clock can stop for us. It's supremely written and sublimely acted by these two actors who are really in their eighties. Emmanuelle Riva (85) is now the oldest nominee for an Academy Award (Oscar). I think, before their death this is one of the best gifts, these they have given us. Big thanks to Michael Haneke for bringing these prime-old people on board with a script that suits them perfectly and extracting sublime acting from them. Also, thanks to studios who have produced this. I can understand that this is a French Movie and French Movies mostly have an open Ending and this one too has an ending that can interpreted as freedom, liberation and even death. But truth of life is death and we have to accept that.Set mostly in an apartment between two people, this enthralls in the agony of the woman and I must say, Emmanuelle Riva has given a performance of her life The cinematography, sound and even the usage of \"Schubert\" music are splendid.Big thanks to Michael Haneke who has now become a pioneer of truly realistic cinema and indeed it's one of the best films of last year. I am not giving a complete 5/5 as I think the pace is too slow for a repeat viewing and thus giving a 4/5. I am not sure if I will subject myself to such pain again by watching this.It's sad to know that with the commercial garbage frenzy of Telugu Films, a beautiful film and many beautiful films like these have not been released at least in Hyderabad. It would be rude on my part to generalize but it's a sad fact that we as Telugu audience dwell and revel in commercialism more than the art. May the \"Businessman's\", \"Gabbar Singh's\" \"Adhurs\" or even \"Sudigaadu's\" or \"Naayaks\" live but LOVE is something that is very difficult for us to even feel. Proud of my Telugu Brothers and Sisters of the film industry who embrace crap and garbage and when art like this is made, it is censored in the name of \"explicit\". We are a hypocritical society and we shall be mostly that for generations to come. Sad but true.",

The film has a simple plot and story which is taken to extremes. Not by any plot twists or by constant changing camera angles, but by the truth and reality. The cinematography submerged you in the story. You begin to see the love between the couple and fall in love with their cute relationship yourself. Such a magnificent achievement by Michael Haneke, he should be proud of himself and his crew for this magnificent motion picture. Some movies like action movies with rapid changing plots, or drama movies that keep you crying constantly lose gripes of what a movie should be. A story taken off the pages and displayed visually by the actor and the portrayal of the character, and captured by the crew and director. This movie revived that form of capturing motion pictures.

Let's call it like that... at 86 it is (relatively) easy to play a role very close for your age and state of health (probably). Sure nobody expects her doing a role in \"expendables\" sequel, but I must admit her interpretation is pretty accurate, at least from a medical point of view. I find the final poorly made, like the author ran out of ideas. He should have \"killed\" her half an hour earlier, make the story shorter and embrace the \"dying in the arms of the beloved\" scene. Overall I rate it 6 out of 10; still a watchable movie, but way to overrated for winning Cannes and lately the Oscar. It fails due to clich\u00e9s.

            "content": "Amour (2012, Michael Haneke)\nIn 2012 this French film generated tremendous buzz and became one of the best reviewed films of the year including nabbing itself an Academy Award nomination for best picture. There is an elegant beauty to this tale of an elderly, professional couple who suffer personal tragedy when the wife, Anna, played by Emmanuelle Riva, is the victim of a stroke which is beginning of the end of their life together. The love and tenderness displayed by the two lead actors is amazing to see but this malady forces them to confront, abruptly and brutally, the mental and physical degradation of Anna. These themes are universally accessible as in some manner over the course of time we may all end up in similar situations. As much as these themes resonate there is an inaccessibility here which may be specific to this couple or may be attributable to a foreign, in this case French, sensibility. The couple in this case are professional and austere, both being former music teachers, and when confronted with these challenges they truly wish to cling to their privacy and deal with this situation alone away from prying eyes including those of former students, friends and even their children. It's as if the sympathy generated from this event is almost as painful as dealing with malady itself. From my very American sensibility I can see very clearly if this film were produced here there would have been a lot more melodrama and a lot more surface emotion as well as character confrontations. Here everything felt very under the surface as if this couple were determined to handle this event with as much dignity and propriety as they have conducted the rest of their life. Anna's condition continues to steadily degrade as husband Georges does his best to do right by her and care for her. In the end he faces a hard, emotionally devastating decision. This film is life affirming and wrenching at the same time, and it deals simply and quite honestly with how one couple faces challenges at the end of life. Some of these decisions challenge not only conventionally decision making but perhaps some moral personal doctrine as well however there is no script for how people should deal with tragedy or how best to love one's life partner and that is never so evident than in the manner presented here.\nEric's Grade: B+",

It is a study of management of suffering in a way. It is about living in the the twilight of life, of memory lapses, of ageing, of dementia, of senility. It is cold, clinical and slow in presentation. Definitely not recommended for audiences seeking entertainment. 80 plus Anne has undergone a paralytic attack and is being nursed at home by her husband George also 80 plus who is comparatively fitter both physically and mentally. Anne has taken a promise from her husband not to take her to hospital or to an elderly care home. Theirs is a mundane existence and the visit of a former student brings momentary cheer in their life. George becomes cynical to the extent that he dislikes sudden visits by daughter since he he feels she has come to check on him. The movie will stay with you long after you have left the theater. Reportedly director Michael Haneke had written the script with these two actors in mind and has shot the scenes in great detail whether both are conversing at the breakfast table or Anne is sitting up in bed while George is lovingly feeding her or helping her at the wheelchair. Worth mentioning is the scene where Anne gets her paralytic attack and freezes for some moments. The director has used the static camera, mid shots and silence to great effect. Anne's gradual health deterioration leading to her inability to speak coherently is depicted with great poignancy. She falls off her wheelchair too. George is shown taking perfect care with great patience though he does lose his temper once when she refuses to gulp down water and slaps Anne. A sensitive scene is one in which he is talking to her about earlier events. An interesting aspect of the movie is that the opening scene of the movie is actually the end.

In fact it make use of things that I really appreciate in a film. It's simple, but well build; it shows all the minor details of the life of the old couple, their habits, hobbies, and it's also loaded with symbolism on it\u0085 so I really have no complaints about the structure of the story. But the problem is: it's way too depressive. The entire film is so heavy and dark, I don't know. No, better, I know. It's the intention of director Michael Haneke to do the film this way. And I want to say that he really accomplished this goal. The anguish, the suffering, the tiredness, the loneliness, all of those uncomfortable feelings is exposed during the 120 minutes of film. So I think it's not really for everyone. It also has a beautiful about it. It really shows the love. I mean, generally, we see love in films, its always depicting the funny, the romantic and the erotic side of love. Michael Haneke, with Amour, shows the real love. The ending is also heart-breaking. I think that if you have sensibility with films, you'll love Amour, just like I do. But I don't know, being said, depressive films like that really don't appeals for me, but I could re-watch it with no major problems. A very intelligent film, with a powerful, simple and beautiful message.I liked a lot the acting in this film. Actor Jean Louis Trintignant and his fiction partner Emmanuelle Riva were excellent. I can imagine the level of difficult that this kind of roles offers, but they made everything look so easy. In fact, Riva's performance was one of the best so far in 2012. Again, don't be fooled by the apparently simplicity of this film. It's terrific, and certainly you won't regret watching. 8.6/10",

The slow pacing and realism to life is what delivers the blows and punches so hard towards the end of the film. What most filmmakers/writers would choose to show in a film, Haneke doesn't show those things, but instead in his directing/writing style he chooses to show the things one usually doesn't get to see in a film which makes for an interesting, delightful as well as a disturbing experience. As Haneke showed us how non-glorifying torture really is in Funny Games(2007 version that I saw), Haneke shows us how non-glorifying all aspects of life are such as getting old, living life in the now, true love as well as hate and ego. A truly masterful film thanks to the subtlety of the director and all of the little nuances that lead us, the viewer, through an emotional battle right to the end with the two main leads. You feel like you will be going through it with the two main leads in Amour as you felt you were going through the emotions with the three hostages in Funny Games(2007 version again).",

            "review_title": "Haneke examines age and mortality.",
            "content": "I definitely think this is Michael Haneke's best film so far. My take on Haneke is that he's a razor sharp, precise, but somewhat limited artist. It's very difficult for me to imagine a Haneke film that did not take intense human suffering as its major focus. But here, he finds a way to look at suffering that is natural and universal, rather than exceptional and perverse, and thus the work's unflinching nature seems compassionate. Haneke's camera-work has never impressed me more. He's always found ways to utilize the master-shot in enigmatic and challenging ways, but in an intellectual and thematic way rather than, for me, a truly aesthetic one. I've traditionally found myself thinking about, more than looking at, his work. Not so here. The long takes are magisterial in both orchestration and profundity. The best, such as Georges's dual with a pigeon, are major cinematic accomplishments in and of themselves. Similarly, the acting in the film reaches higher levels than it does, I feel, in the director's other work. Occasionally, Haneke lets his message dominate his eye and ear. This sometimes affects the ways the performers embody the characters in his films. Dealing with the natural and universal horror of mortality, Haneke can here let life be lived. This allows the performers to more naturally inhabit the characters' skins. Figures only glimpsed at, such as the concierge's husband, are played out with rich humanity. Before seeing the film, I read my former professor Roy Grundmann's superb analysis of it in the December 2012 edition of Senses of Cinema, and his reading of the work of course greatly shaped my viewing of it. In his article, Roy deftly details the influence of Theodore Adorno's thought on Haneke's cinema. In this regard, the previous work of Haneke's that I think \"Amour\" most resembles is \"Seventh Continent.\" In both films bourgeois domesticity, the space of capitalistic being, is depicted as a trap that can only be tolerated through commodity consumption, in the former film, or art in the slightly less dreary recent film, and escaped only through self-annihilation. In and of itself, this outlook could loosely be described as dialectical, but only in a fully negative and defeatist way. This is an element of \"Amour,\" but I think something more complicated is at work here than in the early work for two reasons. First, while Anne and Georges' lives are reduced to something that must be escaped, Haneke acknowledges that the horror of the bourgeois subject, who is born only to die, loves only to lose, and is named only to be forgotten, is still loved along the way, and there are thus moments of joy for this subject. Secondly and more radically, the next to last scene contains what I feel to be the only elational moment in all of Haneke's oeuvre. The space of capitalist being is literally exited, abandoned by subjectivity for a more liberating beyond. Adorno would acknowledge that art could suggest a beyond that could give the subject a reprieve from its state of being, and of course this is only a work of art. But I wonder if, in for the first time depicting a successful escape from bourgeois space, the capitalist state, Haneke is not suggesting something more tangible than Adorno would allow. In this sense, \"Amour\" strikes me as more Althusserian in its thinking. Having been named from birth and put in our place, we must simply find ways to unname ourselves and we're back together on the avenue, kids! The last scene, in which Anne and Georges' middle-aged daughter re-enters their apartment, taking their place, seems to me almost a call to action. How much longer are we to inherit this system, this life, in which we individuals are born only to line up to die?",

It's certainly not entertaining, in fact, it's rather painful to watch.

After living a comfortable, cultured life, circumstances change in an instant once good health fails. In this case, a man in his 80s suddenly becomes caregiver to his wife, doing things and making decisions which previously never crossed his mind.Major kudos to Jean-Louis Trintignant, whose exceptional performance tops anything he's done in his long, prodigious career on screen. He says not a word in a scene where he watches a nurse bathe his wife, yet his face conveys everything that needs to be said. In another scene where he fires an unsuitable nurse, he manages to keep his dignity and resolve despite his compromised defenses. Just two examples of many well-played episodes.I would have liked a less ambiguous ending, yet as it stands, \"Amour\" reinforces the point that there can be no good ending for a situation like this.

It was a brilliant subject in contrary were the title refers to love and the characterization at the end shows the exact opposite. It was the decorum of Love-Hurt-Hate were I am at the edge to point the word hate there because it's not actually the hate we are always in connect with. Anyway the film was a new experience.

            "content": "Please watch the film first then read my comment. Otherwise I might be ruining an experience worth having.Haneke is known for his shocking films, but nothing he's done compares to \"Amour\" (2012) at all. It is a gut-wrenching portrait of physical decay and the absolute-seeming end that death is, the final frontier. I suppose this will go very deep if you know death, what it really is like, instead of a mere cinematic, heroic glorification of it. There is no glory here, no winners who are left standing, panting, bathing in sunlight. There's barely any music, save for what is heard in concert and on the piano forte at the apartment. Ah, there's the record, too.Only few films have had a similar effect on me, namely an utterly, completely life-affirming one. I saw this at an afternoon screening with mostly pensioners. I cried, then the film ended, I left in silence, drove home, and couldn't wait to see my wife and daughter. Unsparing an experience, Haneke's gift of keeping his distance pays dividends, especially in the key scenes that some will politicize but which just are there. They're shown to us, but they don't preach. They just are.All performances are absolute master classes in acting. Riva's Anne and Trintignant's Georges compliment each other, the former the extrovert, the latter the introvert role, and despite Riva's to-the-bone performance, I really want to emphasize the character of Georges, who observes, has to endure, but mostly silently. What is he to do but to keep up the appearance? As he points out in the film, things keep getting worse until it all stops. This is not heartlessness, this is the voice of a tired man, knowing there's absolutely nothing he can do but endure. It's exactly the kind of subdued, nuanced emotion Trintignant brought to a very similar role in Kieslowski's \"Trois couleurs: Rouge\" (1994).A summa of sorts, if that's your cup of tea: cinema doesn't only heal, it can hurt. And I suppose if we really love film, it also should, sometimes. That only means we're still alive, and human.",

            "content": "Most filmed love stories depict the beginnings and complications of couples searching for happiness and a future together. In rare exceptions (The Notebook) do we also see the waning days of love, and with Amour, we are witness to the end of a long union of husband and wife, whose longevity is matched by their love for one another. It is a bittersweet study in the challenges and hardships that are grim reminders that although life is finite, love transcends time. As written and directed by Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher), the story is a realistic study of love, loyalty, and responsibility in a marriage.Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) are a married, elderly couple who share a love of classical piano music and live in a modest apartment. One day, following a visit to a classical concert, Anne is paralyzed by a stroke, and as her body begins to fail her, she and her husband must adjust to a new way of living and the inevitability of the end. What transpires in the following days and weeks amid concerns of their daughter, Eva (Isabelle Huppert), will test an enduring love to its very limits.Featuring two leading actors who starred in two of the more haunting, romantic films at the beginning of the French New Wave Cinema, (Riva in Hiroshima Mon Amour and Trintignant in A Man and a Woman), it is ironic that we see these veteran performers, as aged spouses. Riva makes us feel for her, and she conveys much feeling with her facial expressions particularly in her eyes or the absence of any reaction as she convincingly depicts the gradual deterioration of a human being physically and spiritually. Trintignant deserves credit for making us feel his plight as husband and caregiver. He gives Riva an equal in acting.The contrast of their day to day routines is thrown awry by fate, and the hardship of caring for an physically impaired family member is heartbreaking. The details of hiring healthcare workers, helpful neighbors who buy groceries, acquiring a hospital bed or wheelchair, and even the simplest acts of human function are a challenge. When Anne asks to see a family photo album, we know this is a sign that this is the beginning of the end of her quality of life as she is reviewing her past and better times. There are moments you wonder how much can Georges take and to what lengths he will endure to support his wife's well being. There are echoes of Million Dollar Baby in the incapacity of a loved one and how those closest must come to terms with life. It is a tragedy being played out before our eyes.There is symbolism of a pigeon that repeatedly flies into the apartment; perhaps it represents a precious life that is a metaphor for Anne. Even the sounds of activity in their kitchen speak to their routine at mealtime. Indeed, most of the story takes place in their apartment. The absence of a musical score adds to its realism and immediacy.Despite a somber tone, Amour is blessed with great performances that cap two legendary careers. Give Haneke credit for an ambiguous, bold ending with its memorable imagery; it reaffirms the power of love. The film says that this may be the end of a life but not the end of love.",

Riva was the protagonist in Hiroshima mon amour, portraying an entirely different aspect of love, which though deeply felt and moving, now seems so inconsequential. Similarly Trintignant's intellectual musings and vigorous debate about morality and infidelity in My night at Maude's seems so quaint and indulgent in light of his all too real task of taking care of his ailing wife.The ever-beautiful Isabelle Huppert, another of my all-time favorite actresses, gives her usual strong performance as a caring and loving daughter, yet who does not grasp the depth of the situation, even though it is commonplace, a simple three-penny opera, about that stage of life all of us will eventually have to deal with, no matter how hard we look away from it.Yet despite all the cold realism, and sadness, the ending is one of the most unapologetically romantic scenes ever - a perfect coda and uplifting summation of the daily joy of two shared lives, in synchronicity until the end.A refreshingly mature look at the true meaning of love...",

            "content": "It is perplexing how far foreigners are from Hollywood, yet so close and embedded into the epicness that is filmmaking! Amour (love) a French originating movie roams around an elderly couple; the husband (Georges) played by jean-Louis trintignant, and the wife (Anne) played by Emmanuelle Riva. The couple has experienced a bumpy road in their years of marriage, when Anne was paralyzed! Georges, as weak and incapable as he is, decides to swiftly and gracefully pass through that road and work in desperation to accelerate his wife's recovery.Foreign movie has never made residence in my \"must-watch\" list; in fact, Amour is my second non-English movie I've watched. Preceded by the Bollywood movie \"kites.\" Frankly, kites has changed my perspective on foreigner's story writing, but cinematography and direction is right where I left them (down low). Amour piled up a great story with outstanding direction by always recommended Michael haneke. In my years of movie viewing, in most cases I criticized a character's actions and decisions based on this question, \"why did the screenwriter make the character do this?\" looking out of the box was my forte, but amour stuck me inside the box that made me jump out of my seat! This scene really speaks for itself! A young nurse brought to take care of Anne; was brutally combing Anne's hair, it was clear that she was in pain but the obnoxious nurse neglected that! Georges fired the nurse that triggered her insults! Insults after insult and I was like, \"how dare you? He's at least 60 years older!\" the remarkable screen writing was really the cause of this attachment with the movie! Years and years together all they have is each other! 60 years looking at one face, 60 years and only one person to say \"I love you\" to. Boredom was not in this couple's dictionary! Georges wanted to help, he has seen his wife in her worst form; but to see her arm fixed on her stomach wrinkled as a branch and hanging their like a stick. To see her walking on one foot the right one utterly useless! That stuff can hurt a man, a man who truly loves her and indeed he did! He forcefully fed her, bathed her waked her to the bathroom, to the living room, going from one room to another lifting her from the arm chair to the couch back to the arm chair to the bathroom back to the arm chair and then on bed! An 80 year old! He could barely walk let alone carry her! What I liked was in the kicking moments of the movie, when Anne was still in her senses, she taught him how to carry her, he didn't know how to take care of a person but then with this scene it is as if she told him \"next three months please carry me though it! Moreover, the smooth transition from her in her complete senses to her in ability to distinguish light from day was extraordinary! A sweet woman to an old wreck, you could almost put them next to each other and won't know the difference! After all the help Georges is providing to Anne; the viewers are left to wonder who is taking care of him. Who's cooking? Who's doing the heavy lifting? Well, the viewers are assured and are presented with the outside people who are taking care of them! It's almost the screenwriter has extensive knowledge in what the viewers want to see and what their worried from.Moving on, haneke adopts a new set of camera movements that I haven't seen before. Camera set and the characters are moving, either it is fixed on one character and even though the other character is talking it is still in that character. And the camera is fixed on a room, Georges and Anne going in and out of the room but the camera is not moving with them! In my opinion a movie with impeccable acting should be associated with such a movement! It's like there are no takes they're playing the entire scene in one go; they don't need to film it more than once Anne Georges would nail from the first go! A successful movie? Definitely! Nominated for five Oscars and winning for best foreign movie! Nominations including: best actress, director, screenplay, best motion picture! With a budget of $8,900,000 and earning $19,691,729 is great for a foreign movie! I could talk all day, but at a moment I will be forced to stop, and now's the moment! If you want an emotional elderly love story all comprised in a great movie, then this is your choice!",

The elderly, we are told, are a growing segment of the market for entertainment and so want movies they can relate to. This means films featuring old people dealing with old people's issues. As a confessed member of this group I can say that I think it's a spurious view and this beautiful film, Amour, illustrates why. An elderly couple with a high-culture lifestyle live a secluded but contented life in their Parisian apartment. One day, the woman suffers a minor stroke and so begins a gradual physical and mental decline which tests their love to, and beyond, breaking point. New challenges appear at every turn and must be confronted by the couple alone: the indignities of loss of control of bodily functions, loss of physical mobility, loss of communication, loss of shared activities. But not loss of love, for that endures. As their world shrinks and distances them even from their uncomprehending family, they draw ever closer. Love conquers all, though not the love of roses and chocolates but of bed baths and incontinence pads!The performances of Jean-Louis Trintingant, as the husband, Georges, and of Emmanuelle Riva as his wife, Anne, are wonderfully handled. There is a spareness about the direction which perfectly captures the paring down of Life to its essentials, both tender and grim. We watch knowingly, sympathetically, sadly. There's nothing else we can do.This movie may well bore, and perhaps even disgust, a younger audience who either have no elderly parents or who are too far from their older selves to be able to identify with Georges and Anne's plight. I found it quite profoundly moving. But to return to my opening remarks, this reminder of all our futures is not one I wish to dwell on. Nor do I, at least, want patronising 'comedies' about stereotypical 'old folk'. My guess is that the marketeers (all well below pensionable age, I'm sure) are wrong - what the Silver Pensioneers want is not even realist movies about old-age, like Amour, but good old-fashioned escapism!Open the champagne!

Husband takes care of paralyzed wife until he cracks and kill her. Directing: I would not call it brilliant but it is undoubtedly spectacular. Still pictures with characters who talk freely let you admire apartment's old rooms and start to get attached to them and the house, which you wouldn't the notice it until the final credits run. Dove image entering the house is very telling about the two husbands life, since they can't get out of their house and it's becoming a flat world, the dove appears to be a cry of nature of life thrown in front of Georges, Georges who prefer to suffocate him as he did with Anne. Cameras are not very active, but are recording everything. For me I had a feeling you capture the intrusion into the lives of two, usually a sensation that felt especially when scenes filmed indoors recurring or spectator feeling, but rather the reader or listener. Very strange feeling, really and do not know how he managed to induce that Haneke, because is pleasant and terrifying. Scenario: the end is predictable, but who cares!? The story is beautifully constructed with care, cursive, elegant, endearing. When the final credits start to run you think a part of you died. Superb cooperation between script and directing. Dialogues: I do not even remember a scene where a word said to be felt further replies fillers crappy melodramatic clich\u00e9's that should appear in a movie just to make the feeling that one who sees the movie will come out more smart from the cinema due to a little wiser coehlian \"words of wisdom\". Dialogues natural flowing, elegant, nothing superfluous, incredibly simple and real.Characters: Excellent built, carefully sketched except their daughter, which is quite normal because of the role that it is episodic. Anna's character easily and you can see it is easy to empathize with her even though her \u200b\u200brole half of the film is wining or cry disparate words. Georges has moments in which he reveals the true nature but is fine Haneke brought under control until the end. Actors: the two elders are amazing. I do not know if Jean-Louise Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva Amour made \u200b\u200bin their life roles of actors but are clear to me the most interesting and fascinating actors who managed to make their characters incredible real.

I just believe that he wasn't tired of seeing her suffer like that, but was tired of doing so much for her. He just needed to end his own suffering. The movie didn't make any sense to me at all. Boring, to say the least. 'Love' is a very big word and sure it has different representations and meanings for different people. But this movie was nowhere close to what we can call \"love\". Tell me one instant or one scene where you can picture or feel love? Highly disappointed with the movie. Very long too.",

            "content": "Love, as easy it is between two young blossoming soul, is as difficult between two frail souls at the end of their life. The movie leaves the audience, often blissfully ignorant or negligent, with a poignant helplessness. The story goes beyond judgment in its slow heavy paces which can easily clutch hold of your sleeping emotions and not let go.It is a masterpiece of direction and acting, set in modern France. The smooth, yet lonely, life of two retired old French musicians becomes lonelier when one of them succumbs to paralysis. Each day brings with it further decay and challenges until it is a war between love and loss. The movie is recommended for those of us, too blind to acknowledge life in all its forms.It is, unlike most movies of our time, lacking in unnecessary background music. The pace of the movie is slow which only magnifies the emotions.",

Giving you a real idea of what Love truly is, and bringing meaning to the words 'in sickness and in health, till death do us part' . It shows us real love not the early frivolous stages of love, We see in most movies. Haneke brings us this dour rather depressing set of circumstances but still manages to make a viewer almost hopeful.The shots in the moving are brilliantly still, giving us a true look at these lives. Haneke famous for not turning away with his shots. Even though in some scenes we should beg, you would like him to. You can tell it is personal film to him and that every shot rings true. The performances are powerful and mesmerising. Emmanuelle Riva receiving the majority of the plaudits, which are very deserving. But for me Jean- Louis Trintignant is equally as good.Many may find this truly unbearable to watch. As the idea of illness and old age are not things anyone wants to be faced with, and forced to be shown unbearable pain and sadness. But this does also shows us true courage, and emotional honestly that we rarely see in other films.",

            "content": "A 7 out of 10 is a generous score. There are parts of this film that are drawn out necessarily in order to gain a better perspective and deeper empathy of what it is like to battle the \"dark side\" of aging. But there are other scenes in this film that are arduously long that IMO have no relevance to the central theme and is patronizing to the audience. Some of the script, (well executed by great actors) contain words of wisdom and give voice and reverence to the elderly which often never gets portrayed respectfully or realistically in a lot of films. One notable thing this film did for me (whether it was intended by the makers or not) is ask the question why so many cultures place so many dividing lines among age groups and in a very forced and conscious way. There are some obvious reasons for distinction and exclusion, but some are perpetuated not because of realistic reasons or circumstances but by prejudice/discrimination.",

            "content": "Another Haneke's gem. Amour may divide the audiences by this simple statement: those who lived Georges and Ann experiences, and those who didn't. In that issue I have to tell you I am so simpathetic about the whole movie through. I'm so touched with the awesomeness of the actors in the plot. This is not a movie for everyone, this may not be a movie to watch at cinema with your soda and pop-corn. There are very deep matters involved.. I have to tell you I had to live those experiences myself in terms of taking care to a beloved familiar through the illness, through perspectives of death. That awkward feeling of miscarriage. Helplessness. Fury, anger, unaffordability. Coping with the uncopable. It's a very harsh movie for those who didn't have that painful feeling of loss. And it involves so many perspectives. In those cases of terminal illnesses you do what you can, what you feel. And what you feel all the way through is love.And all these elements are present in this masterpiece. And I mean masterpiece because no one I've noticed had the guts to tell these situations as they are, really. They are unbearable, but somehow, you do manage to bear them with that obscure ingredient that is our humanity. How do we cope with death, or its proximity.The feeling that lingers is LOVE. This movie came to me as the rain in the desert, because I had to cope myself with those situations not so long ago. And I understand every bit of it, I feel I'm not the only one who thinks the same about a terminal illness. About the respect our beloved ones deserve when they feel their time has come. And our behavior in those terms.Needless to say, the actors are wonderful, and Haneke wrists it wonderfully in his own style (which sometimes made me lose my nerve-that 's because his still-camera all the way through).Superb. Poignant. Sad. Harsh. But absolutely REAL. And absolutely full of love.I don't know if it deserves the Academy Awards (I personally think that this is too much for those guys to handle, because it messes with the real deal and the deepest human behavior). But nevertheless, it's a gem I'll never forget.Thank you, Mr. Haneke. I'm not alone on that feeling: LOVE.Cheers from Argentina.",

            "content": "Without interfering with the essence of the movie, it could have well been edited down to a more conventional length, and in that way, made palatable to more moviegoers. Indeed, not everything portrayed required the patience, skill and subtlety that is apparent when, early-on in the movie, the writer and director set out the basis, even the rationale, for the astonishing events that unfold. That more time should have been taken to establish the connection between the husband and wife is unwarranted. No one can or should doubt that this couple was spiritually and intimately connected even before their vows. Near the end, their wills clash, but only temporarily. And so, this is a hard, harsh, uncompromising presentation of the realities of an aging couple, one spouse with progressing debilitation, brought to the screen and mind, without the customary movie drama and softeners. In short, a slice of life, at the end of life, starkly presented without apology. If one expects more, s/he may be disappointed. But if one is willing to nakedly peer into the care-at-home reality of a couple who enjoyed a lifetime of \"Amour\", now 80-something, it is absolutely powerful, if not numbing.",

Thank God there is not some annoying musical score. America could never make a film this honest and blunt. And leave it to the stupid critics to not realize that it is Jean-Louis Tritignant's movie. I am not taking anything away from her, but the focus is on him. He is in nearly every scene. Just watch how he subtly ages. This is sometimes painful to watch but it is never sad. The fact that a spouse so strongly endures what he or she can is the ultimate love. I didn't cry. But I really felt this one. It doesn't get any better. Enjoy it? Sort of. If you are strong enough.",

            "content": "The film is one of the best romantic films coming from the European Cinema till date. Directed by acclaimed Austrian director Michael Haneke, the film which won the Best Foreign Language Film at the 85 Academy Awards and the Palme D Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, has a narrative whose structure follows an aged couple where the lady suffers from Paralysis and how her husband helps her till a tragic ending with their abroad staying daughter suffering the pains (based on an event happened in the director's family). The best thing about the film lies in the cinematography by Darius Khondji and the screenplay by the director himself where the still framing in most of the scenes in the film employs conversations and moments that make the film progress well, making it gripping. The editing by Monika Willi is smooth and she also employs some motif based shots well that actually make them a vital part in the film's narrative. The music score has been rarely, yet well placed in the film. A word about the performances: Excellent. Emmanuel Riva as the paralysed old woman is simply mindblowing and Jean Louis Trintignant as the husband is great and their chemistry is superb in the film. Isabelle Huppert, Alexandre Tharaud and rest are brilliant. Overall, this film is a must watch for film lovers, enthusiasts and students and moreover the die hard romantics as well! My rating would be 4.5/ 5.\ufeff",

Where is you heart I may ask.The movie is about 'Love' , the love of an elderly couple, well situated in the upper middle class. They live their lives at a slow pace, but still enjoy going to a classical concert of one of their past students, something they have been looking forward to. The day after everything chances when Anne is suddenly not responding to her husband's Georges. Their lives completely change as Anne's health is slowly deteriorating. Haneke chose to film entirely in the couple's apartment which gives the movie a claustrophobic feeling, there is not much left of their lives then looking after Anne. Both Riva as Anne and Trintignant as Georges are outstanding, absolutely heartbreaking is the scene where Georges is teaching Anne to sing Sur Le Pont... Absolutely heartbreaking, if you don't feel the love between them, don't see the incredible powerlessness of their fate I ask you what does? Very touching movie. Outstanding acting.10/10",
