            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: English Vinglish",
            "content": "Many will know I have been following Bollywood films over the last few years with keen interest, with one of the prime reasons being, why not? We have dedicated halls and screens which are always showing the latest the industry has to offer, very often having same day premieres, and I cannot fathom having to close this option off for the lack of language ability. English subtitles is a boon, and my only option to understand what's being said on screen. English is of course the plot element here in this film, written and directed by Gauri Shinde, who has made a film that's strong in heart, and powerful in performance.I'm talking about Sridevi's comeback to cinema, having retired some 15 years ago to raise her kids. And this leave of absence surely helped her in her protagonist role here, but more on that later. For those unaware, like I was previously, Sridevi is arguably the best actress Indian Cinema has produced over the last few decades, and it is only today that I fully understood why. Her performance as Shashi, the traditional Indian housewife, is impeccable, and the littlest of nuances put into her role, reaped results in the manifold. As a line of dialogue described, her eyes are like coffee drops in a saucer of milk, and that in itself is an understatement.Charisma is something that you have, or have not, and Sridevi's presence is something that arrests your attention immediately when she comes on screen. Carrying the entire movie, it's unbelievable to think that she's pushing 50 already, as her performance here will probably inspire many actresses of today's generation sit up and take note, to realize that they still have a long way to go to reach a fraction of her level. I'm sold, impressed, and very eager to catch up on her filmography to see what more she had to offer during the 80s and 90s when she was at the peak of her popularity then.Her comeback in English Vinglish is a casting coup for its filmmakers, and let's not forget Shinde's story which was custom fit for her as well, playing the role of a mother, which probably made it quite an easy transition back to the industry. But it's an important role because one of the key takeaways from the narrative, is how we often take those who love us for granted, and as part of the process, inadvertently hurt them too. We may not realize it, or sometimes we do, but these hurt will likely be the worst possible. A callous word and a careless comment go a long way, and is difficult to, or sometimes cannot be taken back.It's something many of us have been through and experienced, regardless which side of the equation one was on, where respect does not get accorded, and where words go out to make others feel small about themselves. In Shashi's case, this happens to be her lack of command in the English language, perceived to be an ability of social status, made quite unbearable when her children thinks it so, and when her husband (Adil Hussain) also gets in on a private joke with their daughter.The film's story worked on many layers, and what I especially admired is how Sridevi becomes the spokesperson for lessons without being too overt about it, save for the ending speech that hammers in the emotion, and is sure to make your eyes well up. It deals with, on a macro level, how as humans we should be helpful and tolerant to those who don't speak our language or understand our culture, that one shouldn't be made to think one's superior just because, or make the other look small. And on the more micro level, the structure of the family and its importance. All these and more, told through a story about a woman finding her inner strength to stand out, stand up and be counted, building and reinforcing confidence that she's more than just a Laddoo machine.But social factors aside, the more obvious ingredient that's put into the movie, is the Mind Your Language type scenes when Shashi enrolls herself into an English crash course to learn conversational English in four weeks. Instead of Mr Brown, there's Mr David (Cory Hibbs) the teacher (whose sexual orientation again highlights the differences in the human race and the need for tolerance and acceptance), and a motley crew of classmates from various parts of the world bonding together. From a woman who centered her life around family, building a network of friends became something of a lifeline of sorts, in keeping life interesting through the sharing of experiences, and of course, food.English Vinglish has everything a typical Indian film contains, from comedy to romance - handled with such maturity - culture and language. What more, it has Sridevi's remarkable return, showing why she was, and still is, one of the iconic female actresses ever to grace the screens of Indian Cinema. A definite recommendation, and though formulaic at parts, is delivered with such slickness, that I'd shortlist it as one of the best this year.",

            "review_title": "A Satisfying Experience",
            "content": "The essence of few stories lies in its simplicity portraying characters from our day-to-day lives and their struggle. English Vinglish is one such beautifully woven simple concept with which audience can identify themselves.English Vinglish is the story of Mrs Shashi Godvale,a regular home-maker from an upper middle-class household whose life revolves around doing the regular household chores. Alongwith homemaking she keeps her passion for cooking intact and within the homely set-up started a small scale business by making laaddoos. Her potential never gets the due diligence from either her indifferent husband who seem to get charged up only in bed, or her daughter who is ashamed of her mother's lack of English knowledge. It seems her lack of sophistication has even crafted the gap with her husband. She is more connected to her little son and her caring mother-in-law. Under circumstances she lands up in New York for her elder niece's wedding and eventually in an English tuition class and the story follows how her life changes thereafter. Learning a new language is symbolic of a key to regain her long lost confidence and self-esteem. Gauri Shinde's directorial debut needs to be applauded for the sheer treatment of the film. She wrote a dignified script which never crossed the line becoming overtly-dramatic. Her skill lies in passing a relevant message without getting didactic. The film re-iterates the importance of woman in our lives. In fact it is dedicated to all the middle-class housewives who are never valued in their own household in this patriarchal society.Mrs Godvale showcases pathos of all such women who are dying under the burden of inconsequential existence even though they have significant potential unexplored. Shinde's script does justice to all the characters. The characters are simple and relatable. Mr Godvale is never depicted as a wife beating devil or an infidel husband. He is just a regular working professional who has lost interest in her wife due to cultural differences and sadly that's the scenario of most arranged marriages (still) happening in our country where the wife is not at par as husband in terms of social strata. Such a marriage becomes a compromise, unsigned deal where physical proximity is rampant but the mental bonding is like searching meaning in a RohitShetty film.The English tuition reminds us of famous yesteryear serial \"Zaban Sambhalke\" where genius Pankiaj Kapoor played the Hindi teacher. There we had hybrid of cultures which created hilarious sequences due to their differences but by the end they got united under the umbrella of a common language. The setting is similar here and the students here are well-edged characters who help in elevating the pace of the film. With mixture of various cultures the experience that comes out is satisfyingly hilarious. Using the back-drop of the tuition class Shinde throws subtle hints on different issues like Indo-Pak peace, tolerance towards homosexuals and understanding them etc. She even used this medium to hint on the hypocrite mindset of male dominated Indo-Pak society as they verbally attacked the French student for openly admitting his soft corner towards Shashi. The relationship between Shahshi and the french student Laurent reminded of relationship shown in WoodyAllen's films. As she converse in Hindi and he reciprocates in French, there seem to be exchange of bouquet of emotions even though they are alien to each other's language. That's the power of feeling and mutual respect which Shashi wanted from her husband. Shashi & Laurent relationship remained as sweet and subtle as the rest of the film. The film can be summarized in one statement of Godvale where she sadly exclaimed that she doesn't need love; she needs Respect. It seems majority of the woman of India is speaking through her and with watery eyes I remember my own mother.I had even lost the opportunity to hug her and openly express my love for her which I never did while she was there beside me \uf04cTechnically the film is well edited by Hemanti Sarkar. The scenes never looked dragged. Utekar's cinematography added the feel-good factor without swaying into K Jo style of escapist extravaganza. Amit Trivedi's music is, as always, rocking. He manages to surprise with every film and his music syncs with the mood of the film, never looking like a separate music album unlike most music directors' scores. Swanand Kirkire is a gifted lyricist and he proved his mettle yet again. And special mention to casting directors (Rita & Sean Powers) who came up with some brilliant and off-beat cast for the film. Sridevi is plain brilliant as Mrs Godvale. I was never a Sridevi fan but was amused by her potential which I felt was never utilized to the fullest barring few films. She looked confident and underplayed her role to suit the character. Adil Hussain as her husband is expectantly efficient and did justice to his NSD degree. One of the finest actors, I sincerely hope this film opens more doors for him. Experienced French actor Mehedi Nebbou was fantastic in the role of Laurent and expressed with his eyes. His equation with Sridevi deserves mention. Priya Anand is spontaneous as Shashi's niece who instills confidence in Shashi's character. Cory Hibbs is rocking as the English teacher. The whole bunch of actors as the students of English tuition are superb. Rest of the supporting cast are all splendid especially the adorable kid who played Shahshi's son. Amitabh Bachchan is present in a meaningful cameo in the flight scene. Overall English Vinglish is a simple and linear yet effective,a touching story of majority housewives of our previous generation. While we are heading towards a more independent society we sincerely hope the mindset towards our woman changes so that we can Really be Proud of our culture and parampara.Hope the time is not far away with more Godvale's understanting their worth and fighting to earn back their dignity rather than letting oneself to be a subject of sympathy.",

            "content": "\"If we don't love ourselves we use to attract towards new things but as soon as we began to love ourselves we feel confident and old things look prettier again.\" This is one dialogue from the movie's lead protagonist which teaches how one can come back to his normal life; English Vinglish is a sweet Laddu with almonds of a logical script, cashew nuts of nice music, raisins of love and pistachios of Hope. English Vinglish is not about just English classes, it's just a metaphor or platform to narrate a simple yet very effective story of self determination, self respect and love about family and love about ourselves.English Vinglish is undoubtedly a movie about the Family, the children & their attitude towards their parents, the husband who does not see his wife skills and potential beyond a born Laddu Maker and yes, it's about a mother who lost her identity as a woman in the society after marriage being a house wife, as her world does not go beyond her family.Shashi Godbole (Sridevi) is a simple middle class housewife living with her husband Satish (Adil Hussain) along with her daughter Sapna and a son named Sagar in Pune, India. She is an excellent cook searching for her own respect among children and husband due to poor understanding of English language. One day she got the call from her sister to visit New York to attend her daughter's wedding, but she was reluctant to go alone because of her poor English language, thou she finally agreed on her husband's persuasion. In New York, during her visit to a caf\u00e9 she felt humiliated due to her understanding of English language which brought a reason for her to fight against the odds and make a place for herself. She left from there and suddenly saw an advertisement for four weeks English speaking classes and that's how she got the way to prove herself by learning a language which is global now and a synonym of 'Being Modern' in Indian societies called English, for Her VINGLISH.Overall, English Vinglish is a memorable watch for the genuine script, superb performances, nice music and definitely the feel good factor it has. In Last scene, Shashi requests the air hostess a Hindi newspaper in English Language, and that's we called in Sridevi's MJ Style without getting 'Judgemental' \u2013YoOO.Regards Your's AvAFor complete review Please visit www.thecritiquelab.comReaders' Feedback is appreciated",

            "review_title": "English Vinglish - Beautiful Sheautiful",
            "content": "English Vinglish is a beautiful journey that a middle class Indian housewife takes, to regain something she lost or probably never really got, ironically enough, in a foreign land with a foreign language as a tool.The movie has a simple plan, and audience gets to know about it right at the beginning. There ain't any surprises or twists therein to wow you, its purely the execution of a simple yet universally appealing plot that makes English Vinglish one of the most beautifully made movie of the year.This is a sort of cinema which has traditionally been oiled with loads of melodrama and any director would have wanted to do that considering the fact that people who are going to relate the most with the central character are most prone to be pleasantly affected by the overdose of melodrama ( Yes, I am being a little 'judgemental' here!). Credit must go to Gauri Shinde for shunning the temptation and going ahead with a recipe where she was able to create delight out of right mix of ingredients rather than putting a coating of sugar on the 'laddoos'. Make no mistake, the feel good factor of the movie isn't there just because all the pieces have been put together in the correct order but also because there are layers attached to the story and the characters. These layers help English Vinglish surpass the expectations that an ordinary viewer would have had with it before stepping into the cinema theatre. These layers have been treated with utmost care and are interwoven in the script with great skill. Even though the plot of the movie doesn't encapsulate many genres, the scenes are successful in generating a range of emotions. Thanks to the central plot, humor becomes a part of majority of the scenes and it is never forced upon you.The entertainment quotient of EV is way more than one would have expected. There are a few sequences which could have easily gone in the zone of 'Oh, thats ridiculous!' but yet they were right there in the 'that will do all right' category and this was only possible because of masterful Sridevi who hasn't lost even an inch of her charm and she still stands way ahead of any of the contemporary actresses when it comes to the art of acting. Her presence is so overpowering that one hardly notices or gets annoyed by certain instances of manufactured dialogues and stereotypical display of characters. The journey, the transformation and its impact on the movie and the audience wouldn't have had half the quality had there not been Sridevi at the helm. Every other actor (and guest actor) plays their part well enough to create the right garnish for this savory meal.Without taking any credit away from Gauri Shinde, everything from costumes, to music and locations to screenplay had impressions of R Balki's(producer) previous works and he would have been of great help in the making of EV as well. The affect that English Vinglish will have on a particular individual will depend on the relationship that he/she has with the one/two women that hold the most important place(s) in their lives. The degree of impact will vary, though one thing is for sure, it will only lie on the right side of the axis. http://imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in/",

            "content": "For someone who has been born and brought up on English medium schools, and I don't say this proudly, but for whom English is his first language of thought, it is very hard to put self in Sridevi's shoes. Someone, who doesn't know English, but in all other ways is very competent. Someone, who is constantly the butt of family jokes and jibes, especially by the husband and the rapidly growing daughter. That the film succeeds in making us feel her angst, and her ways of coping with it, showing the kind of situations she encounters, especially when she goes to New York, is a tribute to the story and the performances, especially the virtuoso acting masterclass by Sridevi, who shows, in more ways than one, that she's still got it !The debilitating effect of not knowing the language is brought alive by her mispronounciation of 'Jazz', a visit to her daughter's PTA, her solo trip to New York, handling immigration, her ordeal there buying coffee and various snide ones by both her husband ('She is born to make laddoo's') and her daughter ('Why did you take my book if you cant read ?'). Redemption arrives when she decides to take English lessons, while in New York, visiting her sister to help with her niece's wedding. She finds unlikely allies in the sister's house and a gallant, romantic French fellow student. And suddenly, life is not so bleak anymore. The film tries hard not to get too sentimental, balancing every tear with a chuckle or a smile. Amitabh Bachchan's delightful cameo, the other madcap students in the English class, none as zany as Salman Khan, the Pakistani, the cheerful nature of her son, her own special, sari-clad Michael Jackson impersonation, all serve to smoothen out the various trials and tribulations thrown her way. Sridevi makes you root for her, getting her every expression, every frown, every smile spot on. Most of the other characters are stereotypes \u2013 the busy, indifferent husband, the cute son, the gallant Gaul, the bombastic Pakistani etc. But she has shades to her character, moments of weakness followed by instances of strength. Waffling indecision followed by gutsy action. Isn't life about communication, rather than the language ? About the message, rather than the medium ? When / How did we get so snobbish about how different people speak, their accents. As the film rightly asks, why have we become so judgemental merely based on the persons attire, language ? Surely there is more to life than that ? More at www.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com",

            "content": "A delightful film that must be appreciated of its simplicity in delivering an important message.How important are the feelings of those, who do not know a language that we speak so much. Is it right to belittle those for they can be good in something else? Is it right to disrespect parents and feel embarrassed when they do not know English? More than anything else, this is the tale of a mother who is being deserted by her kids and husband for she does not know a language that they all speak. And she learns it to redeem her respect. I loved the way Sridevi carried herself and am so very happy seeing her back on the silver screen which she set ablaze many years ago with films like Chandni, Mr. India and Chaalbaaz to name a few. Sridevi is indeed the best part of this film, as she has a poise that subdues the flamboyance and the stardom of her and gets her into the character. So what I saw here was Shashi (Sridevi) more than Sridevi and that's great to begin my review with.If you loved a movie like PAA, then there are definite chances that you may love this too, coz it takes the simplicty from there and applies the same to a different story. I loved PAA, so I loved this one too. But even if you dislike PAA, try this and you may have a surprise then. The good thing of this movie is it's writing, take that scene in which Shashi gets a call from her daughter when she was looking for her scrapbook, and here it isShashi : \"Maine use chupaya taaki main bhi na padh sakoo\" Daughter :Padhna Aaye tab na\" That is, \"How can you read, when you don't know\" The supporting cast has also done well from a French cook to a Pakistani guy, they all teamed up well, but it has it's share of not so likable or rather preachy moments like the teacher being gay. But I will give in to all that, coz it is done quietly and not making fuss. Be it the climax, it was done in a subdued manner and that is why it was beautiful for me.I love this film for its simplicity and for just one reason \"SRIDEVI\" all the other technical departments did their job superbly but \"SRIDEVI\" did something really beautiful. Even the way she walked on those streets was graceful. Also, a mention to music and Amit Trivedi has given beautiful music.Thanks Gauri and R Balki for giving SRIDEVI back to us with this. And thanks to SRIDEVI for doing this film. A 4/5 for this.",

            "review_title": "The Queen Has Returned",
            "content": "If creative intellectuals have their way, when the history of Indian Cinema is written, it will be written in two parts: Before Sridevi and After Sridevi. With due respect to Dilip Kumar, Kamal Hassan, and even Amitabh Bachchan, Sridevi stands as the sole female actor in a country whose native cinema has historically preferred its women to be little more than ornamental showpieces to equal and even generally outrank and outshine her male counterparts by building a legacy that is as artistically rich as it is historically significant.She has achieved every benchmark befitting a historic thespian who is now commonly referred to as \"India's Meryl Streep\": as the only Indian actor (male or female) to have achieved supremacy in every major regional language of the World's Largest Film Industry, her return to the silver screen is not one that can go unnoticed. This is, to put it mildly, The Return of the Queen.And now, at age 49, she reinvents the wheel yet again, giving audiences reluctant to view women past the age of 35 as anything other than matronly spinsters a fully existential view of middle-aged femininity that is somber, sweet, and wholly unlike anything Indian cinema has ever dared to say about women of a certain age. Fifteen years after her last film, Judaai (in which she triumphantly played a materialistic husband-selling virago), she returns to the big screen with a difficult but simple story of a middle class housewife named Shashi who finds her life, relationships, and identity limited by the fact that she cannot speak English. Summoned to New York by her sister to help with the preparations for her niece's upcoming wedding, Shashi finds herself confronted with ideas, customs, and individuals that, while foreign, are not wholly alien to her. She doesn't mind that strangers offer her wine on planes, or that gay couples stroll hand in hand on the Upper West Side. Shashi should be a narrow-minded and provincial simpleton. She is, instead, a warm and accepting woman with a heart of gold who simply doesn't know the language of the world. Or does she? Like all Sridevi creations, Shashi is complex in both her design and her ambition. Unlike all other Sridevi creations, however, Shashi is firmly rooted in reality. Sridevi has almost exclusively been held to the larger than life standard that has enabled her to play some of the most unique and legendary characters ever enacted by any actress, Indian or otherwise. As Mani Ratnam famously said in 1995, \"Asking Sridevi to play the typical heroine role is like asking Picasso to paint your wall.\" With due respect to Picasso's creative process, Sridevi is able to conjure miracles in seconds. Shashi has no grand designs on life. Her only desire is to be taken seriously, to know that she is as important as her family members that converse and operate in English when at the office or at school. For her, there is no tragic event that becomes the impetus for her desire to learn English. It is the cumulative effect of a thousand petty humiliations, borne upon her face day after day, as she is derided, diminished, and dismissed as being less than. Shashi knows that she is capable and intelligent; her mind is as open as her heart; and yet no one will take her seriously.Despite the supporting cast's best efforts, all of the film would be for naught were it not for the heart-poundingly delicate performance from Sridevi who elevates the film as only a master can. That Sridevi is a world-class thespian does not need to be repeated. What does bear pointing out is the utterly flawless way in which Sridevi communicates Shashi's building frustration with her linguistic limitations at every moment when she is derided or disdained by her daughter, husband, or random strangers abroad. It becomes clear to Shashi that no one \u2013 not even her loved ones \u2013 view her as an individual. She is only to be considered in terms of her social relations- as wife, mother, homemaker. That she is an existential being in her own right, with her own desires and ambitions, is something only Shashi asserts, albeit in complete silence. The look of muted broken heartedness that Sridevi conjures at every slight is something to behold: she swallows her humiliations with bitterness, unsure that this is the way things are supposed to be. Sridevi's frankly perfect performance gives rise to more than just her second innings as an actor: it heralds the beginning of a new Golden Age in Hindi Cinema.Such expectations aside, critics and Sridevi fanatics alike have all been asking the same question: where does her portrayal of Shashi rank among her legendary performances? Is it of the caliber of her greatest achievements Sadma, Chaalbaaz, Mr. India, and Lamhe? Does it deserve the same consideration of her landmark work in movies like Chandni, Gumrah, and Laadla? All I can positively assert without any hesitation is that Sridevi's Shashi allows her to produce a fine and finessed performance that is unassuming and wise at the same time. Sridevi has long been \"afflicted\" by the demand that she play only grandiose women. Even \"ordinary\" women like Chandni became larger-than-life purely because Sridevi was playing them. Her very essence speaks to the isolated, the elevated, and the unique. As R. Balki has recently said of Sridevi, an actress of her ability is born but once in a thousand years, and that she must continue to act, not only for the sake of her own career but for the sake of cinema itself. Some artists are their medium in such definitive ways that their absence means a weakening of the entire medium itself. Sridevi is, almost 50 years since the beginning of her career, the purest distillation of Acting India has ever known. And if the 15 years since Judaai are any indication, she will remain thus.",

The treatment of the movie is such that you feel a connection with the movie. The best 'part' of the movie is, of course, Sridevi. Yes, The Sridevi. Her acting is so natural and realistic that you feel the emotions that she is going through in the movie. Sridevi has proved once again (after a break of 15 long years) that she is still the Queen of Bollywood, the so-called Female Amitabh Bachchan (as she was known as in the 80s & 90s). I saw this movie today in an overseas theater and not surprisingly, the theater was mostly full of mature audience, her fans.

            "content": "For about the last 3 years, i have special interest with Indian movies. I found out that Indian movie is worth to watch, the idea of the story is original, based on India everyday life, problem, dilemma. I know Vinglish was something when I read about the plot. This is not about romance between two countries, love which separated by time and distance, unapproved love. This about a good housewife who was very loyal and serve her family entirely. Her name is Shashi. She had side job as a laddu maker (Indian traditional cake). But one thing which become a family joke all the time was her inability to speak English. A very obvious moment how embarrassed her daughter, Sapna, with her was when she should replaced her husband in school meeting (reports day). This the new information to me, in some schools in India, the daily language is English. Sashi unable talk in English and asked the teacher talked in Hindi, Sapna glared at her and refused talk to her on their way returned home. Not only Sapna, her husband, Sathish somehow disregarded her ability as a laddu maker only. Sashi asked by his sister to help her prepared her wedding's daughter in US, Sashi willing to help, but the consequence was she must leave by herself. The others family member would joined her later. Sashi was afraid because she unable speak English and this is the first time she left her home all by herself. But eventually she left. With full of happiness meeting her sister and nephew, Radha, she's still bothered about the embarrassment of her daughter and what her husband said. One day she saw an ad about learning English fluently on 6 weeks! Sashi showed her interest and memorized the number. She sign up herself for the program secretly. In this course she meet a cute French guy, Laurent, who helped her in the other day. He fancy her which was just too visible! Sashi enjoyed the class very much and followed the lesson well. She gained confidence and decided to follow the class till the end of the program. But Radha found out Sashi walked with Laurent, and asked who was he. Sashi revealed she took an English course and Radha supported her. Will Sashi finish her English course? Which one Sathi choose, Sathis or Laurent? You should find it by yourself by watching this humor-drama movie! Many scenes become my favorites, conversation between Amitabachan and American Immigration officer is one of. Gauri Shinde as a director, was very rigorous present it in a smart way, which is mostly I found in Hollywood movie. As an Indian movie, i gave you all my thumbs! :)",

            "content": "\"English Vinglish\" is a film that only a woman could have made. Gauri Shindi lends her feminine sensibilities to the film which is why it is a big success. She captures the nuances in a typical Indian housewife's tryst with her kids and husband. Although there is no true villainous character in the film, it is painful to see the leading lady Shashi (Sridevi) suffer unintentional humiliation at the hands of her teenage daughter and husband because of her inability to converse in English.It is very satisfying to see her grasp the basics of the English language and thereby gain self-confidence. Her English class has an interesting mix of students from across the world including a Frenchman who is besotted with her. The feel-good nature of the film can be attributed to the final scene in particular in which Shashi delivers a thoughtful speech in English. Loved the film but didn't think too much of the soundtrack, especially the track \"Manhattan\". Also felt that her experiences with people in America were sugar-coated. Nonetheless, the film was worth its time. I'm looking forward to introducing my mother to this film.",

            "content": "This movie was released in multiple languages. I saw this movie in the Tamil version. This movie is about a typical Indian woman who has trouble with English speaking and her New York expedition. The simple one line story is whether Sashi (Sridevi) succeeds her English learning mission? Coming to the lead role Sridevi has done it picture perfect in her role of a middle aged typical Indian women. She proves us that her acting skills are legendary through her expressions and dialogue delivery. Her casual looks suits the role perfectly. The whole movie we see her domination on screen. Priya Anand comes as Sridevi's niece and helps her to succeed in her mission. She didn't have much screen space yet delivers a decent performance and her casual advice to Sridevi about 'love after marriage isn't wrong' we see her American cultural influence. Other characters like the husband and daughter of Sridevi has fulfilled their roles in humiliating. Perfect group was the classmates of Sridevi all of them were so perfect in choice and did their part very well. The French cook with his love for Sridevi and the unknown language conversation between them was interesting. Surprise element in the Tamil version is Actor Ajith . He travels along with Sridevi to New York and comforts her during her flight with his comic sense. The only drawback we could feel when watching it in Tamil was we could not take the entire faces in the movie to be a Tamil people. The marriage ceremony was done in Marathi style where we cannot take that as Tamil culture. But we have to come face to face with the fact that this was a Hindi movie dubbed in Tamil. Except this cultural point the overall movie was clean in its scope and casting. Nice work by Director Gauri Shinde and team. We feel like when the movie ends as if we are out of the English class. Get in for a feel light entertainment drama from the house of \"Cheeni kum\" and \"Paa\". Verdict: \"English Vinglish\" Mission Spoken English accomplished .Definitely Sridevi sweeps it all.

            "content": "I rarely watch Hindi movies. Rarer still do I come back appreciating them.English Vinglish is worth it, even a bleary-eyed 6 am review, right after seeing the movie.After just about making it across town to the PVR at Oberoi Mall, Goregaon, was amazed to see that most of the invitees were on time, with thousands of eager fans, waiting to glimpse their favourite stars, and of course the star of the film.As if one needed a reminder, large billboards of Sridevi in a saree against the New York skyline, looking lost, stared back at us all the way.The selling point for this film till the opening has been Sridevi's comeback. For people like me, who aren't a big Sridevi fan, it wasn't the most exciting news. But to contrast, my cousin in the US, much younger than me, and surprisingly a huge fan, (after all she had missed the superstar Sridevi days), has been waiting for this with great anticipation.After the movie got over, I too can be counted as one of the fans. For her fantastic performance. Also for being perfectly cast in the lead role.The pre-hype had already got the basics of the plot out - Indian woman in New York who doesn't know the language, has to pick it up double quick with the help of a motley bunch of fellow non-English speakers. I wouldn't blame you for thinking, \"Hey, it must be a 'Mind Your Language' equivalent, I've seen that.\" Well it is much more than that.Gauri Shinde the award winning short film director and ad film maker is someone we were familiar with. We knew her passion and the dedication to the craft. Her ability to put the story across with minimum fuss.What was a revelation was Gauri Shinde the script writer.English Vinglish is a tight script. Its sweet without being cloying. It holds a mirror where it has to, and at other moments shows the way. The single mindedness of the story and lack of familiar Bollywood distractions of supporting comedians, songs (there are a couple, but in appropriate places), arch villains and hammy side kicks, is what makes the story click.It is humorous, even in the 'familiar' classroom scenes, it is poignant, well-shot, without making New York a tourism board sponsored promotional video. One could sense the director's familiarity with the city, it was obvious she didn't need much help from location scouts.The casting is bang-on. The two kids are a revelation. Especially the younger one. He could be our version of Dakota Fanning. The elder sister was good too, but given that she has age and much more worldly experience on her side to draw upon, I would judge the sibling's performance higher. But that's just nitpicking. The teacher and the co-students are good too. And they make the film lighter. The rest of the family does really well to make this slightly-more-than-a-month-in-the-life-of Mrs Godbole in Pune / New York shine in a warm familial glow.A couple of surprises in terms of guest appearances. On hindsight, one of them is an obvious one, given that R Balki's produced the movie.There is a nice balance to the struggle of restricting English dialogue in an English language setting for a largely Hindi audience in a mainstream Hindi movie. After all, it is a Bollywood movie, for everyone, including the person who has painted 'Ladis' and 'Gends' at the convenience near Byculla, which I happened to pass by in the morning. So the grammar lessons are few and far between, language is used to convey mood and feelings, not necessarily the exact content, and dialogue only when it's absolutely necessary.The cowering, lost woman transforms into a confident and self-aware person. That too without stretching the limits of believability. She doesn't suddenly become an orator in the newly learnt language. She doesn't lose her shyness either.Special mention here of Sridevi, she allows the director to lead her and doesn't overpower the narrative, with a held back, controlled performance. She could have tried to do a lot more, considering this was 'her' film, after like a zillion years.That is where the film hits you. It's real. You can easily identify with it. And is therefore that much more enjoyable.I don't have stars to dole out. Just hugs for the entire team, because, like many others know, it's not easy to make a good film. That too your first one, and at the same time having the guts to relaunch someone's career after many years.Excellent Vexellent.",

            "content": "Movies don't need to be dramatic all the time. The simple stories around us can be much interesting and engaging. \"English Vinglish\" is such sort of movie. It delves into a simple story of Sashi, who is a housewife and can't speak English properly. As a result she often gets ignored and embarrassed by her children and husband. The whole film revolves around her attempt to regain her dignity and respect in family through joining English learning classes secretly. The story is indeed very simple but along the way touches you and even tickles you. The film gives a sweet message on regaining your self esteem rather than becoming sympathetic about yourself; and hence, is commendable in terms of realizing the values of family and relations. Besides, it also hints on how your small remarks may hurt others.The situations created in the film are simple, yet touches you; like Sashi getting hurt by her children's remarks or her desolation in New York City, or her desperation to create a balance with her family and her self esteem. Every moment leaves an impact, whether the ones in which Sashi appears an ignored mother in India, or her quest to regain self esteem in the English learning classes, or at her sister's house The biggest thing of the film is it's entertaining and yet the same time thought provoking without becoming preachy. The story runs at a moderate pace and even drags a bit at the second half but doesn't lose its interest and every moment becomes wittier. The splendid story gets brilliant carried by Sri Devi as Sashi. In every scene, she steals the show. Perhaps remove her, there is nothing in the movie. Watch it, and you would be able to realize more about understanding your family.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",

In my opinion, one of the best ways to judge a movie is by how it makes you feel when you walk out of the theater. To sum-up the experience of watching 'English vinglish' in one word - Beautiful!I had the least expectations from a come-back movie of Sri Devi, but no one could have done a better job for this role. Sri Devi has the most realistic and lively expressions you will get to see in an actress. As my wifey puts it: \"One of the most appealing characteristic of Sri Devi's acting is her ability to talk with her eyes\", and you are going to see a lot of her eyes. Movie shows the ever-young face of Sri Devi for about 80-85% of the time, but you will never get bored of watching her or her \"talking eyes\". For all those people who wonder why Sri Devi still has a big fan following, this movie is the reason :-).The story of 'English vinglish' has a very nice flow to it. You are going to be surprised as to how simple the story is and what a brilliant job the creators have done to shape it into a master-piece. If not for the last scene, this movie would have scored the max points on my ratings, but kudos to the director for keeping it real. Putting aside the acting of Sri Devi, all the co-actors too have done an excellent job in keeping the movie entertaining. Not the mention the unexpected appearance of a guest Super-Star in the movie was a pleasant surprise too. But nothing beats the feeling of an \"expected bad\" movie turning into an awesome one.My suggestion: Perfect for family, couples, and friends, as there is something for everyone to take away from this movie. Just try to not focus on Sri Devi's surgically enhanced nose:-) (Bummer!)",

Her poor grasp on English is ridiculed by her husband, Satish, and teenage daughter, Sapna.Shashi's niece is to get married in New York, where she is settled, and she has to go a few weeks ahead of her family to help her sister with the arrangements. In her time there, she secretly enrolls in a conversational English class geared to help improve her English in four weeks time. She bonds with her fellow students and soon proves to be the most promising student there, watching English movies and reading English newspapers in her spare time.Her husband's ridiculing is irritating, but a realistic scenario that you can find in such a family in India. But her daughter's irreverent and downright rude attitude is atrocious. A few tight slaps could have made the ending a lot better... but that's my opinion.It is a well crafted movie, with a well grounded, realistic premise. The improvement in English is gradual, and Sridevi nails the gradient well, with just a few exceptions (Mid way through her classes, she absent mindedly places an order in perfect English; a perfection her character doesn't master even towards the end of the movie. That was slightly distracting, but I'm nitpicking). At 49, she is stunningly beautiful, and a far better actress than most leading ladies in Bollywood today.

Also kudos to Gauri Shinde for creating a masterpiece out of an average storyline. English Vinglish talks is about the struggle of a regular Indian housewife to keep pace with the rapidly changing Englishified world and, more than that, rebuild her own identity which has been lost in daily household chores. Shashi (Sridevi) is a housewife with two kids, a husband and a mother-in-law in Pune who struggles to be on the same lane as her husband and kids are (the English speaking world in today's offices and schools in India). To add to her worries, she is made to visit New York, ALONE, to help her sister's daughter's wedding. Already under-confident in her own country, the movie beautifully depicts Shashi's road to confidence and building self-identity in a foreign English-speaking country, after awful experiences in the beginning and moments of grief. The movie also depicts the present reality of Indian society where housewifes are often belittled (when her husband calls her \"born to make laddus\" and the daughter scolds her for touching her scrapbook - written in English), mostly because of their little education, especially in English. While the topic of English is just a metaphor, the movie touches upon a woman's determination to get the deserved respect from her own family and support during emotional crisis. The movie is a must-see for a complete family for it has everything for everyone to take away.",

I am spellbound every time I watch it. There are so many scenes, so many of them in which you will be amazed by Sridevi's expressions.Each and every time I watch it, I love it all the more. English Vinglish emotes numerous feelings: Its about the purest form of love- a mother has for her children. The way she hugs her kid, attends the PTA, does the michael jackson dance, cries on leaving her family back home while traveling to US. Its about fighting your inner fears. Its about respecting your mother and so much more.The entire cast of the movie was superb. Her family and the members in her English class, all were outstanding. Amit Trivedi's music was fantastic and complemented the movie perfectly. Some dialogues were quite impressive especially \"When you don't like yourself, you tend to dislike everything connected to you. New things seem to be more attractive. When you learn to love yourself, then the same old life starts looking new, nice.\" That is what life is and couldn't have been put in better words.At the end the only thing I would like to say is that this movie is very close to my heart. Its one of the most refreshing movies you will ever come across and it will leave you with a big smile on your face. And lastly, she deserved the best actress award that year, every bit of it. I am not saying that others didn't deserve, but Sridevi's performance was at par with the rest.

One could hardly imagine any other actress putting life and soul to the character of Shashi, an Indian housewife who is demeaned by her husband and children for her lack of proficiency in the English language. You could hardly realize that Sridevi is an actress who was inactive in the industry for 14 years. She proves yet again that she hasn't lost the spark that was evident in her Khuda Gawah, Sadma, Gumrah, Laadla, Lamhe, and Chandni days. Of course, Shashi's character was based on the life of the director Gauri Shinde's mother. That may be one reason why it helped the debutante to portray the character on screen so beautifully. Some scenes such as the one where Shashi's daughter was feeling embarrassed in front of her principal because her mother can't speak English really touches your heart. It gives us an insight into the life of mothers who can't speak English. We're made to sympathise with them and we're made to learn instead of feeling embarrassed of our mothers' actions, we must encourage them to face up the challenge to learn a difficult language. I wonder why box office India gave a thumbs down to this masterpiece. Is the box office that dumb? Why can't they distinguish between a good and bad film? English Vinglish is thoroughly entertaining and warm. Sridevi makes the film watchable. Go, give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.",

She has undoubtedly earned the name of being Bollywood's biggest superstar but in what has been known as an ageist and sexist film industry, the question was whether the audience would accept and appreciate her. And they did. This just goes to prove her star power. But the other thing that Sridevi has done, that many have failed, was give script top priority and have faith in her director.Sridevi had mentioned that, other than liking the script, she had seen R. Balki's (director Gauri Shinde's husband and one of the producers of 'English Vinglish') 'Cheeni Kum' and 'Paa' and loved both films and this further helped make her decision. However, in my opinion, Shinde's film is far superior when compared to her husbands last two films. It's low on melodrama, consistently written never losing focus, has quirky fun characters (even though Shashi's Indian and Pakistani classmates are somewhat of a clich\u00e9) and makes good use of its tools (set, cinematography, music etc). There are a few loud and slightly syrupy moments and a few of the jokes are a little overdone but the balance in humour, romance and drama is well-maintained and it has a fresh feel.The characters are easy to relate to. I would have liked to know a little more about Shashi's classmates (with the exception of the Pakistani taxi driver and the Indian IT engineer). I liked that the non-Indian characters weren't portrayed as Bollywood stereotypes.The film is shot in both India and America. The locations are eye-candy but never out of place as the viewer sees it all through Shashi's point of view. Lyrically, the songs are a little awkward but they somehow fit the scenes.Where performance is concerned, needless to say this is Sridevi's film. Her acting is as though she had never left film. Not only is it refreshing to see her after a long time but just the moment she appears on screen, one is reminded why she's one of the most loved actresses of Indian cinema. She is excellently supported by a sincere Mehdi Nebbou, a solid Adil Hussain, a vivacious Priya Anand, a very likable Shivansh Kotia and an energetic Corey Hibbs.Thanks to spellbinding Sridevi, talented Gauri Shinde and the cast and crew who have done a remarkable job in making 'English Vinglish' a wonderful cinematic experience. A film that aims straight for the heart of the viewer and one that reminds of how learning a language and going to such classes can be so much fun. It's one of the best films in recent times that can be watched with the entire family and also works brilliantly as a date movie, a rainy day film and something to enjoy with friends.",

            "content": "What a wonderful movie to watch. This is a masterpiece and I cannot describe in words how much I liked this movie. Gouri Shinde has given a superb demonstration of how a good piece of entertainment can be created out of a simple story with a good script. The story revolves around a middle class housewife with a husband, two children and mother-in-law who is an expert in cooking and running a household but deficient in knowledge of English. This causes a tremendous amount of frustration and sadness because her qualities are not recognized by her husband and children and she does get the respect she deserves. The director kept a strong and single focus on the main theme of the story and never allowed any distraction or unnecessary scenes and dialogues. The entire film is Sridevi and she gave a stellar performance as the housewife and the mother of her two children. The first part of the story is based in Pune, India and the second (major) part is based in Manhattan New York where she was invited by her sister to attend her niece's wedding. The scenes and the incidents she faces were so natural that I myself being an immigrant and one time had the very similar experiences. I remember Merv Griffin, the late talk show host asking one of the foreign born actors that what was the most significant thing he noticed in America when he arrived here. The actor ( I forgot the name ) said that \"Here they ask too many questions when ordering food\". When I saw the scene, where Shashi ( Sridevi ) trying to order a snack and coffee what she had to go through and immediately it came to my mind that how much correct that actor was when he said this. The movie did not have anything beyond normal and practical situations which everyday people faces in New York or USA as a whole. The classroom scene was hilarious with a very subtle message behind. It was nice to see how the entire class consisting of people many different countries came together around Shashi and it was very pleasant see they were enjoying the party where they were invited by Shashi's niece as a surprise. I have seen quite a few of Sridevi's movies but here in this one she demonstrated her acting skills with a superb performance. She is just one of the best actors of Hindi cinema and so refreshing to see her on the screen. If this is her first movie after fifteen years of hiatus, I guarantee she is going to please us with many more magnificent films in the future. The music was excellent and the roles played by other players were commendable. But this movie is all about Sridevi and she has shouldered the whole film by herself. I gave it a 9 out of ten.",

            "content": "English Vinglish, just like the Laddoos, it's lead protagonist Shashi so craftily supplies throughout the movie, is as simple, sweet and tasty.This is essentially a story of a simple housewife who craves respect, and instead, is mostly subjected to ridicule by her family for not speaking or understanding English. A chance visit to Manhattan to attend the wedding of a niece somehow opens up a world of opportunities in the form of an English Language Speaking Class of four weeks duration from where there is no turning back. Or is there? That my friends is what this film is about.And yet, like the delicate 'bondees' that stick together to form that Laddoo, English Vinglish is a film that is held together by a fantastic performance by an erstwhile superstar who makes it impossible to even imagine that she took a sabbatical of - hold your breath - 16 years before returning to the screen, and deftly once again in our hearts with this film.Sridevi, as 'Shashi' is in superb form, and gives us a performance unlike any you might have seen her before. She is like the glue that helps add everything together - be it the subtle messages, beautiful performances, or serene screenplay.Gauri Shinde, the d\u00e9butante director and scriptwriter reminds us how your family can never let you feel down, how if you love yourself, you can once again gain equality in a relationship, how the heart craves respect and not love, when it really boils down to a choice between the two, and how it isn't anything to be ashamed of if you don't know English, but it might just break your heart when those closest to you might be judgmental of you due to that fact.)The motley cast and crew ably supports Sridevi in this journey, be it Adil Hussain as her husband Satish who loves his wife, but maybe takes too many things for granted, Mehdi Nebbou as the French cook who in spite of being a student, is also a teacher to Shashi, Priya Anand as Radha, the younger niece who comes at just the right places and helps bring back the spring to Shashi's steps yet again, and last but not the least, Amitabh Bacchan in an excellent cameo who manages to cajole Shashi to take that important leap of faith and spread her wings.Set in mostly Pune, and Manhattan (the city as well as the suburbs), this is a film that is light, simple, and yet effective. Making you feel for the protagonist at numerous places without resorting to dramatic background scores, or an overt display of emotion. The humor is subtle, the racial discrimination portrayed in a practical hue, the pain natural, and the end credits making you feel that it should have run for a bit more.In hindsight, maybe a few more subtitles (especially when the French gentleman speaks), and further character development would have added further essence like a 'kishmish' might to a Laddoo, but then again, its how the cook, in this case the director Gauri Shinde, decides to serve the laddo, to ensure its good for both the diabetic as well as the gourmet, and we will leave her to serve it the way she deems it best.Having said that, let me remind you once again, to go for the film. You will surely enjoy it, especially for Sridevi, if not for the subtle messages, and perfect performances. This Laddoo, at least that day, will surely keep negativity at bay. Enjoy, especially with the women in your family.",

            "content": "She is back...yes SRI is back!! That too with a bang on performance, muttering certain English-Vinglish!! Moreover, as the film progresses, you stop searching for the Sri Hawa Hawai Devi in the Shashi Godbole she plays so naturally!! So remarkably she portrays and lives the vulnerability of a woman, that you are compelled to see beyond the star she has been. Again not delving too much into each and every detail of the movie I will share my picks:1. Barring the strange plastic nose, even today, Sri can give many contemporary actresses run for their money. It was the role which demanded her to be draped in the 9 mtr cloth throughout, otherwise the figure she maintains can still create enough oomph!! Those big oceanic eyes can still drown many!2. Most importantly, as against the title, the movie is not about learning a certain firangi language. Rather, it is about the journey of a woman from a dark gloomy world of low self-esteem to a confident and self-loving persona. Practically speaking, it is not a story of only some fictional Shashi, but of many Indian housewives who encounter googlies of Anglicised world around them daily. Shashi can definitely inspire some of them to break their mental shackles and discover the woman inside them who is comfortable being herself and who has the ability to walk with the world herself.3. Yes, many characters esp. in her English class seem too type-casted and borrowed from comedies like 'Zabaan sambhaal ke' (based on 'Mind your Language'). They are still able to tickle your funny bone.4. The director has also handled the French love angle quite sensitively. Sri makes it very clear why she is not reciprocating; respect is what she wants, not love. Best part is, there is no unnecessary melodrama on this topic.5. Cinematography is more about skyscrapers of Manhattan with a full song dedicated to the US city. Music is peppy, not catchy though.6. Rest of the characters are good in their own places. Sujata Kumar with her endearing smile mesmerizes. Nice to see veteran Sulabha Deshpande after long. However, there could have been some more Marathi actors to give more desi and authentic flavour to the Marathi family flick. Not to forget Big B in a small cameo. He definitely adds some more cheer to the scenes.In all, EV is as sweet as Shashi's ladoos (yummy they look on screen!!), as suave as Shashi's looks and as focused as Shashi's will power. Those looking for G (glamour) quotient should give it a miss. Recommended for rest. Another addition to the league of nice small budget movies we are getting this year!",

            "review_title": "A worth watching flick about a housewife's self-pride which neither offends people fond of using English nor forgets to feel proud of our own Indian language.",
            "content": "English Vinglish is a well made film about an Indian housewife's self- pride and her regained confidence. Its director Gauri Shinde's debut venture executed beautifully, which neither offends the people fond of using English, nor it forgets to feel proud of our own Indian languages lead by Hindi.EV begins calmly with the charming Sridevi returning on the screen in her simplest avatar. She straight away wins your heart with her elegant presence and makes the viewer realize that no one can ever look more innocent on the screen than Sridevi, even today. The first half of the film is a complete winner as it never stresses upon the language, has some really good soothing songs and also holds a very entertaining pleasant surprise for the viewers, which is going to impress them all unanimously. Plus I really loved the way Sri declares intermission with an adorable Michael Jackson step right in the middle of a foreign street forcing you to fall in love with her respectful character played effortlessly.Post intermission, the proceedings become a little slow and the script doesn't progress with the same energy of the first half. No doubt, impressive sequences keep coming in after every few minutes but still I strongly felt that the writer/director could have avoided the intentionally added love angle in the script used quite elaborately (Can't we make films without any love triangle?). The fun element goes missing in the crucial moment of its final hour which eventually affects the momentum for a while. However it all ends on an impressive note and you are bound to have tears in your eyes watching Sri's last speech at the wedding rendered superbly. Regarding its inspirational factor, EV has only got some slight resemblances with the famous comedy serial Zabaan Sambhaal Ke or with its original version Mind Your Language but nothing more than that. Apart from its admirable simplicity, EV also has an impressive Background Score and some good soothing songs well composed by the talented Amit Trivedi. And he is fast becoming the most sought after music director by the thinking directors of such off-beat subjects. Cinematography adds a lot to this lovable venture along with a balanced art direction and a decent costume designing which catches your attention.English Vinglish is purely a Sridevi film from start to finish and the reputed actress rightly chooses a good script which was just perfect for her much awaited come-back. Because after watching it, you cannot even imagine anyone else doing the role of Shashi in the film with such innocence and conviction. The character wins over the viewers in just a few minutes and then you take her home along with you after that memorable final scene written & performed thoughtfully.Priya Anand as Sridevi's niece strongly stays there in the film along with Sri and the girl has got both the looks as well as the spark to do a bigger act. Adil Hussain, as her husband and Sujata Kumar as her elder sister perform well in their important roles along with Sulbha Deshpande, who is a complete natural making an appearance after a long gap. From the cast playing Sri's co-students at the English class, French actor Mehdi Nebbou says a lot with his expressions and acts fine but strangely there is no explanation given in the movie for what he actually says in all those French dialogues. And talking about the surprise element which I would not like to disclose\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085, he is truly magnetic.Moving ahead than just being a film for your entertainment, English Vinglish also gives two important messages to the society, particularly to the Indian Society mentioned below: One, it's really not fair to consider the humble house wives taking care of our homes as the least contributors in our daily life or in our materialistic growth (as done by the husband in the film). If truth be told then they are actually the \"Base Makers\" of that delicious \"Life Pizza\" we all keep on enjoying day after day without any routine hassles and obstacles. So those silent home-makers strongly deserve an equal status and respect by every single person in the family without any questioning.Secondly, it's about the delicate issue of the changing relationship between the growing kids and their parents in our present age families. The issue gets highlighted through two child actors in the film namely Shivansh Kotia (Sri's son) & Navika Kotia (her daughter) who has a problem with her mother's inability to speak English. The girl feels insulted by this and takes no step to teach or help her own mother overcome this minor problem in her life, which she could have done easily. And this is the other issue which deals with the \"Respect Factor\" needed to be maintained between the parents and the growing kids of our families, who in most of the cases, think to be much more knowledgeable and ahead then their own parents & grandparents in many fields. Ideally it's the duty of the younger generation to teach or to take along their parents and let them enjoy the new blessings of this advanced world too as they rightly deserve it. The mistake is finally realized by the daughter in the film while Sri delivers her emotional wedding speech in the end with twinkles in her eyes and their loving hug brings the family back together as never before.Therefore, English Vinglish is a film which deserves to be watched not only by all those House Wives who need to re-invent themselves urgently but its even a more essential watch for all the Husbands and Kids since it has got a valuable lesson for them too in its 135 minutes of entertainment. So do watch it with everyone in the family together and have a good time.",

They even put her down about it. She is asked to go to America to help her sister plan her daughter's wedding, and she has to go alone. She is a veritable fish out of water, not being able to communicate properly in English, even causing trouble at a coffee shop (that scene tries to reinforce the notion that Americans are rude. That notion is dispelled soon enough, however). Frustrated, she enrolls in a four week English learning course, to fit in better. Brave to Sridevi, who is great in this role. Like Sadha, in which she plays an amnesiac who becomes childlike, she becomes the character so convincingly it is almost like she isn't even acting. Still such a pretty lady with big beautiful brown eyes, she just radiates. I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who has known the immigrant experience.

            "content": "Women writers and directors like fiction, fantasy and platonic relations as evidenced in this movie and \"Mr.& Mrs.Iyer.\" Gauri Shinde, does a great job as a first time? director, of this gem of a movie, which is a cross between \"Mr.& Mrs. Iyer\" by the very talented Ms.Aparna Sen and \"Monsoon Wedding\" by the prolific Ms.Mira Nair. The story is absolutely spell binding and riveting like a suspense movie, since, all immigrants to The United States of America, have gone through the routine and nothing is a fantasy. The sessions in the English learning school with a gay teacher (David-a good perf.) is hilarious with the quirks and traits of different ethnic groups brought up without being insulting or demeaning. Each scene flows into another like a garland and the screenplay is simple and homely. The movie is as sweet as laddoo. Sridevi, The French guy (Mehdi Webbou),the kid,and the niece Radha (Priya Anand)the stand out among the rest of the cast, who are above average and the interaction and peace at the end of the semester, could not have been better achieved by United Nations Peace Force.The long story is poignantly related by the woman director, whose feminine touch is evident all along, like Shashi, riveted to the romantic movie, when her platonic relation is watching her. The long walk catching her mental turmoil after the brief spark of awkward romance on the top of the skyscraper. Not everything is as sweet as laddoo. The grandmother left back in India with an excuse she can't get Visa (not Passport as in the movie) was cruel and utterly selfish of her son, to devoid her the joy and happiness of being part of her grand daughters wedding. This is typical of how Indian women are put on a pedestal and worshiped and treated like second class citizens at the same time. If she couldn't get Visa the wedding should have been canceled in New York and they parties should have been flown to Pune, and the expenses should have been born by the parents of the groom (applies to all weddings)The scene in the Deli is so authentic it is tough to believe it is a movie. So is the actress taking Sashi's call at the English school (the patience, perseverance and tolerance shown is so much opposite to the attitude at the Deli and the director is so shrewd to show the contrast.) All said and done, this is feel-good movie that should have been the Oscar Nominee-and probably would have won too-instead of the slovenly stupid and annoying movie called \"Barfi.\"",

Now she is back with a bang after a 15 year hiatus delivering another masterful performance carrying the entire movie on her shoulders with such grace, charisma and a terrific sense of humor. What the movie suffers from bloated runtime, occasional indulgences to mainstream comedy, some stereotypical characters and an undying resolute to repeatedly show the protagonists misgivings more than makes up with many subtle heartfelt moments.Shashi (Sridevi) is a simple Indian housewife happily married with 2 children in an upper-middle class family. She is loving and caring but she does not seem to get the respect she deserves primarily due to her inability to converse in English. When her sister invites Shashi to New York to help with her daughter's wedding, she gets nervous about traveling alone ahead of her family. With a little inspiration she receives from her fellow passenger, she secretly enrolls in a English speaking class.Though Sridevi hogs all the limelight, rest of the cast apart from a few forced in for stereotypes delivers a brilliant performance. The writer-director has done what is rare in Hindi film industry, art of being subtle (well mostly when mattered). Also she seem to have a talent in extracting those delicate masterful nuances from Sridevi which uplifts the movie entirely. The background score though does not feature the song and dance routine is mainstream and decent.Little overdone but delicious nevertheless.",

The movie stresses on how necessary it is for family to double up the love and respect to the home-make of house in return for all the efforts she puts in.

The actress of 80s and 90s is back after JUDAAI(1997) and what a comeback something Karisma, Madhuri failed in. The film doesn't try to showcase her star power or show her in a larger then life way but focuses more on her acting and her character is very identifiable. R.Balki has always surprised us, he gave the delightful Cheeni Kum(2007) which showcased Amitabh in a unique way, and of course PAA(2009) when Amitabh was busy doing Alaadin(2009) type crap films. This time Gauri Shinde is the director The film is set in Pune, Maharashtra though Marathi isn't used much and thankfully Sridevi(South Indian) isn't made to speak in Marathi. The film focuses on a common Indian household where Sridevi is looked down upon because she doesn't know English, a bit exxegerated at places but does seem believable. The turn of events are well handled, especially when Sridevi starts to learn English, but though the characters in English class are quite well shown they don't match up to the sitcom Mind Your Language though we shouldn't compare. The characterization of Pakistani Salman, South Ramamurthy, The Spanish girl, French cook all are well portrayed. Also thrown is a message that even gays should be treated equally. The film does get preachy at places but that is pardonable. The speech by Sridevi in the climax is superb There are some few flaws here and there but overall the film is a well made filmDirection by Gauri Shinde is superb Music is okay though ideally the film shouldve been songlessSridevi is back and how! She makes you forget that you're watching an actress and in fact lives the role of Shashi Godbole. The beauty looks, the style diva all is missing in the film and she gets immersed into the simple housewife look. Adil Hussain another talent is simply superb Priya Anand as Sridevi's niece is simply superb, while Amitabh Bachchan throws in some laughs in his 5 minute cameo though I found his part being overdone. Sujata Kumar as Sri's sister is natural, Navika Kotia and master Shivansh Kotia are both natural French actor Mehdi Nebbou does a superb job conveying through his eyes Sumeet Vyas as Pakistani Salman Khan is amazing, he makes you laugh Rajeev Ravindranathan as Ramamurthy is fab too though he reminds of Chatur from 3 Idiots. Sulabha Deshpande is amazing as Sridevi's mother in law rest all give good support",

            "content": "Sridevi is back from well over a decade hiatus to critical acclaim in this story that brings old traditions to the modern world. The story of an Indian woman who ends up in New York City and struggles to learn the English language while dealing with a society who is less than tolerable is a touching theme. The script conveyed the issues of what a stranger in a foreign land deals with so naturally you feel the characters insecurities and pain. The cinematography, score and production quality captured the spirit of New York City and pulled you into the heart of the film.The supporting cast was extremely talented but the breakout star of this film was Yu Son played by Maria Romano. Ms. Romano lit up the screen and her performance stole the scenes. A true young starlet in the making and I would like to thank the director Gauri Shinde personally for recognizing such talent. The movie was wonderful but see this film if only to get your first glimpse of Maria Romano and see what the future of Hollywood will be!!!",

It will make you happy at times and sad the next, but most of all it will at least make you empathize with others struggles especially as we realize each others differences. I loved all the characters in the movie and they all play their parts really well, but Sridevi steals the screen and her talent for acting really shows through. The plot is excellent as she decides to learn English and goes about reaching that goal. There will be tears of sadness, but also tears of joy. Bravo and a great movie to watch. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The film reminded me of a phrase \"take ordinary and add a little extra to make it extraordinary\". One of the most simple, yet heartwarming films I've seen till date. Sridevi triumphs in her portrayal of an Indian homemaker who doesn't know English and thus, faces criticism from her husband and daughter. Her characterization of a heartbroken wife and mother despite her other personal merits, was quite heartfelt. By the end, the film has that winning-of-an-underdog touch and actually elevates the euphoria of the moment. Besides this, the film is full of light moments depicting the common mentality of good-will, in general. Writer-Director Gauri Shinde makes sure that everyone takes away that lingering feeling of respect for mothers, who sacrifice a lot for their families. Apart from that, Amit Trivedi did a suitable score and music composition and actually gave the film quite a homely touch. I recommend it to all, who prefer films with a message and esp. to those who think that Indians don't have the quality and talent to produce an appreciable film. This one will certainly serve all the purposes well.",

            "content": "This is my first review on IMDb and its just because of one reason. I stay away from my mother and after watching this movie, I called her and talked to her for an hour and am still thinking about her. The first scene will remind a lot of Indian kids about their mother, being the first person to wake up, not even bothering about reading the newspaper and feeding all the family members with a smile on her face. Awesome scene and it set the mood for the entire movie. Sridevi was brilliant as 'Shaashi' and her portrayal of the pain due to neglect and happiness at small things was excellent. Two Hindi movies in this year, Kahaani and now English Vinglish , have shown that Indian actresses (Vidya Balan, Sridevi) know how to act and not just prance around trees. Her connection with the French actor was something to behold and Mehdi Nebbou stood out among all the support cast with his restrained yet powerful performance. Also a special mention for Satish Godbole, Shaashi's husband and Radha, the sprightly niece, who endears herself with her support for Shaashi.The only issue I have with the filmmakers was that they never translated the French part to Hindi and could have added subtitles at those moments so that the audience could understand what Laurent was saying. All said and done, these are minor trifles and don't take away from a brilliantly touching movie and hats off to the Director, Gauri Shinde for creating such a wonderful movie. Finally , thanks a lot for everything you have done Mom and it took a movie like English Vinglish to make me understand how much you give up for your kids.",

Why? Because it has a certain sincerity capable of warming you right up to the cockles of your heart. A beautiful movie with a lovely message made in an endearing prose style and to top it all off it managed to be hilariously funny at certain points. Of course the entire crew of this movie deserves a whole lot of applaud for giving a stellar performance that was both convincing and sincere. At times English Vinglish could strike you as being a triffle too formulaic but due to the well-managed plot as well as the great charisma exuded by the ensemble of cast, this movie is not one of those trite ones that would be soon out of your mind. All in all, this is a must watch movie for the entire family and there is a high probability that once the movie ends, you would want to watch it all over again. My personal opinion? It is worth watching more than once for it is a film with a storyline as unique as its name..",

A light hearted ,feel good movie made with a big heart and so near to the real world we live in, music and cinematography add to the cinematic brilliance.English Vinglish is a smart, crisp tale of an average Indian housewife (yes, she's a good cook, a caring lady) who tries and breaks the shackles and tell the world there's high time they better take notice and respect her for what she is and not just crap her down with her insensitiveness,she is devastated at times as her teenage daughter tortureher for not knowing the language. It's a feel good, inspiring story, atear jerker at times and even delight you with all its charm at others. Given a chance the pretty housewife here, Shashi Godbole (Sri \u2013charming as ever) joins an English coaching class, destined to learn it within 4 weeks. But will she be able to adjust to the hustles and bustles of the family life with it? Will she get back her respect? And will she succeed in her endeavours is the big question.English Vinglish Review \u2013 : Script Analysis Writer \u2013 Director Gauri Shinde is totally into her own here. It could have been another Zabaan Sambhaal Ke if gone wrong, but her narrative and portrayal has paid off. The Dialogues are quite realistic and there are times when you would find that Shashi is shown very helpless, especially in the first half, adds on to the vulnerability and the likability factor even though you hate her daughter who hates her for not knowing the language.English Vinglish Review \u2013: Star Performances Sridevi as Shashi Godbole shines out, she connects with the masses and one cant help but feel that the 49 year old actor's 15 year vanvaas was a tad too long. She's worked with a female director for the first time and its paid off. Adil Hussain as Shashi's husband is decent at times but a bit harsh when dealing with her. He feels she's just good enough to make ladoos . Its sad that an actor of his repute hasn't had much to offer in Bollywood, his last outing we remember ,a certain Jasoos Vijay on Doordarshan, 10 years ago !Shivansh Kotia as the little kid is quite impressive, adds to the charm,would want to see more from him. French actor Mehdi Nebbou is well cast and his eyes speak a lot as he tries his best to bring back love in Shashi's life.The characters in Shashi's English class are well cast and there's a South Indian, a Chinese, A Spanish , gay teacher and an African who bring the cheer here, a certain taxi driver Salman Khan too from Pakistan, whom you just don't wanna miss. Big B in a cameo, could we as for more.English Vinglish Review \u2013 Reader's View: Direction, Music and technicalities Gauri Shinde's debut is full of colors so bright and a promise so tender, with such an outing the industry would expect a lot from her in times to come. Amit Trivedi's music bring the needed kick to the film at times , perhaps was the best man for the soundtrack. Add Resul Pookutty and Swanand Kirkire on the Lyrics and you get just what the doc ordered .Nice and crisp with a running time of 140 minutes, the Editing is to the point .English Vinglish Review \u2013 Reader's View: The Last Word Go for it ! When you count the best movies of the year , English Vinglish would be right up there in the Top 5, would have gone with a 3.5*, but Big B's cameo and Gauri Shinde's 1st outing deserves a 4* from my desk .It's a movie made with a big heart, a great comeback , an emotional feel-good tale you don't wanna miss.Take some lessons from Devi and pay her your obeisance , you will surely be rewarded so much on the EQ front. Do take the morals as you walk out of the theater, love thy mother, she's special ,in every sense of the word.",

            "content": "Diamonds are forever\u0085No, I am not referring to the classic James Bond flick, but paying tribute to our own versatile actress Sridevi. The lady who went into hibernation after marriage and children decades ago, returns to show the same sparkle and magical class in a role that was made for her in the latest Hindi/ Tamil offering: ' English Vinglish' directed by Gauri Shinde who has at once established herself as a quality director of reckoning in this 'feel good' film about an ordinary middle class housewife, often belittled and snickered at for her lack of English skills in this modern \" anglicized' world by her self-centred family members who take digs at her frequently, uncaringly.She hides her tears and swallows her hurt and it is here that Sridevi is so real as the middle class house-wife Shashi, who is a 'laddoo- maker' by choice, that everyone can empathise with her. Even her proficiency and popularity as a good sweet maker is somehow held against her and derisively mocked at. She then gets a chance to go abroad to be with her sister in New York alone and she is naturally petrified at the thought of making it all by herself in an alien English land. But the lady is courageous, determined to learn English in a coaching class in New York to get back her self-pride and some 'show the world ' that she is not just 'born to make only laddoos'.The movie has many endearing moments like a cameo by Amitabh who provide solace and comfort to her on the flight to a soft spoken, French student who inadvertently falls for her simplicity and grace, a Pakistani called funnily as Salman Khan and a home sick madarsi..The movie is all about her fight not only with her inner demons of fear and insecurity but also the time which is running out as the wedding dates at her sister's house, get near and she is pushed to make a complicated choice.This is a real heart touching movie and must be seen to appreciate. The characters and performances are so real that you can reach across and touch them. And Sridevi stands tall. Freckles and all. Now everyone will know ' what and who' we have been missing on the Indian silver screen all these years",

Thankfully this movie has no so called \"item numbers\" and that says a lot! I am not so well versed with Hindi and I always used to avoid watching Hindi movies for the simple reason, I never understood what was going on and again I never had the opportunity to learn my national language and always ran away from it. But this movie was quite a slap on my face with a brick! It woke me up and now I think I should take up a few Hindi classes like Sridevi with her English classes. It would have been a crying shame if I didn't see this movie at all. Big thanks to my wife. She was the one who pulled me in for the movie when I wanted to watch Skyfall. What I loved about the movie was its script and the way the movie was shot. I've got only one word for the director. You made a stunning movie! I really don't know how old Sridevi is but boy, her screen presence with a sari in the middle of NY is just heavenly! I took a lot of positive things I could follow for the rest of my life from this movie and to me, that is the very essence of a great movie. It should leave you home with your mind fully charged with positive energy. I just couldn't find a single down side to this one at all. Brilliant job guys. Hats off!!

            "content": "There are not that many movies that really have the viewer smiling all through till the end. This smile on my face was more so due to the situations the main character overcomes throughout the film. I had an instant connection with this movie because my mother came to the U.S. with weak English and so did many of my friends' mothers.If you look at English Vinglish on a bigger scale, it's nothing more than an underdog story. This time, however, the protagonist doesn't try to win a fight with a certain character with a language and even deeply, she has to win against herself.To state that English Vinglish is pleasing, is a giant understatement. English Vinglish is more than pleasing, it's a journey to overcome your weakness; even if it's just by learning a different language.Shashi is a housewife who's world revolves around her husband and children. She runs a small business working at home. Unlike the rest of her family, she is not even close to fluent in the English language. When she has to fly to America to attend her niece's wedding, this \"weakness\" of hers is further exploited...One fine day, Shahsi has enough and joins classes to learn English in 4 weeks. Of course we know what happens in the end, but what happens between the beginning and the end is a treat all the way.Yes, the film is formulaic and at times, predictable. That is the only criticism I really see in other reviews. What is wrong with narrating a story in a predictable way? What matters is if the story is told with conviction and if it provides entertainment - Which it surely does.There are many scenes in the movie that do the trick. The scene at the caf\u00e9 is striking. All of the scenes in the class are sheer entertainment. Not to forget the scenes Shashi and her french admirer. Unique, yet poetic! Another plus is character development. There is no character that is underdeveloped or even overdeveloped. The writing is nearly flawless.The music is different. The good kind of different.Gauri Shinde's direction is adequate. She is a director to look out for.The performances are all pretty natural. Adil Hussain is first rate. Mehdi Nabou is convincing and charismatic. The actor who plays the south Indian is terrific. Ditto for the Pakistani cab driver - brilliant. The whole cast is perfect. A sweet cameo is done by Amitabh Bachchan and he's, well, charming as always.Nothing, however, is more perfect than the casting of Sridevi. It's impossible to imagine another actress do this role with such ease, such conviction. The vulnerability and then turning into strength - Just marvelous. Applaudworthy! Overall, English Vinglish has a lot of heart. It will keep you smiling and some may even shed a tear or two.",

After watching the movie, my apprehensions were proved wrong. The entire movie kept moving at a steady pace and I didn't feel bored at any particular time. The pillar of strength for the movie is Sridevi's acting. She has carried the entire movie on her shoulders. Be it the expression of shyness when her husband tries to hug her at the airport terminal or the hesitation of a typical Indian mother to dance in parties or the love and affection sown towards her family, She scores full marks in most aspects. It was also good that all songs were with the story and none of them looked out of place. One thing I didn't understand the need for is the romance between the French man and Sridevi. That portion was not related to the main part of the story.But that one didn't as such spoil the movie. It actually added some amount of suspense. Overall the pros of the movie are too high to be weighed down by the cons.It is also good to see that female-centred movies are coming up quite regularly in Bollywood these days.

Hats off to her. There is no any story but a simplest idea. Somewhere executed very well but mostly at very slow pace, somehow at the level of boring. Director Gauri Shinde is very good in enhancing the mood of scenes by detailing and taking with some new camera movements but without a good story, screenplay, everyone is helpless. She has written the story but it did not even have the ingredients of story. No any obstacle to cross. Very linear story. In climax, the classmates arrive on wedding ceremony but when Sridevi gives the speech, the class teacher hands over her a certificate. How did he come with a certificate, when even Sridevi was not aware that she would give a speech. It was completely illogical. Music wise is so so effort by Music Director Amit Trivedi.

            "content": "Although I am going to be biased with this because it is about my all-time favourite female actor but it was an absolute treat to watch Sridevi on the big screen after fifteen years. I don't care whether she's compared to Merryl Streep or being referred as the female Amitabh Bachchan but no one (and I mean it) knows and understands this craft better than she does. Not only she is absolutely pretty, she is completely unaware of it while acting. And man, those EYES! Why don't we get actors as complete as she is any longer? Regarding the film, this is such a coming of age film (typical of La Devi- remember the cult classics Sadma, Lamhe; her regional cinema), doing away with the stereotypes to a large extent (despite of great potential) and dealing with an ordinary subject with an exceptional story-telling ability. It's heart-breaking yet heart-warming. Cheerful, yet melancholy. Tackles superficial anxieties but goes very deep in bringing them to light without being melodramatic. It is very surreal yet so genuine,very life-like. How many times have we enjoyed predictability in a movie so much that we are left completely mesmerized? The film moves at a universal pace with the background score and songs as integral parts of the film. There is no revelation in the climax to make the plot more attention-grabbing, like I said, no melodrama. One problem that I have with the film is eventually one tends to get entrapped in the same social milieu that one resolves to question. Perhaps, that is the reality of ordinary life or shall we say mainstream cinema. But, seems like Gauri was aware of that predicament and therefore the film is not about liberation or deliverance but emergence! The protagonist isn't yearning for love but respect.The classroom scenes may remind you of 'Mind Your Language' but this reminisce would come to mind had it been a French language course or any other tuition with characters of different nationalities as students. This is because the iconic status that TV show has achieved but no one who has seen the film will say, 'Oh this scene is a copy from MYL'. This episode of the film is not the stronghold of the film either. Perhaps Gauri was conscious of this comparison and therefore kept it to the minimal. Learning English or not knowing the language is a metaphor. Not knowing and persistence to learn is the foundation of the script. The only high point coming out of this part of the film is the bonding between Sridevi and French actor Mehdi Nebbou. It is a lesson for all those filmmakers, particularly Anurag Basu who directed Kites (2010), how to use a foreign language in a film without making it boring. The strength of the film is that there are no subtitles for the French dialogues and yet you would enjoy the conversations between Sridevi and Mehdi.This is also a film which does not privilege learning English for respect over the protagonist's culinary passion or for that matter non-remunerative work. One sees that she never belittled herself for what she knew and didn't know. For her, it's her passion which she wants to prioritize. Even when she thinks that being with her children is more important for her than going for her class is a statement that raising children, cooking in the kitchen, being a homemaker are as economic productive tasks as going out to work in an office. The director's ability to give some powerful messages in such a subtle way makes the film a winner.Highly Recommended! (Have written a detailed review with description from scenes but don't want this review to be a spoiler. Will update later to include that) One of the best films I have seen in recent years with a novel plot, a crisp screenplay and a perfect characterisation. If not because I am saying this but trust me international audience doesn't give a standing ovation to a film just like that! The Hindu never recommends a film before its release. Amitabh Bachchan or RajniKanth do not write/speak about a film at such great length. Shekhar Kapoor doesn't tweet everyday on a mainstream film appreciating it. How many times do we have critics/reviewers Subhash K Jha, Rajeev Masand, Anupama Chopra, Taran Adarsh, Jitesh Pillai, Meena Iyer etc on same page effectively calling this the best film of the year thus far? Most of all, it's a comeback of an actor who shouldn't have retired in the first place (cruel industry!). As they say, a true Pan Indian Megastar!And, as someone wrote, 'Sri has brought back the act in acting!' I agree. Welcome back and please stay!",

            "review_title": "A Pathetic Attempt at Saluting a Man's Idea of Indian Women",
            "content": "This film pressed my buttons and made me MAD!!!! If the equivalent were made about a modern day black man who is demoted to a life of doing menial tasks because of lack of education; who then goes on a mission to win respect of those who are belittling him, the whole world would be up in arms at the racist implication. However, in this case, when such things are taken for granted, very few people can see the offence in it!On the surface this film seems harmless enough but remove the cultural veneer and you will see that it is completely insulting to women. The main character is a spineless and timid housewife who cooks and cleans, runs the house and does a bit of freelance cooking on the side which her partner does not approve of. She is dominated by an overbearing husband who wants to keep her in her place, and bullied by a bratty, arrogant daughter who joins her father in his fun making of her mother due to her not being able to understand English. Then out of the blue, the opportunity to learn English is presented to her after going to the USA to attend a wedding. There she makes friends, is wooed by a French student and opens her mind to people all walks of life. Once the rest of her family arrive, she has to continue her English lessons in secret because her first and foremost duty is cooking, cleaning and attending to her husband and children and putting them before all else. The movie continually re-enforces that this is what Indian women are supposed to do and should be the sum total of the meaning of their lives.I think the most insulting line of all in the entire film is said by a couple of fellow Indian students from the English class after the French student Laurent declares his undying love to Sridevi: \"All women not French, this is Indian woman - show respect\" \u2013 the implication being that, French and other women do not need to be shown respect because they are sexually promiscuous and can be easily won over by anyone who's interested, whereas all Indian women are in some way pure and unsullied and cannot be brought to the tarnished depths of Western culture. Really, that type of script is verging on racism surely!The climax of this advertisement for Indian purity happens at the wedding where the housewife (who was tempted but did not stray\u0085of course), delivers a moving speech in broken English about respect simultaneously shaming her daughter and opening her self-centred husbands eyes to the idea that his wife is more than just a rice cooking baby machine.The final scene shows that she is still his obedient wife because she gives him 'two Ladoos' thus proving that even though he treated her like a servant, she still maintains perfect loyalty because he is the 'man' of the house and her 'husband'.Honestly, I cannot express my disappointment at what a heap of tripe the content of this film presents; it is insulting, patronising and perpetuates an outdated dogma that should have been over a long time ago. Please Gauri Shinde, do not insult Indian film-making with this flaccid offering of backward garbage; there are so many brilliant Indian movies out there that are real, gritty and do justice to the industry. If you have the facility and the ability, do something life-changing with it rather than this utter nonsense!",

            "content": "Let us analyse the title more closely! English Vinglish - I would say that the movie is more about Vinglish than English. Rightly so!Of course we Indians proudly talk in English all day even when we share the same mother tongue (maybe Gujarati/Marathi). It has sort of become a fascination with us!I would say English is necessary for business matters. But we still need to cherish our rich heritage of regional languages. I make it a point that I talk to my son (17 months old) in my mother tongue. Of course I will make him learn & understand English as well, when the need arises!Coming back to the movie, we see a common housewife being belittled by her husband and daughter. Luckily she gets a chance to overcome her fears. She does come around indeed!Brilliant performance by Sridevi in her cameo role. It touches your soul when a housewife says 'mujhe pyaar ki jaroorat nahi, respect ki hai!'Next time you come across someone who doesn't understand your flamboyant English, don't belittle him. He/She might be very good at making ladoos!My take - It is a must watch movie for every Indian! A simple problem put down in an emphatic way!10/10 from mewww.facebook.com/investorschool",

I personally drew many useful points from this movie.The movie contained humor, sentiment, commitment, and a lesson one should learn before provoking other's weakness, the art of the person's earning self-respect we call.Sridevi is the forever topnotch actress, a tagged 'natural' actress, and she proves it once again.

She has played this kind of roles (overly traditional and insecure housewife) many times before, not a major departure there. Music is okay, not up to Amit Trevedi's usual standard. He usually has 1-2 very catchy tunes, but I can't recall any from this movie. The actor who played the French cook was also very good. Otherwise a very predictable movie with constant feel-good factor throughout. A total chick-flick, it supplies constant burst of sugar throughout.However, the end (marriage speech onwards) completely ruins the movie. The movie would have been much better if the end was different. Whats with the sudden change of heart from her husband and daughter? Please, give us a break. Lets get real for once, we can handle it.Only watch if you are a die-hard Sridevi fan.",

One day she got the call from her sister to visit New York to attend her daughter's wedding, but she was reluctant to go alone because of her poor English language, thou she finally agreed on her husband's persuasion. In New York, during her visit to a caf\u00e9 she felt humiliated due to her understanding of English language which brought a reason for her to fight against the odds and make a place for herself. She left from there and suddenly saw an advertisement for four weeks English speaking classes and that's how she got the way to prove herself by learning a language which is global now and a synonym of 'Being Modern' in Indian societies called English, for Her VINGLISH.This is a brilliant film and sridevi did full justice to her role. must watch",

There she earns friends and gradually earns respect in eyes of people where it was lacking.There is a dialog where Shashi conveys, it is she who does not know the meaning of PTA but she knows that of a parent.

            "review_title": "A Simple, Funny, Engaging and Touching Experience",
            "content": "Subtleness is less expected from Bollywood, so it was pleasantly surprising to watch the understated subordination of Sridevi's character Shashi by her own husband and daughter. Even more subtle is the family's treatment of the grandmother \u2013 in one scene, Shashi's husband Satish casually tells his mother that she wasn't going with them to America because she had no passport to travel. The subordination of Indian homemakers and more broadly, Indian women in society and within their own homes, and the neglect of aging women within families is honestly conveyed in English Vinglish, the debut film by first-time director Gauri Shinde. The opening scene is fresh and well-thought-out. Shashi is the first to wake up and ready the breakfast for her family. She prepares coffee in the same way she does every morning. She does not know how to pronounce the name of the brand Nescafe correctly, but that is not what concerns her. Her foremost duty is to take care of her dear ones \u2013 her working husband, her teenage daughter, her young son and her sweet mother-in-law. The moment they occupy the dining room, she begins serving toast and tea, sitting down only after each member in her family gets food. The first reaction she gets is 'Oh the toast is burnt. Why am I getting burnt charcoal toast?!' and similar jests and jabs for all the effort she has taken in making their morning. Shashi is then teased by her husband and daughter for butchering the word 'jazz', beginning the core plot of the film. The next few scenes surround Shashi's everyday life, which includes preparing motichoor ladoos for neighbors, poojas and ceremonies, a hobby that supplements the household income but isn't taken seriously by her workaholic husband. Shashi's teenage daughter is very critical about her mother's English speaking skills and is uncomfortable in taking her mother to the parent-teachers' meeting while her son is too young to be finicky about her mother's English and only wants her to mimic Michael Jackson steps. Shashi's language skills become especially worrisome when she is invited by her sister to NY for her niece's wedding. Her husband does not send the kids along with her, saying that she herself would find it hard to adjust and communicate in NY and taking the kids along would just complicate the matter. So Shashi, a common housewife (according to her family) lands in New York, getting acquainted with a magnanimous gentleman on her flight (cameo by Amitabh Bachchan). She does not face much trouble when her sister or niece is present but after a humiliating experience alone at a caf\u00e9, she tries contacting an English Speaking 4 week course, seeing the advertisement on the bus. Shashi starts taking the class, along with a Latina, a Pakistani, a South Indian, a Frenchman, an African and a Chinese and run by a gay teacher. She learns valuable lessons at the class, learning that she is an entrepreneur and finding comfort among people like her, not in nationality but in their inability to communicate in English. Her secret life as a student turns problematic when the Frenchman falls in love with Shashi (easily the most interesting element in the film) and when her family arrives in New York. Will she be able to learn English and more importantly change her family's perception about her? I found many aspects of the relationship between Shashi and her family to be parallel to my own family's; my mother left her job after sixteen years of service and is now a freelancer and part-time German teacher, earning her Masters in German after leaving her job. I know my mother isn't a person who loves cooking, though she makes good food; like Shashi, she makes us bread and tea for breakfast a lot many times and we (my father and I) love to tease her cooking skills. My father, who brings much of the family income, sometimes disregards my mother's freelancing as an actual job, only regarding a 9 to 5 job as 'actual' work. This made some scenes involving Shashi and her husband very engaging for me; also, the incident at school involving Shashi and her mother reminded me of the time I felt embarrassed in going to the theatre with my grandmother once. The relationship between Shashi and her son reminds me of the unconditional love shown by my 4 year old cousin to my grandmother. I was very pleased at how much I could connect with certain aspects in the movie and I applaud Gauri Shinde for taking care in making the interactions between Shashi and her family as realistic as possible. The characterization of Daadi is also wonderfully subtle - in my own family I have felt this relegating role of my grandmother and her sad acceptance of the same. But (I'm going to be hated for saying this) the cameo by Bachchan could've been deleted \u2013 it was that OMG Sridevi and Bachchan moment for those who've seen their previous films together, but apart from that it served very less purpose. This time could've been used instead for more personal interactions between Sridevi and her fellow students. As mentioned above, the silent chemistry between Shashi and Laurent is the most touching element in English Vinglish. The film works best in the latter half when it's less about English and more about themes like love, loyalty, responsibility, understanding, celebration, independence and realization.Even though she wasn't exactly Marathi, Sridevi is lovely and lovable as Shashi, excelling especially in the second half and shouldering the weight of the movie. This can be said about the other characters as well, and all this happens because the writing sparkles with honesty, care and thoughtfulness. English Vinglish is a simple, funny, and engaging and touching film that succeeds with the help of Sridevi and the casts' performances and Gauri Shinde's strong understanding of the characters she created.Verdict: 6.2 out of 10",

India has an obsessional with 'west is best' which has it's good and bad points. However, this film focused mainly on the bad points. It chose to show the glam of NYC, designer labels, cafe culture etc but dismissed the possibility of escaping a clearly dysfunctional marriage. The fact that Shashi was treated as a slave by her family did not change when she told her husband she still loved him. I appreciate that their marriage might have improved but he didn't. This film reflects the fact that modern India still has a long way to go in gender equality. I can imagine that the film would not have been quite the success it has been if she had run off to Paris to setup a restaurant with Laurent but it might have encouraged a wider audience globally.

            "content": "For every other Sridevi fan, this film must have been that much awaited cinematic confrontation with their dream actress and the superstar of her times (or should I say megastar?). Let me admit that I was never a Sridevi fan in my life (even after watching all her fantastic performances in various characters), however, the temptation to see the actress come back in the celluloid after some 15 years was enough for me go for English Vinglish.The movie of course speaks about a woman who does know how to speak the language of English- a very unambiguous and common subject considering the backgrounds of middle class Indian family housewives and their extremely \"anti-western\" exposure. Yet, right at the onset, the film makes mark in the minds of the audience (at least mine) as the lines \"for my mother\" appears on the screen. Sridevi- the actress who went up to the dizzying heights of fame and popularity across the Indian subcontinent in the early 80s is introduced. It is perhaps the commonality of the subject that makes this movie so appealing and beautiful.Hats off to Gauri Shinde for minutely putting up all of these nuances on screen. The superb performances of all the characters (her fellow class mates) in the English class adds up to the entertainment factor of the film and also speaks of the \"other\" world that we are so ignorant of. Why should an Indian woman be smirked at when a royal French man can say something like \"my English is not clean\u0085.it is dirty\"? \u0085we learn. The movie begins by portraying the mundane chore of a woman- morning tea, tiffin for children, blah, blah\u0085common scenarios of every middle class household. In the midst of all this, the revelation of the protagonist gradually takes place. Sridevi plays that common mother of an ICSE/ international board student who does not know how to speak English and hence fails to strike a chord with her children. (In recent times, this has been the subject matter of some films including Supriya Pathak's character in Wake up Sid).Her children make fun of her English as she pronounces \"jazz\" as 'jhaas'. Her husband is no different; he too goes all the way in trampling her spirit and laughing aloud with the kids. With this, the theme of the movie is established.The rest is only predictable. The woman seething within at every joke cracked at her for her wrong English, develops a resolve to make amends.Having been to an ICSE board school myself, I could vividly remember the displeasure I felt at times at having to translate a lot of my school activities ( for eg. something that the teacher said ) to my mother and how she used to shy away for turning up at every PTA's. \"For my mother\" by the director hence made a tremendous mark in my mind and I am sure it did so for several other girls like me.In this film, Shashi (Sridevi) is that woman who is completely consumed in the upbringing of her children and attending to the needs of her husband. However, she is a little different from the rest in the line\u0085 She solemnly pursues something that she loves - making laddoos. Yes, she makes laddoos and sells them and saves the money earned. Shashi is yet not that woman who earns for herself and is independent. In fact, she cannot share her delights of selling laddoos with her husband who thinks it's a relegated job. She is laughed at almost always for her poor English and feels ignored and deprived of both love and respect by her family.However, by some cinematic turn of events, Shashi leaves for America to attend her niece's wedding much before her family comes along and much against her wishes. She finds an advertisement that promises to teach English in 4 weeks. So there it goes- Shashi enrolls for the class. Shashi triumphs in every way, even when it comes to winning the heart of her fellow mates, especially the French man. It was spectacular to watch Shashi and the French man (played by French actor Mehdi Nebbou) speak in Hindi and French respectively to each other while venting out their personal emotions\u0085cinematic excellence indeed!'When someone tells us how beautiful we are, we feel like living that old, jaded and forlorn life again with renewed freshness'- Shashi confesses this to the man who is almost the Yeatsian \"face amid a crowd of stars\" who \"loved the pilgrim soul in her and the sorrows of her changing face\".Shashi teaches us the biggest lesson\u0085that we may not be as \"judgmental\" as others are towards us.A beautiful film, wonderful performances and a complete heartwarming experience it was.The humble appeal of English Vinglish and the detailed description of the innuendos of a woman faced with the inability to speak English connect all the dots and make it a complete must watch for all.P.S- Turned into a Sridevi fan\u0085 Basked in the glory of Bachchan retreat for some minutes. What else can I ask for?PujaCheers!!",

The story revolves around a typical Indian housewife Shashi, beautifully done by yesteryear star Sridevi, who is made fun of by her own family due to her lack of knowledge in English. She feels hurt in her mind but do not share her sorrows. As it is, she has to go for US to attend her sister's daughter's wedding. How would she cope in the US without proper English? The movie also shows the mature relation between Shashi and Laurent, who is a soft spoken French cook staying in the US. The story says genuine communication requires no knowledge of languages (maybe true, to an extent). The storyline is filled with clean humor. The family values of India are also highlighted. Director Gauri Shinde, who also has written the film, should be lauded.",

            "content": "The film is about respect and moral values which are getting decreased these days among people. It also deals with the most sensitive issue of what a child learns in his/her house. What children say and how they behave these days is what they learn from their elders. It is whole a vicious circle. Without going into psychology, I would say that English Vinglish is a brilliant Indian Cinema. The story revolves around a Housewife who is very kind in nature and has a talent in some things like making laddoos, but she is not appreciated in her house by her husband because of her weak English. And to make things worse, even her children sometimes say things which hurt her feelings. The next part of the film shows the will of a person when he/she intends something with their heart.PROS: The acting of Sridevi is the key to the success of the film. The story too is written tightly without any loop holes. The good thing about the film is that though it has been shot on foreign locations, it does not get lost in showing the exotic locations and cinematography. It just focuses on the material of the film.CONS: The camera in the initial scenes seemed to be out of focus. I don't know whether it was a technical problem or it was intentional. The dialogs written for the kids seemed unsatisfactory, as if they were written to invoke more emotions. But the situations alone were good enough to make the audience emotional.Message: \"Everyone needs respect.\" Verdict: \"A must watch Indian Film.\"",

            "content": "Film Review \u2013 English Vinglish.1. A mother of a teenage daughter (played by Sridevi) cannot speak English well. Her daughter hates to take her to school because her friend's mother can speak good English! She is reluctant to take her mother to school in parents-teachers meet lest her friends and teachers will come to know that she cannot speak good English \u0085so basically is a ganwar (illiterate) female the daughter is ashamed to take around in public. The same daughter is OK with the fact that her mother is cooking and taking care of the home front \u2013 just that she should not get to meet her friends! Otherwise all other home- front requirements that a child needs from the mother is given to her and she is fine with it.2. Husband is working in an Advt. agency \u2013 speaks good English \u2013 yet married to her because he is an intelligent man who understands that the role of a wife has nothing to do with her knowledge of any particular language\u0085any language for that matter \u2013 his priorities regarding wife-factor were clear cut! Bit of a belittling attitude towards his wife \u2013 he is fine with the fact that she is taking care of the home front plus even making some money on her own by selling 'kishmish-topped-laddus'!3. Son, who is barely 4 -5 years old is the only one who is a bit attached to his mother \u2013 because he was still very dependent on her for reaching potty-seat and eating food etc. Keeping the family personality on mind \u2013 very soon, even he would alienate from his mother because of her poor English speaking skills!4. By chance, Sridevi gets an opportunity to visit the US to attend her niece's wedding. She is surprised to see her own sister being so confident about staying in a foreign country all on her own! She was managing things quite well\u0085to which her sister replies that her husband's ever encouraging nature was the reason of her confidence. This saddens Sridevi a bit because all that she got by being a good wife and mother was just the belittling attitudes of her family members \u2013 and that too for as vague and stupid a reason as not being able to converse in English with friends, kith and kin! 5. Sridevi then joins 'spoken English' and tries to improvise on her English speaking skills to surprise her family members!6. Last scene is so damn pathetic!! She tries to win the confidence and love of her family members by speaking in English\u0085\u0085.oh! my - how humiliating is that! It's like a female can be a pure Bi*ch as far as nature or character is concerned \u2013 but she can get away with anything if and only if she can speak in English!This is pathetically yours,India!!",

It portrays the everyday struggle of people who don't know English but somehow have to live in an environment where using English for communication is considered as a symbol of modernity (which is quite absurd in a country like India which itself has such a vast literature in regional language and where language is a big part of country's politics. where a foreign language should be used for getting an economic advantage) But broadly in movie English is used a tool to illustrate that things which rationally thinking should be neutral and insignificant in a relationship affects it adversely. In this regard this movie is quite similar to Taare Zameen Par in which the father forces his child to follow the conventional norms without trying to understand his child.Concept wise movie is very good. in performances its' leading lady shine throughout the movie. Shridevi shows how an actress or actor can reinvent them self as was done previously by Amitabh Bachhan in Mohabbatein. Apart from Shridevi any other guys is replaceable in movie.leaving few annoying things like over emphasizing the Shridevie's Laddu making talent and to much stress on cruelty of girl child toward her mother, overall movie is good to watch and an inspiration to many new comer's and existing directors who struggles to bring out new concepts for script.",

The only reason being I had never really liked Sridevi, always had a view her performances were over the top and too loud. To be honest, in those days, my vote would have gone to Madhuri Dixit or even Meenakshi Sheshadri.Post \"3 IDIOTS\", every other movie seems to have a message besides the entertainment element. The controlled performance my Sridevi absolutely blew me away. Wonderful, just wonderful. What she would have liked to put in words, but could not, were more than amply vocalized by her gestures. An absolutely heartwarming, endearing and brilliant role scripted to which she has done 100% justice.For the negative character, wonderful performance by Adil Hussain playing the constantly busy and always cynical husband. Supporting Sridevi's role were very aptly written roles for Priya Anand as Radha, Mehdi Nabbou as the silent and intense French romantic and of course the short and very strong role written out for BIG B.This movie is clean and should be seen with the family for a complete entertaining and marginally moral experience. Absolte and wonderful heart warming experience. Goes to show age is no barrier to learn a new language or skill. And before respecting others, one has to love and respect himself / herself.Once again, Gaauri Shinde and Sridevi..........take a bow!",

            "content": "Some movies are so real life like that you just cant help but get amazed by the creativity and deep thought process of the Writer / Director and in this movies case both the department are headed by the debut Gauri Shinde. She claims it's her mother's story whereas I felt as if she showed me my mother's life story and I guess lot of people like me will definitely relate it to a lot of Indian Housewives whose stories were never told before, never in this way at least. It is class apart and a damn good movie with so many heart warming moments that it keeps you totally hooked to it. You just can't wait for the climax and the moment of glory to come with it, which you look forward to so badly. Entire cast does justice to their roles, like you hate her daughter for laughing at her, you love her son for his unconditional love towards his mother, you again hate her husband too to be so heartless, you love her niece to help her out, totally love her classmates, so on and so forth but the cake goes to Sridevi for an outstanding performance. I tried hard to imagine who else could have lived this character so well but none of the name comes any closer to the way she plays it. I was never her fan \u2013 although I chose her above Madhuri and liked her for the characters she portrayed on screen \u2013 she was and is still damn good looking. This is a must watch for all the married guys, who knows? You may be making the same mistake her husband was doing and it's a must watch for all of the housewives, who knows? A course like that may change your life too. Even otherwise \u2013 it's a damn good entertainer if nothing else, not to be missed by anyone.The Movie: Is based on the life of a middle aged Indian Housewife Shashi (Sridevi), who's married to Satish (Adil Hussain) lives in Pune with her two young kids and mother-in-law. She is a damn good dedicated mother and a good wife yet her own daughter and husband leave no opportunity to make fun of her. Specially her daughter whose a 7th grade student \u2013 she is too embarrassed to go with her mother in a PTA just because of her inability to speak in English to other parents and her class teacher. It is shown in the movie in such a subtle way that I just couldn't help but draw parallels to my own life where I actually hated my mom \u2013 when it came to going to my school to take my progress card or when I had to accompany her to the market or local grocery store. It was a scene cut of my own life in the movie \u2013 moved me big time, I now feel so sorry for being like that. How she overcomes that successfully yet to the embarrassment to her own daughter who feels she overdoes it and still not not happy. I was shocked to see her husband so heartless \u2013 who had no feelings towards his own wife \u2013 who's so good in everything she does, a wife who is so good right from cooking delicious food, to being with the kids all day, taking care of the household, his own age old mother etc. On top of that she even makes damn good Laddoo's (Indian Sweets), which are like well known and praised by one and all in the society \u2013 she does makes good money too with her own small scale business.Twist in the life comes in the form of an invitation from her sister who invites them all to attend her daughter's marriage in United States of America. Now Shashi, who is already weak in English and who couldn't communicate with anyone properly has to go to USA that too alone because she had to help her sister in marriage preparations and obviously her kids and husband couldn't join her because of office and school. Even the thought of the same was scary for her, how she takes the flight and goes to USA to her sister is one hilarious ride yet heart touching drama to say the least. One moment you are in splits and in second you are serious and thinking about her plight. How she tackles those ups and downs is totally commendable and the highlight of the movie. Once in USA \u2013 its good to see her loving niece taking good care of her, helping her out so well, I wish her daughter was half as good as her niece \u2013 life would've been so good for Shashi. One fine day she comes across an Advertisement in a bus claiming \"Learn English in 4 Weeks\" \u2013 how she enrolls for the course and how it all changes her life upside down is the rest of the movie. You've got to see it to believe it. Trust me the best part of the movie starts when she comes out of the class on the first day. That point onwards there is no looking back \u2013 not for her and not for the Shashi loving and cheering audience. It's an amazing experience seeing her success and happiness. So much so that \u2013 I actually wanted to stand in the end and clap for her and I realized \u2013 I was not the only one who was feeling that ways \u2013 even my wife, her friend and almost all the people in the auditorium had the same feelings.",

Gauri Shinde's story of a simple Indian housewife-entrepreneur (yes, you read that right!) and her little act of courage to earn respect from her own family is feel-good, funny and tear-inducing - all at the same time.A housewife's lack of knowledge of the English language makes her the subject of domestic banter. But her husband and teen-aged daughter fail to realize exactly when they cross the line of innocent leg pulling to causing serious pain. In a few scenes of effortless elegance, Gauri Shinde paints a picture of a domestic situation which many of us might have experienced or caused, but realize only after being pointed out explicitly. Situations which occur in family and friend circles, when pain, hurt and insult are dealt out unknowingly.What follows makes for a strong yet simple plot, simple enough for me not to dare going into it or all magic would be spoiled. Sridevi is a class act, and her expressions on two occasions particularly - once when she is showered with unexpected praise by a stranger and the other when she trips on the pavement, with certain peculiar facial contortions that are incredibly natural - define this wonderful performance.Watch English Vinglish for two hours of unbridled, innocent celebration of simplicity and quiet, unassuming courage.",

Watch it multiple times, you will love it more and more. Very well-directed by Gauri Shinde and the supporting cast is excellent. Although all the scenes of the movie are so authentic and true to life. the following stand-out: 1. Shashi at her daughter's school with another parent 2. Shashi talks to her husband at the mall after he hugs a co-worker. 3. Shashi's son Sagar acts as a spy telling his mom about his elder sister. 4. Shashi trying to order food and getting ridiculed. 5. Shashi's communications with Laurent. 6. The last speech (I call it the \"Queen's Speech\")",

What I didn't enjoy was that her husband never seemed to treat her with respect -- the initial description of the movie says something like, she endures \"small slights\" from her husband.... to me they didn't seem small, especially since they were relentless. A stranger on a plane (Amitabh Bachchan) treated her 100% better than her husband. Then a man in a class she took also was very respectful of her...maybe the husband was considerate of her when they were courting, or you'd have to wonder why she ever married him!? unless it was an arranged marriage. It was a movie with a strong positive focus on the female lead character, but for me it would've been a lot stronger if she either left or even considered leaving the husband. (but then it wouldn't maybe be true to the Indian custom of her generation).",

The movie does not have surprises or a climax planned for you but still it is pleasing in it's own sweet way. The movie depicts deep emotions such as absence of family support in such a simplistic manner that you start feeling bad for the protagonist but she turns out to be strong teaching us how we have to stand for ourselves. Every tear of the protagonist has been converted to a chuckle to balance the sentiments of the movie but also how well does it portray the real life situations where women just smile to mask their emotions. The movie is a train of sequences depicting such tiny observations from our day to day life in a humorous manner. The movie is a must watch.",

The twists are so bad, you might be wondering who was responsible for this cheesy mess. Not that the actors are doing anything to improve that stuff.

            "content": "The movie traces the life and struggle of a simple Indian housewife, Sashi (well essayed by Sridevi), to earn respect and dignity which is being denied to her by her own family, only for the reason that she is not proficient in English. She is called upon by her sister for her niece's wedding to New York and once there secretly enrolls herself for a four-week of English class. Constantly helping her is her second niece, Radha (lively performance by Priya Anand). The climax is wherein she delivers a simple but heartfelt speech in English addressing the newly married about how to keep alive a marital relationship, especially when the bond is weak or any one of the partners try the one-man-up attitude. This really shocks the rather unsupportive husband and the indignant elder daughter out of their stupor; but as one deeply in love with her family, Sashi holds no grudges or anger. However, there are a few exaggerations (call them, 'cinematic liberties'): the resentment of the daughter towards the mother who does not know English, the cold attitude of the husband towards his wife, the ease with which a rather coy Indian woman gets used to the American scenario... Of course, anyone - even one who does not know Sridevi - would right away know that she knows English much better than she pretends not to know!All these are more or less overshadowed by the steady focus on the story, simple music, good supporting cast, the decent presentation of family values (especially understanding, concern and sacrifice) ... One of the main values presented is the need to trust oneself (Towards the end, Sashi thanks one of her classmates for helping her love herself). Overall, it is a welcome movie: refreshing and of course offering good insights and values (self-esteem and family ties).http://vcastilino.blogspot.in/2012/10/englsh-vinglish.html",

She looks good for her age (I bet she got it done at the same place MJ did) but her voice is intolerable.The acting of most of the cast is over the top. Liked Adils though.Coming back to the movie, what bothered me the most is that it shows that the protagonist is a Maharastrian from Pune. I would expect that whenever she falls short of words to express herself in English, she would use some Marathi fillers but all the time she would talk in Hindi. Then that scene in the restaurant where she gave the order to waiter in fluent English and the ridiculous reasoning that she could do it because she was angry !!!She apparently has huge clientele for her Laddoos and that too she is the frontend person for her small business, which means she naturally interacts with a lot of people. Its very difficult to believe that such a person does not understand even basic English but learns it in 4 weeks !There are too many things in the movie which insults the audience's intellect.If you are a frustrated house wife who doesn't get the respect you deserve from your family, you might want to show this to your family. It might help in sending across a message.I just learned how retarded Indian Critics are.",

She exhibited a strong, free mind without ever abandoning her role as a traditional homemaker woman in a nuclear family. The story was great and the ending was memorable. Of course, there were some absolutely hilarious moments in the movie. The only regrettable aspect of this movie was that it over-dramatized the rudeness of one American, and as an American it made me roll my eyes.

            "content": "This movie was very much needed for this fast generation of changing India! Due to globalization and absence of a country-wide 'regional' language, most of the businesses today demands efficient use of English - a global language. Naturally, respect for the language that helps earn money with comfort prompts ugly neglect of other regional languages. Schools encourage kids to learn English, keeping it as a mandate. It glorifies this language in minds of children vis-\u00e0-vis other regional languages. They think that they conform to a special status when they know English well. Rather, its a frown - a discomfort to converse in regional language when you know what the world speaks. This nonchalance creeps into every urban household. Slowly it gives birth to a false shame when somebody jumps in with the regional sentence when all are busy interacting in business language. This film is a story of people who are home makers, or local business persons. People who are not concerned about foreign land, their taste, their language and their lifestyle. All they hope to achieve is security for their loved ones and happiness in small achievements. In this film \u2013 the protagonist is a lady who manages her husband's needs, her children's wants and the society's obligations. In their busy schedule, her loved ones fail to understand her sacrifices. They feel terrible at her efforts to try English. Many women watch their children study in English medium schools and converse in English at home. They also desire to come up to their standards, but it remains a distant dream. Their household work keeps them busy. Husband doesn't realize that things do change at home when he is busy attending a meeting. Children too \u2013 busy in learning lessons; tend to ignore their mom's efforts in getting everything ready on time. The result is \u2013 as depicted \u2013 gross negligence. Nobody cares about the lady's feelings; she is taken for granted. She suffers humiliation for her incapability to converse in same manner that her loved ones speak to their friends, colleagues and acquaintances. This breeds a sense of guilt. At the first opportunity, the lady decides to quash her fears and learn English. And experience follows",

It is a thought provoking movie about the Indian middle class housewives, their right to pursue their interest and their duty towards family.Sridevi, as usual, is fantastic as Shashi, an unassuming housewife who feels lesser to her educated husband and kids. The teenage daughter is ashamed of her traditional mother who is ignorant in English and many a times hurts her mothers feelings purposefully. The husband, sees in her, a devoted house wife whose only focus is her family and has no life of her own. Shashi, limited by her family, fails to explore her talent in cooking, restricting it to a small business, just for friends and family.Like a fresh breath of air in her life, comes a chance of going to New York to visit her sister and help her with wedding preparations. Her sister, with the support of her late husband, is a successful woman in NY. A great contrast to Shashi's family situation.In NY, she goes to a class to learn English in 4 weeks an develops a new set of friends. They appreciate her talents and beauty. Thus a silent but determined struggle by the silent Shashi, shows her family how special she is.The screenplay is excellent. Any Indian family can identify with the family on screen. All actors have done a wonderful job. And, the movie conveys good messages about family life and your individuality.It is a must watch for all Indians",
