            "content": "I've seen both version of this film--the original silent version from 1925 and the re-release by Chaplin in the 1940s. The difference is that the re-release was designed to appeal to a new audience that expected sound from their movies. To do this, title cards were removed--having Chaplin narrate the film. In addition, Chaplin-created music (for the most part--some were classical pieces), sound effects and singing were added to make the movie more palatable to the average viewer. I personally like BOTH versions and the one you watch is up to you if you get a copy of the Warner Brothers release on DVD--it has both plus excellent DVD extras. Otherwise, there have been a lot of public domain versions on video out there--many with terrible quality prints or music or both. The Warner version is the most pristine and beautiful silent print you can find. The version usually shown on Turner Classic movies is the 1942 re-release.I use this film for my American history class when we do our unit on the history of film, though I might, in the future, use it for my Psychology classes as well (I teach both) because Chaplin's genius came from his obsessive-compulsive nature. The movie reportedly had 27 times more film exposed than you actually see in the film and the shoe eating segment was shot after more than 60 takes!! The plot involves Charlie going to Alaska for the Gold Rush at the turn of the century. Along the way, he has a series of misadventures that have been thoroughly discussed in the other reviews here on IMDb. Suffice to say, the supporting acting was excellent and the story kept an excellent pace and had enough slapstick to make it fun to watch (something not true of all full-length slapstick comedies--sometimes, their pacing was negatively affected by the transition from shorts to full-length).This is a gorgeous, well-executed piece of American art and a must for any real cinemaniac. The musical score (arranged by Chaplin), direction, acting and cinematography all are simply perfect--making this, in my opinion, the best full-length silent comedy ever made. This is saying a lot considering how much I love Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton's films!",

            "content": "The 1898 Gold Rush to Alaska may have been harsh, but Charlie Chaplin makes it hilarious. As an unnamed prospector, Chaplin goes through a series of gaffes while seeking gold in the Yukon. Most famous of course are the shoe for dinner, the dancing roles, and the cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff. His companion, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) at one point is so hungry that he believes Chaplin's character to be a chicken, and before long, a bear enters their cabin. In the midst of it all, the prospector falls in love with dancer Georgia (Georgia Hale).A real triumph for Charlie Chaplin! They must have had a lot of fun filming it!",

            "content": "This silent classic has many strong points - it has a lot of humor, interesting characters, a good story and good settings.  It's the kind of film that shows how much a master film-maker can communicate in a silent movie.  It overdoes the sentimentality on occasion, but other than that it's a fine film.Chaplin himself plays the 'Lone Prospector', and he is joined by several other interesting characters in a frozen north setting that sets up some good adventures and drama.  There are some memorable scenes in the prospectors' rickety cabins, plus some other good material.The version of this that is the easiest to find is the one that Chaplin re-edited in the 1940's, adding his own narration and deleting the title cards, which gives it a slightly different feel.  (These revisions probably make it a bit easier to follow for those who aren't used to silent films.) You can tell from Chaplin's narration how fond he must have been of \"The Gold Rush\", and he had a lot of good reasons to be pleased with it.  There are a couple of his later films that might be even better and more timeless, but this one contains everything that defined Chaplin and his art.",

            "review_title": "Charlie Chaplin at his best.",
            "content": "The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.\nCharlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush. There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch.",

            "content": "Charles Chaplin's \"The Gold Rush\" is arguably his finest film. He stars as a wimpy prospector who decides to go to the Klondike in the hopes of striking it rich. What he does not realize is that he may find love (in the form of Georgia Hale) instead of money. In the end that may be all right with him. \"The Gold Rush\" shows everything that made Charles Chaplin the great performer, writer and director he was. Quite possibly the finest cinematic icon of the 20th Century, Chaplin showed humanity, love and an undying want to entertain all audiences throughout his stellar cinematic career. The movie is exceptional in every way. Although I am not as well-versed with movies from the 1920s as I am with the decades following it, I would still probably call \"The Gold Rush\" the finest film of that 10-year period. Oh how the cinema misses Charles Chaplin today. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's silent film (also re-released with a narration in the early 1940s) focuses, as usual, on the Little Tramp, and in this case, his attraction to a chorus girl (Georgia Hale). This is the one where he eats a boot, along with its laces, and manages to make it appear a sumptuous meal; as well as creating a dance with bread rolls.The role of the girl was originally intended for the second Mrs Chaplin, Lita Grey, but her pregnancy ruled her out. Georgia Hale is excellent in her disdain of the unwanted Tramp attentions. Mack Swain appears as Big Jim, who shares a cabin with the Tramp, at one point getting so hungry he imagines his pal as a chicken ready to eat! This film has the spirit of the pioneers and gold-runners, as well as the inimitable spirit of the little hero. As a silent it is one of the best comedies of the time, as a sound film, it is fairly good.",

            "review_title": "Charlie of the Yukon",
            "content": "THE GOLD RUSH (United Artists, 1925), written, directed and starring Charlie Chaplin, may not be the very best of the Chaplin feature comedies of the silent era, but has become the very movie in which Chaplin wanted to be most noted for by future generations. So proud of his achievement, Chaplin reissued this silent film in 1942 with a new music soundtrack which introduced a narration written and spoken by Chaplin himself, eliminating the use of title cards. Then in the summer of 1971, THE GOLD RUSH became the initial movie presented on public broadcasting station's 13-week series of \"The Silent Years,\" as hosted by Orson Welles, from the Paul Killian collection with a new and excellent piano score by William Perry.THE GOLD RUSH, which is set in the turn of the century, opens with The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) coming to Alaska. A snow storm drives him into the cabin of \"Black\" Lawson (Tom Murray), an outlaw. \"Big Jim\" McKay (Mack Swain), another prospector who has found gold on his claim, is also driven in by the storm and into the same cabin. After much struggle, Larson finds himself having to accept the two men as his guests. Stranded due to the heavy storm, Larson, finds himself chosen to go out for help. While out in the storm, he comes upon a couple of officers looking for him. He gets away by stealing their dog sled, but is later killed in an avalanche. Back to the cabin, Charlie and Larson, almost in near starvation, eventually make a meal out of a large bear. When the snow storm finally subsides, the two men go about their separate ways. Charlie comes to a mining town where he becomes infatuated with Georgia (Georgia Hale), a dance hall girl, causing jealousy from her suitor, Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite). As for Jim, he has forgotten where his gold claim is, and locates Charlie to help him find it, separating him from Georgia. The results that follow is classic Chaplin.Aside from a large list of supporting players, which consists of frequent Chaplin character actor Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis, \"The Gold Rush\" contains many now classic comedy supplements, including the starving Charlie cooking his boot in hot water, and using his shoelace as spaghetti; Charlie's encounter with Georgia; and the near end finale in which Charlie and Big Jim return to the cabin before setting out to find the claim, in which the cabin gets blown away during the blizzard that forces the cabin to be found the next morning halfway over the edge of a cliff which starts to tilt back and forth as the men make their slightest movement. There are tender moments, too, including Charlie awaiting for Georgia and her other friends to accompany him for New Year's Eve dinner, with tears flowing down his cheek when at the stroke of midnight realizes they are not coming. The most famous sequence of the entire movie is the one where Charlie falls asleep and dreams of himself entertaining his dinner guests by using two forks in two potato rolls as his feet and doing a dance for them.With THE GOLD RUSH being Chaplin's most revived and discussed movie, one must never forget his other artistic achievements that followed, including THE CIRCUS (1928), CITY LIGHTS (1931), MODERN TIMES (1936) and his talkie debut of THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940). Since the advent of home video in the early 1980s, THE GOLD RUSH consists of various editions and different music scores, ranging from the use of piano, organ or orchestra. There are even some editions that have no music track at all, along with some copies running different time lengths, and others eliminating the final closing segment set on the boat in which Charlie and Georgia walk on top of the deck to be interviewed and photographed by the press before the fadeout. The 1942 reissue, being a shorter print with Chaplin's narration, not only was presented occasionally on American Movie Classics, but can also be found on Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary video edition followed by a 1921 comedy short, PAY DAY. Video or DVD enthusiasts out there certainly will have a major choice to consider as to which copy to have in their collection. But in spite of numerous editions, THE GOLD RUSH is a golden treasure where it had been shown on American Movie Classics (1997-2001) and currently presented on Turner Classic Movies in either format of the shorter 1942 reissue or silent print with the William Perry piano score. While Chaplin is listed in the cast solely as The Lone Prospector, avid lip readers will notice that he is called \"Charlie\" by his supporting players, especially by Georgia. (****)",

            "review_title": "Possibly Chaplin's best film, certainly one of the greatest comedies of all time!",
            "content": "To see Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is to know enjoyment. One cannot help but enjoy a film as well-done as this! Chaplin said that this was the film for which he wanted to be remembered, and I can see why. It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal \"lady killer.\" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time! I will not lie, I am a fan of Charlie Chaplin's movies, but as objective as I can possibly be, this IS one of the great movies...Essential viewing!",

            "review_title": "Gold is the operative word here.",
            "content": "The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.  This movie should be counted among Chaplin's best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I've also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy's immortal geniuses.Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college's silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. \nEven so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven't even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that's also on the disc.The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.  And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they've seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.I don't say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It's hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.  For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin's first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema's potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle's aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp's grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.  When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.  The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn't sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film's third act. \nI don't want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I've seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. \nThe Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today's more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia's true feelings for the Tramp.But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.Rating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)",

If you have a chance with the DVD, see it in the 42 recut with no sound and subtitles.The one skit that works the best is the famous dancing rolls bit. You really must see three versions of this one after another. Look at the original. Then see the Robert Downey Jr version done in 1992, almost 70 years later. Notice how much more comic Downey's is because he uses a different timing and is both doing it and referencing the Chaplin dance. Then see the Johnny Depp version of the year later, which pokes fun at the Downey version and reannotates the original.

Oh, though filthy rich at that point, when in the end he falls practically in the girl's arms he is again dressed like a tramp - meaning, no doubt, he is still the same person - but where usually the hero sacrifices superficial, worldly pleasures for the deeper calling that fulfills the soul, here he gets both. There is not even the thought of a compromise.Yet I can't help but connect here with one specific aspect of Chaplin's cosmology; the mysterious, elusive fates - seemingly random, but slowly revealed to be guiding purpose - that govern life and toss it about through so many clashing rocks.Nowhere is this sketched more poignantly than in the famous cliffhanger scene. The tramp wakes in the same cabin he was earlier; familiar surroundings from inside, the reality thought to be known, understood, domesticated into order, but from outside we see how this reality hangs in precarious balance above the void. So, every step inside, taken casually, without much thought, is revealed from outside to have terrifying consequences that govern life and death. 'Blissful ignorance', the intertitle aptly describes the situation inside the cabin.It is a powerful cosmologic symbol, what in Eastern philosophy is understood as karma, fate flowing not from some lofty precipice of the gods above but from inside the house of everyday life. With both gold and love, impossible love with the dream girl, as the chimeras that trick the mind.So Chaplin is gifted enough to see the world as it manifests itself to us on some fundamental level, as in the dream sequence in The Kid where we see the devil tricking the soul from inside, but either cannot properly understand \u2013 and confuses karma for providential fate - or he does, is terrified, and chooses to soothe us instead with a fairy- tale.So however well-meant, it's a dishonest, patronizing vision of bliss. Once more these forces are finally shown to be the challenging, but eventually benevolent whims of providence. It's all made right again, more than right.Notice how well integrated is this notion inside the film, proof that all else aside Chaplin was a talented film mind; we are so closely made to identify with the point-of-view of the tramp, who is kept in blissful ignorance of the larger soul-defining mechanisms that shape his life, that we come out of the film from our position as viewers buying this fantasy as an important lesson.So instead of coming out of the film realizing that we should seize control of our own footsteps in life that keep our world in balance, or assume responsibility for when it trickles down the hill, just wait and it'll all work out in the end. It is a clever manipulation into blissful ignorance, with the filmmaker playing our strings the same way invisible fates play with the character inside the film.Sure, it is occasionally very funny, inventive. But we're talking here about the more intricate mechanisms that drive a film - and, film aspiring to be a truthful reflection of life, life itself.",

The king of silent films is attributed with making slapstick humor one of the stellar accomplishments in the entertainment business!! Slapstick comedy is predicated on a lot of physical humor, often times, slapstick is underrated in terms of the immense amount of talent it actually requires!! Lucille Ball got her start by emulating slapstick icons such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, and later, she instilled slapstick stunts in her renowned comedy series \"I Love Lucy\"... The film, \"Gold Rush\" is hilarious in it's exaggeration of calamity!! Charlie Chaplin is tremendous in engaging in a befuddled demeanor about his basic struggle for survival!! \"Gold Rush\" was listed by one movie critic's list as the best film ever!! Why do you suppose this is? I would say that it is mostly on account of the cunningly successful aspects of silliness that are incorporated in the making of this movie!! Another big reason would be the flippant approach slapstick artist Charlie Chaplin orchestrates when encountering one predicament after the other in this film!! These actions are so overdone that they are hysterically funny!! Charlie Chaplin executes all of the necessary acrobatics of chicanery very effectively!! In the case of \"Gold Rush\" Charlie Chaplin is so intense in his ludicrous actions, that he effortlessly makes \"Gold Rush\" a masterpiece!! Take into account that it is 1925, before the film goer was barraged with a bevy of special effects, and you, (being part of the movie audience) will recognize how well put together this movie really is!! The innocuous charisma of a Nicklelodian style film is often times mollified, and is discarded by many people as being cavalier in it's attempt to attain a recognizable prowess as far as being an assertively marvelous flick is concerned!! Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of the film \"Gold Rush\" This film is outstanding!! The licorice shoes were an added whimsical element to making \"Gold Rush\" funny as well!! I strongly recommend that you rent this movie and watch it!! This is without a doubt, an extremely top notch film!! It is not always rated #1 on every critic's list, but, it is always listed as one of the best movies ever made by virtually every movie expert!! The latest review list that AFI came out with \"Gold Rush\" was rated 58th out of the top 100 American films ever made!!",

There are even a few who like Monsieur Verdoux.  But to say this film is better than City Lights is definitely inviting controversy. As a statement on social mores and values City Lights is far more indicting.  As an important piece of film City Lights shows us many things that had never been done before and perhaps may never be done again on the big screen.  But as a sheer enjoyable romp in The Little Tramp's world City Lights falls short.  It is buried in social commentary whereas the Gold Rush has some social issues to deal with but nothing much new from previous works until the end where it neatly summarizes what \"Charlot\" has been all about all along. It is that ending which makes the Gold Rush the best of Chaplin's works and the one I will watch just for the sheer joy of seeing the artist in his prime. 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was mostly known for his terrific silent films he made in the 1920s which were hugely popular with audiences. The one he himself said he wanted to be remembered for was The Gold Rush. It's technically a comedy, but its plot is much more complicated than most others in the genre. This doesn't mean it's bad in any way, it's just not what I was expecting from a film where the primary focus is to make people laugh. The story in this is centered around Chaplin's character, who doesn't have an actual name. He's a prospector during the gold rush that took place in Alaska at the end of the 1800s, and he is trying to make a huge sum of money very quickly. A snowstorm arrives, and in the confusion, he ends up in a cabin occupied by Black Larsen, a criminal. Jim (Mack Swain) also shows up in the cabin, and the three men reluctantly agree to live together (for now). Later, the cabin's food supply starts to diminish, so Larsen is sent outside to look for food. A bear strays into the cabin and is killed by Jim and the prospector, providing them with meat. Meanwhile, Larsen, still outside in the blizzard, finds a gold deposit and decides to use it as bait to lure Jim close enough so he can kill him. Larsen attacks Jim with a shovel and is knocked out, and Larsen is later killed by an avalanche. When Jim eventually wakes up, he wanders into a town, but can't actually remember where his gold deposit is. The prospector also shows up at this town and meets a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale) at a dance hall, to whom he is instantly attracted. Georgia later goes to his house to eat dinner, but shortly after, Jim shows up to make the prospector guide him to the cabin. While Jim and the prospector are sleeping, a snowstorm blows half of the cabin precariously off a cliff, and it teeters back and forth dreadfully. Jim and the prospector manage to escape, and many months later, the prospector unexpededly encounters Georgia while on a boat back to America, and they're united again. Because this is (believe it or not) the 5th most profitable silent film ever, I had little doubt that it was going to be good. Not only that, but Chaplin is in it. Even almost a century later, there's an abundance of funny and fascinating things in this movie, such as when the cabin is about to fall off the cliff and they show the interior of it rotating. I wonder how they did that. There's also the scene where Jim is going insane with hunger and sees Chaplin's character as a giant chicken that he desperately wants to cook. I know it's a guy in a suit, but it's still funny. Films like this prove that physical comedy is something that will always be amusing, no matter how old it gets. I'm sure people many decades from now will still enjoy these timeless movies featuring one of the most iconic actors in history.",

            "review_title": "Peerless Chaplin masterpiece; comedic gold",
            "content": "After an unsuccessful attempt at melodrama in A Woman in Paris, a conscious attempt to break away from the silly and simplistic entertainment of his early cinematic career and say something important as a serious artist, Charlie Chaplin was forced to return to just the sort of crowd pleasing comedy he had just unsuccessfully made a bid to deviate from. The crucial difference was, despite his return to his defining genre, Chaplin had not abandoned his newfound sense of cinematic grandeur or determination to accomplish something more worthwhile than throwaway entertainment through film. This rekindled cinematic ambition, combined with inspiration from a series of slides detailing a vast march of Klondike gold prospectors and a gruesome account of an expedition leading to cannibalism, led to The Gold Rush, a picture just as grand, vast and engaging as any of the dramas Chaplin might have initially wanted to emulate. However, it is through Chaplin's commitment to mining the most humane and heart-warming of comedy out of the most unlikely sources that the film is firmly cemented as an abiding classic of the era. When recalled from a contemporary standpoint, the film is often remembered simply as a series of comic setpieces: Chaplin forced to scramble up the near vertical floor of a cabin teetering on the edge of a cliff, Chaplin cooking and eating a shoe to cope with famine, and the timeless dance of the dinner rolls endlessly referenced from sources as varied as 1993's Benny and Joon to the Simpsons. But what is often neglected is the sheer craftsmanship and incredibly dedication Chaplin invested in such sequences - the tension and sheer cinematic prowess demonstrated in the rocking cabin sequence alone are enough to still make it almost impossibly breathtaking and tense even when viewed over 80 years after the fact. Through such sequences, The Gold Rush demonstrates Chaplin's maturation as a filmmaker, from simply a skilled entertainer to a genuinely capable director capable of extracting not only laughs, but gasps of white knuckle fear, and unquenchable tears of fundamentally human pathos. As such, to reduce such a universally laudable film to a series of extended gags would not only be an understatement, but downright unreasonable, as the film pulses with vivid life, emotion and utter credibility, despite its exterior dressings as a simple silly comedy. Through reviving his immortal tramp figure, Chaplin gained a near peerless conduit for not only comedy but social criticism and satire, not only sending up the inhumane atrocities of Klondike prospecting life, but of class struggles and the adherence to them preventing proper human interaction. When the tramp enters a mining town, he is scarcely given any more reprieve than in the winter harshness of the mountain prospecting, so beset is he by the scorn and derision of the upper class villagers, adding conflict to a potentially budding romance and adding an ironic tinge to an otherwise saccharine ending. The film also excels technically to an extent Chaplin had previously not achieved, with subtle but deceptively inventive camera-work perfectly complimenting the flavour of the scene, whether creating a bold, sweeping statement through the iconic long shot of a weary train of prospectors traversing a mountainside, or with tender close-ups extracting every inch of emotion from Chaplin's quivering face. Far from a simple string of gags, The Gold Rush makes its mark as an unassuming cinematic masterpiece, both technically and in terms of emotional storytelling.It goes without saying that Chaplin's skills as a performer only continued to improve with each film, and The Gold Rush is no exception. Demonstrating not only his astonishing physical prowess and ability to meticulously undertake precarious stunts and comic gags, Chaplin also showcases an almost unprecedented sentimental side, with his beloved tramp figure proving an utterly irresistible underdog hero who, when beset by adversity, cannot help but genuinely capture the viewer's heart. Chaplin is also gifted with a highly talented supporting cast to play off of, including the admirably ferocious Mack Swain as a brutish fellow prospector and Georgia Hale, noteworthy for being a laudably ambiguous love interest rather than the one dimensional beauties often showcased in Chaplin's films.Arguably one of the strongest cinematic works produced during the silent era, The Gold Rush is more likely to evoke refreshingly genuine raucous laughter, heartfelt tears and finally leave the viewer with an unquenchable beaming smile on their face than almost any film made before or since. Chaplin's opus is a masterpiece of emotional storytelling on an impressively grand scale as well as a comedic classic, easily meriting the director/star's declaration of it being the singular film out of his entire body of work he would most like to be remembered by. -10/10",

            "content": "I never actually sat down to watch a silent movie from start to finish until earlier this year. Right now, I still haven't seen too many, but recently, for the first full-length silent comedy to see, I chose \"The Gold Rush\", a film written, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, a highly renowned filmmaker of his time, as I was aware of this movie's wide appeal, as well as the wide appeal of much of Chaplin's other work. I wasn't as impressed with it as much as many others have been, but all in all, it was a good experience.Set in the year 1898, during the gold rush of the time (hence the title of the film), Chaplin stars as a silly prospector, one of the many who have bravely come up to face the harsh weather conditions of Alaska, in search for gold! After struggling through a blizzard, he comes across a cabin. From there, much lies ahead for him. He experiences being marooned in the cabin with a fellow prospector named Big Jim McKay, both of them without food, and also falls in love with a woman he meets in Alaska named Georgia, and attempts to win her heart!\"The Gold Rush\" definitely has some very funny and memorable gags. The two isolated prospectors eating a boiled boot, due to the fact they have no real food to eat, is definitely one of them. Gagwise, there are many more highlights in the film. The humour is very visual, with a lot of slapstick, which I usually like, and here is no exception. For the most part during the film, if I wasn't laughing, I think I was usually smiling. This 1925 Chaplin film also has some serious scenes, which works fairly well, and social commentary. I guess there's not much I'm saying, if anything, that hasn't already been said about \"The Gold Rush\". Yes, it was made over eighty years ago, but has aged well.",

The story is simple, but really well-done, fast-paced and involving, while the direction is very fine. The performances are first-rate, Georgia Hale is beautiful and contemptuous but it is Chaplin's performance that holds The Gold Rush together. But I cannot not mention the comedy, there are so many wonderful moments that are well and truly hysterical including the opening sequence, the dance of the bread rolls, Chaplin and his companion hallucinating(the companion hallucinating that Chaplin is a very edible chicken), the way Chaplin ate the shoe leather, Chaplin dancing with the dog tied to his belt and the final scene in the cabin on the cliff.Overall, a golden treasure from a comedy genius. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Chaplin always has been great putting effective emotions in a purely comical movie. You always feel and sympathize for his little tramp character.Interestingly enough Charles Chaplin himself in the '40's revived the movie with the addition of spoken dialog-, done by himself and sound. It's not always necessary, since the images themselves speak for their own but it's still interesting to experience because it makes clear what he himself initially always wanted us to see and hear.It's a real Charlie Chaplin movie, also not in the least because he directed, wrote, composed, produced and edited but I mean especially of course his acting. His movements are particularly great but so are his overall comical acting skills. Not hard to see why he's regarded by many as the great movie comedian/entertainer of all time.The story is a sweet one and it perfectly gives Chaplin the opportunity to show of his skills. Though admittedly I didn't like the first halve of the movie as much as the second. Somehow this always seems to be the case with silent comedies. The two parts also don't feel really jointed.

The chicken illusion scene must have been very original and technologically advanced for its time.One disappointment, however. I saw the 1942 revised version of the movie, wherein Chaplin replaced the written dialogue with narration and added a more in-sync score. No issues with the score, but the narration spoils the movie, to an extent. The great thing about silent movies is figuring out the jokes and plot just by the visual medium. With the narration, it feels like you are spoon-fed the jokes and plot, and makes the whole movie feel dumbed-down.I haven't seen the 1925 version but I imagine I would enjoy that more.",

What is it exactly that's so sad about Chaplin, given the fact that he's always doing something zany and laugh out loud funny? It's that he always seems to be an outsider; he never quite fits in. There's always someone bigger, stronger, richer, better looking than him. And I think that's what movie audiences responded to during his hey-day and what they're still responding to now.Perhaps no other scene in a Chaplin film (at least of the ones I've seen) captures this feeling more than the one in \"The Gold Rush\" where Chaplin has gone to a great deal of effort to prepare a New Year's dinner and is stood up by his date, spending his New Year's alone. This scene is almost unbearably sad, so thank God it's surrounded by scene after scene that will have you giggling. This is the movie with the famous \"dancing potatoes\" scene, and wait till you see Chaplin eat his boot for dinner, slurping up his shoelace like it's a spaghetti noodle.I strongly recommend Chaplin films to anyone who is moderately interested in early cinema but is turned off by the idea of silent pictures. He's so expressive and so fun to watch that I guarantee you you'll forget that you're watching a silent film. Even after movies went to sound, Chaplin continued to make virtually silent pictures, and you don't even feel the absence.Grade: A",

            "content": "Seeking his fortune, a lone prospector heads out to the Klondike to get gold. What he finds there at first is little more than snow and the very high chance of an early death. However having survived a cabin without any food, he makes his way into town where he finds that not all wealth comes in the form of money or commodities for sale.I have negative comments to make on this film but I'll hold back on them because they will hopefully not apply if you follow my advice. I recorded The Gold Rush off a movie channel doing a season of classic Chaplin because I felt I had not seen enough of his work to really be able to form an opinion. Unfortunately for me what I saw was not the original release of the film but rather the 1940's re-release \u0096 but I'll come back to this later because I'll try not to hold this against it because in its original form the film is a very pleasing and enjoyable comedy which has funny highs in among a plot that manages to be much more than just a collection of sketches.For my money it does not contain sufficient highs to make it consistent but in it we have some classic routines that most people will have seen (or been aware of) before seeing the film itself. Outside of these the material is consistently amusing if not hilarious and the total narrative arch (for indeed there is one) is reasonable enough as a story to provide a frame. So why do I have a problem with it then? It has many classic moments, plenty of laughs and all within a good delivery but yet watching it at times was grating.The reason for this was my misfortune to be watching the reissue and not the original. In the reissue (made in the time of talkies) all the dialogue cards have been removed and instead the film plays with a running narration provided by Chaplin himself. It sounds bad but this dos not do justice to hold annoying it is. If you have ever accidentally used the audio subtitles for blind viewers (where everything is described) then you'll know how bad it is. To put it another way bear in mind that for Blade Runner, the reissue stripped away the spoon-feeding narration in the same way as The Gold Rush added it! Overall then this is a really enjoyable Chaplin feature length film but I'm implore you to make sure that you get the original version and not the narrated reissue. The former deserves its praise but the reissue is a totally misjudged polish of something that was already perfect on its own and the addition of sound takes away so much while adding almost nothing.",

            "content": "In Charles Chaplin's 1925 film, \"The Gold Rush\", a lone prospector travels to California looking for gold, and entwines himself in adventures and finds Georgia, the woman of his dreams. After many hardships, including a relocating cabin, the lone prospector, played by Charles Chaplin, finds gold and becomes rich, ending in success and unity with Georgia. The time period in which this movie was shot, compared with the technological innovation and the state of the art filming techniques, give this film an undoubted masterpiece feel. The use of up-close shots combined with comedic imagery also brought a new feel to the style of silent cinema. The scene with the cabin shifting, and the camera tilting to reflect the inner cabin, was one of the many stylistic filming techniques that gave \"The Gold Rush\" such artistic and ingenious appeal. Chaplin's ideas and his vision that he brought to life in the movie \"The Gold Rush\" make it a great landmark in the beginning of silent films and in film history. The intricate but simple story of \"The Gold Rush\" brought about many distinct feelings when viewing. It gives feelings of happiness, during scenes where there is comedic relief and slapstick comedy, and also can bring about sadness or pity for the lone prospector when he waits for Georgia on New Year's but she never shows up. It reveals how silent films can become in touch with a person's feelings, making them feel for the protagonist, without having to have dialogue to explain the gestures and plot. These aspects of \"The Gold Rush\" make it a milestone in the film industry of the modern world.",

That Chaplin could take such a morbid topic and spin it into hilarious comedy is a testament to his skill, particularly as a performer -- the moments where he is imagined as a giant chicken or eats his boot and shoelaces as if they were veal cutlets are still astonishingly fresh.  Other set pieces, like the teetering cabin and the dancing dinner rolls, still delight audiences and continue to cement The Gold Rush's legacy.",

            "content": "NOTE: The version of Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush that is being reviewed is the full-length, uncut ninety-six minute version released in 1925, as opposed to the seventy minute cut released in 1942 with updated narration, music, and several story cuts.Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush opens with the mesmerizing shot of hundreds of people walking along the mercilessly snowy Chilkoot Pass in search of gold, rumored to be existing by the limitless amount in California. We then cut to our lead character, nicknamed \"The Lone Prospector,\" (or \"The Tramp\") played by Chaplin himself, who is dapper, determined, but lonely as he attempts to hike towards riches in California from his homestate of Alaska. Along the way, trouble ensues from fellow gold-seekers, love blossoms with a local saloon girl (Georgia Hale), who may not feel as strongly as the prospector does, and many classic silent-era magic is created.Chaplin, who directed, wrote, produced, edited, and starred in this film said this would be his opus; the film he wanted to be remembered for and it would appear he got his wish. This is one of the quintessential Chaplin films, and it also serves as the first one I've ever seen. There is a delicate approach to the material, and even at the original ninety-six minutes, it's pretty short considering all the macro-material that was crammed into this film. Love, tragedy, persistency, determination, and finally, something resembling success.One of the things I've heard from Chaplin enthusiasts is that it's difficult to analyze his films as a whole; \"you're best bet is to take the funny scenes and go into what makes them funny\" said one of my closest friends, so I think I'll do that. Take for example, the iconic scene where Chaplin and his pal feast on his own shoe and laces. The scene was so spontaneous, unexpected, and downright absurd that it seemed the only proper thing to do was laugh at it all. Another scene would be the dance of the dinner rolls, where Chaplin takes two of his forks, stabs two dinner rolls, and allows them to sashay on the table at his control. It's the act and the approach that make these scenes funny. The question is simply 'why?' and if there were ever to be two perfect examples of functioning slapstick, these two would be it, not just for their absurdity, but their ability to stand alone as two great comic scenes.It's also apparent that this is a film that can merge slapstick and sentimentality to a functioning, non-manipulative formula that doesn't come crashing down on the audience. There's genuine emotion in this story; true feelings that come out and realism when the prospector realizes his love may be doomed, which is even sadder than not striking any gold. The way this part of the story is handled is sublime and commendable, fore it knows when to abandon slapstick in favor of a more serious approach.And who can forget the end, where the prospector and Big Jim, a fellow gold-seeker (Mack Swain) are trapped in the isolated cabin amidst high winds and merciless blizzard conditions that are sending the shack right off a cliff. This is one of the several scenes of the silent era in cinema that should be treasured and awed for its terrific effects work and brilliant execution. To be fair, the whole film should as well. It holds up, in its eighty-eight year, where all the jokes are still relevant, the only thing that has become dated is the style, and Chaplin's tour-de-force performance still shines if anything. How many films made today can you say that about in one hundred years? Starring: Charlie Chaplin, Mack Swain, and Georgia Hale. Directed by: Charlie Chaplin.",

Never is it more effective than in this film because they really did have a cabin hanging over a cliff. A lot of later films created the effect, but they had to do the real thing here because special effects were not created fully in 1925.In fact, a lot of great comedy films of the silent 1920's are excellent for just this reason, & this one is no exception. The dream sequences with Charlie & Mack Swain in the cabin show imagination. This is the kind of stuff that is timelessly funny.

Eating the shoe, or getting out of the tilting house? Sheer brilliance, even eighty years later. I laughed out loud and often.There is also that key ingredient to every great film (it seems), a romance, and a funny surprise twist to the plot in the last ten minutes or so. Chaplin the tramp rises above, and yet ends, by slight of hand, as the tramp, or as a rich sophisticated man pretending to be the tramp. Which is what he was.The plot has its slow points, and overly sentimental aspects (including the romance), and it is sometimes bordering on slapstick silly rather than elegantly physical and inventively funny.

He's the main actor, he stars brilliantly, he directs, he writes the script, he's a stage animal, he even orchestrates the music! A complete, multifaceted, brilliant artist, who in this film shows us all his strength and talent. Mack Swain, Georgia Hale and Tom Murray also looked very good to me, but they never quite match Chaplin's mastery, which seems to be a general rule of all films where he participated as an actor.Being a silent film, music is a dominant element throughout the film, whether through specific songs, either through incidental music or leitmotives. Everything sounds wonderfully well and matches harmoniously with what we see on the screen. The film intelligently bets on body language in combination with written lines and dialogues. The sets and costumes, as well as the contrast, the light, everything was meticulously done and helps to make this film a pearl, full of international historical and cultural value.",

The first half of the movie reunites Chaplin, another lonesome gold seeker, and a moral-less scoundrel in a shelter, under a particularly horrendous snowstorm. There happens one of the most memorable scene of the movie: Big Jim's delusion that Chaplin's is a giant (of course bearing Chaplin's manners) chicken, and his desperate attempts to eat him; but Chaplin is saved by a bear showing up which they finally eat. Then, parting their ways, begins the second half of the movie: the one-sided romance with the beautiful Georgia, met in a dance hall. How funny was the scene when she invited out of despair our little fellow to dance to avoid dancing with an invading Jake! How genius showed Chaplin to use Tchaykovsky's...Beauy & the Beast's waltz!

Proclaimed by Chaplin as the film by which he most wanted to be remembered, 'The Gold Rush' has gone onto much acclaim, but those expecting the charm of 'City Lights' and imaginative sets and situations of 'Modern Times' may be disappointed. To be fair, 'The Gold Rush' starts off quite well with lots of humorous situations at the outskirts cabin, including imagined chickens, persons blown in and out of doorways and a hilarious sequence in which Chaplin keeps trying to dodge a gun barrel during a fight, only to find the gun pointed in his face wherever he goes. Around a third of the way in though, Chaplin leaves the cabin and what follows is far less innovative as he becomes the subject of tricks and falls in love upon returning to town. There are some funny town sequences for sure (dancing with a dog leash) and there is a great bit involving a tilting cabin near the end, but the final two thirds of the film never recapture the magic of the first third. With so many jokes and ideas that have since been imitated (bread roll forks), this is an undeniably iconic comedy, but those keen on seeing Chaplin at his finest may wish to look elsewhere.",

DEATHS: H. Rider Haggard, Thomas R. Marshall.KEVIN: We now come to our second Charlie Chaplin film and quite possibly his seminal masterpiece, 1925's The Gold Rush. This movie is wonderful. I laughed really hard right from the beginning. I love the opening where the Tramp first walks on screen, still with his hat and shoes and cane even though there's snow everywhere and he really looks out of his element. I think my favorite comedic beat in the film was the scene where the cabin is teetering over the edge of the cliff. That scene is even better in the 1941 version due to the added tension of sound effects. Another great thing in this movie for me was the irresistible Georgia Hale. Every moment she's on screen everything just lights up. I hear Chaplin was quite the control freak with his films, and I'm sure even he must have been mesmerized with what she did.DOUG: In June 1925, after nearly two years of production, Charles Chaplin finally releases the film for which he is best remembered, and with good reason: The Gold Rush is not just a great comedy, but a great film. And not just because it contains some of Chaplin's best remembered scenes. The gourmet shoe-eating scene is wonderful, the way he is determined to enjoy every bit of the shoe, sucking on the nails like bones, twisting the shoe laces like spaghetti. The scene with the house teetering on the edge of the cliff is one of the greatest sustained comedy scenes ever put on film. And everyone loves when starving Big Jim hallucinates the Tramp as a giant chicken. But there's something more here. Chaplin isn't just interested in telling jokes, but there's a rather poignant story happening here in the romance between the Tramp and Georgia. The scene where he imagines Georgia and her friends enjoying his New Year's Eve party is especially poignant, as he performs the 'Oceana Roll' with a pair of rolls on forks. Interesting this is Chaplin's only silent comedy that he filmed with a complete story ready before filming; interesting too that Chaplin chose this film to redo with new sound and narration in 1942. When you watch the later version, it is cool to realize that it's really Chaplin's voice you're hearing. There were a few noticeable alterations in the two versions, one being that instead of the Tramp reading a note from Georgia that he thinks is for him, he really receives a (different) note from Georgia to him. I prefer the later version of that scene, but I prefer the ending of the earlier version where they kiss; the revised version seems to end rather abruptly.Last film: Strike (1925). Next film: Phantom of the Opera (1925).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time.

In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.",

            "content": "\"We must get food. One of us must brave that storm.\"The film that Chaplin wanted to be remembered for, The Gold Rush, is his most ambitious and adventurous one. Chaplin takes center stage once again and takes us to the snowy mountains of Alaska. Under extremely harsh conditions the tramp struggles to survive, but he always faces life with his innocent naivety and cheerfulness. The Gold Rush is a simple rags to riches story, but somehow the tramp doesn't let his social condition define who he is. He remains the same quirky character no matter the circumstances he faces. In the midst of all the hilarious moments, Chaplin always manages to send an uplifting message to his audience. He reminds us that no matter how difficult the circumstances we are going through are, if we continue to move forward something good is going to come out of it. The Gold Rush might not be his most critically acclaimed film, but it does have some of his most memorable scenes. Without ever having seen this movie I had already seen several clips like the scene where the tramp is preparing a roasted shoe or the scene in which his friend is starving so much that he imagines the tramp as a chicken and chases him. The scenes that take place in the cabin are all hilarious and have inspired many famous cartoon scenes as well. However his most famous and beloved scene involved the dancing rolls which was played over and over again in the theaters were it was played. Perhaps Chaplin is remembered for his work in Modern Times or City Lights, but the scenes in The Gold Rush have passed the test of time and captivated audiences around the world. The good thing about silent films is that they are universally accepted because actions don't need translations.The Gold Rush takes place in gorgeous Alaska during 1898 as thousands of prospectors faced the harsh conditions in order to find gold and become millionaires. The tramp, who is known in this film as the lone prospector (Charles Chaplin), also heads to Alaska on his own dreaming of becoming wealthy man. After a severe storm hits his area, the tramp locates a small cabin and finds refugee there. But the cabin isn't abandoned, a thief known as Black Larsen (Tom Murray) is hiding there. Before Black Larsen can kick him out of the cabin another large prospector arrives. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) uses his size to intimidate Black Larsen and convinces him to allow the three men to stay there until the storm passes. As the days pass the men begin to starve so they decide one of them must face the storm and bring back food. The unlucky fellow isn't the tramp this time as Black Larsen is the chosen one. After a few days the storm passes and the lone prospector decides to head to the nearest gold-rush community where he falls in love with a saloon girl known as Georgia (Georgia Hale) and tries to win her heart.The best moments of The Gold Rush involve the lone prospector's adventures in the cabin and his misunderstandings with the other large prospectors. The love story however was the weakest link as the girl here really doesn't do anything to deserve the tramp's love. She isn't really likable so I can see how critics at the time were unsatisfied by the ending of this film. The Gold Rush could've been his most critically acclaimed film if it had an ending like City Lights. I think that film gets more recognition because Chaplin learned his lesson and ended that film on a perfect note. There is no discussion however that most of the famous Chaplin scenes come from The Gold Rush. This was Chaplin's longest and most produced film at the time and he succeeds again in blending slapstick with pathos effortlessly. The Gold Rush is a fun adventure with several highlights, but I think a shorter running time for silent films works better. Chaplin still never ceases to lose his charm and his character of the tramp never gets old. I also love the score in all his films, they are just inspiring and uplifting. After watching his third feature film, I must agree that his films are timeless and universal.",

            "content": "Sandwiched in between the failure of his non-comedy A Woman of Paris and his final days as a silent star in which he was up against the coming of sound, Charlie Chaplin made his most stupendous and expensive film to date, aptly named The Gold Rush. It became the work of which he was most proud, and the one he wanted to be best remembered for in years to come.But for all its grandiosity, the stuff The Gold Rush is made of is the purist Chaplin simplicity. We open, as we so often did in his short pictures, with the formal establishment of the film's setting, in this case an icy mountain range at the height of the Klondike frenzy, a world into which toddles the little tramp. His entrance here is funny purely because of the absurdness of his being here, and his utter inappropriateness for this environment, still kitted out in his familiar bowler hat and baggy trousers. And from here on the majority of the gags tend to be around such ridiculous juxtapositions, such as Charlie's nonchalant carving up of a boot for Thanksgiving dinner. This by the way is the biggest difference between Chaplin and his closest rival Buster Keaton. Keaton's gags involve meticulous planning and amuse you with their sheer cleverness. Chaplin's humour mostly comes from basic ideas, but the comedy is all in the way he plays them out. Chaplin's partnership with Keystone veteran Mack Swain is particularly effective. Swain looks faintly ridiculous with his burly build and babyish face, but he is never funny in his own right and thus holds up his corner of the comedy without ever upstaging the star.The other thing that sets Chaplin apart from his peers is his balancing of comedy with poignant drama, and The Gold Rush is a particularly sweet example of this. Again, we begin with an entrance, this time a more serious one for female lead Georgia Hale. Chaplin shows her coming out of a photographer's, cleverly framing her with some homely portraits down the left-hand side of the screen. Although it's not yet clear to us what part she will play in the story, this linking of her with something that stands out from all the logs and snow makes her stick in our minds. Chaplin's first meeting with her in the dance hall is masterwork of dramatic direction, with Charlie keeping himself an isolated figure at one side of the screen, but constantly pulling our attention to him with little gestures. And never before has the dramatic story in a Chaplin picture been so realistic. The \"ladies' man\" Jack (played by the little-known Malcolm Waite) looks and acts like a genuine bully, a far cry from the pompous buffoons Charlie was normally up against, and the whole situation with him and Georgia seems entirely credible. Georgia Hale's steady-paced acting focuses us on her emotions, as does that of Chaplin himself.Considering this was Chaplin's personal favourite \u2013 and it is indeed one of his best \u2013 it is odd to learn that the biggest enemy The Gold Rush was to have in later years was, erm, Charlie Chaplin. In 1943 the comic re-cut his movie to suit what he assumed to be \"modern tastes\". The result is a bizarre travesty. He replaces the intertitles with voice-over narration, which is far more distracting and superfluous than even the wordiest of title texts. Worse still he shortens or cuts out many of the scenes which develop that wonderfully tentative love story between Charlie and Georgia, dragging it down to the level of a crass and gratuitous subplot.

A feat that's quite elaborate and full of effort for the time. Like all Cjaplin movies, The Gold Rush depicts his signature character The Tramp, although here he was named the Lone Prospector. I like how the movie depicts the poor man rising up to betterment of his life, an image that many can relate at the time. Chaplin's story telling also comes out as he did all the narratives himself in this movie. The other cast did quite okay here. Georgia Hall nicely complete the angles for this movie.",

            "content": "When Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush was initially released in 1925, the director exclaimed, \"This is the film I want to be remembered for!\" Well Mr. Chaplin, we definitely remember you for this film. Even though he made many excellent films after this film's release, pundits consider this his greatest achievement. I was enamored with the film myself. For a silent film, it had a character-driven narrative and did not solely rely upon Chaplin's familiar humor, which remains excellent as always.There are two versions that the public is aware about; the 1925 silent version and a version edited by Chaplin in 1942 made for the audience that has grown accustomed to sound. He added a score and he made tweaks including changing the ending. Personally, I think the original version is the best because I really do adore the ending. Apparently, the ending was shot in terms of how Chaplin's love life was at the time. Both versions are incredible, but my preferable version was released in 1925.Chaplin, who also wrote the script, attempted to shoot the film on location in California. He eventually had to abandon those plans and shot the film on the studio's backlot. This movie features some well known comedy acts that you always hear about especially if you're taking a film class. We have the boot-eating scene, the roll dance, and the cabin in the storm sequence. These scenes were shot very well. Because of Chaplin's famous obsessive-compulsive disorder, it took more than 60 takes to shoot the shoe-eating segment. Yes, Chaplin wanted perfection and he often got it! This film happened to be the most expensive and longest comedy film at the time. 95 minutes does not sound much, but it was definitely new for those folks. Fortunately, the film became a box-office smash and is one of the silent film's most profitable pictures.The Little Tramp, or the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) is on his way to the Klondike to search for some gold. Conditions are brutal and there is little in the way of food or gold. He goes to the cabin where he meets Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen (who is wanted by the authorities). With no food available, Thanksgiving dinner consists only of a boot. When the Little Tramp finally reaches town, he meets Georgia (Georgia Hale). He falls in love with her, but he seems to have some competition for her heart. Can the Tramp strike it rich and win over Georgia's heart?Chaplin is Chaplin and he does his thing very well. Watching his performance, one can easily see why he is one of the best comedians and performers to grace this planet. No words express his comedic genius here. It's all about body movement and facial expressions that make us laugh. In today's age, that is beyond impressive. I was laughing and smiling throughout. That is how amazing Chaplin is. As for the supporting performances, they are excellent. Georgia Hale, who admired Chaplin for an incredibly long time, gives Chaplin an excellent female pairing.Let's say you have never seen a Chaplin film and you wanted a recommendation. I would not hesitate to allow myself to choose this film. It's funny and features all the legendary comedy Chaplin would be famous for. That said, it has a character-driven narrative that is dramatic and emotional, and Chaplin pulls it off very well. The Gold Rush is Chaplin at his best and it is not hard to see why you can call this a classic.My Grade: A",

            "content": "After his box office failure with A Woman Of Paris, Chaplin edited, wrote, produced, and directed The Gold Rush, which spent almost a year and a half in production. Chaplin did an about face from his previous film with The Gold Rush, realizing the public would not accept serious drama with his name attached to it. Instead, he returned to the little tramp character and his tried and true formula of an everyman at odds with the world around him. Although, in this film he seamlessly combines comedy and drama, as he did in The Kid. It was his first film with a prepared script before shooting began. As with The Kid, it was also another film beset with personal turmoil. Lita Grey, who eventually became Chaplin's second wife, became pregnant after being selected as the female lead in the film. As a result, Georgia Hale, Grey's friend at the time, was selected instead. Filming was delayed considerably, but the film was finally released in the summer of 1925 to instant fanfare. Chaplin plays a lone prospector who meets up at a cabin with Mack Swain, another prospector in the Alaskan Klondike looking for gold. Together they hoodwink escaped convict Black Larsen into looking for help during a snowstorm. This sets the stage for an avalanche of sight gags. From the boiled shoe, to the chicken hallucination, to the bear fight, the audience doesn't know what's coming next. Eventually Chaplin and Swain part ways at the cabin but cross paths again in the neighboring town where Chaplin takes a fancy to Georgia Hale, one of the dance hall girls. Initially she feigns interest and toys with Chaplin to make someone else jealous. Chaplin is taken as usual and is made a fool of soon afterward. Chaplin assists the now forgetful Swain back to Swain's claim in order to strike it rich with him, providing the precursor to one of the most famous comic set pieces in film history: The cabin blown to the precipice of a cliff. The climax is reminiscent of Buster Keaton's rescue of Natalie Talmadge in Our Hospitality only two years before. The film has great editing and pacing and holds up well after all these years. This film is the one where Chaplin does the fork dance with rolls, imitated many times since. Chaplin regular Henry Bergman has a brief role as Hank Curtis, and he also resembles a character aboard ship at the end. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

            "content": "It's all about the pioneers. Charlie Chaplin had already been a seasoned veteran by the time he got to this film and it was only 1925. Motion Pictures were only 30 years old by this point in time. His body of work had already filled up a decade before this (and that isn't including any theater work he did before the films) and he was well on his way as being a film pioneer, visionary and an icon.None of this is more evident than in this film, because you see him accomplish acts and scenes that were repeated and copied by everyone who came after him. The Gold Rush (1925), is probably his most famous film (or at least the most popular, mostly because of its wide release in the cheap home video market over the last 40 years. (It is considered public domain) and that is probably what Charlie would have wanted.Charlie gets involved with the Gold Rush of 1848 and as you might expect it, he runs into some bad guys and eventually gets involved with a love interest, all, during crazy snow storms and chaos in the Yukon. He manages to deal with these pressures on his preordained, slap-stick, kind-of-a-life, by dealing with it, like he always does.Seeing him deliver some of his acrobatic stunts is amazing to see. He also manages to dish out the laughs and it is a treasure to see. He does things that would never be attempted today, mostly because of sensitive actors and paranoid, over-insured production companies. It makes you feel comfortable knowing that even though his safety was in jeopardy, the trade-off is, seeing a master-craftsman at work. See the Gold Rush (1925). It is so important.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin reaches perfection",
            "content": "In the early years of cinema, actor and director Charlie Chaplin rose up to become one of the most important artists of his time, however, his attempt to make a serious drama in \"A Woman in Paris\" lead to his first major failure. But two years after that, Chaplin was still at the top of his game, and he decided to go back to what he liked the most and delivered a movie that would take his trademark style of pantomime to a new level. A film that would not only surpass the critical and commercial success he had with the Little Tramp's previous feature film, \"The Kid\", but would also become one of the most important silent films in history, and the highest grossing silent comedy film: \"The Gold Rush\".The film is the story of the Little Tramp (Chaplin) as a lone prospector during the Klondike Gold Rush. Hoping to find gold in the harsh territories of Alaska, the Tramp finds himself in many different adventures, where he'll face the danger of the mountain, the harsh winter and the pains of hunger in his quest for gold. However, the trip will also take him to meet several friendly, and not so friendly characters; such as fellow prospector Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) and outlaw Black Larsen (Tom Murray), as well as the beautiful Georgia (Georgia Hale).Inspired by the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin found in the hazardous quest for gold a theme for his perfect mixture of comedy and drama. At first sight, \"The Gold Rush\" may seem as just another of the Tramp's adventures, but this film goes beyond the slapstick and presents a testament of Chaplin's ideology about life: that there is no laugh without a tear, and that tragedy and comedy walk the very same path. \"The Gold Rush\"'s plot is presented as a series of \"episodes\" in the Tramp's trip, sometimes more comedy than melodrama, sometimes the opposite, but always walking the fine line between both, making the film a unique comedy that never becomes tiresome nor boring.Chaplin allows himself some daring experimentation in \"The Gold Rush\" unseen in \"The Kid\", and that would lead to his avant-garde \"Modern Times\" in the future. With inventive special effects and his masterful use of pantomime he crafted unforgettable scenes of a force so powerful, that are now deeply rooted in our culture. His talent as director, polished in the many shorts he directed in his early career, is completely developed and balancing comedy and drama he moves from one to the other in a smooth fashion that lacks the manipulative sappiness of \"The Kid\".As always, Charlie Chaplin is superb in a character that he has now mastered. The Little Tramp may have started as a collection of mannerism, but now he has a personality of his own, and as a Lone Prospector, he seems to represent us, in our naive trip through the perils of life, on the search of something that may be what we want, but may not be what we need. Along Chaplin, the supporting cast is quite effective, and also have very developed personalities. Regular collaborator Mack Swain has a lot of funny scenes as Big Jim McKay, proving that Chaplin is not the only star of the show. Tom Murray delivers a sinister performance as Black Larsen and Malcolm Waite is simply perfect as the womanizer Jack Cameron.\"The Gold Rush\" is probably the perfect silent comedy, in the sense that it was aware of its limitations and played with them in a cheerful way. Like other classics of the silent era, its use of image to tell the story is simply breathtaking, and one can imagine the sounds with only watching the film. This characteristic is what makes me think that the sound version (edited by Chaplin in 1942) is not only inferior, but a serious damage to the film. While Chaplin's intentions were definitely good, \"The Gold Rush\" is a film that works better in silent form, without the need of anyone narrating or explaining it because it explains itself on its own.Charlie Chaplin was an artist that really knew his craft (his preference for silent comedy shows this), and had a perfect understanding of human nature. Having lived in poverty in his young years, he knew better than anybody the value of a laugh in the harsher times, so probably he was the only one able to made a film like \"The Gold Rush\", the film that took Chaplin's comedy to the highest levels. 10/10",

The Little Tramp finds himself in the Yukon, braving the wintery elements, bears, and a psychopath, all for the sake of claiming his own fortune of gold. Under his expert direction, Chaplin guides THE GOLD RUSH with painstaking detail of what life would be like to live in the freezing extremes, having to shack up in a  cabin in danger of toppling over a snow-capped cliff, and feasting on shoes for protein. Amidst all the atrocities, Chaplin, being that likeable underdog that everybody roots for and loves, overcomes the odds, managing to make the best out of a bad (read: terrible) situation. He even takes the time to humor himself, and a few ladies, with a song-and-dance number involving two forks and a pair of potatoes.",

Some of them are famous: a starving Chaplin cooking an old shoe to provide dinner for him and his mate; Chaplin doing the fantastic dance of the Oceana rolls. They're extremely funny too. I particularly enjoy Chaplin's winsome expression as the two rolls do ballet steps en pointe.But much of the comedy is less elegant than that -- if making two rolls with forks stuck in them do a can can may be called elegant. The part I find funniest is the tipping cabin, which I won't bother to explain. And Chaplin looking and acting exactly like a huge chicken to his famished room mate, head bobbing, wings flapping. There's also the scene of two bearish men struggling over a shotgun, with the barrel waving this way and that, but unerringly following Chaplin wherever he tries to hide.His later work would introduce more sentimentality and social comment, but even here a great distinction is made between the rich and the poor. Well, that doesn't quite capture the opposition. It's between the extremely rich and the starving poor. Charlie doesn't change much in the course of the story, except that he becomes an emblem of the Gilded Age. Wealth brings happiness. Chaplin should know.It's really a classic of its kind, perhaps the funniest and most inventive silent comedy made. At the time it was made, it was recent history, too. The Klondike gold rush was only 27 years in the past. You can take the same route that the aspiring miners did, on a rickety narrow-gauge train, from Skagway to Dawson. I did it once and was left marveling that anyone, in the middle of winter, could possible get past places with names like Lake Bennett and Dead Horse Gulch. It's a wonder that Criterion or someone hasn't made a good DVD out of it. The print I saw was lousy.",

I had to keep searching and fighting with each other, but also to fight against the bad weather and snow mountains at any time. Being accidentally besieged in the snow mountain hut, and competing with the big bear for food, the plot of one door in one door was arranged by Chaplin very interesting. When there was no food to eat, Chaplin began to think of leather shoes, eating leather shoe laces as noodles, untiring leather shoes and nailing them to eat noodle cakes, eating with relish. Finally, the snow stopped, Chaplin came down the mountain to find food, but found the girl who was happy, but had no money, and had to eat some food to continue to go up the mountain to make gold, and had such a sweet dream. It happened to meet the kind owner, who had sufficient supplies, and went far away to trust him to keep his butler, and just saw the girl who came down the mountain. Chaplin even had the illusion of love, no matter whether the girls were just jokes, at Christmas On the night of the festival, a simple but generous dinner is arranged. Simple is for girls, and rich is for gold prospectors. So there is a classic scene, Chaplin hasn't waited for the beloved, he is looking for fun to pass the boredom. He used two forks to fork a piece of bread, such as human legs and feet, jumping a kind of interesting The dance seemed so vivid, as if there were dancers who went on stage after rehearsing. Unfortunately, the girl didn't come until the night, and even more unfortunately, the avalanche on the mountain and the competition in the house.

            "content": "\"The Gold Rush\" is the quintessential Chaplin film in many aspects. It depicts the tragedy of isolation in the middle of a hostile and selfish environment while providing some of the most sumptuous comedic moments you'll ever see in a film. It's the perfect marriage between slapstick, and social commentary under a nuptial humanism. And one other thing, the movie gets better after each viewing. What strikes the most when you watch \"The Gold Rush\", and being an avid admirer of Charlie Chaplin sure helps, is the completeness of the film, it delivers exactly what you'd expect, to use a dated clich\u00e9, you'll laugh, you'll cry, but with an extra : that for every tear you'll get a comedic twist, and whenever you feel like you need to catch your breath, a scene will come that would remind you that there's no powerful comedy without a good amount of drama. And \"The Gold Rush\", considering, how it's put early in the chronological map of Chaplin's filmography, contains more dramatic elements than usual, counterbalancing the laughs from the slapstick, but with more cinematic maturity. The movie is set in the Klondike during the famous Gold Rush where men were conquering the mountain and their fears for some gold nuggets that would change their life, ultimately most of them would find rocks and disappointment, or lead, if the cold and the mountain didn't kill them. The setting is the first element that makes this movie particularly memorable, no policemen, no bourgeois, not the usual urban setting where Chaplin is the Tramp. In \"The Gold Rush\", we have the mountain, the beautiful summits painted with a blinding white, where every step could be the last, where the blizzard blows the big like the small with a fair mercilessness, a hostility the Tramp used to endure before \u0085 except that he's not the Tramp anymore\u0085 but the Little Fellow\u0085 in a desert of snow.In his quest, the Little Fellow will make enemies and friends through a gallery of unforgettable characters. And this is another relevant aspect of what I called 'cinematic maturity', the characters don't serve as foils to Chaplin, but they have their own background and personality, and for the first time, there's an appealing male character besides the Tramp, when it's usually him and the girl. When we talk about \"The Gold Rush\", we see Big Jim, the good-hearted burly prospector who found a mountain of gold and Black Larsen, as probably the most cold-blooded character in any Chaplin's film. For the first time, we got a real villain, with no fake eyebrows or mustaches, this one looks really menacing and don't hesitate to use his weapons. Another revolutionary aspect is the visual effects. While Chaplin's humor most often relies on slapstick and visual humor, here we have an avalanche (sorry for the bad pun) of spectacular comical effects that would set a lesson the fans of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. The blizzard scene must have used a particular trick to make the sliding effect so believable, also the scene where the cabin is teetering on the edge of a mountain, or when Black Larsen gets his comeuppance. There's a sense of meticulousness that confirms Chaplin's abilities as a film-maker. The spectacular visual effects have nothing to envy from the same-year released \"Battleship Potemkin\". There's no Chaplin's movie without a romance but here again, Chaplin manages to surprise us, by providing an astonishingly modern female character through Georgia, a saloon girl who developed a genuine fondness on the Little Fellow, but to say that she's in love would be a stretch. She uses him, to make her lover jealous, she teases him, and even snubs him during the New Year's Eve date. The Edna Purnivace period is over, we're far from the melodramatic romance or the passive female character. Georgia's got a personality that remarkably contrasts with Chaplin's tenderness, and confirms that sometimes, the coldness of the mountains is easier to tolerate than the heart's. She will eventually regret her act after having hurt the Little Fellow's feelings.The story of \"The Gold Rush\" is a gripping and exhilarating journey through the conquest of mountain and hearts and find gold in both.. There's the heart of brave men beating inside, and this is the inspirational aspect that completes the film. It tells us a story, with memorable characters, a mature romance, great special effects, and a succession of iconic moments forever engraved in our memories. From where can I start? The iconic shoe eating scenes, a scene that had to be rehearsed more than 60 times to satisfy the perfectionism of Chaplin, the hallucination scene, The Little Fellow's frenetic joy when he got a date and during a vision of that very date, the scene that would define the film, the bread rolls dance, an image forever associated with Charlie Chaplin, and that would be parodied in many other films. \"The Gold Rush\" is Chaplin's confirmation of what \"The Kid\" implied, and that the following films would never disappoint.Finally, I'm glad I had the chance to watch the version with Chaplin's narration as it certainly gave more life to the film, and even if I could have understood the story, it sure gave an idea of the actors' pantomime talent. Chaplin's voice provided a comforting presence in a film that needed that while the beautiful music embodied the mix of sad sweetness and tender love that inhabits Chaplin's heart of gold, before he finally found it with Big Jim.I said the film was mature, not quite. There was like a sort of plot twist when The Rich Little Fellow put his old clothes as I thought a misunderstanding would get him off the boat, but no, he met Georgia who finally went with him. Yes, it was an unexpected fairy-tale happy ending, but after all the hardship he endured, The Little Fellow needed a break.",

The other two have that as well, but the jokes here are more relevant to the story and it ends with everything going Chaplin's way with friendship, romance and, of course, gold.",

            "review_title": "Hilariously Captivating Gold Rush Comedy",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's The Gold Rush is one of his best loved films. The Gold Rush, directed by and starring Chaplin, is a wonderfully captivating historical comedy about a lone gold rush prospector. The story is set in the Colorado Rockies during the Gold Rush. It was originally made without music or dialog during the silent film era, in 1925. It was an instant hit and became a success all over the world. In 1942, Chaplin had the idea remake the movie with sound and narration and to release the new version to a public that was now used to films with soundtracks. The release of the new Gold Rush followed the box office flop of his previous film, The Great Dictator, and Chaplin desperately needed something to pick up his career. The Gold Rush was just what he needed and has remained a much-loved classic to this day. The film is both touching and funny at the same time. Chaplin's character is quirky and sympathetic.Synopsis: The Little Fellow (Chaplin) is lost in the Rockies, and comes upon a cabin in a mountain storm. Inside the cabin, he meets Big Jim (Mack Swain), another lone prospector who had stumbled upon a mountain of gold, Black Larson (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal. The three are trapped in the cabin in the storm, and find themselves starved and tired. Desperately running out of food, they draw straws and Black Larson is forced to leave. The two remaining continue to live in the cabin through the storm. At one point, in a serious scene which builds to a comedic climax, The Little Fellow is so hungry that he decides to boil his leather shoe so that they can eat something. This is mocking the famous Donner Party who, caught in the Rockies, resorted to eating their boiled moccasins, among other things. Ahem. Luckily, nobody in The Gold Rush goes that far. At another point in the story, Big Jim gets so hungry, that he starts hallucinating. Using special effects that at that time were unheard of, The Little Fellow miraculously turns into a chicken and then back again in a series that taunts Big Jim. Big Jim grabs his shotgun, and delirious with hunger, proceeds to hunt down The Little Fellow. Big Jim then regains his senses just in time, and doesn't shoot The Little Fellow. After the storm ends, they find themselves at the edge of a cliff. A hilarious scene ensues and they escape just as the house falls off the edge. The pair split up; Big Jim to his mountain of gold, and The Little Fellow to a small mining town, like the many towns that had sprung up all throughout the west during the gold rush. He heads immediately to a bar, where a party is taking place. As everybody starts to dance, The Little Fellow stands in the back, watching awkwardly in his baggy trousers. This is when he first sees Georgia. (Georgia Hale) Georgia is arguing with Jack Cameron (Malcom Waite), a big, strong man who Georgia despises. He is trying to get Georgia to dance when she blows him off and asks The Little Fellow to dance just to make him mad. He takes her seriously, and they dance. When they are finished, she leaves, and Jack goes to follow her. The Little Fellow stands in the doorway, not letting him pass. They get in a fight, and just as The Little Fellow is about to lose, a clock falls on Jack\u00eds head, knocking him out. Everybody stares in awe as The Little Fellow Walks out, standing tall and proud. Later, Georgia comes to the house that The Little Fellow is sitting for money, and they talk. While he is getting firewood, The girls find pictures of Georgia under his pillow, along with the rose that she gave him when they danced. Georgia discovers his love for her.The Little Fellow invites her and her friends over for dinner on Christmas Eve. The night comes, and The Little Fellow prepares a great feast. The girls never show up, and he sits there, sad and dejected. Finally, after they are done partying, the girls come over, feeling bad. During their dinner, Chaplin entertains his guests as he hilariously brings two rolls and two forks to life in his famous \"roll dance.\" Later on, Big Jim returns, after losing his memory, and asks for The Little Fellow's help in finding the mountain of gold. They return to the mountains, find the gold, and instantly become millionaires. As they are leaving on a ship, The Little Fellow meets Georgia and they reunite.",

            "content": "Watching \"The Gold Rush\" was somewhat like listening to great music on a scratchy old record player instead of on a state of the art CD player; the experience is just as exciting, but it takes a little getting used to.  It's the same thing all right, but there is just enough difference to slightly throw you off. After a while you forget about the minor technical variations and enjoy the wonderful music. \tOnce I adjusted to the \"silence\" of Charlie Chaplin's 1925 silent film, I was able to watch it like any other movie.  I could laugh, sympathize, hope, and loathe for the characters, all of the things a movie can make you do. All it took was appreciation of the effort it took people like Chaplin who essentially made something from nothing. In this case, that something is a funny, innovative, and entertaining movie. \t\"The Gold Rush\" revolves around Chaplin's character, the Lone Prospector, in the Yukon where many men seek a fortune in gold. He seeks shelter in a cabin inhabited by wanted criminal Black Larson (Tom Murray) who tries to get rid of Chaplin in one of the funniest scenes of the movie, in which a strong wind prevents Chaplin from leaving. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has found gold, also enters the cabin.  Larson goes out to look food, leaving Big Jim and Chaplin together.  At one point, Big Jim gets so hungry he sees an illusion of Chaplin as a giant chicken. When I saw this scene, I realized that it was probably the first time that this invention, which I have seen in many modern movies and television shows to the point that it is overused, was applied in film. \tFurther along in the film, the Chaplin character visits a small boom town where he meets and falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), who only uses him to make ladies' man Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite) jealous and regards the little shabbily dressed man as a joke. At this point, I didn't care that the characters didn't really speak or that the film was in black and white. I was too involved in the story to be bothered by the rudimental aspects of the film. As the Lone Prospector, Chaplin evoked my sympathy as well as laughter.  I found myself hoping for him to be happy, wanting to see the underdog eventually come out on top. \tWhile it is impossible to ignore the movie as a silent film, it is equally impossible to ignore it as a great comedy that could capably rival any modern comedy, and, like Chaplin's character, come out on top. It is the original that all others follow, and definitely worth renting even, and especially, if you have never before seen a silent film.",

During pre-production, he tried to shoot in the Yukon but that proved to be not a sound idea. So he shot the opening scenes in Truckee, California using some local vagabonds as extras. Charlie Chaplin stars as a prospector who tries his luck looking for gold in the Great North. What he discovers is a lot of other things and a little something about the human condition.A few memorable scenes stick out, one Chaplin starving up to a point where he has to eat his boot (made out of licorice), Chaplin and his companion hallucinating when they run out of things to eat, the iconic opening sequence and the ever famous dancing rolls. I have seen both versions of the film. One thing I didn't like that Chaplin did was that he tinkered with his films in the later years. He re-edited the film and added a narration and cut out several scenes. Despite the alterations, it's an awesome film.Highest recommendation possible",

            "content": "This movie will always have a special place in my heart. This was the first 'long' feature film made by Charlie Chaplin that I saw and the first time I got to see his familiar gags (like the Tramp eating his shoe or 'the dance of the rolls') in context. It surpassed all my expectations and left me speechless.For today's audiences a black-and-white silent film may seem hopelessly outdated, but The Gold Rush is truly a timeless masterpiece that has remained just as fresh, funny and moving as it once was. It's incredibly imaginative, wonderfully structured, and despite the countless laugh-out-loud burlesque moments, it's surprisingly poetic and tear-inducing. It is very reminiscent of Woody Allen's best bittersweet comedies (of course, Allen being an admirer of Chaplin's work, it's actually the other way round), so if you like Woody's perspective (and maybe enjoyed films like Zelig or Manhattan \u2013 shot in black-and-white - from Allen's vast catalogue), The Gold Rush is highly recommended to see where he is coming from.If it's just that you have never been brave enough to attempt a silent feature, well, The Gold Rush is the perfect starting point.

In the film he plays a prospector who tries to cash in on the gold rush but finds one hardship after another.There are a great number of people who consider THE GOLD RUSH to be Chaplin's masterpiece but I will admit that I'm not one of them. There's no question that this is a great film and contains some of the greatest sequences in movie history but at the same time I think both CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES were the better films. With that said, it's says a lot about Chaplin that he managed to make three great films like the ones I've mentioned.If you're familiar with Chaplin then you know that the 1925 version was re-edited, cut down and had narration added to it. The film was restored as good as it could be but what we have today is still missing footage and it's doubtful that we'll ever see the original version. With that said, what remains still has some of the greatest moments in film history. There are countless great scenes here but my personal favorite has to be the sequence in the cabin where the hungry Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) sees Chaplin's character as a chicken.The way that sequence plays out and the timing is just flawless. You've also got a lot of other famous scenes including the roll dance and of course the cabin sliding off the side of the mountain. What has always impressed me about these scenes was the timing was so perfect on every little step. Needless to say, Chaplin, the performer, is wonderful here and his chemistry with Swain was perfect. The two of them make for a great team and there's no question that their magic is what makes the film.",

When all three men were stuck in the cabin together, I honestly thought one of them was going to die in order for the other two to survive off of the one. They eventually draw cards to see who draws the lowest card, and that person had to go out and hunt for food. The tramp got lucky, he drew a low card but fortunately for him the other guy drew the lowest. I thought it was crazy when the Tramp boiled the leather shoe, it just shows you how starving they really were! Both men started going crazy from not eating, especially when one imagined the other as chicken, the chicken suit Charlie wore was great. My favorite part of the movie was when they were both sleeping and the Tramp wakes up to find the cabin moving all around, but he thinks it's in his head. Then both men move from side to side balancing it out perfectly each time before they catch on that half of the cabin was hanging off the edge of the cliff! There were many moments in the movie that I found myself hysterically laughing! I'm glad I watched the Goldrush, it just shows you how clever and funny movies were back in the 1920s.

            "content": "\"The Gold Rush\" is an American black-and-white silent film from 1925, so this one gets closer and closer to its 100th anniversary now. It runs for over 1.5 hours in the original, but there are several versions out there and the version i saw last night was around the 80-minute mark I believe. And it was not really a silent film, not because of the music and soundtrack, but because of the narration. It was unusual to me. We had a narrator who basically told us exactly what the characters were saying in the sense of a voice-over. It felt unusual to me because it was really an audio commentary basically and I have seen a lot from Chaplin, but this I have never come across. I think it is him of course who does the job too. It felt especially strange when he was on two or three occasions saying what the central female character was saying. And yes there was a soundtrack of course. I recently found out that Chaplin wants his movies only shown with his original soundtrack and I can understand why really, even if it always not too easy for me to appreciate how there is really permanent soundtrack from beginning to end in a movie, something that is really unthinkable today. But this did not bother me as much as the narration. I definitely would have preferred intertitles. Anyway, now about the film it was nominated for two Oscars in the audio categories, but not too surprising because it was going against 11 and even 17 contenders for these awards, a lot more nominees than we have today. And Chaplin as neither of the nominees, even if once again this is really his movie once again.So the name Chaplin should already make clear what to expect here. He is still a legend today which was shown last night during my showing that there were 100s of people in the audience at midnight. Okay tickets were free, but still. I watched two other Chaplin classics not too long ago and this one felt a bit different. First of all, there is a historic background to it because it is set during the times of the Gold Rush, which back then really wasn't too much a thing of the past as it is today, so people could definitely easier make a connection to the contents of this film, even if getting is for many still today all life is about apparently. But no more sociocritical statements now. What also felt different is that there was a lot more story in considerably shorter Chaplin films I watched recently. Here it was more about the fun of the individual scenes, but there wasn't too much of a plot, especially in the first half. There is a bit of a clean structure here. The first half is all about isolated life up there in the mountains, while in the second half there are still some scenes that fit the description, but it is also more about romance then. Georgia Hale is really gorgeous by the way and felt almost too young for Chaplin's character, who looks older here than he really was at that point. Oh well, maybe it is just me who thinks so. So yeah up in the mountains, there is also some animal action. Like we have a bear on one occasion and in one of the film's funniest moments we got Chaplin's fellow prospector being so hungry that he has illusions of Chaplin being a gigantic chicken and while all this sounds really funny trust me you don't want a bear in your shack and you also don't want this big guy trying to slaughter you. There was a third character at the shack, but he was not as memorable and also disappeared eventually. Was he killed by an avalanche? I am not entirely sure, but this would actually be a really serious and tragic fate. This first half also offers one of the most seen and famous scenes from Chaplin's career, namely the shoe-eating moment and many have seen it, even if they have not seen this film. Also later on, there is this scene with the house about to crash down into the abyss. This was pretty special too, especially when Charlie pointed to his belly, and I think many have seen this too. But there they definitely needed more characters than just Chaplin and Mack Swain did a fine job there elevating the material even further because the location was basically the same all the time inside the house and Chaplin could not have made it work on his own. The rifle-pointing sequence is another good example and what happens when he thinks he got shot.Now as for the second half, it was also pretty nice at times. The moment they found her picture under Charlie's pillow was sweet and also somewhat funny because by today's standards that would have been really awkward, but back then it was just sweet and romantic. Again there were also moments where you could hear a big ooooh in the crowd, for example when see that he is spending time with his loved one and her friends and gets a kiss and then we find out it is just a dream. But there is a happy ending eventually, not just money-wise, but also Charlie gets his girl and he is really rich and in love and such a sweet ending happens not too often for the Tramp in other films, another unusual thing we got here. I liked it though, even if it does feel a bit rushed admittedly at the end how he ends up together with her. Through coincidence the two meet again (fate?) and he just grabs her and they are together. And then the big \"THE END\" is shown on the screen. But Chaplin gets away with it because by the we adore his character enough already and yeah like I said Hale's cuteness also helps. At that point, the majority of people in the crowd want him to be happy and aren't jealous or so. So overall I certainly liked the watch here. it was a good film, but somehow I feel that I still l preferred some of the other stuff I saw from him. Nonetheless even with all the comedy out there I want to say that sometimes also this film really delivered much better than you'd expect for a (19)20s movie in showing us how hard life is in the snow at these icy temperatures. This can be added because not only people were going through hardships in their attempts to find gold, but these were also the days when North Pole and South Pole got explored, so it was really a film that fit in well in terms of contemporary aspects back then. Overall, there are more popular (and maybe also better) films out there by Chaplin, for example some have almost 200k ratings here on imdb and this one almost has 100k \"only\" and maybe it's a good idea to check these out first. Still I give this one a thumbs-up too and unless you strongly dislike old silent films, it is worth seeing. Go for it.",

            "content": "It's been said that this is the film Charles Chaplin wanted to be best remembered by. If so, I think the great director and comedian might have been selling himself short. As one of his earliest feature films, I think \"The Gold Rush\" set a respectable standard on which to build a reputation, however I enjoyed his later films a lot more. For me, 1931's \"City Lights' is the gauge to measure other Chaplin pictures by, if not the entire genre of silent film. Similarly, I found 1936's \"Modern Times\" and 1940's \"The Great Dictator\" to be more provocative and insightful, which tells me that as Chaplin grew as a film maker, he found more compelling themes to portray and did it with informed maturity and insight.Which is not to say the \"The Gold Rush\" is a poor film, quite the opposite. Chaplin takes his trademark character, the Little Tramp, and turns him, for purposes of the story into The Lone Prospector, or alternately, The Little Fellow. There are any number of memorable elements on display here - Chaplin's transformation into a giant chicken, the boot eating scene, the cabin at the edge of the cliff. Perhaps the best remembered signature piece from the picture involves the 'dance of the rolls', a uniquely creative segment that's often used in pictorials of Chaplin's career. Seeing the sequence in context, I was surprised to learn that the scene involved The Little Fellow entertaining dance hall girl Georgia (Georgia Hale) and her girlfriends from the Monte Carlo Dance Hall. Any other time I've watched that scene, it appeared that Chaplin was simply putting on a show for the viewer alone.Delving into Chaplin's history, even on a surface level can be an interesting exercise. His first choice for the part of Georgia was his own fianc\u00e9e, Lita Grey, who quite unfortunately became pregnant and couldn't make the picture in her condition. In a brief clip of Grey offered in the special features section of \"The Gold Rush\" DVD, she didn't quite seem to have the looks or charisma of Georgia Hale, who's signature curlicue on the center of her forehead made her all the more endearing. This was one of those unintended consequences of real life that might have resulted in a better movie than originally conceived.By all means, a viewing of \"The Gold Rush' is a must to get a full flavor of Chaplin's artistic achievement, and I would recommend it without reservation. However my earlier comments regarding his later work still stand, and ought to be viewed as well to gain a fuller appreciation for his entire body of work.",

The story is so simple that anyone can follow it and enjoy it, from 5-500, and it's ideas have been copied numerous times. I've seen this maybe 5 times now, and, although I've grown to like other silent comedians better, it was a pleasure to see this again. My only other comment, and this is not a complaint but rather an awkward aside. The version I saw quite recently was the 1942 version which is the feature version on the new DVD edition of the film. In this version, instead of inter titles, there's audio commentary. This was all done by Chaplin. While it's fun to listen to (Chaplin seems to be having a ball doing this). I really wonder why this needed to be done, and not just let the original stand on it's own merits. I guess silents were so out of vogue that when it was being re-released Chaplin did this to try to broaden the audience? That would be my guess.",

            "content": "To my knowledge, this is the most acclaimed and well loved of all the films starring Sir Charlie Chaplin, and featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I wasn't going to miss it. Basically a lone prospector, or Tramp (Chaplin, also directing) is in the Alaskan mountains looking for gold, but a blizzard takes him to the shelter of a remote cabin. Also in the cabin staying out of the bad weather is gold searching Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), as well as wanted escaped criminal Black Larsen (Tom Murray). While the criminal leaves the cabin to take the stash of gold, only to meet his fate falling off the cliff, the Tramp and Big Jim stay in the cabin while the wind and snow is still raging. Hunger is beginning to take over, and the Tramp at one point resorts to eating one of his own shoes, leather like meat and laces like spaghetti. Big Jim meanwhile is hallucinating, like the Tramp as a large chicken he is very keen to eat, but he realises he is seeing things. After the blizzard blows the shack to the edge of a cliff and the Tramp and Big Jim escape falling down with it, and of course the weather has calmed down, they travel to the nearest town. Giving up being a prospector for another job, the Tramp sees and has feelings for lonely saloon girl Georgia (Georgia Hale), but he is mistaken into thinking she loves him. The Tramp tries to get the attentions of Georgia in front of her teasing friends, with acts such as sticking forks in bread rolls and making them dance like legs. Big Jim has turned up in town suffering amnesia, he only remembers the Tramp, and he needs his help finding the stash of gold left in the mountains. Of course in the end, they do find the gold and become better dressed millionaire partners, and the Tramp helps out Georgia who has resorted to being a stowaway on boats to get around. In the end, Georgia believes he has always been a Tramp not realising the recent change in his life, but it doesn't matter, she does truly have feelings for him, and it is a happy ending. Also starring Henry Bergman as Hank Curtis and Malcolm Waite as Jack Cameron. The two most memorable sequences are of course the eating the shoe, and dancing bread rolls, and Chaplin is the perfect character to pull them off. There is a version with Chaplin narrating for dialogue and stuff, sounds effects help too, Chaplin is charming and fun, and the slapstick jokes are simple but plentiful, it is certainly the best Chaplin film I know, a must see silent comedy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Max Terr and Best Sound. Sir Charlie Chaplin was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, he was number 38 on The World's Greatest Actor, and he was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 74 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 58 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

While I did enjoy The Circus, I wasn't as thrilled with this one as I was with his other works.While the humor in this is just as good and entertaining, I found it lacking. In my opinion, I found it a tad bit dull compared to precious movies of his. Maybe I'm being too comparative, but I didn't find this movie as thrilling as some of his other concepts. I don't know, I think the plot kept bouncing around to characters that were in the first part and I didn't understand why some characters needed to come into the plot again when Charlie was dealing with Georgia in the dance hall. It's not a bad film; far from it, in fact. For my personal tastes, though, I wished it was something more gripping. I felt like he could have done a lot with the idea of being trapped in the cold north with arctic animals and the like, instead of it drifting back to Georgia. I think it would have made a funnier movie if it kept to the main point in the beginning and went with it. I felt a little disorganized watching it because I didn't know what to focus on in the main storyline.I give this film 7 out of 10 mostly because of how it was executed, so it wasn't as high a rating as before. But, overall, it's a cute movie but not his best.~ Vicky",

New York opening at the Globe: 18 April 1942. U.S. release: 17 April 1942. Australian release: 3 December 1942. 6,709 feet. 74 minutes.

The same version at 6,480 feet, opened in England at the London Pavilion around September 1956 and was subsequently shown widely throughout the U.K. SYNOPSIS: Charlie, a lone prospector, is stormbound in a Klondyke hut with Big Jim, a successful miner, and Black Larson, a desperado.NOTES: The silent version ran 8,498 feet which, projected at sound speed, ran 93 minutes. Chaplin claims that he saved no less than 25 minutes, solely by eliminating the original inter-titles. As the film then ran only 68 minutes, Chaplin added 400 feet of previously discarded footage which he had been wise enough to keep in storage all these years.\n \nChaplin's first film as actor-director for United Artists (of which he was one of the four founding partners). The most commercially successful of all Chaplin's silent films, coming in third at the U.S./Canadian box-office for 1925, with a domestic rentals gross of $2\u00bd million. Location scenes filmed in the High Sierras. COMMENT: Not nearly as funny as its admirers would have us believe, The Gold Rush is too macabre, too grisly in its humor for my taste. True, Chaplin does wonders with seemingly depressing material. Indeed the whole movie depends for its effect on finding something to laugh at in the most horrifying situations. But I still find it hard to chuckle at the sight of a man so desperately hungry he is reduced to cooking his boot.

Pedants can get vexed at the fact that the outer packaging displays the title without the \"The\", but the real puzzlement comes inside. On disc one (\"The Film\") we're given what is listed as the \"definitive\" version... that version being the almost unlistenable and truncated version with Chaplin's narration.Bizarrely the original silent itself is pushed onto the second disc as a \"special feature\", along with some off kilter extras. While the documentaries titled \"Chaplin Today\" are usually at worst interesting and at best compelling, this one seems wide of the mark. Here we get speakers imploring the seamlessness of that terrible toy doll stand in at the climax, or urging us that Chaplin is a genius for dressing up as a giant chicken. Anyone else would have just used a normal sized chicken, they urge us. Errrrrrr.... isn't it just that Chaplin wouldn't have been able to get inside the suit of, or manipulate, a lifelike chicken? I'm all for praising Chaplin's undoubted genius, but here it seems to be praising things that simply aren't there.Yes, The Gold Rush is a very good film... for an extended short. But the vaunted artistry that gave us the political ramifications of Modern Times or the poignancy of City Lights and The Kid just isn't there. The dance of the rolls is extraordinary, the vague allusions to the Depression are to be applauded... but I'm just not seeing this as Chaplin's finest hour. In fact, from The Kid to The Great Dictator I'd see this as his weakest feature, save for A Woman In Paris.Though of course a term like \"weakest\" doesn't really apply when it comes to a Chaplin film in his peak years. The Gold Rush is still a spectacular film... it's just that it's a fun movie that doesn't really tap into his greater sense of artistry.",

The timing, planning and execution are all spot-on, with most scenes featuring material building to a climax.

The universal and age-old themes brought up keep it relevant after nearly 90 years.All this while the thin line between comedy and tragedy grows ever slimmer, nearly disappearing at points. Pacing and score keep certain bits from being terrifying, and make them comical instead. From a technical standpoint, this is well-done.

Georgina Hale plays the love interest harassed by the town's ladies man. She takes interest in Chaplin when trying to avoid her ego driven boyfriend but feels regret when she forgot about Chaplin's new years party. Mack Swain plays the amnesia driven McKay who struck gold before being confronted by Larson. He will enlist in the Tramp's help in relocating it. Tom Murray plays Larson who is wanted by the law but finds refuge in a cabin with Chaplin and McKay until greed takes over. He will eventually take a sudden wrong turn. Malcolm Waite provides great amusement as Hale's egotistical boyfriend who takes a dislike to Chaplin. An impressive film by a director with no limits.

Yet the picture, of which I viewed a restored version that essentially recreates the initial 1925 release, has aged remarkably well and is as charming as you'd expect, managing to maintain a clear and consistent level of visual storytelling and some superb set-pieces that are as amusing as they are impressive. It's just a shame that the flick's final note is actually a secretly, and most likely unwittingly, downbeat one. 7/10",

Here The Tramp is in the Klondike during the gold rush in the 1890's, and while he hardly looks or acts like a prospector, we identify with him as he endures hardship, befriends 'Big Jim' (Mack Swain), survives close quarters with the murderous Black Larsen (Tom Murray), falls for a woman who toys with him (Georgia Hale), and puts up with her bullying boyfriend (Malcolm Waite). The New Year's Eve scene is incredibly touching, both in The Tramp's humiliation when he's stood up by his date and listens forlornly to the celebration in the nearby dance hall, but also in the faces Chaplin (as director) puts the camera on while 'Auld Lang Syne' is being sung. It truly is one of the best scenes you'll ever see - and on that same evening, while the Tramp dreams of entertaining his guests, he does his \"dinner roll dance\", a brilliant, iconic moment in cinema. I also love the scene where he and Big Jim eat one of his shoes after boiling it - Chaplin more enthusiastically, really digging in as if it were a piece of meat, and as if the nails were thin bones. There are also some wonderfully dark moments when out of starvation Big Jim imagines the Tramp as a giant chicken and comes at him with an axe. Throughout it all, Chaplin is so sweet and charming, and we root for him as the underdog while laughing at his innovative humor. Truly deserving of its reputation, and an absolute joy to watch.",

Chaplin's films, though again certainly coherent and finely constructed, have that quality reminiscent of sketches; separate parts that work together as an ensemble; which only works in generating more entertainment for the viewer as he's given a wider palette of thought, visuals and humor. In this one Chaplin showcases his unique ability to make a scene out of nothing, create value out of very little going on, and if ever you'd find it unfunny it is at very least certainly very creative. I'd imagine everybody would laugh wholeheartedly at least once during this. Finally, as always with Chaplin, ultimately this is a tale of humanity, and one that highlights the endearing fact of the 'little guy', the oddball; so unlikely to succeed or fit in anywhere, who yet manages a whole lot more than any of that.",

            "content": "The film which Charlie Chaplin wanted himself to be remembered for may not be the film for which he's actually remembered today but that doesn't mean The Gold Rush is any lesser quality work from the legendary auteur, it only means that Chaplin later went on to surpass the very standards he set for himself with this silent classic.The Gold Rush tells the story of a lone prospector who ventures into Alaska looking for gold but ends up finding more than what he asked for. On his journey, he finds many interesting people, gets caught in a blizzard, almost starves to death & also comes across a very beautiful woman whose heart he tries to win with his charm.Written, produced, directed, edited & composed by Charlie Chaplin, there are two versions of this film in existence but I prefer the silent one for the voice-over in the 1942 re-issue felt very intrusive to me. As for the film, it's an influential example of its genre & contains many moments that are now counted amongst the most memorable segments of silent cinema.Chaplin's ability to seamlessly infuse slapstick humour into drama continues to impress but the latter part doesn't carry enough weight in my opinion. The funny gags, however, are plenty & each one of them manages to leave its mark. And while Chaplin's work behind the camera is admirable, his performance in the starring role is even more infectious & impressive.On an overall scale, The Gold Rush isn't Charlie Chaplin's magnum opus, at least not in my eyes, but it remains an essential classic of its era that has continued to inspire countless films of its genre ever since. It's worth a shot for that \"dancing rolls\" sequence alone which is quite possibly Chaplin's single greatest on-screen moment plus the heavy dose of fun, entertainment & laughter it has in store guarantees an experience you hopefully won't regret.P.S. Choose the 1925 silent version over the 1942 re-issue! The latter, however, can be viewed as The Gold Rush with director's commentary.",

            "content": "The Gold Rush (1925) :\nBrief Review -The Gold of A Film despite the rush of Chaplin's trademark Comedy. The Gold Rush is one of the most popular Classic of Charlie Chaplin's early days and it is a worth watch. It came as the second Classic of Chaplin's career after Cult film 'The Kid' (1921), of course excluding not so good 'A Woman Of Paris' (1923). Hypothetically speaking, The Gold Rush runs a riot in trademark Chaplin style which had not became a trademark by then, so the potential remains low and then the film surpasses it by margin. The Gold Rush is about four Characters, unknown to each other they are linked somehow. A prospector goes to the Klondike in search of gold, he is accompanied by the tramp for some time to have a great friendship later on. In between, the tramp falls in love with the bar girl who isn't much attracted to him but as expected it works later. The Gold Rush is full of adventures and the comedy is generated through those adventurous situations. A sort of dramatic and fantasy touch works fantastically because the innovative concept of creating comedy is immensely attractive. The only fault this film has is it lacks the good love-story. The girl doesn't seem like a charming material to fall in Love with and the love story isn't as lovable it should have been. Several classic comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Llyod had much better Love Stories than The Gold Rush at that time. Excluding that one big falter, The Gold Rush is flawless entertainer. Charlie Chaplin's amazing act during adventures, his get up and that one leg shoe are the things to remember from the film. Overall, it packs a solid punch of comedy, humour, creative scenes, friendship and drama with slightly downed romance. In one word, A Classic Comedy-Drama.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "The Gold Rush is a film that shows Charlie at both his comedic and heart string pulling best, proving that hunkering down in an isolated cabin with a murderer while a snow storm rages outside is in fact a great situation for comedy. Back in town he falls for a woman named Georgia and pulls all the romantic strings - dancing with her whilst using the lead of a dog as a belt to hold up his trousers, entertaining her at the dining table using forks and bread as dancing feet (in his dreams), and after receiving a love letter, venturing back out into the wilderness to claim a mountain of gold for the two of them. However little did he know that the letter was intended for another man, and the dance was only an escape from one. The poor little tramp who can hardly catch a break and only had one shoe to wear after his other was eaten in a severe state of hunger, was being played the whole time.The story relies on quite a few coincidences and loose plot threads, and as you can imagine, leans very strongly on the edges of unbelievability. This is all easily forgivable for the first two acts, as the quality of gags is so entertaining that looking for continuity seems beside the point. Unfortunately however the third act, which sees the cabin Charlie and his mate are sleeping in blown precariously close to the cliffs edge, and the forgotten landmark of gold, really does push too far against those edges, and metaphorically shall I say, falls over the cliff. I guess it was done for the sake of metaphor - a visual of his life literally being on the brink of disaster - but the quality of gags here are not nearly as good as those that came beforehand, and Charlie was always better at gags than metaphor anyway. The chance (did I mention the story relies on coincidences?) encounter between Georgia and Charlie on the boat is even more awkward. With he now a millionaire, the two appear set to live happily ever after, but is it really happy if she is so undeserving?It is well worth watching however, as the first two acts contain some great material.",

The characters all seem to have the same voice and just express things that are very obvious or don't need to be repeated. On the other hand, the narration does sometimes clarify the action on the screen, which just emphasises how unclear it was originally. An example would be near the end when the ship's captain is informed that Charlie Chaplin's character is not a stowaway. If not for the narration, it would just seem like a strange conflict was instigated and then suddenly averted for no clear reason. This makes me doubt the skill of the visual storytelling here - while Charlie Chaplin is generally a master of using only props and expressions to communicate the situation, and this film is full of that skill, there are clearly lapses at times. Other than these misgivings, The Gold Rush has memorable characters, a solid storyline, passionate emotions and intense set pieces - the bear (which used a real bear in production) and the cliff being the stand-outs to me.",

Although it's only one relatively short sequence in the movie, the scene in the cabin with The Lone Prospector (Chaplin) and his two burly companions is by far my favorite. It's HERE that the allusion to the Donner party comes in, as the three men face starvation in the little one-room cabin. At one point, The Prospector becomes convinced that one of his companions has eaten their dog, but, fortunately, this turns out not to be the case. The high point is the scene where The Prospector cooks and eats one of his shoes (which he shares with one of the two others, the third man already having moved on). It's a famous scene, and it's STILL funny: Chaplin wounds a shoestring around his fork like a string of spaghetti and munches it almost happily. And Chaplin, dressed in a chicken suit (which is how his starving companion sees him), accurately mimics the mannerisms of a real chicken (until he's forced to grab a shotgun for self-preservation). It's interesting that the \"dancing buns\" sequence, wherein Chaplin skewers a pair of rolls and proceeds to put on a tabletop floor show for onlookers, turns out to have been nothing but a dream: it goes to the heart of the despair that always seemed to somehow suffuse Chaplin's best films. One of his best.",

Tramp wanders around, gets into trouble, meets a girl, suffers from misfortune, only to end on a happy note. What makes these films so lasting is the comedy and the great drama that is always present despite the comedy. And very much so in here where the harshness of the time period and the harshness of the location emphasize the drama and the suffering, making the light-hearted scenes all the sweeter for it.And the comedy is really good. Personally, as a man born near the end of the century, I do find it a bit slapsticky and repetitive. But that's the nature of comedy, of art in general. People change, societies change and thus tastes change. I can still appreciate it and the impact it has left without rolling on the floor tears of laughter in my eyes.The Gold Rush is Charlie Chaplin in a nutshell. City Lights emphasizes his storytelling and dramatic moments, but this has better comedy in my opinion. Definitely worth a watch for all interested in the roots of cinematic comedy.",

At the same time, he's a passionate fellow, determined to make something of himself. Sure, he dreams of riches and the great moment when he strikes gold, but on his quest to find the goldmines, he struggles for such basic things as warmth, food (boiling his boot and eating it for dinner is a classic scene) and love (he genuinely falls for women who are just hanging around him to make fun of him, and you can't help feel for the guy) And, of course, every scene, every gag is actually part of the story, so it's not just a series of strung-together jokes. It's also worth mentioning that he's such a generous performer, he's willing to share the screen with his co-stars and can use his character to support their moments of glory on the screen.Oh and the ending, with Georgia (the object of the Tramp's affection) sympathising with The Lone Prospector (Chaplin's character) and finally falling for him before the shock of discovering that he's now a multi-millionaire give the story a not-too-sentimental, not-too-corny ending that ensures the movie is still a comedy classic now, 80 years after the film was made.",

            "content": "The Gold Rush is one of Chaplin's best films, as well as one of his most famous. It has been said that it is the film that he most wanted to be remembered by, and it's not hard to see why. Chaplin plays the part of the lone prospector, a young miner during the gold rush. After getting caught in a storm, he hurries to the only shelter that he can find, a wood cabin in the middle of the storm. It turns out that it is already inhabited, and by a tough criminal named Black Larson, no less, and the scene in which Charlie and Big Jim, another prospector, insist to Black Larson that they are going to stay is one of the countless memorable scenes in the film.Charlie and Big Jim are left alone and without food when Larson goes off to face the storm looking for food (having drawn the lowest card in another amusing scene), and the scenes in the cabin are some of the best in the entire film. There is, of course, the boot eating scene, memorable not only because of its cleverness and effectiveness, but also because while making the film, Chaplin ate so much boot (which was made out of licorice) before he was satisfied with the take that he had to be taken to the hospital to have his stomach pumped. Another thing that was really well done was the special effects. I am still amazed every time I watch the film at how realistic it looks when there is a long shot from outside showing Charlie hanging from the door of the cabin, which is balanced precariously on the edge of a cliff. Also notice the fast paced and very effective music during this scene, the same song that is played in the best scene of the 1996 film Shine, with Geoffrey Rush.There is also a very noteworthy love element of The Gold Rush, a part of the story that Chaplin generally has much success with in his films. Charlie's amorous interests in Georgia, a dance hall girl, leads to the scene where he performs the famous dance of the dinner rolls, probably the most famous scene in the film, which was also performed very well by Johnny Depp in Benny & Joon. Charlie's relationship with Georgia is also the thing that leads to his presentation of his sympathy for the lower classes, when he meets her on the ship after having become a multi-millionaire. Chaplin's full length films are inherently more famous than his earlier short comedies, and The Gold Rush is one of the best of his full length features. A must see for any Chaplin fan, but The Gold Rush is also a film that anyone who is interested in quality comedy should watch.",

Entirely unprepared for the harsh climate, he soon finds himself trapped in a small cabin during a snowstorm, along with an on-the-lam criminal and an increasingly insane fellow gold-seeker. That setup is good for a stretch of claustrophobic mayhem, but it's not until the storm ends and the trio split up that things start getting really good.The pace can feel slow at times, pausing to squeeze as much anticipation from each scene as possible, but that all seems worthwhile when everything comes together in the final act. At worst, it's a little drawn-out. At best, a brilliant display of creative scene-setting and cinematic trickery. Chaplin is able to do so much with such limited means, it doesn't even matter that we can see through a few of his visual illusions. In a way, that makes it even more endearing, like a magician who lifts the curtain mid-trick for a sly wink. The Gold Rush is loaded with such ideas; crazy, larger-than-life concepts that work through hustle and sheer power of will. It also bubbles over with little personal moments from the star, whose aloof charisma still shines like a beacon through so many years.",

We have cannibalism, implied prostitution, and starvation-- and that's not going into the sadness at the heart of the film. There's a great sense of loneliness at play.The supporting actors are allowed to shine as much as Chaplin does. Mack Swain as the Tramp's ally Big Jim is my favorite in the whole movie; his self-pitying drama king nature are hilarious. Georgia Hale is a seemingly selfish woman with a heart of gold, and she ranks among Chaplin's best leading ladies.

The familiar Chaplin pathos rears it's head in several scenes, and the expected climax is missing (the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff is an unconvincing model; Buster Keaton would have done it for real), but this is the comedy Chaplin hoped to be remembered by, and for good reason: his 'Little Fellow' was never more dignified, playful, optimistic, or resourceful.

Chaplin isn't what I expected him to be, I was expecting nothing but old school pratfalls and got completely blindsided by how heartfelt he was. When he has those moments of loss and despair, the few happy ones, they really are felt. Beyond that, I was chuckling frequently during this. I don't think I ever reached full-on laughter but it was still a really fun, enjoyable watch.With all that said, I doubt I'd recommend this to most people. I just can't see going up to one of my co-workers and say, \"Oh man, you HAVE to check out The Gold Rush!\" But for film buffs? Oh yeah, definitely watch this. If for nothing else, the experience and the addition to your film repertoire is a great addition. The fact that it's pleasant and fun is just icing on the cake.",

            "review_title": "The Movie Chaplin Hoped To Be Remembered By",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was a guest of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford at their Pickfair home when the couple showed pictures of the harsh conditions the prospectors faced during the Alaskan Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890's. The comedian was so impressed by those who staked their lives for gold nuggets he developed what turned out to be one of cinema's most famous silent movies.Of all the superior films he had produced, Chaplin's August 1925 \"The Gold Rush\" was the one movie he claimed he most wanted to be remembered. He reveled at the combination of comedy, sentimentality and a touch of sadness and elation on the story of The Lone Prospector (Chaplin) journeying to Alaska to try his luck to become rich. Once there, he stumbles upon Big Jim (Mack Swain), who had discovered and misplaced the site where a large deposit of gold vein was buried. The two get mixed up with a wanted criminal, Black Larsen, who knocks out Big Jim but gets killed in an avalanche. Chaplin goes on his own way. He comes across a settlement where he meets and invites Georgia (Georgia Hale) and her friends to his cabin for a New Year's Eve party. The women decide to go elsewhere, setting up one of the saddest New Year's Eve sequences ever put on film.In real life, Chaplin got his new flame, 16-year-old Lita Grey, who was originally scheduled to play the role of Georgia, pregnant. He was forced to marry her in a quickie Mexican wedding to evade being arrested for statutory rape of a minor. Chaplin switched her with Georgia Hale, whom he spotted while viewing Josef von Sternberg's \"The Salvation Hunters.\" The two fell in love during the production. The last clip of \"The Gold Rush\" shows how crazy they were to each other with a concluding passionate kiss. In 1942 when Chaplin narrated the movie with his personally-composed musical score, the director didn't want to show the kiss since the two had broken up soon after the filming. So he faded to black a minute earlier than the original.\"The Gold Rush\" is famous because of several scenes. One is when starving Big Jim and Chaplin are in the cabin seeking shelter from a raging blizzard. Resorting to eating their shoes, The Lone Prospector prepares an exquisite meal of shoe leather and nails. The shoe was made up of licorice so it could be eaten and look like a real one. Being the ultimate movie perfectionist, Chaplin insisted on filming over 60 takes. He ate so much licorice he had to be rushed to the hospital for insulin shock.In the next scene, his appetite not satisfied with shoe leather, Big Jim is so hungry he's hallucinating by seeing Chaplin as a chicken. A stagehand was given the simple job of wearing a chicken suit and strutting around the cabin. After several takes, Chaplin was unhappy with the stagehand's failure to imitate the comedian's famous walk. Chaplin ended up in the chicken suit himself.One other memorable sequence is when Chaplin, waiting for the women to join him for that New Year's Eve dinner, ends up falling asleep. In his dreams the women are highly entertained by The Prospector's antics. He pierces two bread rolls with a pair of forks and has them dance on the table. The sequence was so popular with theater audiences some projectionists stopped the movie, reversed the film, and replayed the dance. The skit was first created by Roscoe Arbuckle in his 1917 \"The Rough House.\"\nAfter the disappointing box office returns for Chaplin's first United Artists film, \"A Woman In Paris,\" which he didn't act in, \"The Gold Rush\" was his first major appearance in a UA production. And it was a phenomenal success at the box office. It has since gained quite a reputation well after its initial release. \"The Gold Rush\" was the fifth highest grossing silent film in history. The American Film Institute named the Chaplin classic as the 58th Best Movie of All Time and #25 Funniest film ever. Entertainment Weekly has it as the 15th of its 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. \"The Gold Rush\" is included in the '1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.' Fellow directors, including Akira Kurosawa and Guillermo del Toro, have said this is one of their favorite films.",

In \"The kid\" this mix is realised within one storyline. In \"The gold rush\" it is divided over two storylines. Charlie looking for gold is a vehicle for comedy, Charlie having a romance with Georgia (Gerogia Hale) is a vehicle for sentimentality.However it is true that \"The gold rush\" probably has more \"unforgettable\" scenes then \"The kid\". When I use the term \"unforgettable scenes\" most people will think of the comedy element and the visual gags and brilliant mime involved in scenes as the cabin on the canyon or the little tramp (or \"the lone prospector\" as he is called in this film) changing into a chicken in the delusion of his hungry companion.I in the first place think of the scene of Charlie waiting in vain for Georgia on new years eve. Seldom has loneliness been portrayed so poignant as in this scene",

            "content": "Here's a really dumb idea for a comedy. Stick a guy in the middle of a whited-out Alaskan wilderness, hungry and lonely, his sole companion bent on eating him alive. Oh, yes, throw in a pretty woman to give him the flirt-and-desert treatment. Man, is this getting worse by the minute...What do I know? \"This will make a wonderful story!\" says the reporter on the boat at the end of \"The Gold Rush\". And so it does. In fact, a big reason for admiring the movie is because it really does tell a good story, unusual for comedies back in the mid-1920s when they were designed just to get you from gag to chase and back.Admiration aside, \"The Gold Rush\" is impressive in another big way. It's still deliriously funny.The story: An unnamed prospector called \"the little fellow\" or \"the tramp\" (Charlie Chaplin) struggles to find his fortune and just stay alive during the 1898 Alaska Gold Rush. The story forms two halves. In one, he and his friend Big Jim (Mack Swain) must stave off starvation and help Big Jim rediscover his \"mountain of gold\". In the other, he tries to win the heart of jaded dance-hall girl Georgia (Georgia Hale).The two subplots are not only resolved, but in tandem, a neat trick for any age. At the core of the film's success is Chaplin's way as writer and director of creating empathy for his character's plight.This was not always a plus for Chaplin in my view; he was prone to overload the pathos and artistic sentiment a few times in his career. But here the sympathy we feel for the Tramp is not only genuine and earned but serves to advance the comedy, making the laughs deeper and more satisfying.Take the scene where the Tramp first makes Georgia's acquaintance, in the dance hall where she works. As an establishing shot, we see him in the foreground from the back, arm akimbo, almost totally in darkness as the two-level set in the background is brightly lit. He's obviously the guy in the corner being ignored by the merrymakers around him.Then we see Georgia's first meeting with him. She's talking about how bored she is. \"If I could meet someone worthwhile,\" she says, as he listens, awestruck. Then she turns and looks in his direction. He freezes up, but to no avail, as she looks right past him and walks on.It's funny, yes, but at the same time you feel for the guy. Film comedies have been trying to do this thing ever since, and most often they fail because they overplay the laugh or the pity. Here Chaplin nails it.The three big set pieces people talk about in the film, the Thanksgiving dinner where the Tramp eats a shoe, his dance with the dinner rolls, and the cliffhanger at the end with Big Jim in the cabin, are all bedrock moments of cinema. Yet they exist not in isolation but in tandem with everything else in \"The Gold Rush\".So many other prize scenes here, too, like Charlie's transformation into a chicken and his racket for making money by shoveling snow from one storefront to the next. I'm at a loss as to why there was need for the nominal villain, Black Larson, who does absolutely nothing to advance the story of the film. But he does have a great comic struggle with Big Jim over a shotgun, which always manages to be aimed at the Tramp no matter where he's trying to hide.I would vote for seeing the film in its original 1925 silent state, though I don't think the 1942 version narrated by Chaplin is an atrocity. It just short-changes some of the story elements. For any comedy before \"The Gold Rush\", such trims would be just fine, but \"The Gold Rush\" is not any comedy. It's the mother lode!",

The conditions are horrible, it is freezing, there is nothing to eat and if he doesn't have something he will starve. So sitting down at the table dining on the shoe he makes it seem as if he were eating a slice of pizza using his shoelaces as pasta. He is pleased to have something to eat even if it is a piece of leather. The man at his side (Mack Swain) can't comprehend and tries it in disgust. In a way, he represents us.Make the best of a bad situation. This was the essence of The Tramp, a character who is dirt poor but refuses to be downtrodden. No film illustrates this more then 'The Gold Rush'. Chaplin knew how to find the next layer in a scene. The moment was funny but the it's the things that we don't expect that make it work.In \"The Gold Rush\", The Tramp finds himself in the freezing Klondike looking for gold and battling a burly prospector for the hand of a beautiful girl.His timing is impeccable especially a scene in which his log cabin teeters over the edge of a cliff and the tramp holds on my his fingernails. Or a scene in which he faces a large man who challenges him for the affections of the same girl. The man only need raise his hand and the tramp flinches but regains his feet never giving up.",

            "content": "The Gold Rush is a Charlie Chaplin classic. Released in 1925, The Gold Rush was Chaplin's 3rd film, and contains many standards of his work. The film features the famous Chaplin character, referred to as the \"Tramp\", or the \"little fellow\". The version I watched was the 1942 re-release, which featured a new score, as well as narration from Chaplin himself.Charlie Chaplin is famous for being an influence on many films after his time, which I did not truly appreciate until I saw this movie. The Gold Rush showcases many of these influential elements. A number of iconic Chaplin scenes, such as the dance of the dinner rolls, the windy cabin, and the boiled shoe dinner are from this movie. This was the first Chaplin film I had seen, and afterwards, I began to notice many scenes in modern movies such as La La Land and Baby Driver incorporated elements of Chaplin's brand of visual humor. This style of visual humor is subtle, effective and almost elusive. It involves staging, progression and cinematography. By understanding that Charlie Chaplin began his career in theater, his approaches start to make a little more sense. Many Chaplin scenes are staged like theater productions. That is to say, the camera has a wide view of an entire room, and does not move during a long, continuous scene. It mimics the experience of the audience watching a theater production. Chaplin also builds humor using a sense of progression, slowly building the ridiculousness of his scenes, each gag sillier than the last. Despite it's age, The Gold Rush still exhibits a highly advanced understanding of narrative and visual story telling. Chaplin was not a fan of having many title cards in his films, so he tried to minimize the necessity of them by having the character's actions speak for themselves. I wish I could have watched the original silent version of the film first, so that I could better compare the two and how well they got the story across. The narrated version offers a great amount of depth, without being overbearing or distracting. I very much enjoyed the narration, but I did get the impression that the film was written without planning for it. As a result, sometimes the narration can actually have a detrimental effect on some of the scenes. A dialogue line might detract from a visual punch line, or the timing might be a little off. What I found interesting was how many scenes were still silent. I couldn't tell you what made Chaplin decide some scenes needed narration and others didn't, but I appreciate the restraint, and the understanding that sometimes, narration or dialogue would do more harm than good.I'm usually not that into old films, but The Gold Rush completely won me over. It has aged well, and the humor is still very funny. The style of story telling is different, to be sure, but still highly effective. Charlie Chaplin is a timeless performer, and I definitely recommend watching this movie.",

I know that silent films is where are cinema history began, but i have to say i find them utterly boring.I was honestly bored and found myself drifting away from the movie, it just didn't hold my attention. At least Chaplin comedy can be fabulously expressed even without words. For example there's a scene where their so hungry there imaging a chicken and chasing each other around. The scene could be funny even if taken out of context. There's also a scene where hes shoveling snow, but not realizing that hes making an even bigger pile out of what hes shoveling. I found myself laughing quite a bit during that scene. The scenes do seem a little bit over done at times though.The movie is about just what is sounds like, Chaplin finds him self searching for gold,and comedy ensues. The props for The Gold Rush were noticeable bad, very fake. For example there's the cabin scenes. Everything just looks like a set, especially when the cabin is about to slide off the side of the mountain, the scenes/effects(all the back and forth motion) is not very authentic.

To slip a modern film in between would be a bit jarring and I'm enjoying having my cinematic sensibilities reset by Chaplin's silent era vision. His appearance here is much quicker than in The Kid. He's now a star. Here he's The Lone Prospector, although to all intents and purposes he's still The Tramp. He's a character we're designed to feel for, as he struggles in the snowy wilderness, looking for gold in the earth, shelter from the harsh winter weather and safety from the more suitably dressed outdoorsmen whom share the screen with him. It's certainly dramatic with gunfights, the threat of starvation and Big Jim (Mack Swain) deliriously imagining that our hero is a giant tasty chicken. Daft as that sounds, it's pretty violent really. That is until our hero prospector meets Georgia (Georgia Hale) at a dancehall in the new mining town and falls in love. Sadly Georgia isn't as sweet and innocent as the doe eyed prospector. It doesn't quite have the well rounded plot of The Kid, but it is still very good and it does have the famous bread roll dance. That now given its fame, seems almost incidental in the storyline. Despite being the downtrodden character, the prospector is the nicest man in the room and with any luck, soon to be the richest. Maybe it's that The Kid set the bar so high, but this feels a bit lacking in comparison. There's a whole subplot with the wanted Black Larsen (Tom Murray) that essentially gets forgotten about and as it nears its finale, everything feels a little rushed, like they're running out of film. It's still charming though. Next up: City Lights.",

The movie does what a silent movie should and that is, it left me with a visual experience quite unlike other movies I am used to seeing. In the movie, Chaplin is partnered with a character named Jim MacKay (Mack Swain)whose size and persona are the opposite of Chaplin. The dinner scene with the boots as the meal was so imaginative and realistic, that one could imagine him devouring a delectable meal. Later a cliffhanging scene shows the two of them running back and forth across a one room cabin as it teeters on the edge of a cliff. The romance with a girl named Georgia (Georgia Hale) is heartwarming and very innocent by today's standards. In one dance scene, the viewer sees the two of them as one embarrassing incident followed another with the floor filled with other dance partners oblivious to the whole scene. Another time he entertains a group of young ladies and uses two buns and forks to simulate a dance routine.

The Tramp goes off to the Gold Rush and grapples with bears, extreme winds and cold, hunger, and love for a dilettante woman. The contrast between the diminutive tramp and the two huge brutes he shares his cabin with is the constant sight conceit. It plays out wonderfully in the cliff-edge cabin scene. It enhances the boot-cooking scene and the hallucination of Tramp as chicken. The film also has heart that transcends the sentimentalism that preyed on the cinema of its times - the Tramp is made to work for his maiden's hand, and her humiliation of him on New Year's Eve is poignant and painful. Story, camera-work, editing, effects, acting and score (Neil Brand's current interpretation) all gel wonderfully in a celebration of cinema's power when every element clicks. Great in 1925, great in its restored version screening in 2012, and destined to be celebrated as long as humankind gather to see stories visually represented. In short, timeless genius.",

The movie reminds me of comedy classics such as Dr. Strangelove, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, It Happened One Night, The Kid, Steamboat Bill Jr., Bruce Almighty etc., The movie tells the story of a prospector/tramp who goes to Alaska on a gold mining mission in order to become a multi-millionaire (played by Chaplin himself.) This movie makes me think back to the worst animated movie ever which was the beginning of Frozen when there is prospectors mining for ice which I was pretty sure it was on the polar ice caps (during the arctic scenes.). Not only the movie works as a dramatic comedy but it also works as a romantic love story. Chaplin's masterpiece to me was a comedy masterwork.",

            "content": "Sir Charlie Chaplin, wrote many poems on celluloid that were moving with a smile. And here is one of them, that is hilarious and equally good as his other great films. This indeed, is great Chaplin Film that has many moments of comedy and it's situational, believable and slapstick. Chaplin had great stories to tell and indeed he mostly told great stories only. Based on the Klondike Gold Rush of 1890's Chaplin wrote this and made a phenomenal film. Undoubtedly, this was one of the landmark films in terms of setting and cinematography. The climax scene in house, is a treat to watch and is worth the wait till the end of it. I just loved it. But my favorite scene would be the \"roll dance\" with his girl amidst many people. This film boasts of the heroism in the Tramp and at times makes us sympathetic with the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin). If in one scene he is a super dancer, the next one is smart escapist. All along, this film has only one thing and that's Chaplin. Well, I must say he was greatly supported by the cast. The art direction is something that is always great in Chaplin films and here again, it is superb. The set on the top of a snow hill, the falling off of the house, or anything you take it, it's great considering it was in 1925, the film happened. The next best thing is costume design. Now, what we are watching is a 1942 version of the film that was re-edited as Chaplin wanted it to be more precise and focused on the Gold rush itself.There was a Gold Rush, that is rushing for Gold in the snow cold mountains of Alaska, so many Americans rushed there to find gold and indeed, a few found gold too. So this is a film that tells us that story in a way, only Chaplin could do. This is a great film and one the finest films that stood the test of time from 1920's till 2010's.Charlie Chaplin has given us so many remarkable and memorable films that this too stands right up there. A 5/5 for this Chaplin Film too.",

They wear you out, they have high critical acclaim that I just dont seem to get and they are quite often just not entertaining, rewatchable and you would not recommend them to casual audiences.With Chaplin you get no annoying tinting and you instantly get the character of the Tramp and you can totally understand why he was the most successful movie star in the world at this time.Here he looks totally out of place in the harsh winters of Alaska and it seems like he has wandered into the most hostile and realistic western made up to this point. He is absolutely incredible as he balances the line between hilarious and desperation. His character is either suffering from extreme starvation, in extreme danger or depressingly lonely in every part of the movie. It is absolutely nail biting and intense at times but hilarious at the same time.Charlie Chaplin is still one of the most recognized film stars in history and he lives up to the hype.",

The script and the screenplay are just as creative as they come, which was all know they come Charlie Chaplin style, making you laugh all the way. My favorite scene in this movie is where the house was hanging on a cliff, with the Lone Prospector and Big Jim trapped inside. The movie boasts of such amazing screenplay, especially that specific scene.Chaplin's movies have received numerous recognitions for their work and appeal, this movie is no exception it got an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Recording, although it is a silent film. In 1942, Chaplin re-released the movie and in this new version, he added a musical score and a narration which he recorded himself, the original version was a silent film done in 1925.The movie's plot is about a character named The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) whose desire to venture into Alaska to look for gold led him down a path of adventure where he discovered gold and fell in love. In his adventure he met Big Jim McKay and Black Larsen and during a storm all three were trapped in a cabin.While they were tapped in the cabin, they ran out of food and Larsen went out to go search for some, while Big Jim almost ate the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin), as Larsen wasn't back in time and he Big Jim was hungry. The movie then carried on, at the end of the storm, Big Jim unfortunately loses his memory as he battled with Larsen at one point while the Lone Prospector went into town and fell in love with a girl he met at a saloon named Georgia.Although Gold Rush is fun and a nice movie to see, but it is not as great as City Lights which was done six years after. Gold Rush was a box office success gaining over 4 million dollars. The movie made over four times its production cost and it is featured in the AFI's top 100 movies of 100 years (10th Anniversary Edition), there it is rated 58 and it is rated the 25th funniest movies in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs.Charlie Chaplin has been a wonderful actor, director, writer and producer in the many movies that he has done; this is just as much a classic as the others. Gold Rush is fun to watch and you will find yourself laughing your way through.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "review_title": "A charming little silent movie from a legend",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin is a film star who transcends time and not just for those who enjoy silent movies. Chaplin's movies can be enjoyed today as much as they were back when and his physical and in particular his facial expressions are top notch and a must even today for any true comedic actor. With The Gold Rush you get Chaplin at his best comedic wise, and although maybe I don't think right now I think this movie is incredible, I can still see that Charlie Chaplin is one of the best actors of all time. We see our story set in the rugged gold rush times in Alaska and Canada known as the Klondike Gold Rush, Chaplin is a lone prospector and he has come to seek his fortune like many others, but some people will help him whilst others will not.The film is as much at times a drama as it is a comedy mixing gags with truly emotional scenes, Chaplin yet again proves himself not only a great actor, but also a director at that level too. Chaplin's little tramp persona (who kind of reminds me of a penguin) arrives to a stormy place and meets Big Jim McKay who is also a lonely prospector and Black Larsen a wanted criminal. I don't want to go into the plot too much as to not ruin it for those who have yet to see this but over time Chaplin's character comes to love, befriend and well ultimately get into some sticky situations. The story I felt was good fun and although maybe not amazing for me personally, it is still very well played out.Chaplin also writes this movie further proving his absolute brilliance as he basically does everything for this movie. His skill is most plain to see in scenes where his character is being flung around or blown away by the fierce storms, the direction is not only superb but the laughs that can be had are a plenty yet again showing Chaplin's awesome humorous acting. The stunts are really well done as well by all involved, in fact Chaplin seems to make a seemingly normal stunt funny, a certain scene in a cabin off a cliff edge is probably the pick of the scenes for me. This movie also shows us some of Chaplin's most famous moments with the shoes, the dancing rolls and well of course his not unique to this movie but Chaplin's walking stick and hat. I think if you feel before watching this that you won't enjoy silent movies then think again, I myself at the time of this review have not ventured into silent's as much as I would like to have but still know from this that many are enjoyable. Is this Chaplin's greatest work? Well it could be but I do feel his movies in the 1930's are what he will be best remembered for and his highest rated although Chaplin of course wanted to be remembered for this one the most and so he should, it is him at the top of his game, and that's even before he did a lot of his more famous one's. Yes this film is good in my opinion, a very likable little adventure and although one I would not say is great, it is still very much worth watching and again afterwards. It may have aged slightly through time but in any case for a movie like this to be better than most it shows that Chaplin not only understood film making but he actually put it into action, made films people loved and cried at whether that be tears of laughter or emotion and in the end made people happy with his cheeky smile and little moustache.",

One of the last stops in his evolution was The Gold Rush. A lone prospector (Chaplin) finds himself starving and without shelter in the snowy Alaskan wilderness. Caught in of a violent storm, he ends up at the door of a ramshackle cabin whose only inhabitant is the wanted criminal, Black Larson (Tom Murray). Another victim of the storm, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) finds his way to the cabin and the two intruders forcibly establish residence. Larson packs his things and leaves while the two interlopers narrowly avoid starvation as they wait out the weather. They struggle through a Thanksgiving meal of boiled boot before Big Jim, in the midst of delirious starvation, nearly shoots Charlie while hallucinating that he is really a giant chicken. When the friends part company, Big Jim returns to his claim where he is robbed and assaulted by Larson, while Charlie wanders off to the nearest town. In the local saloon, the Monte Carlo, Charlie first sees Georgia (Georgia Hale), a beautiful dance hall girl and gazes at her with wide-eyed wonder as she literally looks right through him. She is pursued by Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite) a 'ladies man' with a confident but brutal disposition. In an effort to force good behavior out of Jack through jealousy, Georgia invites Charlie to dance. \"You see, I'm very particular who I dance with.\" Charlie struggles to retain his dignity and his falling trousers throughout the dance, but finally looses to a dog, whose leash he has unknowingly borrowed as a belt. He attempts to protect Georgia from Jack's unwelcome advances. Jack toys with Charlie, and with his hat pulled over his eyes Charlie punches a post as a clock falls on Jack knocking him out, leaving Charlie to believe he has defended Georgia's honor. The next morning Charlie manages to install himself as the caretaker of another miners cabin and before long the dance hall girls are at his doorstep playing in the snow. Georgia secretly discovers her tattered photo under his pillow and playfully suggests he invite them to dinner. Elated, Charlie suggests New Year's Eve, and the girls accept with no real intention of keeping the date. The smitten little fellow prepares for a party and patiently waits for the girls who never arrive. At this point, as the tramp dreams of what might have been, the film reveals one of the most touching and beautiful scenes Chaplin, or anyone else, ever conceived. \"Speech! Speech!\" \"I'm so h-h-happy - Oh I can't \u0096 \" \"But I'll dance the Oceana Roll.\" In this one exquisite moment the essence of all that Chaplin was, is distilled down to its simplest and most revealing. He wakes, realizes they are not coming and wanders off toward the sounds of singing in the dancehall while at the same time Georgia persuades the girls and Jack to pay Charlie a visit \" \u0085and have a little fun with him.\" Georgia discovers Charlie's preparations in the empty cabin and with shamed remorse admits, \"The joke has gone too far\u0085\" Later, Big Jim returns with claims of finding a \"mountain of gold\" but due to amnesia he can't remember where. Back in the dancehall, Jack sends a love note he received from Georgia to Charlie as a joke, with anticipated results. At the same instant, Big Jim sees Charlie and drags him off to the cabin believing he will now find his claim while Charlie professes his love to a bewildered Georgia. The comic scenes between Chaplin and Swain serve as a brilliant counterpoint to the central story of unrequited love. The final hilarious cabin scene finds the two unaware they are teetering on the edge after a storm nearly blows the cabin over a cliff. With their wealth assured, the two prospectors depart in style while Charlie ponders the tattered but now framed photo he treasures, \"Everything but Georgia.\" With a beautifully played tableau of circumstance and surprise, The Gold Rush concludes as only Chaplin could have imagined it, with the sweetest screen kiss ever filmed.Chaplin spent months in the Sierra Nevada Mountains filming in frigid, snowy weather and used only two short scenes for the finished film. Most of the snow seen in the film is actually rock salt. The original cast included Chaplin's young wife Lita Gray, who appeared as an angel in The Kid (1921). Georgia Hale replaced her when she became pregnant. The boiled boot eaten by Chaplin and Swain for their Thanksgiving meal was actually made of licorice. As was his practice, Chaplin required numerous takes, which caused both actors to become violently ill. The \"Oceana Roll\" stands as one of the most popular images in screen history. Johnny Depp's beautiful homage from Benny & Joon seventy years later serves as proof of it's enduring significance.",

So, while I sat watching this film, I felt I had definitely seen parts before, but I've never watched the whole film in its entirety. Judging a silent film from 1925 is a difficult mandate, but I was honestly never bored with this film, and there were so many great scenes and comedic skits. I laughed when Chaplin's tramp was trying to keep his trouser up and secured an unwanted best friend during a dance sequence.Charlie Chaplin does genius physical comedy as well as acting to boot. Add Mack Swain as Big Jim, and this film is wildly entertaining, as well as showing that silent comedies have the prospect to be comedic gold. I haven't seen the majority of Chaplin's work, but considering the time period and pioneering of visual comedy, I would recommend this to people who want to his work! I don't think is as good as Keaton's 'The General' though, but 'The Gold Rush' is highly regarded as a silent comedy classic. Glad I finally saw it! ****\u00bd out of *****!",

            "content": "I am not sure if it is because there is a problem with the recovery of this film, but I found the cuts in the middle of the film confusing. The linearity of the narrative comes into question as we see Chaplin in the town, then up in the mountains, and back without an apparent transition from the two locations. Chaplin's films unlike Keaton's focus a lot more on his persona and characters around him. While Keaton engages with objects during gags, Chaplin engages with people, and both are equally engaging. Chaplin's tramp persona is always seen as the outcast, and with great composition shots, gains the sympathies of the audience. Examples of this is apparent in the mountain scene when he walks alongside the mountain and his lone figure is contrasted by this enormous mountain. There is also another great shot taken in the dance club where he first meets Georgia, here the camera is located behind Chaplin as he stands in the shadows looking at the dance floor. Both great shots that emphasize his loneliness and separateness from society. While I do enjoy this film, I must confess that Keaton's had me more engaged. Chaplin's gags are either subtle or extravagant and mostly emits from his tramp persona. The most remarkable 'gag' in this film is with the scene in the house, and to be honest, it got a bit repetitive after awhile. It was still enjoyable though.

His exquisite comic timing, his great touch for the funny move, and his willingness to play the fool infused his comedy with such depth and humanity that probably all comedians following him owe him some debt, whether they realize it or not. He took the funny out of the everyday and applied his genius to entertaining by a unique combination of physical comedy, an exquisite human touch, and a sensitive eye for the funny in the mundane. This is one of his masterworks in that mode.Chaplin plays The Tramp joining the troop of hopeful prospectors trying their luck at the Klondike Gold Rush. He encounters an affable lug - Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain) with whom he finds fugitive Black Larsen (Tom Murray) and who they both end up facing off. Charlie ends up overseeing a cabin nearer the center of the gold prospecting and encounters the lovely Georgia (Georgia Hale) who he falls for but who is uninterested in him.The set pieces in this film - Charlie and Big Jim eating a shoe, their cabin balancing on the edge of a cliff, Charlie attempting to avoid a gun being pointed at him when Big Jim and Black fight, and Big Jim imagining that Charlie is a chicken - are hilarious. These are great bits and speak to Chaplin's genius. The film progresses at a steady pace and Chaplin integrates the comedic pieces into the film deftly. He gets good work from actors Tom Murray, Mack Swain, and Georgia Mack. It's a movie everyone should see.",

Characters are not talking but there is a narrator talking instead of there being title cards.There was a time, long ago, when slapstick was still smart. This Charlie Chaplin movie is an example of that era. Gold Rush is actually funny despite the comedy being based on physical slapstick. There are no penis jokes or poop jokes needed to make this movie funny (unlike the modern \"comedies\"). Although most of the comedy comes from Charlie Chaplin's physical hijinks, the commentary of the narrator can be quite witty as well. You will probably not be laughing loudly, but Gold Rush is worth plenty of smiles.The story is about Charlie Chaplin's character in Alaska during the gold rush there. Some of the content in which the film finds its comedy is actually surprisingly macabre. Although the movie is entertaining, it did get a little boring in the middle. The performances are not so captivating and the humour is not so great as to keep you entertained the whole time. Also, the ending seems to be an afterthought. It feels rushed, like the story skips about 10 minutes worth of story that should have explained what happened to a couple of the characters.The movie looks interesting. There are some special effects done using miniatures and a technique whereby the characters from one film are pasted over the background of another film. The shots of mock up models are interchanged with the close up shots of the real thing, like for example there is a live bear involved but during certain scenes it becomes a dude in a costume. The effects look very fake, but nonetheless interesting. In 1925 these were probably really advanced special effects.Gold Rush does not feel particularly special. It just an overall entertaining and well done semi-silent film.",

As such, \"City Lights\" serves as a kind of watershed. His prior work basks in certain boisterousness and hyper-energy that his later work, whilst impeccably refined, does not exhibit to the same degree. Perhaps there is a sense of self- consciousness that many later works display. Perhaps these early works, now that I'm revisiting them so consciously in retrospect, contain more of Chaplin's exuberance. Or then it's just me projecting, aggressively.Be that as it may, \"The Gold Rush\" (1925) is an altogether enchanting film. Tragicomic in its exultation of love on one hand and its portrayal of the love here as a mere fling on the other, there are many wonderful visual moments that have been used to build our cinematic pantheon: the cottage in the storm, the eating of the shoe, the roll dance. And in the midst of the fireworks, there's Chaplin himself, his timing perfectly nuanced, his expressions fresh. He is at his most handsome, charismatic and unforgettable in how he reacts to the roll dance reception \u2013 just look at the man!I prefer the longer, original 1926 cut to the 1942 sound version, mainly because I just can't see the point in having the voice-over. The newer version cuts a few corners, some of which are for the better, and perhaps it is the voice-over that allows Chaplin to do it, but I don't see it as so much tighter a film to encourage myself to revisit it as often as the 1925 cut. The older version breathes and never lags. It could, however, be a nice experience to watch the 1942 cut with the sound off.Whichever your preference, the beautiful Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection (Region A) is worth its weight in gold, as are all their Chaplin releases for that matter.",

It may not be Charles Chaplin's best considering the movies that followed this, but it's a movie to remember for it's humor accompanied by a soothing background score.",

            "content": "This 1925 Chaplin film is probably the one I enjoyed most. I don't know what it was about this film, but I was laughing out loud constantly throughout it. Sure, it doesn't have the strong romance of City Lights (1931), but it is as funny \u0096 perhaps funnier. But when it comes to any film, it is all up to personal preference. Yep, now I think about it, this is my favourite Chaplin movie.Like most Chaplin films, we have the benefit of a simple plot. The Gold Rush is the story of a tramp (Chaplin's classic character) that sets off to Klondike, Alaska during the Gold Rush craze. However he finds much more\u0085 including two, to say the least dodgy characters, which lead to some hilarious situations.The only part that I am not so sure of is the romance between Georgia and The Tramp. She doesn't really seem that nice to him, and compared to his other movies, I wasn't that satisfied at the end, which is very disappointing. This is the reason why it is only nine stars out of ten instead of ten out of ten.I really liked the narration on the DVD version, but I'm not sure why. I know some people think it takes away from the movie, but I am of the opinion that it adds to it. Chaplin has a marvelous speaking voice and I like how he guides the story. Apart from this, the DVD is absolutely the way to go for its crisp, clear picture. You'll find you'll miss some of the jokes if your picture is fuzzy.This Chaplin film, which he wrote and directed (like most of his films), is an absolute masterpiece and a pleasure to watch. Chaplin is a comic genius. Bravo!",

But that's not enough for Charley. He's not satisfied with \"his stomach full\". He needs to dance a folk dance with forks and bread.

            "content": "In the dust of time from \"The gold rush\" (1925) directed by Charlie Chaplin, probably anybody still alive in Hollywood forgot the scene where the explorer is inside the hut near an abyss, from a valley around the mountains, during the eve of new year within bad weather and almost nothing warming the place, just when he is eating the threads of his shoes - perhaps giving the environment not so better than like boiled spaghetti - and the nails as chicken's bones. This is all about stock change in Chaplin's golden style, acting with a really experienced way of life inspired certainly in his own childhood, surely also by any other improvisation on the spot and probably, who knows, in an anodyne story of gold's searchers in California. He is in this extraordinary scene that took anybody who would be with this fate, if possible across the dream of that character on the silent screen in the aftermath and during his own sleeping pleasure, before wake up going out for the girl. Later, Chaplin already as a young and competitive millionaire, plays with fair play his old character as in the past, like a poor miner searching gold - when in situation during a last scene, at the liner on the deck, in a rivalry with his fat partner - in a mimic specially for the press and just before the encounter with the same woman, who was his own pleasure and now is already there too in the same place but without each other knowing it, for the moment. The purpose now of this movie it is enchanting our common lost memory of the past development and technology, that put still any society of settlers in turmoil when people is at the brink of a discovery so important as gold it was - as merchandising an equalizer for the grains of stone - as though like him one quickly should getting wealth at any price at the time. The ridiculousness of the main character, as imported tramp of this past world, if he exists as model still now is like less a pattern of unrest, because hungry animated by his mental comfort in dream but supposed as illness in the reality since then until to the present and past future. It was by no means Charlie your campaigner, conceived as a poor gentleman in this gamble of surviving and a rich tramp coming up in solidarity with his fellow citizens, even if he doesn't cope anymore at any price except with humor and cruelty for rivalries to return home alive. The scene where we saw the big bear coming up from the cavern, in the snowed and cold mountain during the bad weather, pursuing the little man and forcing this one slipping down the path on the border of the hill, as if he was escaping from the fire with gracious preciosity, it is the reverse of a human being in the role of an animal in its complicity for shared savagery in the unknown territory. There are many aspects of this movie which are still intriguing the hardiness from the construction of the plot, as though each time we saw it, it's another different movie as sensation and feeling of great emotion on the screen's pictures. That means probably its strength about suggestion in the viewer of today in it, by our collective memory naturally changes from the silent cinema to the sound and even if with its musicality additions over the sights, after a second version of the same movie with less length since then. Because also of many ingredients in it, such as the dream above the reality on the fiction there, it was too like the character of the fat gold prospector, who for a while forgot the location of the hut where it was his discovery and the only who knew the place in which it is, was Charlie.",

The story is, as always on Chaplin's part, very beautiful and touching, conveying a positive message and strong moral values. This movie contains some of the most iconic scenes of silent movies. The only snag I have with this movie is its sudden end about Chaplin's love interest for Georgia, and Georgia has not convinced me. The impression she gave me was that she did not love him but rather felt sorry for him, which at least is already a step in becoming more human, and when finding that he became millionaire she seemed only more relieved (financially) than properly happy - unless both money and happiness are the same to her. And this is the only reason why I cannot score this movie more than 7/10.",

            "content": "Of 1925's THE GOLD RUSH, Charlie Chaplin said this was the one movie he always wanted to be remembered by. He was an idol of my father when he was a boy, and when I was ten during the summer of 1975, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation began airing Chaplin's silents on Sunday nights. As we sat in front of the television, Dad introduced me to the Little Tramp, beginning with THE GOLD RUSH, followed by CITY LIGHTS, MODERN TIMES, THE GREAT DICTATOR, and MONSIEUR VERDOUX.Looking back on it today, I think that was his way of passing down a family heirloom to me. Then... for many years, I went without ever seeing a Chaplin film until the late Eighties when, in conjunction with his centenary, they debuted on home videocassette. Watching them all over again with adult eyes, I realized for the first time just how much of a genius Chaplin really was.Chaplin's inspiration for THE GOLD RUSH derived from two iconic moments. The first was the ill-fated 19th century Donner party, a lost group of greenhorns attempting to cross the Continental Divide who resorted to cannibalism in order to stay alive. The second was a famous photograph of prospectors ascending the Chilkoot Pass in the Klondike. Because replicating that image in the actual location was not feasible for the film, Chaplin recreated it at a place in the the Sierra Nevadas called Truckee.As it turned out, that recreation of Chilkoot Pass was the only exterior shot Chaplin filmed in Truckee. Many crew members suffered frostbite due to the cold, leaving him to close up shop and head back to his studio in Hollywood where it would be more comfortable. Well.... about as comfortable as one can be wearing snow gear in southern California.",

In this masterpiece, which Chaplin prevalent made, consist one of the best performance by the exalted Chaplin. A performance at the dinner, yeah guys, these dancing bread !! Nowadays, you can't call it as acting, we call it as pure talent.Prevailing habits of the audience while witnessing another Chaplin, the feelings of another inspiration, another humanity, another huge applause, and of course another cry. I never understand why he always successfully did it, such a prosperous masterpiece maker. We don't talk about ecclesiastical or pious on Chaplins. He was secular but as triumphant humanism, noble as film-maker. Chaplin is a generous elite that dare and care to us, the next generation. He taught us so many universality which distilled by every scenes within silence. Maybe haunting the viewers with his creation was his hobby. Bring the reconciliation after fights, bring the light after darkness, and bring a smile after sadness, that was Chaplin could do. That was proved for every generation whose already watch his creations. Thank you Chaplin.. from your biggest fan.. 23 years-old boy..",

            "content": "8.0 of 10 stars. Most respected Film Historians would say that Charlie Chaplin Directed 15-20 masterpieces during his career, and this would certainly include 'The Gold Rush' from 1925. No argument here, this is a truly great piece of filmed cinema, a masterpiece. His 15-20 masterpieces are about an even mix of full length feature films and short length films, probably 9-10 of each.'The Gold Rush' was not only Directed by Charlie Chaplin, but he also Produced, wrote the Music and Starred in it, which is the case with almost all of the Films that he Directed. This film has so many legendary scenes, with 'the dancing rolls' being one of the most famous short scenes in the history of filmed cinema. It is Masterful, the way he uses his eyes and eyebrows, it's simple but magical. Chaplin stars in this film alongside Mack Swain and Tom Murray, and they both do an extremely good job in this Film. Georgia Hale has a smaller but critical part in the film and she is tremendous, jumps off the screen and is somehow able to show the vulnerability on a level that Chaplin does, which is saying a ton. Her role also calls for her to show opposite traits at the same time-adamant conceit while having a dainty vulnerability at the same time, and it works tremendously good, she is great in the role.Chaplin was the first to really put multiple emotions in the same Film-mixing humor, sadness, vulnerability, glory, failure, triumph, undertones, overtones. The viewer could not only laugh or cry in the same Movie, but sometimes even in the same scene. It's not that he was the first Director to do it or Pioneer this concept, though that is special in itself; but what makes him so influential and legendary, and what makes him, 110 years later, still on the forefront of today's great Directors, Actors and Historians minds is the fact that he did it so masterfully, so well.I once heard a respected Film Historian say that the best Director and the best Actor in the history of Hollywood are one and the same person, Charlie Chaplin. I do not believe that Chaplin is the best Director ever, but I do believe he remains one of the 10 best ever. In my opinion, the 10 best Director's of all-time are (listed in order from oldest to newest): Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, John Cassavetes, Martin Scorsese, Stephen Spielberg, The Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson.Chaplin also remains one of the most influential Director's of all-time, and most all in that Top 10 are. Chaplin helped define what Motion Pictures could be, period. Hollywood's first huge star, and still almost 110 years later his image is still recognized by almost everyone, even kids that have never watched a Chaplin movie; but they somehow know his image and if shown the image, they know it's Chaplin, like it's born into us at birth. Never has there been an Actor/Director that we can say that about, other than Chaplin. And during the 1920s when this Film was released, it can't be overstated, he was the biggest Star and the most recognizable person in the World; and the highest paid employee in the World.In my opinion, 'The Gold Rush' is his best Film, 'thee' masterpiece of a man that made many. It has almost become a National pastime for Film Historians to argue what the best Chaplin Films are. I believe if we talked to the 100 most respected Film Historians around the World, they would all have slightly different orders, but I think this would be their consensus; the Top 10 Films Directed by Charlie Chaplin:1. City Lights (1931) 2. Modern Times (1936) 3. The Circus (1928) 4. The Kid (1921) 5. The Gold Rush (1925) 6. The Great Dictator (1940) 7. Limelight (1952) 8. Monsier Verdoux (1947) 9. The Idle Class (1921-short film) 10. A Dog's Life (1918-short film)I would have a slightly different order, and I would include 'A Woman Of Paris' (the only masterpiece that he Directed but did not Star in). My order would be:1. The Gold Rush (1925) 2. The Kid (1921) 3. A Woman Of Paris (1923) 4. Modern Times (1936) 5. City Lights (1931) 6. The Circus (1928) 7. A Dog's Life (1918-short film) 8. Limelight (1952) 9. Monsier Verdoux (1947) 10. The Great Dictator (1940)The Gold Rush is a must see, a truly great piece of Filmed Cinema.",

            "review_title": "Reel Look: 'The Gold Rush'",
            "content": "\"But I'll dance the Oceana Roll!\" In Chaplin's 1925 silent comedy classic 'The Gold Rush', the Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin) is faced with a whole slew of hardships and challenges, such as biting, blistering winds, near starvation and leaping out of a cabin right before it plummets off of a cliff! And all for the sake of seeking fame and fortune, respectively. To upset matters worse, his ill-gotten attire market him as the mockery for the buffoonery of his comrades and the ruthless rigors of the frigid trek northward. However, real prospectors of the late nineteenth century as part of the Klondike Gold rush faced somewhat similar predicaments. Some came from many walks of life, some as far as the United Kingdom, South Africa and Australia. Most were perfectly aware that the chances of finding significant amounts of gold were very slim and just went along for the adventure, despite what hardships they might face, even through if it meant trenching up the discouraging but enduring Chilkoot Pass in the hopes of gaining their own individual fortunes. Prospectors had to build rafts and boats that would take them the final five-hundred plus miles down the Yukon to Dawson City, near the gold fields. Also, they had to carry a year's supply of goods over the passes to be allowed to enter Canada. About a ton, more than half of it, was food. Regarding history, I believe that some of it matches what 'The Gold Rush' portrays in the film. During the picture in the beginning, many men were carrying goods on their backs or pulling them on sleds, just like during the real Klondike expedition. However, do the prospectors that endure the frigid winds and blinding snow in a vain search for valuable, shiny nuggets depict the accuracy of what occurred in real life back then? Let's take a look.In silent films of that particular era, the challenges of acting and portraying emotions were only emphasized by the faces of the actors and the music being played in the background. Since sound was not an option yet, the viewer could only discern what the actor or actress was trying to do or say through their face or body language, and lines were shown on the screen so that the viewer could read them and follow the plot throughout the film. In the movies of today, regarding modern culture, sound has much improved. With the latest sound equipment, viewers no longer have to rely on reading lines on the screen but can enjoy listening to them being spoken, and to be alert for the tone of voice that the actor or actress is using to define the emotions given. Also, actors and actresses can actually declare their emotions out loud to each other and to the viewer as well. The film did however manage to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Sound Recording nonetheless. Besides the sound quality, this silent gem is also loaded with adventure, love, greed and with Chaplin, laughter, of course, this being a dramatic comedy. With the infamous scene of the dancing dinner rolls to Chaplin cooking and eating his own shoe and, in the eyes of the ravenous eyes of Big Jim (Mack Swain) when the Lone Prospector turns into a giant strutting chicken as they have been holed up in a food-deprived cabin belonging to the renegade Black Larsen (Tom Murray), each bout of hilarity is as endearing and timeless as the next. Though the Lone Prospector doesn't get the gold in the end, at least he gets something of more worth: the girl (the lovely Georgia Hale)!",

Regardless of the situation, the Tramp always manages to stay true to himself and his ideals and Chaplin's characters always stand up for themselves and for the leading lady, in this film her name is Georgia. Despite the dangers that the Alaskan frontier poses, from bears to storms to murderers and falling cabins, Chaplin always manages to bring his unique laugh out loud humor to nearly every scene. At the end of the movie when Big Jim and the Tramp sail home as millionaires and the Tramp was asked to dress up in his prospecting clothes for a photo shoot I thought for sure the authorities were going to arrest him as a stowaway but happily he wasn't and he even reunited with Georgia. The last scene with the two of them kissing was so touching it made me think that maybe Chaplin had an affair with the actress in real life. I hope so because they looked great together. Also impressive is the scenery and the special effects.

            "content": "\"The Gold Rush\" has very realistic effects for being filmed in 1925. For instance even though this movie was filmed on Hollywood sets, it really looked as if all the characters were actually in the mountains of Alaska. The cabin, the clothing, the town, everything really helped to set the mood that they were actually there. The effect when the house is hanging off the mountain actually seemed real! Whenever there was too much weight on the side of the house which was over the cliff, the house would actually tip, with all of the items inside it sliding. This seems very good effects for the '20s. I also enjoyed the effects when Charlie Chaplin's character faded in and out from being a chicken, to the tramp.The comedy also seemed genius for the time. Many of the humorous parts that happened throughout the movie, you still see in movies now. Even though there is no dialogue, you really get what is happening. For example, when Charlie's character completely trashes the apartment because he is so excited that Georgia has agreed to come to dinner, and then Georgia returns because she has forgotten her gloves, and the tramp is humiliated. This similar scene was in the movie \"Just Friends\" with Ryan Reynolds. Also the scene where the tramp is dancing with Georgia and his pants will not stay up, and he accidentally ties the dog leash around his waist; you could definitely see where that would be in any sort of modern day comedy. What a great movie for being almost 90 years old!",

Chaplin's performance as \"The Lone Prospector\" isn't just funny, but endearing and personal as well. It's clear that a lot of soul was put into the performance. The scene where Chaplin anticipates Georgia(Georgia Hale) and her crew's arrival on New Year's Eve, for instance, is both funny and deeply sentimental. Chaplin has the charm and presence of a cartoon character. Nintendo's \"Super Mario\" comes to mind(who was undoubtedly(at least indirectly)influenced by Chaplin's Little Tramp character). About 25 minutes through the film, Chaplin's character makes himself a ridiculous looking new boot(after eating his old one), and it remains with for the rest of the movie. It's very humorous, and it's just one of the subtle charms of the character(and the movie). Mack Swain as Big Jim Mckay is hilarious as well. Him and Chaplin are great together.",

However I was surprised to see how well together it was considering how low key technology was back then compared to today. The over acting and the music had me both laughing at the comedy and paying more attention to the serious parts, even without the spoken words from the actors. \"The Gold Rush\" kept my attention from beginning to end and made me interested in seeing more silent movies. The storyline was well put together and I can see that type of story happening even today. Overall it was a very good experience to watch this movie and I would recommend it.",

I have to say I really enjoyed it. I was very impressed with both the writing and acting in Gold Rush. Going into it I was somewhat expecting see a lot of random slapstick comedy and a disorganized story. However, the movie actually had a very coherent and entertaining plot. Charlie's acting was phenomenal in my opinion. His facial expressions and demeanor were really effective. Also, just the way he moved and his behavior were hilarious. I also thought all of the gags and physical comedy in the movie were great. While watching it I noticed that a lot of the jokes were predictable to me because I've seen similar things in so many other films. (For example; when Charlie and the minor, who had been looking for Charlie, crossed paths without noticing one another.) This is really interesting because guys like Chaplin were pioneers in film comedy and were the first to use a lot of these comedic techniques.",

I thought that a silent film wouldn't be too exciting, however, I had never really seen an entire film of this sort. The Gold Rush was confusing for me at first, I didn't understand what was going on when the scenes switched from being in the middle of nowhere, to being in a small town. Other than that, I appreciated the fact the Charlie Chaplin was so innovative, and his camera skills were impressive for the 1920's. The acting was humorous and understandable. It was surprisingly easy for me to relate to the characters because of their exaggerated facial expressions and body language. The only part of the film I did not like was when the house was falling of the cliff, it was a little too obvious that it wasn't real, but then again there weren't the same technological advances then as there are now. Overall, The Gold Rush was a great silent film for my first experience.",

            "content": "Perhaps one of the finest films I've ever seen and one of Chaplins best. The film never lets up, either with moments of comedy or high drama. This is what Chaplin does best, one moment you'll be laughing at a brilliant piece of comedy and in the next scene he'll sucker punch you with some drama and leave you heartbroken only to have you laughing in the scene following. The only complaint I have about this film is the soundtrack to the version we watched in class. Granted it is a silent film but the music just seemed too overbearing and unnecessarily loud at times. When we first see Chaplin strolling through the wilderness and his cane falls through the snow there is an overly loud explosion of sound that really takes you out of the moment. Besides the music this is a very well crafted film and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who could sit through a silent film.",

I had heard of Charlie Chaplin in my travels but never could truly understand what the craze was about until i saw him in action for the first time. His Ability to capture the audience in a spell of wonder, excitement, and laughter is nothing short of amazing, considering its release date and the fact that it is a silent film. Chaplin is an artist, and entertaining an audience is simply his canvas. His over-exaggerated gestures, facial features, and appearance all add to the magic of his character. The movie itself didn't so much stand out to me, I knew it was about a Gold Rush but, I was more interested in Chaplins performance and his interactions with other actresses and actors of that time period. The film itself held pleasing visuals, once again, considering that it was 1925. All in all the film was delightful, it was my first silent film and was enjoyable. Just imagine if some of todays blockbusters were dubbed silent, most of the \"actors\" wouldn't be able to hold the shortened attention span of the present day audiences for more than thirty seconds!",

However the entrance titles definitely helped explain exactly what was going on in the film. Although i did find the story line rather hard to follow. With that said I was very impressed with how good the actors really were for this being such an early film, all the dancing was great and the outfits all seemed to go together pretty well as well as fit the time period. This was my first silent film and I enjoyed it it made me laugh; however, I must say that I'm extremely please with how far technology has come seeing as how now we are able to watch DVDs in color and hear sound and all the crazy lighting and camera effects we are now able to enjoy!",

I've always thought that Charlie Chaplin was a genius and it shows in this film extraordinarily. This film is the perfect film to start with if your a beginner in watching silent films, or even classic movies in general. The film keeps the viewer entertained and it's hard to find a boring part although some points are rather repetitive. One of the best parts of the film is that dialogue is not necessary, the antics in the film speak for themselves. All in all I would give this film an 8 out of 10 because it's such an entertaining movie that anyone can watch, it doesn't matter if your not into classic films, or silent films for that matter, the comedy featured is classic and transcends time and CC is an absolute comedic genius and icon.",

I think this is a true talent because it is easier to tell the audience how you are feeling instead of acting it out. I love how the movie resembles the American dream. After his long adventure, the man found millions and ended up with the women of his dreams.I was a little disappointed when the acts would go on for to long.

            "content": "Living in an age where the norm in cinema is heavy action, verbal comedy, and almost all the visuals are done with special effects, Charlie Chaplin's Gold Rush is something I watched out of boredom and did not expect to be as good as it is. It is one of the few films out there that received a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was a film released in 1925, originally silent, then later music and a voice over was added and it was re released in 1942. It does not matter which version you watch, although I suggest that if you want a more immersive experience, the 1942 version is the way to go. In its original release alone, it pulled $1 million dollars into United Artists, and $2 million to Chaplin. This was in 1926!\nGetting into the nitty-gritty of this film, this is some of Chaplin's best work in my opinion. Although the story is basic and scenes are easily predictable, it is still a great laugh to watch. This film has some great examples of how Chaplin liked to direct and make his films.He takes a basic scenario where we as the viewer think we know exactly what will happen. \"Oh his pants are falling so he'll take that rope he eyed on the table and tie it around his waist.\" This is the first step of reality. Then in typical Chaplin fashion, he flip reality on us. \"He's used the rope to hold up his pants, but its the leash to a dog!\" That's how most if not all of Chaplin's jokes work. Camera angle also plays into effect here. We only see the rope on the table Chaplin wants to use. But what we can't see from this angle is the dog laying on the floor, tied to the rope. This how the majority of the jokes play out in this movie and although it is a bit old school to do it this way, it makes the movie great!\nThe characters and story in this film are also fantastic! You have the prospector (Charlie Chaplin), the disposable bad guy(Tom Murray), the friend(Mack Swain), the love interest(Georgia Hale), and the cocky ladies man(Malcom Waite). Like I said before, the story is at its root pretty basic,(boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back) but its the jokes and how the story is played out that makes this so enjoyable. \nClosing up, this film is not only a great work of Chaplin, but of cinema. Chaplin some years later had said that this was the film he wanted to be remembered for. The filming is good, the characters, the visuals, the story. Its all a hilarious classic adventure. Definitely watch this if you have time, it will be time well spent.",

Him and the actors and actresses in this film are spectacular in showing emotion such as sadness, happiness, and going a little bit insane since no words are said in the actual film. I enjoyed the comedy in this film; it was simple yet affective to put a smile on my face at some points and it kind of reminded me of \"The Three Stooges\" at one point. The music did a great job in expression as well when there was a fight, a sad moment, a happy moment, or a moment that is supposed to be a little silly. I also like how they included folk songs such as \"Loch Lomond\" in the middle of the film and \"Auld Lang Syne\" in the dance hall scene on New Year's Eve. All in all, this was a great movie and I would highly recommend it to a person who may want to see a silent movie.",

            "content": "Chaplin's biggest, most well known film (includes his most famous routine, the 'bread rolls dance' along with a handful of others, including my favourite, the boot gourmet dinner, which is made significantly more entertaining thanks to Chaplin's facial quirks and subtle comic timing) and the one he wanted to be remembered for, remains one of the greatest films ever made (although not his best, believe it or not! The man truly was a genius). Not only is it a triumph of pathos but also a brilliant achievement in film-making. Expansive set-pieces, technical wizardry and some of Chaplin's finest, most inventive tomfoolery. Some have argued that this film lacks the potent emotional drive or social commentary his other masterpieces had in abundance, but the New Year's Eve dinner sequence is truly heartbreaking, and the thousands of prospectors trudging up into the grim cold mountains in desperate search for gold at a time of depression provides a realistic, gritty backdrop against which the comedy can slowly and precariously unwind. I was a little troubled by the anti-climatic ending which didn't sit in too well with the rest of the film (he's with a woman who, while being the girl of his dreams, has already shown to have no affection for him whatsoever, only pity, and is more interested in a brutish womaniser) but up till then it's pure gold. Chaplin directs with a level of intimacy and restraint well ahead of his time. Also, Neil Brand's piano accompaniment is a welcome touch to this restored version I watched. Chaplin is undoubtedly the most famous figure in the history of cinema, and this film lends substantial weight to the argument that he was also the greatest.",

However, from a modern standpoint, it was not the funniest film I've seen.Charlie's choice of clothing was a commentary in and of its self. His clothes were almost clown-like, from the oversized pants to the shoes that were two sizes too big. He bore a striking resemblance to a clown of that era. However, his clothes were also quite dapper. His cane and bowler hat made him look more like a gentleman.Charlie Chaplin was well versed in roles in the film industry. He acted in, directed, and composed music for The Gold Rush. He was a brilliant and genius actor for his time.From a plot perspective, the movie is very weak. It is lacking in the necessary elements to give the story depth, such as character development, and a strong goal that the characters are striving to compete. It's also very predictable, they get the gold, they lose the gold, they get the gold again and consequently win the girl. The storyline isn't the main focus. rather the humorous incidents within the film - were meant to be the main focus.",
