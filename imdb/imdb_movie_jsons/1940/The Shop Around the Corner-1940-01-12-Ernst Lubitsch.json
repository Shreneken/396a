            "content": "I am not sure whether I can add to the other reviewers here about the gem that is The Shop Around the Corner. It is beautiful, funny and touching and one of those perfect films really. It looks stunning, has deft direction from the great Ernst Lubitsch, has a truly sweet and romantic ending and has a beautifully-balanced script. I do agree to some extent the story is thin, but it is full of charm, wit and such that you actually ignore that, while the film is a good length and moves briskly.The acting from the two leads are delightful. James Stewart is perfect as Alfred, this film and his performance deserves to be up there with his other great films/performances It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, Rear Window, Philadelphia Story, Anatomy of a Murder and Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Margaret Sullivan is the epitome of grace and warmth as Klara, and Frank Morgan provides impeccable support as Hugo.All in all, a lovely little film as funny and moving as it is beautiful and charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The supporting cast is outstanding - from the always-likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career. He takes the film and turns it around into a whole different mood for awhile when something dramatic happens to him. That \"twist\" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind.Once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of that. In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I'll take this over the re-make \"You've Got Mail,\" any day. No comparison.",

His legacy is an outstanding group of movies that will live forever, as is the case with \"The Shop Around the Corner\". This film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr. Lubitsch's own, and definite version.Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in several films together. Their characters in this movie stand out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to be acting at all. Both stars are delightful as the pen pals that don't know of one another, but who fate had them working together in the same shop in Budapest.The reason why these classic films worked so well is the amazing supporting casts the studios put together in picture after picture. In here, we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, playing the owner of the shop. Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, doing impressive work in making us believe that yes, they are in Budapest.That is why these films will live forever!",

            "content": "With a very good cast, a nice blend of wit and sentiment, and many other pluses, this classic remains as enjoyable and charming as ever.  The fluffy but pleasant story benefits greatly from the Lubitsch touch, since he had the knack of giving significance to little things without taking them or himself too seriously.  Presenting his characters honestly yet sympathetically, he makes the somewhat contrived situation seem believable and worth caring about.  Its appeal comes across as almost effortless, but you only have to compare it with the less effective 90's remake to see how important the right touch is with this kind of story.The atmosphere of life in the Budapest shop is set up efficiently and convincingly, and the cast all settle into their roles seamlessly.  As the leads, Jimmy Stewart works perfectly, of course, and Margaret Sullavan conveys the right balance of spunkiness and vulnerability.  Felix Bressart is invaluable, giving perhaps the finest performance among his many character roles.  In some of his scenes, he barely has to say a word to make you smile.  Frank Morgan is surprisingly good in a role rather different than usual for him, Joseph Schildkraut is effectively oily as the deceitful Vadas, and the others all help out, too.  Lubitsch gives all of the characters a chance to come to life without pretense, just by using simple details effectively.It all fits together very well, moves at just the right pace, and makes you a part of the characters' world.  It makes for a very enjoyable movie that holds up very well even after several viewings.",

            "review_title": "A Nearly Perfect Little Romance",
            "content": "A warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it. The key to this film's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key, unfussy performances. As a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them.There's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by Frank Morgan. He discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it. This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met. Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy.Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well.This is a wonderful, unsung romance.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Splendid romantic comedy and referenced as an over the top classic . It is set in a small Budapest shop called \"Matuschek's\" (proprietor Frank Morgan) , it is the known and gossip-ridden gift shop around the corner. Among the clerks are Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) , Klara (Margaret Sullavan) , and others (Joseph Schildkraut , Sara Haden , Felix Bressart , Inez Courtney) , all of them form the shop staff at logger-heads in Matuschek's emporium . Alfred is a sympathetic young man who's in love with a woman he has never met and whose name he doesn't even know . When Klara comes to work as a clerk in the shop, the sparks begin to fly : she and Alfred don't get along. Of course, what neither knows is that Klara is the woman Alfred has been romancing via a lonely hearts club . Alfred slowly realises that he has been carrying on an anonymous romance by letter .\nUnforgettable characters, enjoyable dialogue , lots of laughs, one of the best films of the cinema history and of one the best Lubitsch, a real cinema classy . A charming and attractive portrayal of ordinary people in ordinary situations . Adapted from the Nikolaus Laszlo's play : Parfumerie , later made into a musical show titled \u00a8In the Good Old Summertime\u00a8 , and , on Broadway \u00a8She loves me\u00a8. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan give top-notch interpretations as a young duo who are feuding clerks and unknownly fall in love through the mail . Teaming Stewart , Sullavan and Frank Morgan just as in \u00a8Frank Borzage's The mortal storm\u00a8 shot the same year , this also concerns a troublesome love story in Central Europe , though here the threat is not Nazism but the intereference of others and pride . It is a wonderfully delicate comedy , finally very stirring and exciting ; including the twisted as well as troubled intrigues among the staff also carrying narrative weight and especially dealing with a peculiar \"romance\" that has been conducted through a post office box . Phenomenal secondary cast , such as : Joseph Schildkraut , Sara Haden , Felix Bressart , William Tracy and the honest , agreeable proprietor , Frank Morgan , being especially affecting and moving .This low-key motion picture was stunningly directed by Ernest Lubitsch , and all scenes were reportedly shot in sequence ; being throughly different from his classic movie \u00a8To Be or not to Be\u00a8, but just as entertaining and exhilarating . It is one of the few movies truly justifying Lubitsch's reputation for his famous \u00a8Touch\u00a8. It was later turned into a musical comedy as In the Good Old Summertime . Lubitsch's breakthrough film came in 1918 with \"The Eyes of the Mummy\", a tragedy starring future Hollywood star Pola Negri. Also that year he made Carmen (1918), again with Negri, a film that was commercially successful on the international level. His work already showed his genius for catching the eye as well as the ear in not only comedy but historical drama. The year 1919 found Lubitsch directing seven films, the two standouts being his lavish Madame DuBarry (1919) with two of his favorite actors--Negri (yet again) and Emil Jannings. His other standout was the witty parody of the American upper crust, \"The Oyster Princess\" 1919 . This film was a perfect example of what became known as the Lubitsch style, or the \"Lubitsch Touch\", as it became known--sophisticated humor combined with inspired staging that economically presented a visual synopsis of storyline, scenes and characters. Lubitsch directed a lot of comedies and vintage movies , such as : \u00a8Heaven can wait\u00a8, \u00a8That uncertain feeling\u00a8, \u00a8Ninotchka\u00a8, \u00a8Bluebeard's eight wife\u00a8, \u00a8Angel\u00a8, \u00a8The merry widow\u00a8, \u00a8The Student Prince\u00a8, \u00a8So this is Paris\u00a8, \u00a8Lady Windermere's fan\u00a8, \u00a8The marriage circle\u00a8, \u00a8One Arabian night\u00a8, \u00a8Passion\u00a8, \u00a8Gypsy blood\u00a8, among others . Rating : 8/10 . Better than average .",

            "content": "This, despite not being the original - it began life as a play in Central Europe - has weathered the several incarnations that followed (MGM's own remake with period songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, even the excellent theatre revival in Paris a couple of years ago) and remains the definitive version and the one they all have to beat. Several previous commenters have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable not least being the prevailing fashion in 30s and 40s Hollywood for lavishing attention and detail on ensemble playing rather than just two leads as so often happens today - try, for example, removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you'd still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they'd just be frosting without the rich cake mixture below. Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan WERE both ideal and irreplaceable leads but how much brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Hardy's Sara Haden and this is BEFORE we factor in that Lubitsch 'touch'. Okay, maybe they WERE a tad more naive, innocent even, in that Jurassic Age but how many genuine film lovers, sated with scatology, screwing and in-your-face sex, turn back to those days of Stories, Style, Slickness and Skill and wallow in great movies like this one. By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but DVD that can at one and the same time make these classics available to nostalgics and show the Matrix freaks how the big boys used to do it.",

He offered me one chance to show him a movie that proved cinema's worth as an art form.I chose \"The Shop Around the Corner.\" It's neither highbrow nor lowbrow, it's neither epic nor a silly bit of froth, it's not a genre or a formula picture, and it's about nothing bigger than decency and love (which are plenty big enough). It is, however, flawless, both funny and touching, and I thought it was a fair representation of how superb even modest films can be, and therefore a fair test of how open-minded my friend was.\"Powerfully flavored,\" was his summation, and he was impressed enough to begin seeing movies again (the last one he'd seen on a big screen was \"Lawrence of Arabia\").

When Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) seeks a job position of saleswoman in the store, Matuschek hires her but Kralik and she do not tolerate each other. Meanwhile the lonely and dedicated Kralik has an unknown pen pal that he intends to propose very soon; however, he is fired without explanation by Matuschek in the night that he is going to meet his secret love. He goes to the bar where they have scheduled their meeting with his colleague Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) and he surprisingly finds that Klara is his correspondent; however, ashamed with the unemployment, he does not disclose his identity to her. When Matuschek discovers that he had misjudged Kralik and committed a mistake, he hires him again for the position of manager. But Klara is still fascinated with her future fianc\u00e9 and does not pay much attention to Kralik. \"The Shop around the Corner\" is a delightfully naive romance, and this is the type of film that deserves to be watched many times. It is charming and innocent, and James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan show a wonderful chemistry even in their arguments. I love this period of classic romantic comedies when society was satisfied with a screenplay that does not need to use sex scenes and other diversion but great dialogs supported by outstanding direction and acting. In 1998, Nora Ephron updated this film with the remake \"You've Got Mail\" without any reference to the work of Ernest Lubitsch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"A Loja da Esquina\" (\"The Shop around the Corner\")",

Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only \"villian\" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart.",

            "content": "Much about love & life can be learned from watching the folks at THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his longtime collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from a cast of abundantly talented performers, he created a truly memorable movie. Always believing in playing up to the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication over slapstick, the director concocted a scintillating cinematic repast seasoned with that elusive, enigmatic quality known as the \u0091Lubitsch touch.'Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a jumble of accents among the players) this is of no consequence. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any great American city or small town could easily be the locus for the action.Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing it. Their dialogue - so adeptly handled as to seem utterly natural - perfectly conveys their confusion & quiet desperation as they seek for soul mates. Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his little world is shattered when he finds himself to be a cuckold. An accomplished scene stealer, he allows no emotion to escape unvented. Additionally, Morgan provides the film with its most joyous few moments - near the end - when he determines that his store's newest employee, an impoverished youth, enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve.Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid depiction to his roster of screen portrayals, this time that of a toadying, sycophantic Lothario who thoroughly deserves the punishment eventually meted out to him. Gentle Felix Bressart has his finest film role as a family man who really can not afford to become involved in shop intrigues, yet remains a steadfast friend to Stewart.Sara Haden graces the small role of a sales clerk. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious errand boy who takes advantage of unforeseen developments to leverage himself onto the sales force.In tiny roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Movie mavens will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother & aunt.",

There is not a shot, a line, a performance, or a moment in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER that isn't exactly right.  Everything fits together and runs like a Swiss watch.With its flawless screenplay and cast, it's the most subtle, discreet, and understated of romantic comedies.  What other film manages to be so warm-hearted yet so rigorously unsentimental?  What other movie story is so exquisitely planned and executed?Margaret Sullaven isn't sexy, it's true, but this isn't a film about sex. It's about love in the human heart and mind.  A sexier actress would have thrown things out-of-balance.  As always, Lubitsch knew exactly what he was doing.  Just as he knew ace comedian Frank Morgan (the WIZARD OF OZ's Wizard) had hidden depth, which this film so beautifully reveals.They don't make them like this anymore -- they didn't make them like this back then, either.  SHOP was under-rated in 1940, when it appeared.  It's simply too subtle, too intelligent and disciplined for the average viewer or critic.Nothing overdone or exaggerated.  Nothing out-of-place.

This annoys Alfred and both he and Klara take an instant dislike to each other, completely unaware that they are I fact both each others lonely hearts pen pal.Boy oh boy was this production in safe hands. Produced and directed by the fabulous Ernst Lubitsch (\"To Be Or Not To Be\" & \"Heaven Can Wait\") and starring James Stewart (take your pick of many classics), Margaret Sullavan (\"The Good Fairy\" & \"So Red the Rose\") and Frank Morgan (\"The Wizard Of Oz\"). Adapted by Samson Raphaelson from Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3's play (\"Parfumerie\"), The Shop Around The Corner ranks up with the best of the romantic comedies from the classic era. Blending charm with community spirit, and dark moments with beams of light, it's a concocted remedy for the blues at a time when war was at the forefront of everyone's minds.Unashamedly sweet as it is, it's important to note the intricacies of the plot, with people being desperate for work, even forming rivalries within the confines of the shop, they even manage to flesh out an infidelity arc to really keep the viewer on their respective toes. All the efforts here are first class, Stewart gives the kind of performance that is often overlooked, no middle America \"Aww Shucks\" on show here, it's precise and with feeling, this is a truly great Stewart performance.Sullavan is sadly something of a forgotten actress, and her films are so hard to find as well, it's a shame because she's right on the money and matches Stewart pound for pound in both humorous and emotive acting. Director Lubitsch once said that for human comedy he was never as on form as he was with The Shop Around The Corner, so who wishes to argue with that? Because the evidence suggests he was right, and I can only add that it is not merely just a romantic comedy, it's an experience all around the table - and then some. 9/10.",

Oddly set in Budapest in a small gift and accessory shop, the place runs with the precision of the army, but with warmth and comradarie among the employees. Although made 80 years ago in a Budapest that was destroyed by WWII, you can recognize the types of people in the story and workplace relationships today. The main gist of the plot is that long time employee of Matuschek and Company , Alfred Kralik (James Stewart), is constantly clashing with more recent hire Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan). What they don't know is that they are actually secret and anonymous pen pals to one another. Against this backdrop of open bickering and secret romantic thoughts there is the predicament of shop owner Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) who has discovered his wife of 22 years is cheating on him and has gotten it into his head that Kralik is the other man - he isn't.European native director Ernst Lubitsch is probably using his memories of his home of origin in describing all of these characters. There is open formality in all of the relationships, but there is a warmth and caring for one another underneath. Add this to the fact that the story takes place around Christmas and it is just the perfect holiday movie.1940 was really James Stewart's year. He won the Oscar for Philadelphia Story, but I think he showed more range in this film and in The Mortal Storm, which if you wondered what happened to the gentle souls in this film during that conflict, you have three of the players here showing up there somewhat answering that question.What doesn't work for me but is not enough to take off a star for? Pepe the store errand boy. He just seems like he is too much out of the Bronx and the Bowery boys to fit into this old world story. But he does have his humorous moments.The lesson I took away from this film? Don't be so in love with love as an ideal that you overlook the person right in front of you.",

            "content": "A wonderful film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really distinguishes the film, however, is that undercurrent of sadness throughout. The story is underscored by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences. Most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed, having been ripped apart by the beginning of World War II. In fact, the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes. Yet funny it is--listen to Margaret Sullivan's harsh dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend \"of poetry and meanness\". It's funny, pointed, and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made.",

            "content": "There never was an actress like Margaret Sullivan, who could convey the radiance and poignancy of her soul in every part she played. She only had a few truly great roles, but this was one of them. She and James Stewart compliment each other perfectly in this exquisite picture.This is a story of a shop around the corner - in Budapest and the people who work there. Family man Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), two- faced, sly Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut who was so sympathetic in \"Orphans of the Storm\"(1921)), unassuming Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart), Flora (Sara Haden), flighty Ilona (Inez Courtney) and cocky Pepi (William Tracy). Alfred has received another letter from his secret pen friend - her letters transport him to a pleasanter place than his humdrum shop life. That day Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan) comes to the store - desperately looking for a jog. She is told there are none to be had, but after ingeniously selling a musical box as a candy box to an over-weight customer, she is in!!! But she is out with Alfred, they antagonize each other from the start from the particular colour of her blouse to the right way to pack boxes. Of course she is the girl of Alfred's dreams, his pen friend (but neither of them know it) and they have agreed, by mail, to meet at a particular cafe. He is to wear a buttonhole and she is to carry a book, \"Anna Karenina\" by Tolstoy.The store's owner, Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) is having his own problems - the money he is giving to his wife is sending the store into bankruptcy. He is also suspicious of Kralik - he thinks he is having an affair with his wife!!! Events escalate and Alfred is sacked - Matuschek has had his wife watched and his fears are confirmed - she is seeing another man - but it is not Alfred, it is slimy Mr. Vadas. When he realises he has sacked the wrong man, Mr. Matuschek tries to kill himself. He makes things right from his hospital bed, Alfred is reinstated as the new manager and Pepi (who saved his life) is promoted to clerk!!! Even Vadas gets his come-uppance.Everything works out perfectly in this perfect film. James Stewart is as far from a lowly clerk in a notions store in Budapest as you can get, but this could be his most memorable role. Actually this film had an earlier remake than \"You've Got Mail\". In 1949 MGM remade it as \"In the Good Old Summertime\" with Judy Garland and Van Johnson. It was set in a Chicago music shop around the early 1900s and was a good excuse to give Judy some popular music of the time to sing.Highly Recommended.",

Kralik secretly becomes Klara's pen-friend, and at work together Klara confides in Kralik about the content of his (Kralik's) letters.

Joseph Schildkraut as the womanising arrogant \"Vadas\" - so well played that you cannot help but hate him right from the beginning.Finally William Tracy who manages to endear himself to us all with his over-confident upstart of a shop junior \"Pepi Katona\".Recently re-made as \"You've Got Mail\" starring Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect younger audiences would disagree.If this film is on in your area over Christmas, I suggest you pour yourself a nice glass of wine, put a log on the fire and have a box of Kleenex handy.",

            "review_title": "A love story as great as it is real...",
            "content": "THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is one of the sweetest and most feel-good romantic comedies ever made. There's just no getting around that, and it's hard to actually put one's feeling for this film into words. It's not one of those films that tries too hard, nor does it come up with the oddest possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end. In fact, all its charm is innate, contained within the characters and the setting and the plot... which is highly believable to boot. It's easy to think that such a love story, as beautiful as any other ever told, *could* happen to you... a feeling you don't often get from other romantic comedies, however sweet and heart-warming they may be. Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Clara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) don't have the most auspicious of first meetings when she arrives in the shop (Matuschek & Co.) he's been working in for the past nine years, asking for a job. They clash from the very beginning, mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it's opened--he thinks it's a ludicrous idea; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired. Their bickering takes them through the next six months, even as they both (unconsciously, of course!) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through PO Box 237. This would be a pretty thin plotline to base an entire film on, except that THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is expertly fleshed-out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters, from the fatherly but lonely Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) himself, who learns that his shop really is his home; Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), Kralik's sidekick and friend who always skitters out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion; smarmy pimp-du-jour Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous Kralik; and ambitious errand boy Pepi Katona (William Tracy) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of clerk for Matuschek & Co. The unpretentious love story between 'Dear Friends' is played out in this little shop in Budapest, Hungary, in which Kralik's unceremonious dismissal and subsequent promotion to shop manager help the two lovebirds-to-be along. It's nice that everyone gets a story in this film; the supporting characters are well-developed, and Matuschek's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one Alfred and Clara share. His invitation to new errand boy Rudy (Charles Smith) for Christmas Eve dinner, made in the whirling, beautiful snow of a Hungarian winter, makes the audience glad that he is not alone; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it isn't this film's business to tell. \nAside from the love story, I must say that James Stewart is truly one of the best things about this film. He doesn't play the full-fledged Jimmy Stewart persona in this film (c/f 'Mr Smith Goes To Washington' for that); in fact Alfred Kralik is prickly and abrupt and not particularly kind. He's rather a brusque man, in fact, with little hint (until, perhaps, the very end) of the aw-shucks down-home boyish charm Stewart would soon come to patent. When he finds out before Clara that they have been corresponding in secret, in fact, Kralik doesn't 'fess up--he waits it out to see how far he can take the charade, especially since he quickly realises (given his stormy relationship with Clara as boss and underling) that loving the person he knows through the exchanged letters might not equate with loving the person herself. His description to Clara of the fictional Matthias Popkin (what a name!) who was to become her fiance is hilarious in the extreme, but also his way of proving that the letters don't reveal all there is to a man, just as her letters don't reveal all there is to her. Stewart plays this role perfectly--he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever Clara insults Mr. Kralik, as she is often wont to do, even (and especially) to his face. And yet one believes, underneath the brusqueness and professionalism, that he *could* reveal his identity with as much earnestness and sincerity and sheer *hope* as he eventually does. Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well. Margaret Sullavan fares rather less well in the first half of the film, but she really comes into her own in the closing-shop scene on Christmas Eve, when she almost gets her heart broken again by Alfred's most vivid description of her mailbox sweetheart. Frank Morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous Hugo Matuschek driven to nervous breakdown, the man who has to rediscover his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to 'grow old with him'. And Felix Bressart plays the role of the meek but loyal Pirovitch wonderfully (a Lubitsch regular, since he appears as a hilarious Russian ambassador in NINOTCHKA)--of particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend Alfred get the Christmas present the latter *really* wants... a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on. Ernst Lubitsch really does himself proud with this film--for example, the famously lavish and meticulous care given to detail in the creation of the Matuschek shop is well worth the effort, right down to the Hungarian names on the door, the wares and the cash register and so on. But even though Lubitsch chose to have the story set in Hungary, the setting is actually universal: it could happen anywhere; it could happen to you. Therein lies the charm of this simple story, these believable characters who really *are* people. The snow on Christmas Eve is real as well, or at least as real as Lubitsch could make it (he had snow machines brought in at great expense). It is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable, that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that cannot be replicated. (No, not even in a remake like YOU'VE GOT MAIL.)  *This* is really the Jimmy Stewart Christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Not to detract from the merits of that other film, but there'd be no harm, and in fact a lot of good, done in watching THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER this Christmas instead. It's sweet, funny, charming, and Stewart is impeccable in his role. We should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could.",

The small number of sets reflect a middle European design but it could be a shop around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail leather goods business but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters.Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope and aspiration and romance, and the story unwinds to bring these two aspects together beautifully. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the shop, is having trouble with his wife, she only a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret affair. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys her fur garments. Mr Pirovitch's life is centred around his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' to a girl at Christmas. You even sense that quiet Flora Katchuck, while staying at home with her mother dreams of someone.\nThe script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It is one of those quiet films that repays looking at again and again, simple yet profound. The dialogue reflects the character speaking which is not common these days. All the acting is magnificent. Even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other perfectly. He was really getting into his stride as an actor then and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a terrific actor and under appreciated these days. Some of her other films are worth catching. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. His moment of truth is very moving. Gold stars all round to the performers.It is a well worn phrase that they don't make them like they used to (The vague re-make 'You've Got Mail' was dire) but in this case it is true. The director Lubitsch is not in farce mode thankfully but delivered a classic film of spirit, charm and warm humanity.",

            "content": "After being recommended this film and seeing it pop up on enough \"best of holiday flicks\" lists, I decided to finally give it a watch. Unfortunately, despite a solid cast and a interesting kernel of an idea, I found \"The Shop Around The Corner\" to be perplexingly disinterested in its main conceit, to the detriment of the overall experience.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on a group of individuals working at a sort of knick-knack shop owned by Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan). More specifically, employee Alfred Kralick (Jimmy Stewart) becoming continually exasperated--personally and professionally--with new hire Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan). Unbeknownst (at least for a time) to both parties, however, they are also each other's romantic/mysterious pen pals, corresponding through letters as they bicker in person.There's no doubt that \"Shop Around The Corner\" is based upon an interesting idea: two people who seemingly hate each other in real life are over-the-moon for each other strictly based on written correspondence. The problem here, though, is that this central conceit is bafflingly given very little rope to play out. Viewers are never given a scene of, say, Kralick writing one of his letters, and when we finally do see Ms. Novak read one, it is played more for comedy than anything. I just never felt much romantic chemistry between the two for that reason.Instead, we get numerous subplots involving the store, such as the owner's attempted suicide, his wife's infidelity (with a store employee), and the upward trajectory of a young \"errand boy\". All of those angles--and more--are generally fun and contain their own little revelations or witticisms. Yet, taken as a whole, they also largely overshadow the Kralick/Novak dynamic that needs to be so central for a movie like this to really work.Perhaps this is a film better enjoyed in its cultural time period. Perhaps I just \"didn't get it\", so to speak. Either way, while I was certainly never bored or outrightly disappointed with any of the on-screen happenings, none of it really made much of an emotional impact on me, either.",

There was no one quite like him; Billy Wilder once complained that something was \"like Lubitsch but it isn't Lubitsch.\" Well, this is, and it's delicious.Set in Budapest, the story concerns two people, Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak, who work at Matuschek's gift shop. They don't get along. Meanwhile, they've both answered a personal ad and are writing to each other. They work with the trouble-making slimeball, Vadas (who else but Joseph Schildkraut), the pleasant and helpful Pirovitch (Felix Bressart) and Pepi (William Tracy). There is a subplot, which is the saga of Matuschek himself (Frank Morgan) who has suddenly becomes cold toward Alfred.James Stewart could be pretty sexy in these romantic roles. Maybe it's just me, but he softens his voice and looks right into the woman's eyes - quite disarming. Tall and boyish, he's adorable playing against Margaret Sullavan, with whom he worked 5 times. She's very funny, always sounding polite, upbeat and lofty even when she's insulting Alfred. She's especially funny when making unfavorable comparisons between Alfred and her pen-pal. \"Oh, but you don't understand, Mr. Kralik. A man like you wouldn't...\" Both were capable of such heavy dramatic roles and yet could turn around and do a light comedy with no problem.Frank Morgan gives a very touching performance and Felix Bressart is sweet and likable as Pirovitch. Schildkraut is hilarious - one isn't sure if it's his lines, his delivery, or the direction - it was probably all three. My favorite is when he says to Matuschek, \"I saw your new dining room table. It's lovely. It must be especially beautiful in the evenings at dinner parties with the candles lit...Stunning.\" Sounds like nothing yet he's great.This can't possibly be compared to the remake, \"You've Got Mail.\" After all, it isn't Lubitsch.",

            "content": "The Budapest in The Shop Around The Corner is fixed on love and shopping, essential bourgeois habits. But do not be deceived by the precious delicacy - like a fine music box - of the film. Ernst Lubitsch knew the risks lovers ran. You can feel his crossed fingers. This may be Hollywood's most poignant love story, set amid the fussy, heightened naturalism of a little shop where everyone is a character. At work, Alfred and Klara do not get on, no matter that they are James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. They are vexed by misunderstandings and cross-purposes. But they share one thing: they are both writing heartfelt letters to an unknown correspondent, and through this epistolary communion they have fallen in love. Of course, a moment of discovery will come, and the great Felix Bressart makes it as tense as some moments in Hitchcock films. American film has no more heartbreaking shot than that of Sullavan's face gazing into her empty letter-box. Lubitsch had come so far - from German costume dramas and romantic comedies to Hollywood and Paramount, where he was put in charge of production. He enjoyed considerable acclaim for his silent pictures, including Lady Windermere's Fan (1925), and in the 1930s, with the advent of sound, created a further series of successes - The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), Trouble In Paradise (1932), Design For Living (1933), The Merry Widow (1934), Angel (1937), and Ninotchka (1939). He was a master of sophisticated comedy, whose light touch inspired people like Billy Wilder, who really got his break writing scripts for Lubitsch. The Shop Around The Corner is something of a departure for the director in that its characters are poor and hard-working, and also because the film relies on the ambiance of the shop. It is also the picture in which Lubitsch himself seems most moved and anxious for his lovers. It's a grave and lovely film, as well as a secure masterpiece. In 1940 the US was not yet at war, and Hungary was still free from the worst Nazi domination, but the idea of Christmas at Matuschek's was already far-fetched.",

Had I been casting the film, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan.Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. But is only this one where neither of them dies. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then.I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out. But if you can accept Stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person. But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife. Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very scarce.And Joseph Schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan. You really hate people like that, I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.",

            "content": "'The Shop Around the Corner (1940)' is a pleasant romantic comedy, not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days, but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation. By 1940, director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm, and his famed \"Lubitsch touch\" had become a sparkling commercial trademark. This film was planned for a 1939 release, but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming. Rather than substituting either of his main stars, Lubitsch decided to postpone production, in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in 'Ninotchka (1939).' When it was finally completed, 'The Shop Around the Corner' appears to have been met with relative indifference, receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role. Time, nevertheless, has betrayed the film's massive and enduring influence, with high-profile remakes including 'In the Good Old Summertime (1949)' and 'You've Got Mail (1998).'At its surface, one might assume 'The Shop Around the Corner' to simply be the story of two lovers, Klara Novak (Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Stewart), who love each other without knowing it. However, Lubitsch's film runs much deeper than that. It's the story of Matuschek and Company, a stylish gift shop in Budapest, and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family. When store-owner Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife, we witness the breakdown of two families, both at home and at work. There's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States \u0096 perhaps in the blustery streets of New York \u0096 but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe, the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep. This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful, personal touch to the film \u0096 in fact, even as I write this review, I'm beginning to appreciate the story even more.Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles, but I think that it's the supporting cast that really make the film. Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix, and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable. I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek, who, in any other film, would have been restricted to an underdeveloped, two-dimensional portrayal. Matuschek may have lost the love of his family, but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees, and you feel a heartwarming glow when, in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm, he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy (Charles Smith). This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder's later creations, for example, Boom Boom Jackson in 'The Fortune Cookie (1966)' or Carlo Carlucci in 'Avanti! (1972).' Of course, it doesn't really need saying, but Billy Wilder learned from the best.",

            "content": "THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1940), produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch, is a delightful tale of two store employees who don't get along very well, unaware they're carrying on a pen-pal correspondence through the mail that starts with \"Dear Friend.\" Starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart for the third time together, following NEXT TIME WE LOVE (Universal, 1936), and THE SHOPWORN ANGEL (MGM, 1938), there's no doubt that this comedy-drama, based on the Hungarian play by Nikolas Laszlo, happens to be their finest collaboration thus far. Although a circumstantial love story from the viewpoint of its central characters, the film rightfully belongs to the owner of the shop around the corner, as wonderfully played by Frank \"The Wizard of Oz\" Morgan.What's the story about? Opening title reveals: \"This is a story of Matuschek and Company - of Mr. Matuschek and the people who work for him. It is just around the corner from Andrassy Street - on Balta Street, in Budapest, Hungary.\" The shop, Matuschek and Company, consists of various workers starting with its founder, Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan), a middle-aged man devoted to both his store and wife, Emma, of 22 years; and staff: Alfred Kralik (James Stewart), a nine year employee/salesman and Matuschek's most trusted and closest friend; Mr. Petrovitch (Felix Bressart), a happily married family man whose the very first to arrive ten minutes before the store opens; Pepi Katena (William Tracy), an errand boy with a squeaky voice; salesgirls, Flora (Sara Haden) and Ilona (Inez Courtney); and Ferencz Vadan (Joseph Schildkraut), a \"yes\" man who mysteriously arrives each day by taxi loaded with large money bills in his pocket and expensive wardrobe. One morning, Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) arrives seeking employment. She successfully sells herself by selling an \"O Tchonia\" playing music box to a plump lady customer who mistakes it for a candy box. During the course of her six month stay at Matuschek and Company, Klara and Alfred find themselves constantly arguing, unaware that they carrying on a romance through the mail left in a post office box. Further complications arise as Alfred notices Mr. Matuschek to suddenly act indifferently towards him, even to a point of dismissing him before Christmas for no apparent reason.Being an Ernst Lubitsch production where his traditional locales to his motion pictures having European backdrops, mostly Paris, interestingly THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is a sort of story that could very well have taken place anywhere at anytime. Following the pattern of remakes, the musical version retitled IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME (MGM, 1949) starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson, takes place at turn-of-the-century Chicago; while the most updated edition, YOU'VE GOT MAIL (Warner Brothers, 1998) with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, not only is set in New York City, but uses the internet as its means of communication between pen-pal writers. With the exception of European born actors, Joseph Schildkraut and Felix Bressart, along with label signs written in Hungarian, many of the other players are essentially Americans talking naturally without any attempts using accents. Had director Lubitsch attempted on using European-born performers in leading roles as the two-time Academy Award winning Viennese born Luise Rainer as Klara, with Czech Francis Lederer as Alfred, for example, the outcome would have turned out entirely different and possibly not as successful as with the selected players as Sullavan and Stewart. Frank Morgan, best known for playing befuddled characters, is shown to best advantage here breaking away from his typical \"Morgan style\" for a more straightforward performance. Aside from serious performances from THE MORTAL STORM (1940), that reunited him with Sullavan and Stewart, and the much better known THE HUMAN COMEDY (1943) starring Mickey Rooney, it makes one wish Frank Morgan did more dramatic roles like these as opposed to the tailor-made double-talking bumbling characters he's done so often, even in his signature role as THE WIZARD OF OZ (MGM, 1939).Being a versatile actor, Morgan, believably having that European presence through his thick mustache and old-style haircut, gives a performance worthy for an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. His key elements include moments of humor for not trying to influence his employees when asking for their honest opinions; his surprise reaction when discovering the error of his ways towards his trusted employee, Alfred; and a heartfelt moment when inviting his newest and youngest employee, Rudy (Charles Smith), age 17, living alone in Budapest, to have dinner with him on Christmas Eve. When Morgan isn't around, the concentration resumes on the feuding store employees, Klara and Alfred. One unforgettable moment includes a scene outside the caf\u00e9 where Alfred looks through the window, after being told by his friend, Petrovitch, that his pen-pal, with only means of identification being a Leo Tolstoy book, \"Anna Karenina,\" happens to be Klara. While he doesn't give away his identity, he does surprise her when stopping by her table, only to soon be insulted and hurt when angrily called an \"insignificant clerk.\" Other scenes involving Klara and Alfred are both amusing and touching in the best Lubitsch style and tradition. A pleasing musical score by Werner Hermann during its opening and closing credits is also worthy of an honorable mention here. No wonder THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER has lived up to its expectations in recent years as an exceptional motion picture.Formerly on video cassette since the late 1980s, and later available in the DVD format, for anyone looking for a bargain when it comes to shopping for a good movie with a Christmas theme, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER should make any customer satisfied without asking for refunds or exchanges the next time it's broadcast on Turner Classic Movies cable channel.

            "content": "It would be of interest to study the dramatists of late 19th Century through 20th Century Hungary. The only one who has left a lasting imprint to most theatergoers in the U.S. and England (and the English - speaking world) is Ferencz Molnar, best recalled for LILLIOM and THE PLAY'S THE THING. But Ernst Lubitsch was born in middle Europe and frequently turned to German, Austrian, and Hungarian dramatists for his movie scripts. It is to him that we owe the discovery of Miklos Lazslo's THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, which has a remarkable track record: it is one of the few stage plays that was the basis for three successful movie versions. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER was the first and possibly the best (YOU'VE GOT MAIL may actually be the best, depending on who you talk to). The middle one is IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, which was the first musical version (there was a second, successful musical, for Broadway, called SHE LOVES ME). Oddly enough, it is the only play by Lazslo that seems to have been discovered. Perhaps someone will look over his dramatic confections to see if anything else is worth taking.The plot of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is very simple. James Stewart is Alfred Kralek, who is the chief salesman at Matuschek and Company, a leather goods store in Budapesth that is owned by Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan). Kralek is forced to work with Klara Novak (Margaret Sullivan), an intelligent saleswoman (who initially he resisted hiring), who seems to question all of his ideas and orders. In the meantime Kralek has started writing letters to a pen pal whom he has never met - a woman that attracts him. What he does not know is that Klara is the woman, and she is equally attracted to his pen-pal form. So they love each other in their letters, but (not knowing each other's pen-pal personae) they dislike each other in the flesh.However, their pen-pal versions set up a date, and this is jeopardized by a change in the usually jovial personality of Mr. Matuschek, who becomes very harsh towards Kralek (up-to-then his \"fair haired\" boy). It turns out that Matuschek is aware that his wife is carrying on an affair with a male employee. He believes it is Kralek (who has been invited over to Matuschek's home several times). Finally, he fires Kralek a week before Christmas, and the night that Kralek was to finally meet his pen-pal.Kralek does go to the meeting spot with his close friend and co-worker Pirovich (Felix Bressart). He discovers Klara is his pen-pal, but he shows up (as though by accident - he claims he's waiting for Pirovich who has gone home), and proceeds to needle Klara. Klara manages to finally get him to leave. But her \"pen-pal\" never shows up. In the end the actual villain is revealed, and Morgan does rehire Stewart. I won't go into the rest of the film - delightful as it is - but the film does surround itself with Christmas. The store has a banner Christmas sales (an element rarely touched in Christmas stories; the commercial side is usually not considered something to push in Christmas stories). And the romance is straightened out in an entertaining fashion.Stewart and Sullivan make a very appealing couple (even when bickering). Morgan plays the comedy as he typically did, but his moments of anger and jealousy show he is really hurting (and disappointed at his wife). Bressart makes an art out of running out of sight when his boss wants advice (and he also has interesting views about apartments and having friends over for dinner). William Tracy (as Pepi), who is the store's messenger boy, is wonderfully nasty at several points to Mrs. Matuschek and her boyfriend, and to the fellow whom he eventually hires as his replacement - and look at his wonderful brief scene with Edwin Maxwell as Matuschek's doctor. And Joseph Schildkraut, as Ferencz Vardas (the villain) is properly sleazy and sneaky (although when Stewart is fired he shows he is feeling guilty about that). Perhaps not as soul enriching as IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but it's sweet presentation of a set of little people who find each other makes it one of the nicest of all film romantic comedies.",

I avoided it for years and stayed as far away as possible from its recent remake, \"You've Got Mail\" in which, instead of using the post, the would-be lovers exchange their love notes by email.But it was wrong to ignore the original. Lubitsch is not a slob. He rarely goes for the cheap shot and he knows ironic wit when he hears it. There is only one hug in the entire movie. (I counted.) Further, there are first-rate performances by most of the cast. The film is based on a play, so there really aren't that many characters. Sullavan looks pleasant without looking beautiful, and Stewart is Stewart, in one of his best pre-war performances. I'll give an example. Stewart is visiting Sullavan after he (but not she) has found out that they are secretly drawn to one another. Knowing this, he has written a letter praising his epistolary self. As they sit together, the letter is delivered to Sullavan and she lights up like the bulb on a Christmas tree and reads aloud the panegyric that Stewart (in his role as co-worker) has written about himself (as lover). Watch the expressions slowly make their way across Stewart's features, blending shame, pride, modesty, and calculation. It only takes a minute.In fact, the pace is pretty fast. Nobody shouts but everybody says what they have to say and darts off somewhere else. So, in expecting a sludge of sentimentality and tears, I must have been thinking of another movie. This one has quiet irony and is -- I don't know how to say this exactly, but it's European in its sensibilities. I'd have expected it from France but not Hollywood.",

The most recent that modern audiences will recognize is \"You've Got Mail\" from 1998.Billed as a comedy first, this movie shows us a slice of life of working people in 1930s Budapest, Hungary. Europe was also a part of the worldwide depression that had begun in the U.S. Even as the economies began to improve, jobs were scarce and hard to come by. That sets the stage for this story that has a wonderful mix of light comedy with romance and drama. It's a very good study of people.The entire cast shine in this movie. James Stewart as Mr. Kralik and Margaret Sullavan as Miss Novak play off each other splendidly. Sullavan especially does a wonderful job as Novak subtly comes around after noticing the changes in Kralik. Felix Bressart is perfect as Pirovitch. This wonderful supporting actor had a fine career in film before he died at age 57 from leukemia. Frank Morgan's performance as Mr. Matuschek is also worth noting. He portrayed a worrisome man with something on his mind exceptionally well.As I watched this movie again recently, I remember being curious about the monetary units in the story. We see the cash register tills ring up pengos, and Matuschek talks about how many pengos they take in. I was a stamp collector for years growing up, and got to know a lot of world geography and other things from those stamps. Among them were monetary systems, capitals, famous historical figures, etc. For instance, I knew that Magyar referred to an area and people of Hungary, and I had stamps in denominations of korona. But the pengo had me stumped, so I just looked it up.The pengo replaced the korona as the basic monetary unit of Hungary from 1927 to 1946, when it was replaced by the forint. It was the equivalent of 100 fillers, making it similar to the U.S. dollar as the form of currency. Encyclopedias explain that the pengo was part of the stabilization program for Europe following WW I. It lasted only 20 years and apparently had the worst hyperinflation of all time. I don't know what the value of the pengo was in U.S. dollars then. The Hungarian Florint for several years now has ranged between one-third and one-half a U.S. cent.At the time this film was made, the pengo was issued only in denominations of 10-, 5- and 2-pengo bills. Minted coins included 1, 2, 10, 20 and 50 filler, and three in pengo amounts of 1, 2 and 5. The front of the 10-pengo bill had a picture of Mary holding the baby Jesus on the left, and a female model bust on the right. The reverse had the picture of a statue of King Stephen astride a horse.The story takes place around the holiday season. \"Shop Around the Corner\" makes a nice film to add to one's Christmas collection for annual viewing.",

            "content": "It's easy to see romantic comedies containing ridiculous premises - we've had them now with Hollywood for decades - but like so much in cinema what has to work is the execution. You could have a meet cute that involves two people meeting by accidentally bumping into each other and striking up a conversation about their dogs in 2016 (sound familiar at all?) and it could be a terrific, entertaining, engaging and artistically driven film if there's some heart behind it, if we can get behind the characters, and the actors and director are sympatico with how to add some humanity to the situation. Ernst Lubitch and Margararet Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart have that with Shop Around the Corner, and that's what counts.Hell, the movie may sound familiar because it IS now remade (1998's You've Got Mail): Klara gets a job through showing off a skill (apparently it is one) to sell an object like a music box to a newcomer to the owner of Matuschek's (Frank Morgan, Oz's Wizard in an apt role), and yet this doesn't sit well with Alfred, who can't stand the music box (mpph, he says, what if someone smokes 20 cigarettes a day, it'll get in their heads!) or maybe even her for that matter. But his animosity is also met by her's, and yet unbeknownst to each other they have a correspondence going with people they find \"wonderful\" and arrange some months after - it cuts ahead in time, it's fine - to finally meet. And of course they are writing to one another.So it's cute, it's precious maybe, but everything in this script is realistically drawn by Samson Raphaelson (from a play, and apparently it's why this takes place in Hungary for some reason or another). That is to say, no one really acts too much like an idiot (a common problem with today's rom-coms, when they do some out but you know what I mean), and there's even an element of sadness to the film, of things not working out for people and betrayal and mistrust. In a way it's as much about trust and belief in others as it is about love if not more-so, and a lot of this comes out in a sub-plot that makes the film as good as it is.What happens with this sub-plot? Well, Mr Matuschek is becoming more brusque with his employees as time goes on - he cares that things get sold and that his employees do things like stay after, just ONCE per year, to help set things up for Christmas - and it leads to an argument with Alfred that later in the same day results in Alfred being let go from the job. This isn't the kind of scene many might expect when coming to a screwball romantic comedy (and this isn't really screwball, but you also know what I mean). It's dealt with in a degree of reality, and that there's sadness to what's happened to Alfred and how Stewart and Morgan act the scene together when the boss tells him employee he's fired it's not something explosive or melodramatic, it's subtle and it cuts deep since we know there's this connection between the two going back years (Alfred being the oldest employee he has).And then there's Matuschek's marriage, which drives a lot of this sub-plot conflict, and it's not silly or meant for laughs. If anything the movie may lack some laughs in places, but there are enough that it satisfies as a comedy, if not *as* much as Trouble in Paradise or To Be or Not to Be (very different movies but also films dealing with romance and status in society). I think the real juggling act for Lubitsch here is to have this light tone, to have the kind of \"ooh, I can't STAND you!\" dynamic that Stewart and Sullivan have here - and I think Stewart is a better fit than in the other 1940 mega Rom-Com, The Philadelphia Story, which is possibly more entertaining overall but not as strong as a story - and there's that part of it, and then there's the dramatic parts. This is a business we're meant to take seriously as a place that Matuschek's made for his employees to feel like they're at home (with one exception, who I won't mention here but is revealed to be the sort of \"heel\" of the movie), and when this old man gets drama in his life it tears him apart despite his work life.I wish I could put into words what makes this movie so special, and I think that it's *because* that Lubitsch has this plot contrivance involving these two people and their correspondence, and how Alfred finds out first that Klara has been writing to him all along and he doesn't mention anything about it when he goes into that restaurant (only to let the tension and words and verbal aggression continue), that he has something to work with. It's fun to see this push and pull between the two, but then also how they naturally, mostly from Klara to Alfred, build attraction over the course of the story.So by the time it gets to that ending, it's not corny or cheesy, it's earned and emotional and it feels like a fable come true in some odd way. The Shop Around the Corner both reflects the economic uncertainty of the period (remember this is still pre WW2 and though it's Europe I'm sure it wasn't so different as in the US far as lack of work goes) and fulfills a good part of drama for how characters see one another and how misconceptions can drive things to a tipping point (and will one go over or not), and then also how a sweet romance can be concocted amid all of this. 9.5/10",

This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Tortilla Flat\" under his belt, that is saying a lot.  The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy.  Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought \"Trouble In Paradise\" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph.

One might fully aware that this film is the archetype of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's commercial sensation YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998, 7/10), but even its inception is over half a century older than the latter, the former still manage to overshadow it (or even any other praiseworthy rom-coms) in every possible aspect. An ingenious script renders a witty plot set-up which only leaves our leading lady unwittingly snared inside a white lie while audiences' appetite has been fully whetted and the final revelation is well-anticipated, humorous, affecting and sincerely good- natured, this is \"the\" kind of film which Hollywood doesn't (or is unable to) produce any more, pitifully!The temperaments of the two leads are plain congenial and mutually harmonious, the James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan pair oozes the optimal chemistry in the conventional rom-com mis-matched setting. The two represents the quintessential precious nature of the two sexes, role models of the golden age and rarely can be found in reality now, it all reminds us nostalgically what a pure golden-heart could be and elicits more whole-hearted appreciation. Stewart would win his Oscar for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940, 8/10) the same year, but under Lubistch's guidance, his slightly reserved suaveness and gentleman-like diffidence achieve an irresistible personal debonair which also is difficult to find at present. Sullavan, not quite a household name but in this film, her performance is exquisite, heartwarming, say, the ending, when she finally gets to know the man of her dream is her bickering partner in the shop, her psychologically-shocking-but-exhilaratingly-content transition is the killing of the film and saves the film from being an emotional overkill or worse, a stroke of bathos. Frank Morgan (afresh from THE WIZARD OF OZ 1939, 8/10) and Joseph Schildkraut both deliver excellent work as the credulous but kind-hearted shop owner and the sycophantic poseur in the shop respectively, pristine frills added to the main storyline. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, is a rare gem of its own kind, I highly doubt Lubitsch could excel himself in his canon, where I will burrow and wish me luck!",

That version has been on PBS, the second time this show was filmed for TV. The earlier musical version with Judy Garland and Van Johnson (\"In the Good Old Summertime\") is quite good, and the updated version \"You've Got Mail\" is decent in spite of the fact that modern technology took away the old fashioned charm.This version of the classic play \"Parfumarie\" is set in Budapest (also the location for the musical) and deals with gruff Frank Morgan's shop (around some corner...) where the close nit staff has its differences but basically gets along. No one really likes the pretentious Joseph Schikdkraut, but head clerk James Stewart is an example of professionalism, that is until Margaret Sullavan blusters her way onto the staff by selling a music box that no one else can move.Morgan has his gripes but is fine until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him and suspects Stewart. The squabbles between Stewart and Sullavan hide the fact that they are actually secret penpals, and it's that story that's the basis for the verbal comedy with the tragedy being Morgan's realization of how wrong he's been and his reaction to that.The rest of the staff is cast with some of the great character actors of the golden age with Felix Bressart as an eager to please clerk determined not to be fired, Sarah Haden as the plain speaking cashier, William Tracy as the ambitious delivery boy and Inez Courtney as the young sexpot. The perfect script goes through an entire year, culminating at Christmas which is why it gets annual yuletide broadcasts. Everything about this movie keeps you engaged, reminding me of the mix of comedy, romance and tragedy in \"Grand Hotel\" and \"Dinner at Eight\".It's interesting that this did not receive any Academy Award nominations, but 1940 was such a good year that many great films were overlooked. Stewart won for \"The Philadelphia Story\" and was paired with Sullavan ant Morgan again in \"The Mortal Storm\", one of my favorite World War II films. Schikdkraut is delightfully smarmy, and you expect venom to shoot out of his mouth everytime he smiles. Young Tracy is hysterical, especially when he gets to deal with the unseen cheating wife on the phone. True perfection from start to finish.",

The setting and the characters make it work. Jimmy Stewart is very good, and more assured and less of a stutterer this time around. The ending is not so much predictable as it is inevitable and a \"must\" in stories of this kind. What was predictable and obvious was that Morgan's wife is cheating on him and that he suspected Stewart while it was Schildkraut all along. (Then again, perhaps it was meant to be obvious.) The film doesn't cop out by throwing in some overly-dramatic twists to try to lull the viewer into sobbing uncontrollably; it remains light throughout. Even Morgan's attempted suicide isn't treated with doom and gloom. Though, I have to say, I was a little surprised how little disbelief Stewart showed when finding out that Sullavan is his pen pal; I mean, what are the odds of it?! He should have even been a bit suspicious; the woman comes to the shop, looking for a job, where, of all people, she bumps into him. Sullavan was a little more bewildered than Stewart when she found out, but I would have thrown in more amazement when the two were confronted with that strange fact.It's unusual that nearly all the last names are Slavic, whereas this is supposed to be in going on in Budapest.",

The acting of the three major characters is exceptional with Margaret Sullavan as Klara, James Stewart as Alfred, and Frank Morgan as Matuschek. In fact, this film may be Stewart's signature role, that which solidifies once and for all the \"Jimmy Stewart\" motif. Sullavan plays a part which is decades ahead of its time, a romantic yet forceful and free-spirited woman who controls her own destiny. And Morgan is the gruff merchant with the golden heart. What is special about the writing is that one can find not lines which do not belong to the action. Situations are more or less normal and the language of the film is neither too sentimental nor too forceful, in keeping with the advice that Hamlet gives the players is Shakespears's play. The supporting cast is very strong, so much so that there is little distraction from the main point of each scene. Special credit goes to Felix Bressart as Pirovich, the wise one who seems to understand the human side of life; to William Tracy, the witty delivery boy turned clerk; and, to Joseph Schildkraut, who can make situation ethics seem virtuous.

            "content": "\"The Shop around the Corner\" is one of my favorite films starring my favorite actor Mr. James Stewart. Co-starring with Stewart is an actress who helped him build his reputation as a true professional: Margaret Sullavan. In a supporting role is Frank Morgan, a marvelous character actor. The producer and director of this charming piece is none other than Ernst Lubitsch, a master of subtlety and wit - everyone calls it \"the Lubitsch touch\". (Please DO NOT read the rest of this commentary if you have not yet seen this picture.) Klara Novak (Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Stewart) are two bickering clerks at a small Budapest leather-goods gift shop owned by Mr. Matuschek (Morgan). With each passing month the feuding, fussing, and fighting gets worse, but the audience learns something about Klara and Kralik that they don't know about each other; they have been falling in love together as secret pen pals! Before too long, Kralik finds out, but he does not reveal his anonymous identity to Klara until the very end. Let me repeat, Ernst Lubitsch was a MASTER of subtlety and wit.The casting of \"The Shop around the Corner\" could not have been better. Margaret Sullavan as Klara Novak is a fast-talking, unpredictable wit, and James Stewart as Alfred Kralik displays a quiet self-control throughout most of the film. (In fact, Stewart biographer Jonathan Coe once remarked that \"The Shop around the Corner\" is one of the quietest motion pictures ever made.) Frank Morgan was the perfect choice to portray Mr. Matuschek, the owner of the shop. When he's in a bad mood, his staff dares not irk him any further; when he asks you for your honest opinion, he wants you to tell him what he wants to hear; when he's in a bright, cheerful mood, everyone working for him tends to be a reflection of that as well. Not to mention Joseph Schildkraut as Ferencz Vadas, a well-tailored, articulate clerk who kisses up to the boss, and Felix Bressart as Mr. Pirovitch, Kralik's fellow clerk and best friend who dares not contradict the boss.Notwithstanding the delicious chemistry between Sullavan and Stewart, here are some of my other favorite moments from \"The Shop around the Corner\". Matuschek asks Kralik, now the store manager, to dismiss Vadas as quietly as possible, but Kralik's handling of the matter is anything but quiet. To prove to the no-longer-anonymous Klara that he isn't bowlegged, Kralik pulls up his trousers to reveal his socks being held up by suspenders! On Christmas Eve, when the shop closes, the lonely Mr. Matuschek realizes that his new errand boy Rudi (Charles Smith) has no family in Budapest with whom to spend the holiday, so Matuschek happily takes Rudi out to dinner. Errand boy-turned-clerk Pepi Katona (William Tracy) saves Mr. Matuschek from taking his own life, just in the nick of time! At the opening of the film, Kralik quietly shares one of Klara's anonymous letters with Pirovitch, and then, from riches to rags, he tells Mr. Matuschek what he honestly thinks of his newly acquired \"Ochi Tchornya\" cigarette box. And I love how Mr. Matuschek engages in an angry tirade against his sales clerks, with a few subtle interruptions.\"The Shop around the Corner\" is one of the finest romantic comedies I have ever seen. The same year it was released - 1940 - James Stewart appeared in another more sophisticated romance comedy with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant titled \"The Philadelphia Story\", for which Stewart garnered his only Oscar, but I personally feel that \"The Shop around the Corner\" is infinitely better than \"The Philidelphia Story\". I can also overlook the fact that the setting for this Sullavan/Stewart romance is Budapest, Hungary, yet a majority of the actors are American and speak the clearest English. To summarize, \"The Shop around the Corner\" is a truly remarkable film.",

It has just the right tone and spirit to warm one's heart following a series of misunderstandings between the principals, admirably portrayed by Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart.There's a nice snowfall scene in the picture that calls to mind the town of Bedford Falls from another Stewart classic, \"It's a Wonderful Life\". Stewart himself evokes an entire range of emotions in his portrayal of lead salesman Alfred Kralik. Just catch his reaction when Klara (Sullavan) stuns him with the remark about being an insignificant little clerk. And this after he realizes that she's his secret sweetheart, which will remain unknown to her until very near the end of the story.Frank Morgan never seems to disappoint in any of his pictures, and I thought he brought a finely subdued element of Professor Marvel to his characterization here of Hugo Matuschek. However I had to wonder whether the story line could have found another way of his dealing with his wife's infidelity rather than contemplating suicide. For a holiday themed picture, that was a rather morose curve ball to throw at the viewer. Fortunately that theme worked itself out favorably but it was rather jarring when encountered as an off screen gunshot.Perhaps the sweetest thing going for the movie was Kralik's early observation that for him, above average beauty wasn't a prerequisite for finding the right woman and falling in love. His simple taste called for a lovely, average girl. The entire time, and even throughout those recurring arguments between Klara and Alfred, the viewer never doubts that that this was a couple made for each other.",

There are moments in the movie, such as when Clara insults him during their meeting in the caf\u00e9, or when he visits Matachek in the hospital - the most moving scene in the movie for me - when I just marvel at the understated quality of his acting.The same is true of Morgan. We think of him as the Wizard of Oz, and he was great in that movie. But he was not all big gestures and exaggeration. When he faces the infidelity of his wife, and then has to apologize to Stewart for suspecting him of having an affair with his wife, or at the end when he is desperate to find someone to spend Christmas Eve with, now that he finds himself without a family to go home to, the understated perfection of his acting is really very impressive. If you have ever seen him in *Port of Seven Seas*, based on Marcel Pagnol's *Marcel* and *Fanny* plays, this won't come as any surprise to you.In 1940, when this movie was made and released, Hungary was still an independent nation, though moving closer to Germany and Italy and passing several anti-Semitic laws. (Felix Bressart, who plays Pirovitch here, would play the Jewish actor Greenberg two years later in *To Be or Not to Be* and, in his riff on Shylock's speech, enter into cinematic history.) The next year Hungary would enter World War II on the German side against Russia. But in this movie, Budapest is still a charming Eastern European city where people care about each other and everything looks warm and wonderful under the falling snowflakes.If you ever feel a need to watch great actors make miracles out of small moments, watch this. You will be amazed.",

Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart- is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with an admission that the sales girl 'liked' Stewart all along, the happy ending is inevitable.Although VERY dated (references to poverty and -I have a wife and two kids to consider- are over-used, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, like a musical cigar box, are out-of-reach for common people's enjoyment), this film is much more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make \"You've Got Mail\". In the re-make starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the actual odds of the chain-of-events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended.\"Shop Around The Corner\" is an innocent stroll down memory lane into a less complicated, less hectic, and more romantic time and place known as a novelist's Utopia.

The 1998 Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks starer --You've Got Mail was largely inspired by this and was charming in its own right BUT it is no match to this original classic.It is a movie which carves out a niche for each character and makes all of them loved and memorable. The dialogs are some of the wittiest and the most charming I have ever heard.Sparkling performances by the lead pair James Stewart and Margaret Sulluvan.

            "content": "While the first remake, In the Good Old Summertime, is mostly fluff, and the second remake, You've Got Mail, focuses mostly on the romance, the original film, The Shop Around the Corner, is a drama that gives nearly equal attention to everyone in the shop, not just the two romantic leads. Originally based on a Hungarian play, it was translated and worked into a Hollywood movie starring Frank Morgan, James Stewart, and Margaret Sullavan.Frank is the owner of a small Hungarian shop. James Stewart is his number one employee bucking for a raise, despite his vocal oppositions to his boss's opinions, and Margaret is the newest hire. There are others in the shop, and they all have their own personalities and subplots. Felix Bressart, the pushover who tries to get along without committing to anything. \"All I want is your honest opinion,\" Frank says to his employees, and Felix hides in the back storage so he won't have to participate. Joseph Schildkraut is the exact opposite, a smarmy yes-man who wants to get on everyone's good side and in the same breath would stab the same person in the back to get ahead. Sara Haden is quiet and plays by the rules, and William Tracy is a mere errand boy who yearns for more responsibility.The main focus of the movie is in fact the dynamic of the shop employees and the boss, but there is a secondary plot of an adorable and unexpected romance. During the day, James Stewart and Margaret get on each other's nerves at work and bicker constantly. They have no idea that they've accidentally become each other's pen pal and have fallen in love through their letters. In an immortal scene repeated through the decades, they agree to meet at a caf\u00e9, and while Margaret waits at a table with a book and a flower, Jimmy brings his wingman Felix along to find out if she's pretty. \"If you don't like Miss Novak, I can tell you right now, you're not going to like this girl,\" Felix says, after a gentle lead-up. \"Because it is Miss Novak!\"To me, the romance of the movie is secondary to the characters at the Matuschek shop. Yes, it's extremely cute to have the contrast of their irritation by day and their love letters in the off hours, but that part could have been taken out of any romantic comedy of the 1940s and could have been played by any of the top stars of the silver screen. Myrna Loy, Rosalind Russell, Miriam Hopkins, Ginger Rogers, Fred MacMurray, Ray Milland, or Clark Gable could have played the pen pals, but the personalities of the Matuschek shop are unique to this cast. Joseph Schildkraut oozes slime as much as Felix Bressart emits kindness. Sara Haden is naturally demure, and William Tracy has enough spunk to show how tired he is of being the boss's wife's errand boy. Margaret Sullavan has a conniving edge that follows her character from start to finish. In all her scenes, she's looking for an angle on how to get what she wants. James Stewart is outspoken because he believes he's right and knows what's best for the shop. He's not self-centered, he just takes pride in his work and loves the shop. Finally Frank Morgan, the real lead even though he has no love interest, has the world on his shoulders. It might be a very small world, but it's his world and his shoulders. He has to run a business that's not doing very well right before Christmas, he's responsible for several people's livelihoods, and he has a troubled marriage. Here at Hot Toasty Rag, we were proud to honor Frank with his third nomination, as well as a nomination for Felix and the quick, heartwarming screenplay.If somehow this version of the story has passed you by, you've got to rent it this winter. You might not want to watch it right around Christmas, since it has some sad parts, but it'll be a lot of fun to watch it when it's snowing outside.",

The action centres around a small shop where James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan star as employees who are unknowingly pen pals. Frank Morgan plays the shop owner who wants everything in tip top shape for Christmas. Director Ernst Lubitsch does a fine job at presenting relationships within an ordinary corner shop, but the film has tremendous depth as well. Stewart is terrific as someone who has mastered the shop and maintained its order but a misunderstanding results in his firing. Sullavan plays the female counter part who regrets the actions against Stewart despite their disagreements. Morgan steals his moments as he learns to take a closer look at life in the shop and demonstrate benefits to those of hard work. Joseph Schildkraut plays the film's villain whose tactics lead to the one act of violence where he is sacked in the jaw. William Tracy plays a young delivery boy who frequents the shop and eventually prevents a tragedy. While the ending is corny, the film's presentation of the characters through the walls of this little shop make for an interesting observation of those of us who must tolerate one another through eight hour periods.

            "content": "A delightful, warm-hearted what we'd now call romantic comedy from the Hungarian maestro Ernst Lubitsch. Set in Budapest although neither lead, James Stewart or Margaret Sullavan even begins to attempt a local accent, the narrative concerns the lives and loves of grumpy but paternal gift shop boss, played by Frank Morgan and his employees. While there is plenty of local colour with locations, names and sometimes accents, the action could probably have easily been staged in a 5th Avenue store.There are a number of intertwining plot strands, principal amongst them being the romantic, incognito pen-pal correspondence between Stewart and Sullivan, who in real life bicker constantly on the shop floor and old shop owner Morgan's worries over his spendthrift wife's marital fidelity. In addition there are important supporting characters like the kindly if timid old-timer salesman played by Felix Bressart, who tries to play peacemaker to all and sundry, William Tracy as the ambitious young errand boy Pepe whose timely intervention later saves the day and Joseph Schildkraut as the toadying shop assistant with ulterior motives.The plot moves gently back and forward with some light comedic touches interspersed with others reflecting everyday normality and one moment in particular of near tragedy, before things get back on track in time for a Christmassy happy ending for all the principals.Stewart and Sullavan made four movies together and I'd like to check out some of the others on the evidence of this. There's good support everywhere else in the cast especially Bressart as nice-guy Pirovich. The direction is deft, sophisticated and engaging, the famed Lubitsch Touch very much in evidence.A little shop of delights you won't be disappointed to visit.",

They fall in love reading those letters.The climax scene played just perfectly is a long dialog between Stewart & O'Sullivan on Christmas Eve where he gives her the longest possible verbal trail to realize he is the man she is in love with, and that the feeling is mutual. It is one of the best verbal sparring climaxes ever put on film. She has put up so many road blocks from her fight with him that he has to take the most careful path ever to get the the happy ending.When it comes to this climax, both Sullivan & Stewart play the encounter perfect.

The inspiration for the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicle \"You've Got Mail\", the film watches as two employees, Klara Novak and Alfred Kralick, repeatedly bicker. Unbeknownst to both, they're also madly in love with each other, having been anonymous pen-pals for several months. Will their romance finally break free of the post office? In a way, it doesn't matter. Lubitsch is all about tone and style. A director with a gift for a certain velvety sophistication, he treats us to some wonderfully sharp back-and-forth banter, a gang of likable characters, and turns the film's chief location, a bourgeois shop owned by the paternalist Mr Matuschek, into a romantic alcove with its own little family dynamics. There's shop-boy Pepi, actors Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart as our romantic duo (they'd work together in 4 films), and a cast of European-born Jewish actors ( Joseph Schildkraut, Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart), all of whom play likable shop employees. Throw in much Christmas-time ambiance and you have a film which practically glows.Of course you couldn't make a film like this today (love at Walmart?). \"The Shop Around the Corner\" hinges on a very specific type of nostalgia, relies on a certain naivet\u00e9 and hearkens back to a time when business meant family, corporate expansion meant buying a doorbell and all monetary transactions were seen as being inherently beneficial to any and all fellow-men. Such thinking is offensive today. To Lubitsch, though, the film's nostalgia means something else. It marks a world now lost and hidden \"around the corner\". A lamentation for the Germany he left behind, and a Europe which was changing come the the Second World War, Mr Matuschek's shop represents a place and time the Jewish Berliner recognises as having vanished. Perhaps this is why, though the film ends on a happy note, it ultimately leaves one with a keen sense of loss.Billy Wilder, another writer/director who had a way with words, adored Lubitsch, and had the phrase \"What would Lubitsch do?\" stencilled on his office doors. Today, modern audiences seem to have forgotten Lubitsch. \"The Shop Around the Corner\" still gets a lot of airplay, though, perhaps thanks to the always lovable Jimmy Stewart.9/10 \u2013 Makes a good companion piece to Vincente Miennelli's \"The Clock\". For the pessimistically inclined, see \"The Shop On Main Street\" and \"The Pawnbroker\".",

The supposed comedic part doesn't really come off, as its scattered instances quickly bump into a prevailing serious side. Too bad, for example, the screenplay drops in Matuschek's heartbreak over his wife's infidelity so awkwardly. Unfortunately, that comes at expense of the prevailing mood. Nonetheless, the lead roles are poignantly performed by leads Stewart and Sullavan even though they must play out their darker moments. Then too, the plot poses a thoughtful conflict between personalities on paper versus personalities in the flesh. Klara (Sullavan) and Klavik (Stewart) are in love as pen pals, but without knowing their true identities, quarrel constantly in as co-workers in the gift shop. That's an interesting idea since it counterposes constructed identities to real ones, and we wonder which set will prevail. Kudos to production for refusing to glamorize the gift shop staff, especially Klara. Nor, for that matter, is Klara all that likable in her shop work. In fact, the story's almost as much about the shop business as it is about romantic dreams of everyday people. Anyway, there's much to recommend in the 100-minutes, but the overall result is not particularly memorable, Lubitsch or no.",

            "content": "Why this film is so unknown I'm not quite sure. Maybe it's the way that James Stewart's 'It's A Wonderful Life' overshadows it, or maybe because its modern remake 'You've Got Mail' has stolen its popularity, or I guess it is simply the fact that the film is so hard to come by.A top tip for screenwriters is to 'show not tell', obviously the writers of The Shop Around The Corner (Samson Raphaelson and Ben Hecht) did not receive this advice but still they managed to create a clever structure around amusing dialogue. Of course, this story was originally a stage play written by Miklos Laszlo, which answers why it is so packed full of the spoken word. Those words are so well merged with each other and developed to make a succinct but simple story with lots of memorable moments of comedy.The director, Ernst Lubitsch, keeps the story going without allowing the narrative to become complicated, keeping a sharp pace to the 97-minute story. Lubitsch later said that this was his favourite he made in his career. His career includes being nominated for 3 Oscars and directing classic movies such as To Be or Not to Be, Heaven Can Wait, and Ninotchka. He is a legend from the golden era of Hollywood and if this is his favourite film it surely means it is a must watch! If you can find somewhere to watch this comical Christmassy romance then I have no doubt you'll thoroughly enjoy it, even with its occasional rather dark elements dipped into a couple of scenes.The Shop Around The Corner is a lovely film marvellously performed by Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart in the lead roles. No doubt that it's James Stewart's second best Christmas film!",

Both are excellent and you should see them both.Now, concerning the recent remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (YOU'VE GOT MAIL), I do not recommend it.

As is so often the case, emphasis on a particular locality has the paradoxical effect of heightening general truths. It's this that has enabled this wonderful piece to be turned into two musicals and be updated to the digital age with equal success.It does concern me that the sheer joy of this movie might become less appreciated as the years go by. It takes effort to look into films headlined by stars such as Sullavan and directors such as Lubitsch, whose names are not, let's face it, as prominent as they were in their own day. An even worse fate could befall, and perhaps already has befallen, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, described on my DVD cover as 'the original of YOU'VE GOT MAIL.' In this case, whatever might be said positively about the update, the original is better, by a long, long way. Lubitsch's film is a classic.",

This movie was produced in a more tender and sweeter time, with a much gentler sense of comedy, and the actors even seemed to be really participating in the show, not just acting like it. The choice of an Eastern European setting was very effective, especially the Budapest locale, a Hollywood version of Budapest it is true, but one which had not yet been ravaged and twisted by the horrors of World War II. The black and white format again helped in that the viewer wasn't distracted by the beauty or the color of the scenery, and could focus on the brilliance of the acting, which by the way, was evident among all the actors, not just the ones in the starring roles. I too fail to see much in common with the 1998 production of You've Got Mail, except for the actual mail element.

I thought Stewart's performance as Alfred Kralik was outstanding, while Margaret Sullavan's work as Klara Novak seemed a bit stilted and unconvincing at times.  The entire movie hinges on making the viewer believe that Klara can go from hating Alfred to accepting his offer of engagement in one scene.

            "content": "A film with many layers and a joy to watch, it's a real triumph for director Ernst Lubitsch. He gives us a romantic comedy in which the romance is just a part of a larger canvas, one that touches us in so many ways: the loneliness of the holiday season, the humiliation of betrayal, needing to endure other people and the boss at one's workplace to support a family, and of course, an unlikely love that only comes from scratching beneath the surface.Lubitsch is so complete in the way he tells this story, and yet seems to tread lightly as he does so. He fleshes out his characters in the simplest of ways, with little gestures and comments. He exercises the deftness of restraint in all things, from the slyness of his comedy to letting silence and his actors' faces say it all when appropriate. He gives us a rich symphony of human emotions, showing us human dignity and the angels of our better natures, but also our pettiness, jealousy, vanity, and disdain. In love, he shows us the importance of inner character but also acknowledges physical appeal. In community, he gives us a sense of comradeship, but also the inevitable pecking order and little rivalries. There is real wisdom in his observations of how people behave, but also a philosophical acceptance and elegant refinement in how he presents it. He always seems to thread the needle, and maybe that's the essence of what the 'Lubitsch touch' is all about.One theme in the film is how people communicate, and the need to be honest and yet graceful. We see this in how one salesman (Jimmy Stewart) talks to the boss (Frank Morgan) contrasted to the way another does (Joseph Schildkraut), a guy who sucks up and is an example of grace without truth. We also see it in how Stewart and the new saleswoman (Margaret Sullavan) antagonize each another, never giving one another the benefit of the doubt, and often being forthright but lacking grace. They are of course much more eloquent and kind to one another as anonymous pen-pals, and it shows us how much our openness and attitude towards someone else shapes our view of them.The cast is fantastic, led by excellent performances from Morgan and Stewart. Felix Bressart as the family man and William Tracy as the errand boy stand out in supporting roles. I wasn't as wild about Margaret Sullavan, but she fits the part quite well. The scene she has with Stewart in the caf\u00e9 is wonderfully acerbic, and is preceded by Bressart pointing out just who has the copy of Anna Karenina with the red carnation in a clever way. Another great scene is Stewart's dismissal, which is one he and Lubitsch both execute as true masters. I also loved that moment Frank Morgan has with the new errand boy after seeking someone to go to dinner with.There is such a genuine feeling to this film, where Lubitsch really takes us into the world of this little shop. As in life, there is despair, humiliation, and bickering, just as there is warmth, friendship, and higher love. This is an old film to seek out.",

            "review_title": "The Shop Around the Corner",
            "content": "Lovely, heart-warming Christmastime classic, with a strong cast, appealing leads, and good seasonal, festive atmosphere. A gift shop in Budapest is the setting for this romantic melodrama featuring Jimmy Stewart as a sales clerk and Margaret Sullavan as a new hire under his tutelage, with the excellent Frank Morgan (\"The Wizard of Oz\") as the boss/owner. Stewart and Sullavan often butt heads in constant argument, not realizing that they are each other's anonymous \"letter friends\" (maybe pen pals is particularly more apt), while Morgan is worried about his wife's possible infidelity. Morgan believes his wife's lover is Stewart, since he has been to Morgan's home and met her. But it is actually the chatty, unflappable Joseph Schildkraut, who knows how brownnose and butter folks up, quite clever and manipulative. Unbeknownst to Morgan, Schildkraut has been getting the wife to funnel him cash, quite the Casanova. While the film spends almost all of its time at the shop, a decision director Lubitsch made to appeal to the middle class, its cast make the most of the intimate setting. Stewart, with his soft cadence and careful tone, \"fights\" with Sullavan but he's more reactionary when she draws some ire for confrontational jabs at his critique of her work and finds him frustrating for back and forth discussions, sometimes heated, in regards to sales and approach to customers, not to mention, stocking the shelves and such. I think it is more flirting than anything else; I think she can be a bit harsh, sometimes, but a lot of it stems from the long hours together and differences in opinion in the shop. The film gets particularly cute when Stewart discovers that Sullavan is the one he's been writing to and receiving letters from, trying to calm the stormy tides of their rocky relationship so he can potentially prepare her for the grand revelation at the end. Morgan is a delight at the shop owner who grows increasingly irritable and grouchy because of his wife's spending habits, eventually learning of her affair, even trying to end his own life. The gut-wrenching release of Stewart by Morgan is handled in an alarmingly professional, quiet, and melancholic manner...Stewart reading the release letter to his co-workers is especially depressing. It was as if a father and son were parting, considering that Stewart apprenticed under Morgan. The caf\u00e9 scene where Stewart \"interrupts\" Sullvan's supposed meeting with her \"dream date\", as she does everything she can to shoo him away, including some harsh comments about him, expertly sets up the conclusion when Sullavan learns all. Stewart trying to describe her letter partner in a way that isn't particularly flattering is an amusing bit of sleight of hand that doesn't halt her from the dinner date, forcing him to come clean. Morgan out of a hospital, staying to recover from emotional distress after nearly shooting himself (William Tracy, as the \"errand boy\", certainly knows how to earn his stripes and eventually gain real entrance into the shop as a clerk when Stewart is promoted to Manager), returning to the shop to find quite a Christmas busy evening, is a pleasant hug for the viewer as he eventually sees life improving, even inviting a lonely kid working as the new errand boy for a Christmas supper. As a holiday film, \"The Shop Around the Corner\" fits the Christmas season quite well, even if many might grumble a bit about the commercialism of the setting. What I liked about Stewart was how he seems to have thick skin when some of Sullavan's cutting comments might ruffle more thin-skinned types...he is also only aggressive or lifts his voice to the very man that wronged his father figure. Despite Sullavan's meanness, from time to time, she still remains quite charming which should be noted. She is just looking for love, truly star-crossed by her fellow writer's gift for poetic style, and her desire to be a good saleswoman sort of brings out her assertive tit for tat opposite Stewart, who could be demanding. Felix Bressart, as Stewart's confidante, always tending to his family crises, is that employee at the store always loyal, there when you need him, offering friendly advice, and mindful of the importance to keep his job. When Stewart faces the dilemma of a job lost at such a time of the year, it is Bressart right there with him afterward.",

Even though the actors themselves are superb in their portrayals of the various characters, it took a master's hand to generate the framing of scenes, the timing, and the little nuances of interaction we see here. Only Billy Wilder comes to mind as a similarly gifted director.Comparisons to the later Hanks-Ryan opus are as many have noted odious and inaccurate. Still, there is just enough there to suggest that the theme is universal and apt, whether as holiday fare or as straight romance. Substitute e-mail for tiny letter boxes.If I have any reservations this late in the day about a Hollywood production quaintly placed in a setting that was about to explode in real life, c'est la vie. One can easily ignore the very American dialogue and sensibilities juxtaposed against Hungarian signage, or for that matter the historical fact that Budapest was then under a fascist regime and on the edge of becoming a contributor to the Holocaust.

She always strikes me as a drab looking little creature--notwithstanding a certain amount of charm--but nonetheless not a movie star I really care about. On the other hand, JAMES STEWART is terrific here. His restrained skill in romantic comedy is never put to better use than he does with the role as the love-smitten clerk who doesn't realize the girl he works with is sharing his pen pal letters.I had trouble with the clunky screenplay that veered off in the direction of dramatics at unexpected moments--pertaining to the Frank Morgan character. And the Joseph Schildkraut character comes across as a complete puzzlement--never adequately motivated or explained by the script.Frankly, I much prefer both musical versions that I've seen. And YOU'VE GOT MAIL wasn't bad either. At least the musicals played both leading roles for comic effect. Here Sullavan is much too earnest and plain to be appealing in the role.Of course I know this film has its admirers and they're all probably shaking their heads in disbelief at my review. But this is my impression of the film after hearing about it for years. The chief asset is James Stewart's effortless performance and Felix Bressart adding a great deal of warmth as a fellow clerk who avoids offering an opinion to the boss. Frank Morgan is not as lovable as usual in an ill conceived role and William Tracy is completely over the top as an ambitious errand boy promoted to clerk.Summing up: Could have been so much better since it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch who was supposed to have \"that touch\" with comedy.",

            "content": "It was 1940, 5 years before I was born. This movie is a nice example of a good romantic comedy at a time when we were more civilized. No sex, no bad language, just an interesting script and good acting. Set in Budapest, it is the same story that made it to Broadway, and also was turned later into \"You've Got Mail\" with Hanks and Ryan. Already a movie veteran and nearing age 30, James Stewart is Alfred Kralik, trusted salesman and assistant manager in the little \"Shop Around The Corner.\" But he has figured out he needs more than just work, so he begins to correspond with a local pen pal. About this time Margaret Sullavan, also a movie veteran nearing 30, as Klara Novak shows up in the shop, she desperately needs a job, and manages to talk herself into one as a sales person. It is nearing Christmas so they probably needed some help.The big boss is Frank Morgan (of Wizard in Wizard of Oz fame) Hugo Matuschek. He owns the company and runs a tight ship. Everyone seems afraid of him, always deferring to his opinions, except Kralik, who always tells him what he thinks. My favorite in this movie is William Tracy as the young messenger boy Pepi Katona, always efficient and eventually talks himself also into a sales job in the shop.SPOILERS FOLLOW: We figure out pretty quickly that the two anonymous letter-writers are Kralik and Novak, but they have no idea. In fact, they generate interpersonal friction early and appear to detest each other. But the letters tell a different story, and they each begin to fall in love with the other letter writer. Kralik gets fired, because of a misunderstanding. The boss thinks he is cheating with his wife. But the real news puts the boss in the hospital for a few weeks, during which Kralik is re-hired as manager and the Christmas season turns out to be one of the shop's best ever. In the last scene Novak finds out Kralik is the letter writer, they embrace, they will marry and live happily ever after.",

            "review_title": "The Unparalleled Lubitsch Touch in a Genuine Romantic Comedy Classic",
            "content": "Ernst Lubitsch was a master of the unexpected comedy element, something so idiosyncratic that it defies serious explanation. This charming 1940 classic epitomizes his style so well that the subsequent remakes appear either marginally pointless (the musical 1949 version, \"In the Good Old Summertime\") or excruciatingly formulaic (1998's e-mail update, \"You've Got Mail\"). This is a wondrous and gentle romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.Written by Samson Raphaelson, the souffl\u00e9-light plot involves the staff at Matuschek & Company, a Budapest leather goods emporium run by its curmudgeonly namesake. Head clerk Alfred Kralik is on the management track when Klara Novak impresses Matuschek enough to get hired as a new sales clerk. Inevitably, Alfred and Klara are at odds with each other from the start, but we discover they are also unwitting pen-pals who are falling in love without having met. Meanwhile, Matuschek suspects his wife of having an affair and suspects Alfred, whom he immediately terminates. When it turns out not to be Alfred but his despised co-worker, the bootlicking toady Ferencz Vadas, Matuschek commits a desperate act which forces Alfred to become the interim store manager. The busy Christmas season provides the appropriate setting to resolve all the plot strands.What strikes me most about the film is not the actual storyline, which borders on predictable and contrived upon closer inspection, but the way Lubitsch and the cast bring it to life in such subtly memorable ways. Young and assured, Stewart gives one of my favorite of his performances as Alfred, and with her buttery speaking voice, Sullavan provides the perfect match as Klara. Their chemistry is palpable and makes the subsequent remakes feel comparatively pallid. The Wizard himself, Frank Morgan portrays Matuschek with alternate bluster and poignancy. The other players also make vivid impressions, in particular, Lubitsch regular Felix Bressart as the timid Pirovitch, a cast-against-type Joseph Schildkraut as the slimy Vadas, and William Tracy as the resourceful errand boy Pepi. The print transfer on the 2002 DVD is blessedly clean, and there are two extras offered, the original theatrical trailer and a 1940 short, \"The Miracle of Sound\" about the impact of the sound revolution at MGM.",

The movie drags a little at some points but in general it keeps a rather decent pace. Some events are a pleasent suprise in the story but they feel a little misplaced. Stewart brings, as always, a certain amount of joy, believability and sensitivity to his character. Sullavan is well casts and performs quite well however in some scenes she lacks a powerfull attitude behind her words.\nAlthough a small role, the character development of Pepi, well played by William Tracy, gives a refreshing dimension to the movie.Some would call this a Christmas movie but I would say that it just so happends to take place around the holidays.

            "content": "Like many folks who've seen \"You've Got Mail\", I'd heard of \"The Restaurant Around the Corner\", but had never gotten around to seeing it until Christmas Eve, when it ran on TCM. What a gem! The hallmark of a great old movie, like a jazz or country album, is not the headliners but the supporting cast. Jimmy Stewart is so, well, Stewartesque as the senior employee of Matuschek and company, a gift shop anticipating a busy Christmas, and Frank Morgan, his boss, makes you forget all about The Wizard of Oz and almost convinced me that rich people really are worse off than those who have to work for them, when he suspects his wife of an affair with one of his employees. Margaret Sullavan stirs the shop's crew when she manages to sell a hard-to-move item to one of the shop's hardest customers, and she and Stewart create a delicious love/hate relationship that was imitated, not matched, by Ryan and Hanks decades later. The cast includes Sir Joseph Schildkraut, one of the earliest Oscar-winning supporting actors, and his role as Vadas, a co-worker to Stewart, is marvelous; at once mousy (whenever he hears the boss asking for an \"honest opinion\", he disappears as if the building is on fire) and fatherly, offering both Stewart and Sullavan advice on their love lives. The rest of the supporting cast is not as well known as the leads, but equally as delightful. Grace Hayle (not even credited) plays \"plump woman\" for perhaps the 100th time in her prolific career as a character actress. The movie exhibits the \"Lubitsch touch\", and sixty years after its release it still has moments that will make you laugh out loud. If you aren't used to watching movies from the 30s and 40s, you might not be used to the long sequences that, today, would be accompanied by soundtracks; likewise, some of the entrances and exits (walking into the scene after the camera has started) may appear dated. But that is part of the film's charm, for me at any rate.I'm sorry it's taken me so long to discover this happy little movie. Look for it year round, or at Christmastime.",

THAT one!\"). But, while director Ernst Lubitsch's classical rom-com may have to contend with its '90s remake for pop culture recognition, it's easily charming and delightful enough to warrant, at the very least, comparable adulation. Distinctly more demure and gentle than the masses of sparkier screwball comedies in vogue at its time, Lubitsch's film strips itself of any such pretences, striving instead for a softer, infinitely more vulnerable play for unfettered emotion, seasoned with knowing wit. His sentiment pays off, as the film remains an abiding holiday classic, almost too lovable to resist. Adapted from Hungarian playwright Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3's work Parfumerie, Lubitsch's retaining the Budapest setting with transplanted American actors may take some acclimatizing to (perhaps Lubitsch was content to have a more heartwarming link to Europe than all of the wartime atrocities cluttering the newsreels - notice the conspicuous absence of any politics or world events), but it only adds to the film's nostalgic, somewhat anachronistic charm. With a dreamy, unassuming pace, Lubitsch allows his characters to breathe, carefully delineating the lives, fears, hopes and dreams of each staff member of the titular department store's staff with tender compassion before allowing the centrepiece love story to build amidst them with slow, teasing playfulness. Certainly, the film has its blips of alarming darkness that suggest Lubitsch was too attuned to the sociopolitical climate to create an entirely vacuous fairy tale, but they are painted with the same observant humanity and care as the rest of the film's naturalistic character beats. And if the corresponding friction inherent in the film's Much Ado About Nothing twist may come with occasional whiffs of contrivance or excessive convenience, the mischievous, disarming sweetness with which they weave tantalizingly closer to one another more than makes up for it. The film's 'first date' scene alone is so unforgettably clever and savagely funny that even You've Got Mail couldn't resist borrowing it almost shot-for-shot, and winning the raucous laughs of a whole new generation of viewers. Still, it's the indelible chemistry of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, one of the most reliable pairings of the classical era, that elevate the film to the level of classic. The two play off each other with consummate ease, segueing from caustic, prank- filled, screwball-lite barbs and fireworks to embers of affection seamlessly, and Sullavan's fast-talking, peppery vigour proves the perfectly adorable foil for Stewart's twinkling, huffy bluster. Supporting them, Felix Bressart practically embodies the film's gentle, winking spirit as their kindly coworker, Joseph Schildkraut is so oily he practically glistens as the store's resident fink, William Tracy is so loudly comedic he practically seems to have cockily strolled in from another film entirely (but remains irresistibly funny nonetheless), while Frank Morgan hits the perfect cocktail of imposingly obtuse with a secret heart of gold as the shop's perennially harried owner. It's hugely refreshing, even for the early 1940s, to find a film so straightforwardly pleasant and enjoyable, but Lubitsch's deft hand has the film bursting with simple but robust charm. Resonantly heartwarming comedy and romance, an undercurrent of melancholy stripped of any histrionics and with only the gentlest indulgence of saccharine Hollywood convention, The Shop Around the Corner's abiding sweetness continues to make it a welcome discovery or revisitation, whether as a holiday watch, or a means of unwinding with a smile year-round. And if its success had anything to do to stem the flow of tacky, ornamental music boxes? All the better. -8/10",

But that doesn't mean that the story is not a well written one. Often though of course most elements in it are generic and predictable, it is still all brought in a fresh way, which makes the movie still original enough in its genre and definitely for its time. The dialog is especially well written, as you would expect from a '40's movie, when writers understood their craft. It even in the end has a great Christmas spirit in it, which adds all the more to the pleasant warm feeling of the movie.To me it seemed pretty redundant though that the movie was set in Hungary. It added nothing to the story or characters and worked only confusing, since the characters all had Hungarian names but of course were all talking in plain English. I understand they let this movie take place in Hungary because it was based on an Hungarian play but movie-wise it didn't added anything. This was something the later movie versions of the play \"In the Good Old Summertime\" and \"You've Got Mail\" understood.James Stewart wasn't really known for his leading comical or romantic roles, so his role in this movie is quite surprising and he does a good job at it as well. He still looked so very young in this and in his first scene I didn't even realized it was him, simply because I didn't recognized him. The rest of the cast isn't that well known but the movie is filled with many and delightful characters, that are by no means standard or one dimensional. The many characters within the movie definitely adds to the movie its fun.It's not the sort of comedy that will make you laugh out loud but it's more the sort of movie that will put a smile on your face, all the way through. 8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

But it's a pleasant film and has some funny scenes. The photography is exceptional, and Lubitsch's direction as always is finely balanced. He always gives you just enough and not too much, whether it be \"corn\" or drama or anything.Stewart is also very good in the role, I was surprised he could play so \"young\".",

            "content": "Ernst Lubitsch's comedies (\"Ninotchka\", \"To be or not to be\") have simple arguments that can easily charm us. This occurs, among other factors, due to the charisma of its characters, the structure of the stories and the personal touch of the filmmaker. That must be why, especially from the 1980s onwards, it is possible to observe references to his productions in the most diverse romantic comedies. In \"Message To You\", by Nora Ephron, it is possible, for example, to notice an update of \"A Loja da Esquina\", a 1940 comedy starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.Based on the eponymous play by Mikl\u00f3s Laszl\u00f3, the plot follows Alfred Kralik (Stewart), an experienced salesman for Matuschek, a gift shop in Budapest. Kralik corresponds anonymously with a young woman, unaware that this is Klara Novak (Sullavan), the newly hired saleswoman at the store with whom he does not have a friendly relationship. The setting of the film takes place, mostly, inside the store, which makes it possible to know the story of other characters such as the owner (Frank Morgan) and Pirovitch (Felix Bressart). More than that, we are invited to be with them.Between a whisper and another by Pirovitch and Kralik, a cynical discussion between the protagonist couple and Matuschek's abrupt interruptions, the camera by William H. Daniels (\"Vale das Bonecas\") makes us the third member of the scene, which contributes to create intimacy and perpetuate the charisma of the characters. Lubitsch's direction calls the viewer to witness the stories told in the store. Without resorting to exaggerations or mushy artifices common to this cinematographic genre, the German director does an unpretentious job, which employs in the group of salesmen a reflection of the world between wars.REFLECTION OF A SAD WORLDAlthough the narrative is constructed within a comic and Christmas atmosphere, it also accuses the psychosocial state to which it is inserted. One can notice, in the faces of the characters and in the dialogues, the loneliness, melancholy and collective hopelessness resulting from the initial tensions of the Second World War added to the crisis of 1929.Metaphorically, the script signed by Samson Raphaelson uses proximity to Christmas celebrations to nurture a dramatic arc in which all the characters are emotionally isolated and react to it, even if imperceptibly. For this reason, issues related to fear, limitations and disappointments are so present. In this scope, the linear narrative and without major twists and turns represents the existential condition of this historical period.Lubitsch built a small masterpiece in \"A Loja da Esquina\". Its round and charming story reveals a simple and smooth film that is much more than a classic romantic comedy: it is a portrait of its time.",

Finally an Ernst Lubitsch film worked for me. Recently i heard about 'Lubitsch touch' and watched 2 films, 'Trouble In Paradise' & 'Ninotchka' and found both of them highly overrated. Since I was hesitating to watch more Lubitsch films i happened to read a lot of good things about 'The Shop Around The Corner' being one of the finest lovestory and entertaining film of early 40s. I just gotto agree now. The Shop Around is highly sensible writing getting exactly the intelligent direction it deserves. There's fun, there's sadness, there're emotions, there's love, there's uniqueness, there's sensibility, there's comedy, there's is seriousness and bla bla oh god how much can i expect from one film in 100 minutes runtime? Lubitsch gave me everything in those 100 minutes and not to forget those interesting characters in the film. It has several characters that left me in aww and therefore i must say that this film isn't just a love story of 2 people but moreover it is a story of a family that works in the shop. I laughed, i cried, i moved by the narrative and i enjoyed it a lot. A guy and a girl are loving each other and simultaneously hating each other, how rarely we see this kind of intellectual storyline in 40s films? Or even today in 21st century? I never thought a farewell scene of an employee could be so emotional and moving untill I saw it here in the film. I never thought the conflicts in one small film could be so realistic and intellectual at the same time until I saw the conflicts in Boss and Employee's relationship in The Shop Around The Corner. I could go on saying so much about this film and spoiling so much so better i stop here. James Stewart is a fine actor and this film is just another remark of it. Margaret Sullavan gets same time space as other side actors in the film hence goes little bit less noticed. But the side roles are heavyweights here. William Tracey, Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart made their presence feel even bigger. The dialogues in the film are so beautiful. Those letter conversations, those quarrels, funny punches, slapstick notes and those sentimental talks were so wonderful. Overall, The Shop Around The Corner delivers more than expected from one film. It has so many things overloaded yet balanced to make one Memorable film. Just don't miss it. This will work in any country, any culture, any mindset, any taste, any time and any day. It's a purest form of Timeless Entertainment !RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

But let's not forget another truly wonderful, unforgettable holiday movie also starring Jimmy Stewart, Ernst Lubitsch's \"The Shop Around the Corner.\" Capra employs the device of an angel named Clarence trying to earn his wings to help prove to the character played by Stewart his own inherent goodness and worth. But Lubitsch has a simpler and less supernatural approach to conveying his holiday message: pen pals who've fallen in love without ever having seen one another. Both films are fundamentally about the power of love, in its many and various forms, to renew, redeem, and restore meaning to life. As was Capra's way, \"Life\" takes the more melodramatic & sentimental approach, whereas \"Shop\" is a bit melancholy and remarkably unsentimental in making its point. Many may continue to prefer the former, but I prefer the latter approach without reservation. Both are treasures, to be sure, during the holiday season or indeed at any time of year.",

Meanwhile, Matuschek happily deludes himself to the point of ruin about his wife, pouring money via her into the dandy Vadas' jewelry box.  The shop itself sells vanities to the affected middle classes epitomised by the musical cigarette boxes.  Pirovitch alone is happy with his simple family life acting as a counterpoint to the self-deluding fantasies of the rest of the cast. This could be a set up for a tragedy, and indeed seems to be heading that way when Stewart looses his job and trades barbed comments with Sullivan. But we are offered the chance of redemption.  Rudy saves Matuschek from the bullet, Vadas is uncovered (by perhaps an almost revelingly cruel Stewart) and we swing back into romance territory.  The underpaid workers are happy selling their knick-knacks again, the tills ring for Christmas and romance fills the air, their salvation, or another happy deception?",

That I ultimately prefer the dark side is not due to any fault of Lubitsch but rather to my indifference toward Sullivan as a comedic actress.

With such levels of subtly, this is the kind of movie that needs to be watched multiple times and gets better every time you do so. Often there will be a verbal joke in which I am unaware it even is a joke and it will take a few seconds to catch onto it. Most of Lubitsch's films were set in Europe as this was where he was from. The shop of Shop Around the Corner is in Budapest, Hungary. The world this movie is set was on the brink of destruction in 1940 but there is no mention of this in the film. Just like how the film harkens back to a more peaceful time it also acts like a nostalgia portal to a time before the internet or big corporate businesses. A shop which is a physical, hands-on and above all a communal experience. The shop is a world onto its own populated by unforgettable characters.Like Lubitsch, most of Margaret Sullavan's movies also took place in Europe, I don't know of the reason for this, however; a big coincidence or did she deliberately choose to star in movies with European settings? James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan aren't remotely Hungarian but classic Hollywood movies aren't exactly known for their realism in this regard. I also find it humorous how Klara is able to get a job by walking into a store and proving she is capable of selling items; if only it were that easy in real life!The Shop Around the Corner is one of the prime examples of the classic \"they hate each other but are really in love\"; in fact, they really hate each other. Stewart's Alfred Kralik is actually a real asshole; he's brash and very opinionated. Likewise, Margaret Sullavan isn't a sexy, glamorous Hollywood star; Klara Novak is a down to Earth, intellectual. As the movie progresses you so badly want these two characters to end up together to the point that it hurts. These aren't two performers with great chemistry, these are two performers with incredible lifelike chemistry which blends the dividing line between fiction and reality. If ever there was an on-screen couple how where made for each other, this is it.",

They are played with wit, grace and charm-- and they leave you feeling something wonderful, something transcendent, has just happened on screen. Ernst Lubitsch's THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is that way.Though filmed entirely on a Hollywood soundstage by MGM, Lubitsch manages to make the production feel European. We know it's not really Budapest-- there are no exteriors shot on location; and most of the accents are no different than those used in other Hollywood films set in foreign locales.But we believe in this story, and we believe in Matuschek and Company, the tiny shop where goods are sold around the corner. It exists in a time and place much less complicated than our world today.The emotional heart of the story is anchored by two would-be lovers named Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan). Mr. Kralik has worked for Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan) for nine years, having advanced from his original position as a lowly clerk. As the film begins, Miss Novak comes in looking for a job, but Matuschek and Kralik are reluctant to take her on.By some miracle she is able to prove herself as a saleswoman and is subsequently hired. The story moves on from there. Kralik and Novak are now coworkers, and the two forge a bond despite often clashing with one another.Though much of the narrative's focus is on the blossoming relationship between Kralik and Novak, there are plenty of moments that feature the other employees at the shop. All their lives are affected by the boss and by each other. This includes the villain of the piece Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut) who we learn early on is having an affair with Matuschek's never seen wife.Most of the romantic elements that occur between the leads are backgrounded during the film's first half. But gradually it comes to the forefront, as we learn Kralik and Novak have been anonymously corresponding with each other. They've fallen in love through their letters to one another, but ironically have come to despise working together.He learns the truth first and withholds this information from her. The moment near the end when she finds out is truly sublime. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan perform so well in these scenes, there is never any doubt about the characters' real feelings. They appeared in three other films, though this is certainly their most remembered collaboration.The success of Lubitsch's picture cannot be underestimated. Critic Pauline Kael called it the most perfect Hollywood film ever made, praising its delicate pacing and skillful execution. MGM remade it in Technicolor in 1949, as a musical with Judy Garland. In the 1990s it was re-filmed again, updated to reflect a love affair that occurs through emails. Neither one of the remakes have the grace and dignity of the original.",

It certainly doesn't have the charm or irresistible properties of some of his earlier films and this story is one of the darkest of romantic comedies I have ever seen. Still, with all due respect, Stewart is one of the greatest actors to ever live and the supporting cast is wonderful with Frank Morgan as the store owner and Felix Bressart as Pirovitch.

The whole is just flawless.The remake in 1998 is perfectly pleasant but the sheer perfection of this production raises the story to a different level. There is nothing obviously profound about this story but we are being memorably transported to an uplifting vision and warmth in the midst of normal people's lives. In itself, this is profound or can be if we let it.",

Fortunately, it was playing on Turner Classic Movie channel, so I settled down after my family's Christmas celebration and just enjoyed! Movies from this era of film are more akin to stage plays than the movies now and I so enjoy the craft of well spoken dialogue. The plot is simple and transparent (it's premise was the inspiration for YOU'VE GOT MAIL). The supporting cast is eclectic and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Usually, I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies.If you are bored by today's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself. Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart. (OK, weired example.) Yes, the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet still, I liked it a lot. If you liked Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner. in fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.",

Only Lubitsch could make James Stewart a despicable person, balanced out by Stewart's natural likability. I wanted to like The Shop Around The Corner more given that it's very popular among those who made it but maybe it'll grow on me. I did love its idea of love not being superficial.

            "content": "This move was the inspiration for \"You've Got Mail\" which is a far better movie in every way. Most of the problem lies with the nasty, hateful characters.Alfred Kralik (James Stewart): Kralik is an affable character who is misunderstood and insulted by Klara. There is no logical reason for her behavior except that she is a b***** at heart who misrepresented herself in her letters. Poor Kralik, deludes himself into thinking he loves her when he really loves the false persona she generated in her letters. Stewart's performance is average, but still apropos for the character.Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan):\nShrill voiced shrew who hurled a constant and unending barrage of hateful insults at Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart). She misinterpreted everything he said to her as some kind of insult and responded with hateful biting insults. She continued this right up until the end of the movie. I don't know how the viewer is supposed to believe she wrote the kinds of letter she supposedly wrote given her abominable behavior. There was no reason for her behavior other than the fact that she is a thoroughly nasty person. People regularly misrepresent themselves online and obviously did the same back when they communicated by letter, as klara did. The ending where he looks at his legs and kisses him passionately is the most stupid romantic endings in any movie I have EVER seen!Pepe Katona:\nA thoroughly unlikeable character who shows his true colors when he gets the promotion for saving Mr. Matuschek's life. He is a small insignificant man (boy\") with delusions of grandeur about his self-worth. In addition, he was supposed to keep the attempted suicide of Mr. Matuschek and the reason for it secret, but he blurts it all out in front of everyone when he talks to Mrs. Matuschek. In addition, he had no way of knowing the she had an affair with Mr. Vadas, since that was told to Mr. Kralik in strictest confidence, yet he implies that is what happened in the same phone call. Beyond that, the re does not seem to be any surprise among the other employees when they hear the phone call, as if they all already knew the whole story.Ferencz Vadas:\nWhile a dislikable character, at least he was portrayed honestly and not misrepresented as a good guy. The viewer immediately disliked him the moment he spoke for the very first time. He was a preening egotistical man with delusions of self grandeurs, much like Pepe, except he was portrayed honestly as the villain of the piece.Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan):\nThe first hurdle with this character is getting over the urge to see him as the Wizard in the Wizard of Oz. His character is thoroughly likeable and we are all sympathetic to his travails. He comes across as the kindly old uncle who looks out for the welfare of his relatives. There is, however, some bad and contradictory writing of his character. He confesses to Kralik that he has hated him for a very long time because he thought he was having an affair with his wife, but he invited him to his home for dinner, and talked warmly about making Kralik a partner in the store. In fact, he is very friendly to Kralik throughout the movie until the scene where he dismisses him. It looks like the writers were just making up whatever suited their story line at that point in the movie without regard to continuity, very bad writing.This is a very badly written movie, with all kinds of plot holes and errors that are never fixed. It is also a very dark and depressing movie in spite of the attempt to make it a romantic and warm Christmas movie. We have poor Kralik about to marry Klara based on the lies she wrote in her letters. Mr. Matuschek while giving from his heart as he offers Christmas dinner to the delivery boy, still has to deal with the infidelity of his wife leading to his attempted suicide.You may want to watch this movie just to see the inspiration for \"You've Got mail\", but rest assured \"You've Got Mail\" is a much better movie, with thoroughly likeable characters, especially Meg Ryan's character who shows genuine empathy and remorse when she insults Joe Fox. The romantic end is much more heartwarming and actually brought me to tears which is a very difficult thing to do.I am overly generous giving this movie even two stars.",

But not a single customer coming in the shop speaks a foreign language or even has an accent. Perhaps this was characteristic of movies of that day, but I found it distracting.

It is more believable that the two romantic leads can overcome their dislike for each other and fall in love.

The movie's main characters are portrayed by the great James Stewart and wonderful Margaret Sullavan and just by looking at the two of them you feel their chemistry right away. Outstanding performances. And so are everyone else's; the secondary characters have their stories as well - they open up to the viewer, make us care for them, fall in love with them, empathize with them and it all happens in the runtime of just less than a 100 minutes; most of 200 minute movies nowadays cannot offer even the main character's full disclosure.Watching movies like \"The shop around the corner\" makes me feel alive and thinking that destiny has its own funny ways of playing this strange little game called life. You can dream of a perfect person who will adore you, love you, make you feel beautiful and pretty but it wouldn't be the same as having a real one by your side, and where can you find such person? Oh, maybe he's just around the corner, or seats right by you on a subway train, or stands right behind you in the line to get a latte. Don't you ever underestimate fate, folks, I tell you, because one of these days when you least expect it you will be punched right in your face by the fist of fate - and you will feel great about it.I have always loved James and I always will - I consider \"The shop around the corner\" one of his finest performances ever but Margaret shines the brightest here; I would surely love to dig into her filmography as well and see what else this remarkable actress has got to offer.

Being that \"You've Got Mail,\" is one of my favorite romance comedies of all time, I expected that I would love this film as well. Unfortunately, this version did not work as well as I would have liked. Unlike the remake, this film does not keep us and the main characters in suspense, waiting and wishing for them to finally fall in love. Several subplots also put burdens on the light-hearted nature the film should have, as the remake did. The film has too many upsetting moments, such as job losses, nervous breakdowns, and Jimmy Stewart's boss (Frank Morgan, the Wizard of \"Wizard of Oz\") learning his wife is having an affair. I prefer this film as the fun, romantic story it turned out to be in the remake. Jimmy Stewart and Margret Sullivan make excellent stars, but the supporting cast is not as good or appealing as I would like. If you don't mind a romantic story like this mixed in with more serious moments, you will probably enjoy this. If you want a more carefree and romantic film, as I did, this one may not be for you.

I was struck by the similarity of the characters and much of the plot line to \"Little House of Horrors.\" Steve Martin's dentist could have been the man who seduced the wife of the shop owner. Audrey could have been Miss Novak, etc. The owners of both shops were almost twins, even having similar names. Maybe I'm crazy, but these two movies are from the same, or at least parallel, universes.Jimmy Stewart gave a great performance as the clerk. I especially liked the kid who played Rudy--a small but critical part that gave the little shop a future, while the old errand boy started his climb to eventfully manage the place. Real life showed up in this film.",

James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan head up an excellent cast of people working in a leather goods store during the Christmas season. Some interesting surprises are in store for the viewer, but the Stewart-Sullavan interplay drives this delightful old film forward. Frank Morgan is the owner of the 'shop' and delivers his role beautifully. TCM shows it from time to time.",

It didn't hurt that Ernst Lubitsch was at the helm, presiding over a talented cast headed by Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, an actress whose work should be better remembered. In previous years, the two stars had gained a lot of experience in the same the community-theater circuits, and their chemistry here is genuine. Sure, the movie is pushing a century old....everybody is polite and they call each other \"Mr\" and \"Miss\"....any conflicts are handled without foul language, violence or bawdy conversation....and what a well-acted, expertly directed, gentle pleasure it is. If you appreciate the Golden Age of movies, don't miss this little gem.",

This The Shop Around the Corner, from 1940, is already part of the final stage of his career, with other great hits such as Ninotchka or To Be Or Not to Be.With James Stewart leading the cast, this is a story of the common man, humble shopkeepers, with their frugal lives and small dreams, poetically elevated to the role of everyday heroes.A fun and positive film, very well written and capable of raising the viewer's morale and good mood, even more than 80 years after it was made, due to its humanism and intelligence.",

            "content": "In the wide range of the Lubitsch touch, The Shop Around The Corner most certainly falls more deeply in the romance category than the comedic side, represented by his other masterpieces like To Be Or Not To Be. As another reviewer said, this is one of the saddest romantic comedies around, but we'll all be happy to know that the screenwriter couldn't help but put in a few clever quips that Lubitsch is so wonderfully known for. The script could easily be one of the tightest scripts of all time, and it is admirable how much mileage they get out of a single room and few relationships. I highly suggest this film to anyone who finds joy in simple stories made fun through the sheer mastery of the craft of film.",

            "content": "\"The Shop Around the Corner\" is the movie on which the Tom Hanks / Meg Ryan film, \"You've Got Mail\" is based.  My wife and I enjoyed the Hanks film a great deal and, as I am a big fan of Jimmy Stewart, I expected to like the original even more.  Alas, in this I was disappointed.  Stewart is excellent as Alfred Kralik and Margaret Sullivan makes a good foil for his efforts as Klara Novak, but overall the movie falls short of what it could have been. \nThere are really two stories going on in this movie:  Kralik's anonymous postbox relationship with Klara Novak, and Kralik's pseudo father/son relationship with his employer, Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan).  This means that the script must make room for both stories, the result of which is that neither is as fully developed as it could be.  This is most evident at the end, when we learn -- in what comes off as a very artificial rush -- that Klara has been attracted to Alfred all along and was (supposedly) faking her dislike for him as a means of attracting his attention.  This Deus-ex-machina contrivance is necessary in order to produce the required Happy Ending when Alfred reveals to Klara that he is the letter writer whom she has pined over.Nora Ephron's adaptation of this story avoids this pitfall by sticking with only one story -- the two-sided relationship between the Hanks and Ryan. She was thus able to permit Meg Ryan's character much more time to change her view of Hanks, and Hanks more time to woo her to that changed point of view.  The result was a more believable Happy Ending (to the extent, of course, that any Hollywood Happy Endings are believable!).I also found the supposed setting (pre-war Budapest) to be a similar contrivance.  As a Hungarian, Miklos Laszlo's decision to set the play in pre-war Budapest is understandable.  But when the movie was cast with the all-American stars Stewart, Sullivan, and Morgan, a New York or Chicago setting would have been much more credible.Disappointment aside, though, this is still a fun film to watch.  As I said at the beginning, Jimmy Stewart acts with his usual brilliance, and Margaret Sullivan and Frank Morgan complement him very well.  So do go ahead and get this on DVD if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan or a lover of romantic comedies. The Shop Around the Corner is not perfect, but it is pleasant.  I, for one, like pleasant.",

Stewart gives a good performance as usual but Sullivan who plays the girl isn't that appealing. At some points she gets so annoying and whiny that you almost hope they don't end up together. The supporting cast gives good laughs and keeps you entertained most of the time. This movie does have more plot than the other two and the supporting characters are not just \"window dressing\". It's a good film, worth seeing if you have the time, but definitely check out the other two versions and make your own judgment.",
