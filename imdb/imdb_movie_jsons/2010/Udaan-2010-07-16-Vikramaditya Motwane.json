            "content": "Udaan must be one of the best Hindi films I've ever seen - realistic, simple, engaging, riveting, inspiring and deeply moving. Vikramaditya Motwane's direction deserves the highest of praise, and the script, written by Motwane and the great Anurag Kashyap, is superbly written. The film looks authentic and is easy to relate to and yet it has an impressive larger-than-life quality to it that makes wonders. This poignant story is brought out exceedingly well on-screen, and the depiction of the subject matter is brutally honest, at times disturbing and excruciating and yet totally encouraging. Made with sheer graciousness and sincerity, Udaan perfectly captures the adolescent days of a young teenager named Rohan, and it follows his dreams, desires and growing maturity.After being in a boarding school for 8 years, Rohan is expelled and is forced to return to Jamshedpur to live with his terribly authoritarian father and a younger half-brother about whose existence he never knew. The story follows Rohan's life with his domineering father, who maltreats him and disapproves of his dreams to become a writer by forcing him to study engineering and work at his steel factory, by treating him like a recruit, by abusing him physically and emotionally, and by scorning his writing skills. But life there actually causes Rohan to mature. His pain inspires him to write and he gradually grows to love his poor and helpless young brother Arjun, who, orphaned from his mother, equally yet quietly bears the brunt of his father's cruelty and is intimidated into silence by his despotism.Udaan is about chasing your dreams and living your life as fully as possible despite everything. It, in a sense, celebrates the power of the human spirit, showing us that we can fly very high and fulfill our most impossible dreams if we only believe in ourselves and summon up the courage to fight for our happiness. All that is presented through the character of Rohan, which is incredibly well written. He is smart, talented, compassionate and he does not spend time feeling sorry for himself for having a true monster of a father. On the contrary, it gives him the strength to create and write more, never letting his father's attempts to morally abuse him into submission deter him, lose his sense of life or stop writing. That's what makes this movie so spirit lifting.The narrative style is exemplary. The movie is amazingly realistic and intense and while some may say it is a bit slow in pace, according to me it's thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Not even once does it lose its consistency and integrity. Every scene is brilliantly shot and directed and is important to the film's proceedings. The portrayal of relationships is also aptly done here. Rohan's friendship with his schoolmates is portrayed exceptionally, despite the minimal screen time it's given. You just feel it's always there. Where its technical aspects go, Mahendra Shetty's cinematography is fantastic and so is Dipika Kalra's effective editing. Amit Trivedi's music is absolutely spot on for this movie. The songs bring the film to life and are truly uplifting and fun.The acting is roundly excellent by one and all. Even the tiniest roles look believable and genuine and they greatly contribute to the film. Rajat Barmecha debuts in this movie in a role that young aspiring actors can only dream of. He is one of the most promising actors of the current breed of fresh talents and although he clearly is going to have a great career, this is probably the role he will be most remembered for. He acts with complete understanding of the character, making it very convincing and relatable by naturally displaying Rohan's anguish, vulnerability and compassion, and later on his coming-of-age, courage and determination to do it his way.Ronit Roy is excellent as the merciless father. He manages to be as hateful as possible, yet at times he shows sparks of regret and humanity, which may be very few and barely noticeable to some, but are enough to understand that it is his own weakness and struggle that made him act as he did. Ram Kapoor in a relatively small part leaves a mark as the kind uncle of the kids, who is the complete opposite of his hot-blooded brother. The same can be said about Manjot Singh, who makes his second film appearance after a memorable performance in Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!. His ten-minute role here as Rohan's best friend is so likable and well-played that you feel like having watched him there throughout the entire movie. The film's brightest spot is undoubtedly Aayan Boradia. He is simply outstanding as Arjun and is easily one of the cutest kids in recent movies. This is a strikingly convincing portrayal; he smiles very few times throughout and conveys so much of his loneliness and pain through his innocent eyes and touching silence, without ever overdoing it. His quiet suffering and heartbreakingly accepting attitude of growing without a mother and without the care of a loving parent, on top of that having a merciless and violent father instead, make you really feel for him. It's almost impossible to believe anyone could harm such a poor creature. This is according to me one of the finest performances by a child actor, up there with the unforgettable Jugal Hansraj of Masoom.Udaan does not work because of what it 'has' but more because of what it 'is', and that's why it's so great. The ending is extraordinary, and it brings forth the long-awaited catharsis. The climactic sprinting scene is a triumph on its own - exhilaratingly exciting and hauntingly memorable. A magnificent song called \"Aazaadiyan\" perfectly concludes this terrific story, effectively presenting the film's ultimate 'udaan' (flight). Udaan is an ineffable cinematic experience and to put it simply, the best Indian film I've seen in years. Truly one gem of a movie.",

A taut relationship, often violent, aggressive, and abusive, between a father and his son, with two amazing performances taking centre stage.

            "content": "You might find the poster of the movie a bit misleading \u2013 because the poster and the trailer of the movie seem to suggest that it is college- teen story. And Udaan is anything but that. It is, however, a intensely heartfelt movie with a strong emotional connect \u2013 and with so much realism, that I cant shake the feeling it is, to a large extent, autobiographical. Even though it is populated with largely unknown faces, set in a bleak industrial city, yet this movie will linger in your minds for a long time after you exit the hall.The plot of the movie is essentially a two liner. A 17 year old is kicked out of boarding school for playing truant and is forced back to an apathetic father \u2013 and to a 6 year old half brother he didn't know existed. Stuck in a small town with no friends, forced to study engineering and work in his father's iron and steel works, Udaan is a story of Rohan's struggle with his loneliness and desperation. It is not pure entertainment, but it has got a lot of soulThe overbearing character in the movie is Bhairav Singh, played by Ronit Roy. A despotic father (with some probable army background, though its never suggested) \u2013 who does not listen to any opinion that doesn't match his own and runs his life with army-like discipline. He even insists his sons call him Sir. He stands starkly in contrast with his younger brother, the affable Ram Kapoor. He is the only beacon of light in Rohan's new world.And amongst them, sitting quietly in a corner is his younger brother Arjun \u2013 who doesn't speak much, yet wins your heart. Everything from the background music to the photography is perfect for the movie \u2013 Amit Trivedi's music melodious yet not distracting from the movie and the bleak shots of Jamshedpur accentuating the void that Rohan feels around him. Udaan is a coming-of-age movie that you will identify with because of its honesty and sincerity. Newcomer Rajat Barmecha delivers one of the most subtle, yet effective roles in sometime \u2013 putting up a stoic face against the circumstances, yet showing us the vulnerable teenager within. The movie takes a slow pace, which in my opinion is essential for the viewers to share Rohan's desperation \u2013 but some of my friends thought otherwise. That is probably the only slight flaw in this fabulous movie. Highly recommendedYou can read more reviews at http://bombaycinephile.blogspot.com",

            "review_title": "Abusive father, idealistic son, and complex modern India middle class...",
            "content": "Udaan (2010)On the main level this is a gripping, realistic, deeply moving story of a sensitive boy with an abusive father growing up in a culturally complex India. This is the main point here, and the reason to see it. The leading part played by this boy, Rohan, is a magnificent acting debut for Rajat Barmecha. He was twenty playing a seventeen year old schoolboy, but he's convincing, and nuanced, with both great emotional vulnerability and flashes of rebellion and fire. The other level to consider from this movie is as a cultural lens. I write from the U.S. and know only what I see from here, but it seems like a coming of age movie with the tinges of generation gap and young rebellion seen blossoming (in the movies and in life) here in the 1960s and 70s. Rohan's father is \"old school\" in that he's tough on his son, thinking the son needs discipline and hard work to grow up and be functional. The boy though is a writer at heart (there are several scenes where he recites poems or tells stories and they are spellbinding, if brief), and the father won't hear of that. Raising Rohan without a mother seems to give him so leniency for his stubbornness, but not for his violence, and Rohan, somehow, must react.The third character of note is not a girl--a nice change from many young men growing up stories--but a little half-brother who Rohan ends up befriend and ultimately kind of mentoring. The little one is super cute and delicate, and the three males with all their problems and conflicts make for a rich, intense interplay.The other cultural aspect (besides how young people might be seeing their morality shift from their parents and grandparents) for an outsider is to see contemporary India in a rather true, ordinary way. I mean, \"Slumdog Millionaire\" was amazing and sensational in its own way, but it pushed buttons and pushed boundaries. This movies stays within boundaries to that being edgy isn't interfering with the reality of the story and all its successive stages. It's really great stuff overall. The one thing that will seem odd, maybe, to some is the inspirational feel-good music with lyrics written for the film. It's almost saccharine it's so idealistic, but then, it's probably when every struggling 16 year old in Mumbai or New Delhi or wherever needs to hear. That part of the movie is not for an outsider at all, which is okay. I think people see the American classic \"The Graduate\" and have similar problems with the coming of age problems being mid-1960s in flavor, and the music having a pretty tenor not always up a contemporary alley.So see Udaan for what it is. Rooted in expert and conventional filmmaking and storytelling, but powerful stuff.",

            "review_title": "This Udaan will fly high....",
            "content": "Udaan First time director Vikramaditya Motwane has done a brilliant job with Udaan. This film was truly worthy of a screening at Cannes. The simplicity of this movie is probably what makes this movie wonderful. Its a story which is not too uncommon in India, but the way its been shown, is what brings the freshness in the film.Rohan(Rajat Barmecha) has just been rusticated from his boarding school along with his 3 friends for they were caught watching an adult film of sorts(Kanti Shah ke Angoor) by their dean. As it turns out, Rohan has to go back to his home in the small industrial town of Jamshedpur, To add to his woes we find out that he hasn't met his father(Ronit Roy as Bhairav) in 8 years and he doesn't even know of the existence of a step-brother(Aayan Boradia as Arjun) at his home. Reaching there he learns that he has to work with his father at his factory and enroll in engineering college. And the disciplinarian his father is, he can't even question him. As he is stuck there with his dream of becoming a writer seemingly getting shattered, he learns to cope with life. He learns to love his kid step-brother, manages to write between work and college, sneaks out for a drink or two at night, but inspite of all this, he is getting suffocated. He wants to escape. He wants to fly.Udaan is a simple, emotional story about a boy in a small town, learning to live with his disciplinarian of a father. It is actually as simple as that. It might not sound interesting like this but the fact is that the way this normal coming of age story has been showed is just brilliant. There is nothing 'bollywood' about this film, its as if this movie was shot with a handy-cam, capturing the lives of a real family. But that doesn't make this one bit boring, because obviously there are some exaggerations, some gags, some drama but all in all its very real and believable. I'm sure everyone one of us would be able to relate to this film in some way or the other.The high point of the movie is the performances by the leading men(there are hardly any women in this film). Ronit Roy as a single father has done his job with perfection. He drinks, smokes, but still goes for a jog every morning, which also turns out to be a very important aspect in the story. He sometimes loses his cool, uses force in teaching his kids a lesson, but at times we also see that he is caring and probably a little vulnerable. He's acted so well, that you can feel it when he is drunk, you even get scared when he is angry, that good is his screen presence. I was wrong to write off this TV actor. Rajat Barmecha too has done an impeccable job in portraying a kid, who has lived his life in one of the best boarding schools of India and now is stuck in a small town. He does the usual, sneaks out at night for drinks and smoke, steals his fathers cars for doing so, but still makes it on time in the morning for his daily run with his dad. His writings are beautiful too, so credit must go to the original writer as well. But the award must go to Aayan Boradia who is one of the best child actors I have ever come across in Indian cinema. He is so real, so cute and you will just fall in love with him. He is somewhat aware of what is going on but obviously at his age he just can;t do anything about it as his understanding does not go that deep. And then lastly Ram Kapoor as Jimmy, Bhairav's younger brother brings a very good contrast between his authoritarian brother and his practical chilled out of sorts character. He understands Rohan's dreams and aspirations but he can only do so much to convince his big brother to change his mind. A very intriguing relationship between the two brothers I must say.Running time of over 2 hours, this might at times seem a little slow, but you gradually understand the importance of those long silent shots as the film progresses to its climax. There are scenes that will send chills down your spine. There scenes that will inspire you to 'fly out of a cage' if you are in one, metaphorically speaking of course. Its just filled with those moments that will be with you for sometime to come. It won't be easy to forget this movie soon. And let me assure you, you will come out highly satisfied after watching this movie. A big thumbs up for Motwane! Looking forward for more! Cheers to all the actors as well!",

            "review_title": "An insightful and must watch take on adolescence with a hidden message.",
            "content": "Adolescence is one of those rare subjects on which we haven't witnessed many movies made in Bollywood. Therefore UDAAN comes as a pleasant surprise from a debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane, who boldly makes his first movie on an important subject and delivers a fine polished product proving his unique thought process with a style.First of all the film is not preachy as it may seem to be from its look and promos. It's a simple story of a young boy and his relationship with his rigid father and helpless younger step brother told in the most simplistic way. But as it is said, 'The beauty lies in its simplicity', UDAAN becomes worth watching because it's truthfully simple without any added flavors or colors.It starts superbly with its first 20 minutes depicting the mischievous days of 4 young friends living in a boarding school. The sequence of their running from the school to watch an adult movie in the night show sets the mood in for the viewers. But this particular section of the film indisputably belongs to Manjot Singh alone (the young Lucky from 'Oye Lucky Lucky Oye\"), as he clearly outshines everyone on the screen with his famous realistic dialogue delivery style and comic persona. After its funny half an hour, UDAAN takes a serious turn and then moves into a completely different shell talking about the difficulties faced by a young boy while interacting with his ruler kind of a father. At this stage the narration becomes serious and the pace slows down drastically. But very soon you find yourself involved in this little family of three men living in the same house as strangers.In every family, a young male child always has his own contradictions with his father. There is difference of opinion, difference of vision and most probably the fight is over the issue of the stream or line in which the child desires to make a career in. UDAAN rightly focuses on this relevant issue and therefore every young boy watching the movie would easily relate to the script and the characters in a big way.The movie may not find a thumbs up from every section of the viewers as its basically meant for the fans of realistic cinema who are used to a slower pace and can appreciate the social subject of the script. It also has some minor flaws in its charactersiation like, how can a child steal money and car from his father who has a reign of fear in the family and yet cannot revolt right away. But even after these minor glitches, it still remains a well crafted film standing out of all those usual projects offered to us in 2010.In real terms there are few visible and one invisible aspect of \"UDAAN\", which makes it a worth watching project.The visible aspects mainly include the outstanding confrontation sequences between the father and the son about their different styles of living and choice of professions. Both Rajat Barmecha as the young boy and Ronit Roy as the father truly excel in their scenes together. Then just watch out for the young kid Aayan Boradia, playing the silent step son, who mutely keeps suffering the merciless beatings of his father and doesn't utter a word. He is simply adorable and loving with his innocent smile and dialogues. And then there are two sparkling performances by Ram Kapoor and Manjot Singh. Especially the silent conversation scenes between Ram and Rajat are a treat to watch. Finally the most impactful visible aspect of the movie remains its climax where Rajat along with his writer Anurag Kashyap and director Motwane defines the meaning of their title \"UDAAN\" in an exceptional way. In fact the concluding scene of the movie is capable of lifting up every viewer from his seat in sheer joy.Coming to the invisible but in my opinion the most important aspect of \"UDAAN\", which puts it in a completely different league, is the way it expresses the need of A MOTHER in every child's life. The film makes you feel the incomparable role of a female or a mother in a family who cannot be replaced by any amount of love, compassion or care provided by the other members. A mother, who can finish off all the differences in a family with her kind presence, love and calmness. A mother, who in disguise is just GOD living in our homes for taking care of us in the needy times. And a Mother whose debt we cannot repay in any form in our whole life on this planet.Both the director and the writer need to be congratulated on this hidden aspect of the movie which may not strike all the viewers at first. But if you can think for a moment, then all the sufferings in the movie are only there due to the missing factor in the family called \"MOTHER\".So, in a way \"UDAAN\" also makes you realize this Biggest Gift of God to the mankind by very softly portraying the fact that a family becomes completely dry and stiff in absence of a motherly abode. I hope the film encourages every son or daughter to remember that they are blessed to have their mothers around them in this tender age and they do take care and love her to the best of their abilities forever. Summing up, its a recommended flick since it has an important message for all fathers and families having their kids in the adolescence age. And indeed a must watch for its invisible merit, indicating the role of a Mother in a happy family.(The movie right away moves into my \"Movies To See Before You Die\" list cause it makes you realize the most precious gift of God to us and that's our Mother.)",

Ronit Roy does it so amazingly that you wonder if his talents were wasted on television. Both kids are so refreshing.

            "content": "If you don't like unpleasant films, then you should not see \"Udaan\". Now I am NOT saying it's a bad movie--it's actually very good. But the subject matter clearly isn't fun or entertaining...nor should it be.When the film begins, four teens from a boarding school are caught sneaking off campus. Considering they've all been in trouble before, the group is expelled. The story then focuses specifically on one of the boys, Rohan. His situation is pitiful, as he's been at this school 8 years and he's never been home. Clearly he's a lost soul.Rohan soon arrives back home and your worst fears are confirmed--his father is garbage. Not only is he neglectful, which was obvious, but he's also a nasty, violent brute. He has no love in him whatsoever and he bullies Rohan and his little brother. Speaking of little brother, this 6 year-old has never even met Rohan! Throughout the course of the film, the father bullies, threatens and uses violence and Rohan's response is covert insolence--pretending to work hard at school but instead running around and wasting his life. What's to happen to this miserable young man and his tiny brother?In many ways this movie reminds me both of Truffaut's \"The 400 Blows\" (about an abused and neglected teen who ends up in reform school) and Majid Majidi's \"The Color of Paradise\"--a brilliant Iranian film about a father who is ashamed to have a blind son and abandons him to a boarding school. None of these films are fun but they are brave and compelling. In the case of \"Udaan\", like these other films, it's also very well made--and NOT at all like a stereotypical Bollywood production.",

            "content": "For some reason I have been postponing watching 'Udaan' until finally I watched it last night. I figured, why shouldn't it be the first film I watch this year? I had only heard many good things about it but even then it surpassed my expectations. 'Udaan' is one of those rare Indian films that scores high on every component of filmmaking, be it, direction, writing, cinematography, casting, score... It looks authentic and it feels honest.What particularly stands out about 'Udaan' is how true to life it is and at the same time it's not a documentary style film but one with a great big heart that tells an inspiring story of a teenager fighting for his dream to become the man he aspires to. Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap have done an outstanding job in the writing department. It's very detailed without being showy, poetic without being operatic, subtle without being too restrained and poignant without being preachy.In addition, Motwane does a phenomenal job translating the words from paper to screen. The narrative style is superb and remains consistent throughout. The characters are very human and easily recognizable mostly because of how the relationships are depicted, with sincerity.Shetty's cinematography works in a subtle way. Every frame is photogenic but not to the point of looking like a postcard or being distracting. Trivedi's score is used very efficiently, never intrusive but rather contributing by echoing the mood of the sequences. Kalra's editing is solid as never does the pace feel uneven nor does the film lose its focus at any point.Now coming to the performances, each and every actor's portrayal is genuine. Starting with newcomer Rajat Barmecha who is spot on as he looks the part and acts sublime. Ronit Roy finally gets a role that showcases his previously unknown talent. This is definitely a breakthrough performance for the actor who's been in movies for almost two years. While his portrayal of the authoritarian father is haunting one can also sympathize for him as he himself is a victim of abuse and he really does believe that he's doing the best for his sons and yet shows signs of regret at some of the wrong decisions. Ram Kapoor is equally convincing as the supportive light-hearted uncle who is the polar opposite of the quick tempered father. And of course, last but not least, there is young Aayan Boradia who delivers one of the most accurate performances of a child. It's amazing how, mostly through non-verbal gestures, he displays Arjun's innocence, loneliness, quiet suffering and longing with such precision While most of the first act and second act of the film depicts Rohan and Arjun's quiet suffering, the final act is excellently cathartic. I don't mean cathartic in the sense that events take an explosive turn that involves loud confrontations. Here it's rather matter-of-factly but at the same time energetic, invigorating and symbolic. Even though I was expecting what Rohan would eventually do for himself to escape his father's imprisonment, there are some precious little surprises that happen along the way, making 'Udaan' a one-of-a-kind gem.'Udaan' is a celebration of the human spirit. I'm very glad I picked this movie to start the year.",

            "content": "The literal translation of the word 'Udaan' is 'flight', and that becomes the story of seventeen year old Rohan Singh (Rajat Barmecha), who desperately seeks the means to flee a dreadful family situation made bitter by an abusive father. It's the age old story of a man who wants the son to follow in his own footsteps, deciding his career path in advance, and tormented by the teenager's insistence on following his own path. Though the idea is not new, the story provides additional resonance when Rohan learns that his father's abuse has become physical with a younger sibling that Rohan never knew he had as a result of Bhairav Singh's (Ronit Roy) second marriage after the boy was enrolled in boarding school. This is where some of the story's credibility suffers somewhat however. One has to wonder how hospital staff would have missed the bruise marks left by a belt that the father used to punish the young boy. Throughout the story, the father earns a reputation as one of the most vile villains in Hindi cinema, as he harbors not a shred of remorse toward his boys. A late apology for berating them is quickly followed by a promise to send eight year old Ariun (Aayan Boradia) off to boarding school, and a demand that Rohan spend an additional three hours daily at work in an iron forge. So much for compassion. Rohan understandably realizes that he must take the step-brother under his wing and leave the toxic family situation, certain that either he or his brother might one day follow in the father's footsteps as angry, frustrated individuals.This is one of the better Hindi films I've managed to view, all of which have been recommended via IMDb's 'Top 250' lists over the past few years. Not all have been worthy of inclusion, so catching a good one now and then has been a rare treat. The one head-scratcher in this film however was presented by the eighty year old patient in the hospital who enjoyed Rohan's story about Chandu and his bicycle. The man responded to one of Rohan's observations by stating \"Day destroys the night, night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide. Break on through to the other side.\" It sounded like a cryptic reply intended to appreciate Rohan's ambition as a future writer, but all it did was make me wonder - what are the odds an eighty year old Hindi man would be quoting a line from a 1967 song by Jim Morrison and The Doors?",

Movie deals with a ordinary issue with very sincere treatment.The movie should get accolades almost in every part,right from technicalities to performances. Direction (from Vikramaditya ,who finally got a production house after five years of a long wait)is very strong and clear,thus made his movie to be screened at Festival De Cannes.The movie contains very strong performances from the lead actors.Rajat Barmecha as a young boy did a superb act,and so does Ronit Roy(as his father) and Ram Kapoor(as his uncle). Music from Amit Trivedi complements the happenings and has a fresh feel. I will recommend this movie for serious audience who are greedy of something real and brilliant as this.",

Rohan's journey after being expelled from boarding school in the city of Jamshedpur working under his tyrant father and the way his character evolves simply touches your heart. Little bit of one liners shared between Rohan and his friends stay with you. Rohan's younger step brother is absolutely fabulous and even if he spoke barely few dialogues in the movie, he made an impact by his sly little demeanors. Character of ultra strict father played by Ronit Roy is so well crafted and acted that it is very much believable. To top it all, amazing music from Amit Trivedi gels so well into the movie that it lifts the spirits up by tons. At the end, kudos to the whole team for delivering such a lovely work.",

            "content": "After being expelled from boarding school for sneaking out to watch an x-rated movie, Rohan comes back home and sees his father after eight years and becomes overwhelmed by his new life. He is forced to deal with the fact that he has a half-brother, to suppress his artistic desires and dreams of being a writer, to work as an engineer at his dad's factory, and to live a regimented life at the order of his authoritative father. It is uplifting to see, though, how amidst such a dull and draining life, he is able to just barely keep his spirit alive, whether it be through writing poems by the river, chatting with his uncle, or telling stories to a sick, elderly man at the hospital. He also begins to sympathize for his half-brother, especially after seeing that their dad abuses him. This new relationship makes Rohan's life ever more complicated as running away would be the easy solution; now the future of a young child will be determined by Rohan's actions. Fantastic direction and great performances by the supporting cast, especially the little half-brother.One of the final scenes where Rohan outruns his father is beautifully captured. This image leaves a long-lasting impression on the viewer, and in my opinion, this still image of Rohan sprinting is very symbolic of the new Indian culture. India's youth is forging ahead, making a name for itself, breaking the shackles of convention, and redefining the future. Many years from now, this striking image will be remembered as an iconic allegory of the youth of India's new attitude and determination to succeed and live life as they envision it.",

            "review_title": "Take this flight of freedom....",
            "content": "In our pressure cooker society, an adolescent's aspirations are woven from the expectations of their parents. In earnest efforts to fulfill those expectations, the youth have often strangled their dreams and yet, hidden in those glimmering eyes is the hope to become a writer, the excitement of living life to its fullest everyday, the recklessness of a brat, the spirit of adventure, the fear of his father's wrath over his carefree attitude, the discomfort of living the alternate life and the determination to break free. Such is the glimmer seen in the eyes of Rohan (Rajat Barmecha) in debutant director Vikramaditya Motwane's 'Udaan' which is co-written and produced by Anurag Kashyap; from whom, only excellence is accepted.Udaan is indeed a flight of dreams for cinema. Motwane depicts a simple but relevant story with the most exhaustive and impeccable narrative. Seldom has reality been so refreshingly poignant as it has with Rohan's journey of chasing his dreams. Having spent 8 years in boarding school, away from his stern father, Rohan hones his writing skills after occasional escapades with his foolhardy friends with whom he shares a bond of freedom, fear, hope, joy and dreams. After they cross the limits of discipline in the school's standards, their expulsion sends each of them back to their families and Rohan, to Jamshedpur, where his hot tempered father (Ronit Roy) leaves him no choice but to work with him in his foundry and study in the city's engineering college. Rohan also discovers his step brother he did not know about and while he remains aloof from that innocent child, we can feel the growing tension between a rigid father and his audacious son. Bhairav's brother Jimmy (Ram Kapoor) also plays an important part in being an understanding guide to Rohan's ambitions but even he cannot confront the rudeness and apathy of his elder brother for too long. Rohan's mornings involve long runs with his father around the city, hours of hard labor in the foundry, followed by hours of incurious attendance in college, followed by circuitous paths back home where he writes his stories and poetry on railway tracks and river banks and finally, back to the tense environment of home. It is quite shocking to see him sneak out with his father's car and drive around the city to revel in its night life with a new bunch of foolhardy goons. At some point you almost cover your face because you are more afraid of the result of his actions than he is! The younger son, Arjun (Aayan Boradia) is hospitalized after receiving a discreet beating by his father and while the tyrant leaves for a few days, a heart-warming bond develops between the brothers through the writer's stories. The tension between Bhairav Singh and Rohan is beautifully balanced with Arjun's placid innocence and his relationship with Rohan. Concurrently, Rohan is tempted to join his hostel friends in Bombay where they now run a restaurant. He only becomes more desperate as his father attempts to renew his personal life in an attempt to seek solace.In the end, Rohan's flight of dreams turns into a Flight to freedom as he breaks the shackles for his Udaan. The moment is inspiring, uplifting and relieving after a final race between an apathetic enforcer and a dreamer. Unlike 'Iqbal' and 'Taare Zameen Par', Udaan has the capability to engage you in a personal manner as one can relate to the mature protagonist either with one's own history in adolescent years or having a friend/brother who was in similar circumstances. We have all lived some of the moments that Rohan experiences. Those late night escapades, watching C grade movies in small towns, drinking to life with friends, just picking on a fight because you feel like it, being rebellious against the dictating conventions and introspecting into one's conscience to find life's meaning. Rajat Barmecha is a revelation with a mature and sincere performance in a challenging role as the adolescent. Ronit Roy as Bhairav Singh delivers a shocking performance. He is so well versed with the character that it makes it one of the most natural performances we have seen. Indeed, it is sad to see him overact in his alternate avatar on TV. Ram Kapoor brings liveliness with deep understanding of the emotions of his character. Little Aayan Boradia is remarkable for his age and debut while we wish to see more of Manjot Singh in a comic role as he was just hilarious in every scene!Amit Trivedi's soulful musical journey is only optimized with Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics which will narrate the movie's essence. While being meaningful in lyrics, the music is very contemporary in its beats and rhythms. The inspiring words in Ek Udaan, the uplifting tone and feel of Aazaadiyan, the hopeful and soul stirring Kahaani, the literally refreshing Geet (Kuch naya toh zaroor) and the insulting Motu Master are truly unique compositions that will remain with you as long as the movie will. Mahendra Shetty's exemplary photography depicts Jamshedpur in all its green splendour. The indoor camera angles too suit the mood of the scene and put even more life into the characters. Abstaining from the conventional medium of telling stories, Motwane chose to be real yet artistic in his direction of Udaan. Such film-making speaks aloud of how far Indian films have come. With the most appropriate utilization of music in situations, the writers also add depth with Rohan's poetry. The visuals support such adept collaboration of script and performances while neglecting all the clich\u00e9d dramatization. Udaan resonates the deeper cords to leave a lasting impression. Its rich narrative, powerful performances, sincere making and inspiring music are to be cherished for they do not come so often in such a vivid form. Take this flight....-9.337 on a scale of 1-10.",

The story is very novel and I must comment Vikramaditya Sir that he had taken lots of courage to swim against the tide and attempt such a film and that too as his debut ! This movie just made me clap my hands in joy in the end of the movie. I believe it truly deserves a standing ovation.Now coming to the acting. I was very much impressed by Ronit Roy as he was given the most difficult role to play and he accomplished it with \u00e9lan'.

            "content": "I saw this film at Noordelijk Filmfestival 2011 (in Leeuwarden, province of Friesland NL). A very strict father who want to be called \"sir\" by his sons, is not very happy when his son (Rohan) is expelled from school. Being a steel factory owner, the next logical step for the father is to make plans for his son to work there, starting from a lowly position, if only to learn some discipline and to prove himself from there.The father dismays Rohan's writing ambitions. Yet each and every free hour is spent in making new poems, at the cost of his engineering study he has to follow next to working in the factory. Many people praise his texts (uncle, hospital staff, etc), unlike the father who regards it as something only appealing to females, seeing no future in it. We observe a series of clashes that are bound to happen. Neither the father nor the son are free from faults, however. You should not expect a black and white story line, with an ending rewarding the good and punishing the bad.Nevertheless, after one and a half hour I feared for a short moment that we got into a feel-good movie. A morning after the umpteenth incident the father tells he has been thinking all night long, he apologizes for everything he did wrong, and also announces new behavior towards his sons. Luckily, the story did not end here and then. The good part is still to come. Also, I don't particularly like feel-good movies.Rohan hears from several sides (uncle, bar friends, etc) that he should stop blaming his father, but rather take action and stand up. We cannot expect any good to come out of this, as this type of father won't take whatever mutiny lying down. But that would be too simple, and we get an unexpected ending instead. No one is killed or wounded in the process (with a wrecked car as only exception). I'm not sure it is legally acceptable what Rohan did, and what future he has acting this way, but that is not for us to worry.All in all, what we saw on the screen is quality all over with regard to script, casting and acting. Since 134 minutes is a bit long for a film with hardly any characters we feel sympathetic to, the overall impression would certainly improve by trimming some of the scenes. The logic in some sequences of events seems flawed too. Still there were enough reasons to score a 4 (out of 5) for the audience award when leaving the theater.",

He is sent back to his father who he has not seen in years. His father is a harsh man who vows to whip his son into shape, not matter what it takes. And there will be no talk of becoming a writer or any of that other hippie swill.It's a story about changing cultural landscape. No longer are boys blindly following their fathers into their professions. Young people are increasingly global, capable of dreaming outside the limited boundaries of their small towns, their immediate family. Naturally this creates a lot of friction and this movie is a case study of one of those instances where the friction turns nasty.That being said, the one major problem I had with this film was that none of the main characters were at all likable. They all had major flaws in their characters, which made them hardly relatable. You're supposed to hate the father, that much is clear, but in his case, the abusiveness is so over the top and cruel that it becomes cartoonish.The big problem is the main character. He's a lazy jerk who believes himself entitled to something more. Sure, it's the plot that he wants to become something more than just another factory worker, but the way he goes about achieving that goal - or rather, the way he doesn't - feels alienating. It's realistic that people get stuck in a groove, but it doesn't make for a sympathetic character.Even the boy's uncle, easily the most jovial of the characters in the movie, suffers from crippling passivity.Udaan talks about an important subject matter.

If I steal my father's car to go to the bar and get drunk or get expelled from school, do I expect my father to give me a hug when I get back??\nThe kid is disrespectful, a troublemaker. He shouldn't expect anything than what is happening to him.About Arjun, the little kid, well yeah. To get beaten like that is unacceptable. But now, he isn't the main character.On the other hand, I don't get how is it hard to become a writer and run a factory, a family business. The boy is pretty darn good that he doesn't need to go to school to become a writer, he already is.

I had heard about the movie , a boy returns from hostel to home ,tries to adjust to life , to an authoritarian father , to an unknown brother. I suspected it to be another lakshya, 3 idiots or wakeup Sid with good things thrown in, some speech by our hero and a happy ending. Well ending is not sad but it is uncertain and frightening. \u0095 His long stay in hostel and how his friends wish for a life outside hostel reminded me of many of my friends who were in hostels since their school time. Most of them were there because they were from villages and for lack of good educational facilities they were living in big towns and hostels. But I have seen quite a few boys who were essentially shunned by their parents and what harm it does to their psyche. \u0095 Character of father is a case study character. Believe it or not we were told with pride by people around us how their father used to beat them for slightest of pretext, how one of my seniors used to hide all his cricket bats before his dad came in home else he would be beaten by them, how parents of many of my aunts and uncles had no idea in which class their wards were and so on and on. As a society we condone this behavior and cruelty towards kids. \u0095 Film captures local environ of Jamshedpur beautifully, I never knew city was so beautiful. Bihari tone of characters is very authentic, not clownish like other movies but not snobbish either. \u0095 Though his college seniors who are supposed to rag him and drinking scene with those guys seem to be forced \u0095 It is also interesting that no neighbor or relative other than his uncle is shown \u0095 Acting by all three leading men are superb. Ronit Roy who is shattered from inside and has converted himself into a demon unknowingly. \u0095 Initial poem is very good which he recites to his friend in school, and so is background track in the movie. \u0095 It somehow reminded me of movies like being Cyrus or ek choti si love story. Style of movie telling is erringly similar , stories are told from point of view of protagonist, lonely childhood is captured effectively.",

Sanjay Leela Bhansali made a brilliant attempt at such a movie with \"Black\". Udaan falls into the very same narrative structure, yet it comes out much, much more triumphant. That happens because Vikramaditya Motwane of Udaan (for once the word auteur is justified)chooses consiously to avoid fire and bombast in what is ultimately a very commonplace, a very personal storyline. Each one of us has felt teenage angst, and has known the feeling that we are not understood by the people who should know us the best. For the most part we have kept silent and let our lives be led as our parents wanted. For the most part the film embodies this silence, with gentle, moody music underscoring much of the events, superbly worked by Amit Trivedi.Rajat Barmecha deserves a National Award for his brilliantly understated performance which drives the movie and does not feel forced for even a single second. And one wonders what Ronit Roy was doing all this time in stupid saas-bahu serials. Again, a pitch-perfect outing as a tyrant and a defeated man, whom you feel sorry for as much as you hate him. I watched this movie with my friends and it did put us all into a pensive mood for a bit. It did make us think about our life and the choices we had made till then, and whether they had been correct or not. The movie only grows on you after repeated viewings.

            "content": "\u00a8Freedom can never be asked for. Seize it and live forever free.\u00a8 Udaan is an Indian film directed by Vikramaditya Motwane which was nominated for the 2010 Cannes Film Festival for the Un Certain Regard Award. Even though it didn't win, I have to admit that the film was pretty strong and had a lot of soul put into it by first time feature film director Motwane. The story isn't original, we've seen the premise before, but the way it is presented and the performances from the unknown actors are what makes the film feel real and authentic. My only complaint might be that the film is a little too long and drags at times, but it still is a very entertaining watch with several emotional moments throughout the movie. I loved the performances in this film especially the one of the seventeen year old son played by Rajat Barmecha and his estranged and abusive father, Ronit Roy. Aayan Boradia, the six year old brother, was also a charm and despite not having much dialogue he steals your heart in every scene. This is a strong and emotional film about family and finding the courage to follow your dreams. Some scenes may seem like taken out of a Disney movie where you have the abusive father who wants to force his kid to work in the family business and neglect his personal dream or goal of becoming an artist (in this case a writer). The characters in this film have a lot of depth, but at the same time they are one dimensional sometimes. The father is abusive, mean, and disciplines his children like if they were in the military by making them call him \u00a8sir.\u00a8 He shows no love for neither of his sons. Despite the story being familiar and clich\u00e9, I still found it very touching and powerful thanks to some great performances and a good soundtrack. Udaan was a very interesting film and I absolutely recommend it.The film begins with four friends escaping one night from a boarding school to go watch an adult movie at the cinema. Once they are at the movies they have the bad fortune of running into the school guardian who informs the principle about their misconduct. Rohan Singh (Rajat Barmecha) and his friends are expelled from school. Rohan is forced to return to his hometown in an industrial part of India where his estranged father lives. Rohan hadn't seen his father since his mother died and he was sent to the school over eight years ago. His father, Bhairav (Ronit Roy) never visited him during that period and only wrote to him one letter a year. Bhairav is very displeased with Rohan's behavior and forces him to work at the steel industry that he manages and study engineering. Rohan wants to go to art school and become a writer, but his father is determined he study engineering and abandon his silly dreams. Rohan also discovers for the first time that he has a six year old brother named Arjun (Aayan Boradia) who obeys every word coming from his father. The only person who seems to treat Rohan well is his uncle, Jimmy (Ram Kapoor), who unsuccessfully tries to convince Bhairav to let his son become a writer. Rohan feels imprisoned at home and can't find the way to pursue his own dreams. He finds refugee some nights by escaping from his home and hanging out with his friends, but he also begins to worry about his little brother and the way his father treats them.If I would've just read the premise of the story I would've probably thought the movie was going to be clich\u00e9 and predictable, which in a way it is, but it's still worth the watch because of the emotional drama that is poured into the film. It has a lot of heart and some terrific performances from Ronit Roy as the mean spirited and strict father and Rajat Barmecha as the son who feels abandoned by his father and locked in a cage without being able to pursue his own dreams. You can't help but feel sorry for him knowing that he has a special talent but can't do anything about it due to his father's stubbornness. There is no good in Roy's character, it's as if he has no love in him and wants to force everyone to be like him. He is a tyrant and is good at it. The film is entertaining and worth the watch thanks to these performances and the emotional moments that transcend the big screen. Udaan is a great social drama that many will enjoy.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

In terms of acting, cinematography, and plot, 1990s Hindi films appear to be similar to 1950s American films, 40 years behind. In a similar way, Udaan appeared to be similar to a 1980s American film, 30 years behind. So in 20 years, they have only closed the gap by 10 years, which honestly seems very hard to believe when seeing that nearly every other nation is maintaining or exceeding American quality when comparing films of similar budgets. I will continue to be unimpressed with Hindi cinema until it begins learning from foreign films, which by the current rate of progress, it seems that may not be until the 2070s.Udaan is a coming of age film reminiscent of USA 1980s films in the same genre. I imagine Americans who enjoy those films will find aspects of Udaan that they can enjoy, though Udaan will obviously lack any nostalgic elements, and Udaan will also feel like it employs many of the genre's tropes without ever providing anything new. I imagine that Indian viewers may feel the same connection to Udaan that Americans feel for their coming of age films, but I doubt that non-Hindi viewers will think that Udaan is anything more than mediocre.",

They have an undefined genre plus most of them contain stupid song sequences which have nothing to do with reality nor the movie.

Now the fact is, Bollywood directors/Producers(95%) want their movies earning them fame and profit and after 1 year we and even they forget about their own stuff.When it comes to movies with tiny/low budgets, they are also disgusting but there are few movies (I am talking about low budget movies here) which are good and even excellent but only a small portion of audience get to see them and the hard work of cast/crew is therefore not praised by most.Udaan is another example of movie that I am talking about. I believe most of Indians must have seen \"Ghajni\" which was a stupid remake of a fantastic Hollywood movie \"Memento\". They couldn't even adapt the script of the Hollywood movie in their Bollywood blockbuster and even audience and critics said it was good. (but it was nothing good indeed except one nice romantic song) This movie tells us a story of a 16 years old boy who returns home after getting expelled from college and his interaction with his abusive father. The movie has some flaws but they are not very big. Ending is hopeful but I found it contradicting from reality because life never gets very easy at any stage/ The best part of the movie is direction and Father's nice performance.Its a very fine movie that contains material which you never get to see in most of Bollywood's Blockbusters.I'll give it a 6/10. still you don't get much out of the movie in the end.",

Caught in the crossfire is the young brother who accepts what comes and isn't in a position to see what's wrong. Alongside the main cast, Ram Kapoor plays the uncle Jimmy Singh who acts as a counterpoint to the father, a kind figure who supports the children as much as possible but nonetheless has limited ability to improve their lives.

Let me be very clear that I don't judge films by moral values or message, a reason people may quote for disliking Udaan. My reasons are purely cinematic.While the film is wonderfully scripted, edited and cinematographed; the show stealer of the film remains its awe-inspiring music. Amit Trivedi is undoubtedly the next Rahman Indian cinema has to offer. With the soundtrack of DevD, Udaan and the more recent 'No one killed Jessica', Amit has proved his mettle time and again! On a personal note, since I am from Jharkhand and completely in love with my place, I loved the familiar scenes from Jamshedpur. It was a treat to watch! However, I have several reasons for not liking the film. Firstly, unlike Kashyap's style, there were many scenes which were begging to me to sympathize with the protagonist. I am still assuming that Kashyap's script was good and director Motwane couldn't do justice with it. I wouldn't have been disappointed if Karan Johar or Yash Chopra would have tried a tear jerker, but Kashyap and his associates should belong to a league of their own.Secondly, I found that this film has three aspect to ponder. The protagonist's relationship with his younger brother, his relationship with friends, and his terms with his father. While the first two aspects were realistic, the character of his father (played by Ronit Roy) lacked realism. Or shall I call it 'exceptional realism'? The father was outright evil. Fathers like him don't occur in places like Jharkhand. If the film was set in New York, I wouldn't have complained. Moreover, the film lacked progression, character highlighting and surrealism, something that Kashyap's earlier films were known for.",

This is what the film is about, a young boy has a dream he will go for it against the huge barrier placed. Now, this hindrance or stoppage is non other than his own father who becomes an obstacle for his only dream.A very relevant movie for the times when people are lost in the race to accumulate more comforts through money, one wants a car another wants a villa so on and so forth and to achieve they take a route that fate had given them and not what they chose to do. This film clearly that it's easy to fall prey to fate but it's difficult to go for it. The toughest decision for any human is what would he like to do and end up in life as what. Now this film handles this very most important question in a very simple and a very relatable way.Surely, there would be many Rohan's who succumb to the wishes of their parents and become what their parents to be. But I could relate to Rohan as I could see myself in him even I wanted to do arts but was put in engineering which I never understood. I want to become writer like Rohan too but yet that's my passion not profession (and the day is not so far when passion becomes profession, hopefully).The simple story is elevated to very great level by performances of actors. Specifically of the antagonist played by Ronit Roy as Bhairav Singh that is Rohan's father. All others have done their roles really well by bringing out real portraits of stereotypes. Narrative pace some may say that it is slow but thats what is the essence of the movie too. It surely does not want to fall in the rat race and is very very uncompromising in it's production. Thanks to director Vikramditya Motwane to stick to his faith and to Anurag Kashyap to produce such an essential film.Loved this movie and it's for a repeat watch on my list.

            "content": "This has been a long pending post. But, thanks to the DVD in my possession now, I revisit it 2 months later and the feelings it invokes are as fresh and heart-felt.Udaan is simple. So it is but natural to understand the \" what's the big deal?\" comments. It released along with the visually acrobatic Inception, so it was bound to be underwritten, even though the two are worlds apart.For me, the very fact that a simple story plays on screen, minus frills, yet with so much flavor is a good movie. The flavor of Udaan is a mix of curbed ambitions and feelings inside Rohan, that find the courage and flight in the end.The stark, shady start to the quaint steel town of Jamshedpur, everything is life-like. The terrorizing father too, who sometimes may seem exaggerated seems believably loathsome. The kid brother brings lighter moments to the film and is as wonderful as the rest of the cast.What stays with me from this movie, is a parallel of the 'Mohan drinks water from urchin in Swades' and ' Ashok tells Gogol about how he reminds him of every moment in his life after the accident in Namesake.' It is the final flight moment when Rohan walks out with his elder brother to live a better life and simultaneously his voice-over plays as his father reads his letter- that please don't even try to understand, as it is about something you will never understand- Love. Such a poignant and powerful moment in any film that summarizes the spirit of that movie is plain moving and becomes a memory of that film.Not to mention the opening and closing tracks and the beautiful poetry which only enhance the spirit of the film. This remains a benchmark for this year, and I am sure would remain unsurpassed. For, a well-rounded sincere film in it's own capacity is rare to be found.",

When it was released i tried seeing it in movie theatre but could not get a ticket , as the movie was in only a few theatres and that too only for 1 week , which i can now say after seeing the movie was totally ridiculous ,as its a great movie. First let me tell you that this movie is not for the weak hearted , it has some intense , gut wrenching emotions and pervertedness we commonly associate with anurag kashyap. it scores 10/10 in this department. It is basically a story about a boy with a strong desire to become a writer in life , and his authoritarian , arrogant , maniac father , played superbly by RONIT ROY who lives in his own world and wants everybody to live by his ways. It is a story of how strong desires can overcome the fear of failure and obstacles and show you the light to achieve something in life . The cherry on top was amit trivedi mind boggling background score and music. The lyrics and poetry used in the film were awesome and completely swept me off my feet. The only drawback was that at times it became too slow and started becoming boring and monotonous. for that i gave it 9/10. But overall its a must watch Hindi movie of 2010. Not to be missed by any movie enthusiast.HATS OFF TO ANURAG KASHYAP!!!!!!!",

Udaan is a celebration of innocence amidst adolescence coupled with a youthful and rebellious spirit. It is a very crafty and intensely personal script that you will surely identify with.Udaan is a coming-of-age tale of Rohan Singh, brilliantly portrayed by Rajat Barmecha, a 17-year-old motherless teenager who is expelled from boarding school and has to live with his tyrant of a father Bhairav Singh, played by Ronit Roy. He learns of his 6-year-old step-brother only after his new life with his authoritarian, oppressive and abusive father is thrust upon him in the industrial town of Jamshedpur. Forced by his father to work in a steel plant and then study engineering and often subject to capital punishment, Rohan's only silver lining is his jovial and cheerful uncle Jimmy, aptly played by the rotund Ram Kapoor.Udaan resonates with absolutely anyone who has had to break away from convention and suffer oppression in order to pursue one's dreams. It is a film about hope and every teenager will connect with Rohan when he rebels in his own ways by sneaking out after hours in his father's car and drinking with new found mates, by bunking college and blissfully penning poems along railway tracks and disobeying his father time and again.Udaan takes flight and reaches an unimaginable height which is purely attributable to its honest and well-paced plot. With a story devoid of pretentious and unnecessary attractions, director Vikramaditya Motwane and producer Anurag Kashyap have recreated their Dev D magic all over again. In the climax when Rohan outruns his father after punching, you cannot help but give him a standing ovation.The cast delivers a stellar performance. Rajat Barmecha is a discovery made by the Dev D duo and Ronit Roy with his superb portrayal of the frustrated father makes you wonder why he has been dormant all this while and making appearances only in soaps. On the lighter side is child actor Aayan Boradia who speaks volumes with his facial expressions. Oye Lucky Lucky Oye's Manjot Singh is commendable in his cameo as Rohan's school friend and partner-in-crime.Amit Trivedi composes for Udaan after winning awards for Dev D and the track Aazadiyan is sure to move you while the other scores set the tone for the plot without distracting you. Vikramaditya Motwane has struck gold and each chord in our hearts with his directorial debut and this film is sure to linger in your minds for long. Arguably the best movie in 2010 amidst various disappointments, no wonder this was screened at Cannes this year.I suggest go watch Udaan and celebrate Rohan's triumph as breaks free from his shackles. I give Udaan 4 stars out of 5.-Joydeep Roy for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com",

From here the story takes off and keeps you engaged as what Rohan will do and cheer for him to take his Udaan (flight). The story is flawless and the acting is brilliant. Rajat Barmecha makes an extraordinary debut and wins the audience with his innocence and silent strength. Ram Kapoor plays a great supporting role as a loving Uncle. But the real star in Udaan is Ronit Roy, who plays the father and shows his acting prowess that was not seen in his previous soap operas. This is a film that I recommend every film fan to watch and you would not regret watching this future classic. The performances, along with an excellent screenplay as well as brilliant performances from everyone, Udaan is a film that no one should miss.

            "content": "Udaan had been on my watch list for several years before I finally got around to checking it out, only to find out it was somewhat less than advertised.What you get is a routine coming of age drama. The son, who yearns to be a writer, struggles with a cold and authoritarian father who demands he study engineering in a conflict as ancient as the Old Testament. Just once, could we have parents who dream their child will become traveling juggler or penniless artist, only to have the son say, gee, thanks Mom and Dad, but what I really want to do is be a bond trader? Be different, anyway.The film is skillfully produced with good cinematography and solid acting. The script smartly avoids introducing a love interest, instead choosing to focus on the four central male characters, the father, his brother, the son and his half-brother. Despite that, character development is a bit wanting, particularly in the role of the father. Although Ronit Roy charges every scene with an unpredictable aura of boiling menace and violence, the script unfortunately confines him largely to a role as a one-dimensional villain, never really addressing how he and his brother became so different.The story runs a bit long at over two hours, subplots involving the son's friends could probably have been cut considerably and there are several longish montages that might have been pared back. Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie is its depiction of modern middle class India, a world largely unfamiliar to most Westerners.An interesting, well-constructed film with a really terrific performance by Roy, but unfortunately hamstrung by a somewhat cliched and well-worn plot that has nothing new to say.",

The script wasn't depending on emotional over-doze (TZP) or super-human deeds of its protagonist(3I) for impact....and for once there were no song-dance routines....bold new step for Indian cinema!",

If the antagonist in TZP (i.e, parent), Taare Zameen Par for those who don't know, was like the principal in Munnabhai MBBS, then here he is the equivalent of Bukka Reddy in Rakhtacharitra. Other than that, it is a typical story of teenage angst, but has to be seen for some of the best performances in Indian cinema. Also, to be noted, is the attempt by the writers to respect the Hindi language. The dialogue is witty as well as pointed where required. I also liked the score, and the way music is presented here is quite welcome, since a dance number would have been quite out of place. The music also matched the setting quite well, and remained with me for long even after the credits rolled. Movies like this should be seen, if only to encourage a professional attitude towards film making by bollywood people, who for far too long have been making easy money by just copying better made foreign movies frame to frame. But then again, it's been so long since I watched a well made Hindi film, so probably that revolution has already started.",

            "content": "Rohan, a sixteen year old boy who is expelled from high school for his mischievous behavior, has come back to his home and facing harsh realities of life. Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag kashyap have written a beautiful screenplay which depicts the life of a young boy, who has never got affection from his father and motivates himself to manage all his dreams alone. The movie is about living your dreams no matter how difficult it is to achieve it. Rajat Barmecha as Rohan proves every inch of it in the movie. His unconditional passion for becoming a writer remains alive till the end of the movie. Whereas, Ronit Roy as Bhairav Singh plays a role of Rohan's father, who is annoyed, shrewd and does not understand his son's love for writing stories and poems. He always disrespects Rohan's work and throws tantrums on him for being expelled from the high school. Rohan does not have an interest in engineering but his father pressurizes him for joining him in his factory and to study engineering. It shows how parents misjudge the talents of their children and keep on criticizing them for not doing something major in life. But, they fail to understand that what their child has in him, every child does not have. Their egos always build a high wall between the dreams of their children. This is what happens with Rohan when he tells his father that he wants to be a writer and he denies without even giving him a chance. His father believes that writers have no life; they roam around for work and have zero knowledge about anything. The music by Amit Trivedi is commendable. All songs go very well with the story-line. It motivates you time to time when something wrong happens with Rohan in the movie. The lyrics of all songs are so beautifully written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. It tells that your dreams cannot be chained, it will always float and who listen to their inner voice will always be successful. The movie has shown both sides of Rohan, one where he remains clam and tolerates every harsh word that comes from his dad. While other where he uses to sneak out every night with his buddies to feel the fresh air and does whatever he feels like. His step brother Aayan Barodia as Arjun does a wonderful job in the movie. An unusual bond between the two is something you should not miss. The purity of Arjun's character is another element to watch this movie. Also, Ram kapoor as Rohan's uncle fits in perfect for this role. The way he pushes Rohan to live his dream makes you motivate at times. Not to forget, Rohan's beautiful poems that he recites in the movie, all of them are so inspiring. Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag kashyap have made a flawless effort by making Udaan and awaking several bodies who need such kind of motivation to achieve something big in their lives. You must watch this movie if you're a fan of actual Indian cinema apart from that fancy and high budget vague story-lines.",

Hats off to writer who wrote that . Music, singing , lyrics , timing everything is perfect of this song. Movie seems to be little bit long. Starting of this movie is also not good. absence of female lead in this movie is not noticeable . But some characters seem irrelevant with movie plot . Further sequel of this movie are possible.",

Like a :O, seriously. I remember when I first watched No Smoking or Dev.D, and it was like a new awakening. Each of his movies had that crispness to it, with vivid imagery, great cinematography, strong characters with very realistic portrayals.With Udaan, Kashyap has dumbed down what he calls 'his style of cinema'. While watching the movie, a lot of scenes made me feel that he was pleading to my emotional side, almost begging me to sympathize with the protagonist. This is something that Yash Johar is famous for doing in Bollywood, not Kashyap. Kashyap does not make movies that want to make you cry. He doesn't do coochie-coo and touchie-feelie.The good parts of the movie - Amit Trivedi. I cannot tell you how great a genius this man is. He did it in Dev.D and he recreated the magic in Udaan. What made me stick through the movie was probably the exceptional soundtrack, most of which was nice alternative rock, with a hint of some punk here and there. And guys who think that Motumaster ruined the soundtrack - Number 1, screw you, the lyrics of Motumaster are epic. Number 2 - good news for you, the track is not a part of the movie. Anyway, each track is perfectly positioned and suited to the character and the scene at hand.Rajat Barmecha does a fair job, though I wouldn't go ahead and title him with good (I'm pretty nazi about who I call good, more so about who I call awesome). Kay Kay Menon in Black Friday or Gulaal or Paanch was good, John Abraham in No Smoking or Abhay Deol in Dev.D were awesome. I am judging his actors by the standards that HE set for me. Its not my fault he did his job well before and is just failing now.Also, the story. I understand that it resonates Kashyap's personal life, and I also understand that Motwane was responsible for the overall dumbing down of the story. But where the hell was progression? Where were awesome character highlighting scenes? The whole movie was bouncing back and forth - from son to dad, back to son, then back to dad. Where was the surrealism? Where are spine chilling scenes that make me lose touch from reality? I hope you realize the blunder that you've done here. And don't worry, I still believe in you.

Overall, I expected something to happen in the climax, but the director closed the movie with the titles. So what happens to these kids? Did they get at least food? Unanswered questions arises.
