A 3.8 current rating? Seriously? And a 23 Metascore rating? And yet \"Funny Games\" (1997) about home invaders torturing members of a household gets a 7.6 rating and a 69 Metascore? And a Criterion release? And, no, I can't think of any circumstances under which I would want to be \"challenged\" by such material.I have had a rough week. I had three refrigerators delivered to my house before I finally got one that worked, after one that was only two years old died. And my garbage disposal is broken and leaking. This was just the film to cheer me up. Because of all the gross-out jokes I don't think I would want kids to see this, and that must have hurt box office because I think kids might have been part of the target audience, but it hit the spot for this adult.Citizen Kane it isn't, but if you just want to laugh and put your brain on hold I don't think another film could do a better job.",

If you watch the film right to the very end there is a very funny dance routine done by the cast. Good to see actors letting their hair way down and having a bit of fun. Brendan Fraser & Brooke Shields are clearly not egomaniacs.\nI got a few good laughs out of this and it would be a great movie to watch with the kids. I am going to be generous with my score as the 3.8 it has at the moment is very unfair. It is much better than that.\nAgain, be sure to watch the cast dance routine while the end credits roll.",

They laughed up a storm and gave it 10/10 when I asked them (my rating of 6 is an average of their score and mine!) As other reviewers have written, you have to give the cast credit for giving it their all, even if it was in pursuit of a rather questionable goal. We watched the gag reel and Making Of video on the DVD, and they clearly had a ball making this movie. I also give them credit for shoehorning in a great message about protecting forests - it's never bad for kids to hear that.If you're expecting a deep, meaningful movie experience, this ain't it, but if you and your kids want some cheap laughs, this is a safe bet.",

            "review_title": "The Animals Are Taking Over",
            "content": "I like Brendan Fraser. I really do. I think he does best when he's doing comedies like \"Bedazzled\" or family fare like \"Journey To The Center Of The Earth.\" \"Furry Vengeance\" is good comedy to spread its \"Get Green\" message, and it does it while being funny. Fraser plays a contractor living in the housing development he is building near the woods of a forest preserve, and the animals have learned his bosses want to devastate the forest for housing tracts. He mugs, grimaces and reacts to the wild antics going on as he surrenders his body to more slapstick again and again. One of the odd things about this movie is that the animals, ranging from a raccoon, some skunks, beavers and a bear among others, act and think like humans; just how and why is never resolved. The bulk of the movie is the amount of abuse and harassment Fraser gets from these furry woodland creatures and his resulting psychosis when he realizes the animals seem to have a conspiracy against him, but by then, they've infested his house and violated his car. Brooke Shields plays his wife oblivious to the action, and his son and girl friend are additional witnesses to his spiraling descent into hysteria. It's a really funny movie once you learn to ignore the ridiculous leaps in logic and science, but you really start to cheer the animals on as they fight together in wild and creative scenarios to defend their homes. There's a message in the movie that isn't forced; it's much more simple than coerced, and the closing montage of movie parodies is a lot of fun to watch as well.",

I almost skipped this movie because of these even, but I'm glad I gave it a shot and watched it anyhow.My wife and kids liked it too. There was a lot of cute and silly moments that brought every thing from chuckles to full on LOL's.IMHO comedy is a hard thing to pull off for movies (and stand-up comics alike). The timing has to be right, can't be too deliberate, generally can't be too silly nor too dull, has to fit the audience and culture, etc. I feel like they pulled it off well the majority of the movie.If I had only one complaint, I would say it's the title. At first glance it doesn't say, or give much of a hint to the genre. Relax, have some popcorn.. If you are considering this movie to watch with your family, give it a shot.",

It is what it is, a funny family movie with lots of forest critters causing trouble for Brendon Fraser.Of course Brendon has done better more artful movies, of course he's done more adult-themed action, but why all the hate for this movie? Sometimes I want a sophisticated cerebral comedy with witty satire and subtlety, just like sometimes I want a fancy meal. But there also times I just want to kick my shoes off, sink a beer, scoff a pizza, burp and watch a fun film. This is what you get with Furry Vengeance, and it delivers what it sets out to deliver.The performances are exaggerated sure, and yes, you can tell no-one has spent months refining the CGI. But what the hell, the movies makes you smile throughout, with a few laugh out loud moments thrown in too, and the extras on the DVD prove that everyone had a good time making the film.Chill out all you negative reviewers, appreciate this movie for what it is.",

However, Brendan is hysterical as the poor project developer against whom the animals have ganged up, invading home, car and his mind! Brooke Shields does a great job as the tolerant wife.

Well, yes, I did - only this time our protagonist is Brendan Fraser not Sam Worthington, and the forest dwellers are all sorts of animals, not big blue people with bows and arrows.This is Avatar for tinies, and no-one should lose sight of that. It is NOT a film for grownups. There is lots of slapstick as the CGI-assisted wildlife knocks 7 bells out of Fraser while no-one believes him that a raccoon is masterminding the fight back (I wonder why).Fraser overacts dreadfully (but entirely appropriately given the nature of the material), there are entertaining turns from Wallace Shawn, Ken Jeong, and Billy Bush. And Brooke Shields has become an extremely attractive older woman.The sequence which accompanies the closing credits is brilliant - I loved it.And it appears to have been produced by an Abu Dhabi company which raised my eyebrows a bit.",

I have put two and two together and decided that the low rating this movie has accrued has probably everything to do with a bunch 20 something nerdy tech heads who have yet to enjoy the pleasure of having children, I watched this film with 3 young children of various ages and they had a ball as I did, there was several laugh out loud moments and not just for young children but adults too, but if you're a twenty something adult you might find it so uncool inverted commas! so seriously you view life. When you have children of your own movies like this will become so much more enjoyable believe me!. I'd give this movie a 7 rating from an adult with children perspective but I rated it a nine because the children in my presence absolutely adored it and would probably have gave it ten if they could rate it themselves.

For those who like Airplane, Night at the Museum, original Pink Panther, you will like this. I heard so much bad in reviews, that I put off watching it. Turns out, I got a comedic cleansing from it.The casting was great, especially Brenden Fraser as Dan Sanders, and Ricky Garcia as Frank...PERFECT! One improvement I would make, and that would be to take some of the environmentalism out of it. It was a bit much. Couldn't the animals guard the forest without constant comments of green, etc. The other would be to tie the movie together a bit more at the end. Like have hikers and a tour guide. Loved the part before the credits!!!!! Brendan Fraser, you know how to make people laugh. More movies please! I will buying this movie.",

Once you accept this fact and look at it as just a lighthearted piece of family friendly fluff that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's kind of amusing. There's no obvious profanity nor is there any nudity and when characters get into some wildly unbelievable scrapes that, realistically, would cause a lot of bodily damage, pain, or worse, death, it's glossed over because, THIS IS A KID-FRIENDLY MOVIE. It's made that way (in the old Disney-style tradition) to entertain with lots of cartoonish antics (particularly by Brendan Fraser's goofy real estate developer). It's nice to see Brooke Shields acting in something again but the real stars of this silly but often funny film are the animals, especially the ring-leader raccoon and his platoon of able and willing skunks. Don't expect the depth of Shutter Island or the amazing special effects of Avatar here; this is just a cute little film for parents with kids who are not interested in seeing giant robots blow the snot out of a city yet...they're still young and naive enough to find the cutesy antics of comical animals amusing enough.

You see, I've enjoyed my share of cinematic disasters in the past (The Adventures of Pluto Nash, anyone?) and so I thought: how bad can it be? So yeah, the story of animals getting revenge on a real estate agent that's tearing down their forest won't exactly win any Oscars or be forever cherished as a modern classic. However, Furry Vengeance was - in its own dumb way - fluffy (and dare I say furry) fun. Sure, it was stupid and shallow - but I found myself smiling and even releasing an occasional laugh, so as a whole it wasn't as bad as some people made it up to be.To sum things up - if you walk into the film expecting nothing but Brendan Fraser's crazy hijinks, you'll get exactly what you paid for.I gave it 5 stars out of 10.",

            "content": "From the always reliable and brilliant Roger Kumbles (College Road Trip, The Sweetest Thing), comes \"Furry Vengeance\" which might just be his masterpiece. Hilarious and laugh out loud funny from the first frame to the very last, \"Furry Vengeance\" provides the brand of intelligent comedy that has been lacking for the past few decades. While the plot may seem simple on paper, it truly is an intricate story that unfolds with great pace and flow. Not once did I glance at my watch or take my eyes off of the screen. Simply put, this is very effective storytelling that blends in comedy very well with its engaging storyline. And as we all know, a comedy cannot be truly great without a funny lead. Brendan Fraser provides just that. He adds a whole new dimension to his character that I can't imagine any other actor pulling off. But that's not to say there are no standout performances from the supporting cast. Mega-star Matt Prokop proves once more why he has become such a bankable star. The other main component of the film is the visual effects, which is one of the best to date, if not THE best. You thought Avatar was great? Think again. Words cannot describe the achievement in visual effects this movie has managed to pull off. So I'll simply state: they're f**king amazing. To say the least, I'm very content with my decision to attend the exclusive premier of one of the best comedies of all time. I recommend you check it out once it arrives at a theater near you.",

            "content": "Furry Vengeance (1:30, PG) \u2014 Other: Talking Animals, 3rd string, originalBrendan Fraser 1st endeared himself to SF fans as the thawed-out missing link in 1992's Encino Man. Since then, he's turned in a lot solid performances in genre films, notably as gentleman adventurer Rick O'Connell in the Mummy series. So, while he does doofus really well, he can also sell himself as a big, beefy guy with a soft heart or as a serious actor in a serious role. The one thing he's never attempted is villainy; like Will Smith, he's always aimed for (and largely hit) likability. Last year he reached new heights in Inkheart, which I thot was magnificent. (I'm a sucker for books.) This week the law of averages reasserts itself as he plummets straight to the bottom in the role of suburban developer Dan Sanders, beset by the woodland creatures he's preparing to displace, in Furry Vengeance.Just to put things in perspective about the relentless, unremitting awfulness of this movie, I gave Beverly Hills Chihuahua a higher rating (2). Speaking of relentlessness, Edward Shearmur's score is both ubiquitous and manically perky. An appearance by the world's least helpful librarian is only about 54th on this film's list of sins.Screenwriters Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert have provided an abundance of plot and dialog, so you get a lot of substance in the 90 minutes you spend squirming and covering your eyes. I think they took pride in breaking new ground in the icky-fluids department. In addition to the abundance of poop, pee, fart, barf, and crotch jokes, they've upped the ante with skunks. And, just to be sure you didn't miss this brilliant innovation on their part, they repeat it 3 or 4 times.Searching desperately for something positive to say about Furry Vengeance, I must commend director Roger Kumble for getting the entire cast to buy into the premise of how it should be overacted, as every single one of them gives it everything they've got, from beginning to end, without pause or apology. I can imagine Kumble's pep speech at the kick-off meeting: \"All right, we're making this film for an autistic audience that doesn't read human expressions very well. Also, we think it'll probably play well with space aliens who know nothing whatsoever about carbon-based life forms. So don't hold back, OK? Exaggerate everything. Everything! Actions, expressions, vocal intonations, emotions, the works! Just to help you out, we've prepared this little drug cocktail we'd like you to take daily, consisting of LSD, PCP, speed, and whatever it is that gets your eyes to bug out like that guy in the Staples commercial.\"I categorize this movie under \"talking animals\", even tho they don't engage in actual human speech. Instead we get a variety of churrs, coos, and gurgles, apparently from the throat of one Dee Bradley Baker. But the various different kinds of critters can all understand each other, and they pass along stories via cartoon thot balloons running flashbacks (or, in one scene, Mel Gibson in Braveheart). And they've developed tool use, which we see in the opening scenes, as a Rube Goldberg contraption turns a huge boulder loose on the SUV of an arrogant developer who has just thrown his cigar stub into a pile of dry leaves.Philosophers who have long sought the elusive white crow (as an example of trying to prove a negative) will be delighted to know that the producers of this nature epic did not blanch at depicting one, apparently figuring nobody in the audience would notice ... or maybe care.This film reminds me of nothing so much as the conservative political pundit William Kristol. He's bright, well informed, charming, articulate, thotful, and well intentioned. And you know that every single time he's opened his mouth for the last quarter century, whatever comes out of it has been dead wrong. Reliably. Consistently. Every time. Without let or regret. And he just keeps on doing it!I cannot imagine what anybody ever said to the participants in, or financiers of, this train wreck that made them think it would be a good idea. Redeeming thot?

I'd say this movie would be ideal for anyone between the ages of 5 and 9. I'd not buy it on DVD except from the bargain bucket, or watch for free on regular TV. I regret having spent good money to see it at the cinema.We saw this at the cinema as a family; we are middle-aged parents with a son, 6, and a daughter, 4.We adults thought it was slow to get started but managed to pick up a little bit of pace. It was quite predictable with the same jokes repeated, and there were no plot twists at all to give it any interest. The bored teenager role was acted with little imagination, the girlfriend just about imagining a soup\u00e7on of character. Brendan Fraser managed to make a reasonable deal of a weak plot, and his wife Brooke Shields had a few moments of believable acting as a wife.The script writer lacked imagination, the budget was probably quite low too, there were times the poor CGI punctured the suspension of disbelief (I imagine this would not be one to enjoy on blu-ray unless they fix things up in the transfer). One novelty was that the animals didn't speak, instead thought bubbles appeared with pictures. If I was being cynical I'd say this was as much a way to avoid the costs of voice character actors and dubbing into foreign languages as to give the movie a twist.This could easily have been an episode of a any standard sitcom about a family relocating to the country, and could have been edited down to 45 minutes... and then perhaps the reuse of jokes might not be so bad, but they quickly became stale.So, the movie failed from an adult perspective. Did it succeed to keep the kids entertained? Our 6 year old enjoyed it, he's at that age where adults being stupid, animals being smart, and lots of mess and stink are funny. He's able to follow quite complex dialogue so was able to grasp the point of the movie.Our 4 year old found it hard going, as it was slow to start, there was too much dialogue with too little action, she enjoyed the slapstick humour, but was frequently restless - she'll re-watch Finding Nemo with more attention and she's seen that 10+ times!.",

Brendan Fraser is unfunny and uninteresting to watch, he is oftener enjoyable to watch, but he just was'nt this time. Usually I like movies about smart animals, but everything was too precise in this film. Not to mention the comedy was badly written, resulting to unfunny written slapstick.

Absolutely brilliant casting. The worst one for his role is Matt Prokop as the impudent teenage son. He appears way older than 16, and Prokop is a dweeb. // I wonder how many times Dan says, \"OK. Just make it look like an accident.\" LOL // Great cinematography. The photography is top notch. The scenery is amazing. The directing is spot on. And the SFX of the animals is amazing. It was refreshing that they didn't have the animals talking, and just rely on expressions and animals sounds. You can fill in your own dialogue, in your head. // One reviewer thinks this is a movie for kids. LOL I guess that is why I love it so much. I am 74, going on 12. I've watched it about 12 times. It's a really good movie if the kid in you hasn't died yet. How sad is it when we give Furry Vengeance a 3.8/10 average rating, and crap like Deadpool 2016 an 8/10?? I guess they should have had Fraser use the F word in every sentence to make \"adults\" happy. It's almost scary thinking about the degeneration of society. I think Furry Vengeance is much better than people are saying. // And the reviewer maroons that vote 1, OMG. Really? You think this movie is a 1? // The Bushwacker 1/1/2022.",

It's a good kids movie, not meant to be analyzed or taken too seriously. Honestly, tonight when I went to see it there were only middle aged adults in the theater. I noticed that they all enjoyed the humor in this movie and didn't hear any negative comments as we were leaving at the end of the film. There were some parts that were a bit over used, but there were still several funny scenes. And Brendon Fraser has to be given some respect for having the guts to put his 41 year old body, flaws and all out there for everyone to see and laugh at. This definitely was NOT the worse film I have ever seen. If you take anything serious about this film then take seriously the message to protect our forests. One thing that I thought was sad was that this film was supposed to be about Oregon but was filmed in Massachusetts. I could tell right away that it was not Oregon scenery. Anyway, it was cute and it was funny. Take your kids to see it.",

But, the BIG BOSS, Neal (Ken Jeong) sends him to the Oregon wilderness, where the company is building a new subdivision that will be \"close to nature\". When one looks at the forested area, it is so beautiful that to take any part of it down is a shame. Dan himself is not really happy with the project but wants to keep his job and Tyler is very homesick. Tammy, making the best of things, gets a job at the local school system. But, wait, there are others who are unhappy, too! These are the forest creatures from the lively raccoon to the ermine to the skunks. Yes, they allowed the \"model\" to be built on site but when they hear more trees are coming down, they are furious. Communicating with their own special languages, which resemble cartoon script bubbles, they plot havoc for poor Dan. Their strategies include woodpeckers tapping on the bedroom window, for hours, to giving Dan a \"scented ride\" in his car with skunks. Ugh. Since the family is complaining to Dan, as well as the boss and all of the animals, this poor developer feels squeezed from every side. With the critters keeping up their tricks, who will quit first, Dan or the animals? This is a lovely film, with a terrific setting and a good story. Fraser is always welcome as the erstwhile innocent while Shields, Jeong, Wallace Shawn and others compliment him nicely. The real problem is the direction, which is very uneven, and the slow pace. Many scenes could have been shortened and creatively spliced together for better interest. But, alas, it is not so. Also, there are some coarse scenes, where animals use their bodily functions to sabotage Dan. Yuck! Yet, for its deficiences, kids will probably enjoy the animal antics and the overall product. Therefore, give it a try, all you creature lovers.",

This angers the local wildlife, headed by a cackling raccoon, who set off to humiliate, injure, and presumably kill Fraser and other human interlopers.Now, I'm all for the stupidly funny. I wasn't expecting Oscar material and certainly didn't expect it from this. But even on its own low terms, this movie just fails to be funny, and in my eyes, there's little worse than a bad comedy. Bad efforts at other genres can be great for laughs, but when comedies fail to elicit laughs, they're just painful and dull.Fraser's goofy amiability has levitated other films before, but this time he's just not up to it. There's too much bottom-of-the-barrel slapstick, an overpopulation of stupid characters, and predictable family drama. Also, frequently weirdly inconsistent. At one point Fraser is flung into a bee's nest and is covered with stings, but the next morning he's shown without a scratch or swelling on him. Early on, another character suffers an animal-induced auto accident that's rather appalling since it would be clearly fatal and later we're told the character \"disappeared.\" There quite a bit of wet-crotch and groin-injury humor; I remember a time when that was considered too risqu\u00e9 for children, and now is standard for kid flicks. At any rate, they're cheap laughs.Fraser looks bad; he's gained weight and looks pudgy and uncomfortable. Brooke Shields can be a great comic actress but spends most of the time playing the straight man, so her talents are underused. She also doesn't look her best, either. They're basically playing second fiddle to the cutesy animals, which range from real animals to poorly-done CGI stand-ins. Also has nocturnal animals, like owls and raccoons, running around in the day, and daytime animals, like crows, active at night. Not to mention seagulls suddenly showing up in a clearly inland and mountainous locale. At one point the flick attempts to set up some sort of mystical/magical reasoning for the intelligent animals (who not only understand human speech, but seem every bit as aware of human pop culture as the humans are), but then it's quickly dropped and forgotten.I saw this at a preview screening; there were a number of families there and I could tell the very young found it funny, but older kids and adults were clearly not amused and unimpressed. I guess they wanted a sort of live-action cartoon here, but amidst all the mayhem they forgot to make it truly funny...and contrasting it to a halfway realistic family drama doesn't help. You're better off staying at home with some classic Warner Brothers cartoons. FURRY VENGEANCE is to be avoided at all costs, one of the worst things I've seen in a long time.",

During this film, nothing in the actually film made me laugh, but I did laugh seeing the target demographic, a 5-year old boy falling asleep, not from fatigue, but from being plain bored. Brendan Fraser has actually been a talented actor in his career when he wants to be. Don't believe me? If you don't, watch Gods & Monsters, Crash, The Quiet American, With Honors & School Ties. If you want to prove me wrong, watch this film. Other talented people such as Ken Jeong, Brooke Shields, Angela Kinsey, and Wallace Shawn show up, but just blandly read their lines, walk off screen, and if I were to go out on a limb, collect their paychecks, and walk out of the studio. The animals don't talk, which should be refreshing, but is even more annoying than talking animals in live action films, and that's saying a lot.

Sure, the jokes are silly, have been done before and are sometimes rather disgusting. I wasn't to found of the birds at the end of the movie that \"Stuka-crapped\" on everything.

This movie is, mostly, rated by adults but it is not a movie for adults. It's a movie for kids. Kids haven't seen all the movies that preceded this one, kids do not know that some of the jokes are old and, most of all, kids do not care. Kids still laugh when someone falls on their arse and even more so when it's a cute but sneaky (and furry) animal that is the cause.Most of the animal scenes where actually not too bad, even from an adult perspective. Brendan Fraser portrayed the guy slowly going nuts quite well. Myself, I think I would have given it 5 or maybe 6 stars, the kids loved it and would have probably given it 7 or 8.

The few things that make it bearable are the special effects having the animals \"talk\" and do things animals can't do are flawless, some of Shields reactions to Fraser are actually amusing and the closing credits which has the cast clowning around.

There, that's it.Basically nothing more than a live action version of \"Open Season,\" with a smattering of \"Over the Hedge,\" \"Are We Done, Yet?\" and \"Evan Almighty\" slopped about, this is another tale where a bunch of cuddly little vermin connive to thwart a major development project.Oh yes, the lines are drawn very clearly. For example, the head of the project, Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong, \"The Hangover,\" \"The Goods\"), brags openly about all of the forests he has - well, deforested. His henchmen are equally disrespectful of the environment. Hey, I'm no developer, but wouldn't an intelligent one utilize both aspect of construction a certain care for the surrounding area? And aren't there many, many laws on the books - both local and national - to prevent wholesale rape of the land? Anyway, Lyman's point man for the new project is Dan Sanders, who with wife, Tammy (Brooke Shields), and Earth Firster son, Tyler (Matt Prokop, \"High School Musical 3\"), get to live in the first prototype home in the area. Since the trailers all show it (and the film's title is \"Furry Vengeance\"), there's no need for a spoiler alert here.Yep, the little creatures begin to put together a plan not only to drive out the Sanders, but to keep their sanctuary as human being-free as possible. This begins with little annoyances such as keeping Dan up at night (it's funny that only HE - and the audience - sees what's happening, but his clueless wife does not) to total war on the encroaching developers (i.e. birds dive-bombing, bears trapping Dan in a port-a-potty, etc.).We're supposed to universally root for the animals, but I could not support ANYONE or ANYTHING in this mess. The creatures were creepily unrealistic, the actors were abysmal, dialogue ridiculous and the direction non-existent. That, and there wasn't a solid laugh in the whole enterprise. And this is what passes for comedy in Hollywood today? In fact, the past two years have been a vast wasteland in the humorous film category. A wasteland littered with the decaying bones of \"Year One,\" \"I Love You, Beth Cooper,\" \"Our Family Wedding,\" \"Cop Out,\" \"Hot Tub Time Machine,\" \"Post-Grad,\" etc., etc., etc. Now add this lame effort to that ever-growing list.Brief political rant: Okay, I know destroying the environment is bad. We ALL know that. It's also bad to wipe out forests for nothing else except to build a mall. But that mall had to go SOMEWHERE. After all, if there was no mall, there would be no venue for suckers out there to pay good money to watch crap like this.",

Based on the method behind the score that my fellow reviewer gave - an average from an adult and a kid - with the same method \"The Godfather\" and \"House M.D.\" will also get a score of like 3.

When we finally saw the DVD for sale at a local car boot sale, I bought it despite my serious reservations and we watched it the same afternoon. My son enjoyed the film, but I had severely underestimated how excruciating the experience would be for me.Brendan Fraser plays property developer Dan Sanders, who has moved with his family to rural Oregon to oversee a new housing project that requires the levelling of some woodland. To his horror, Sanders faces some stiff opposition, not from human protesters, but from the intelligent animals that live in the area: raccoons, turkeys, skunks, foxes, bears, and beavers who will do anything to protect their homes.Oh, the horror. Furry Vengeance has to be one of the worst comedies I have ever endured. I didn't laugh once\u2014and silly animal antics are usually guaranteed to make me giggle. Fraser is absolutely awful, his slapstick rapidly becoming annoying, the comedy is puerile with a repetition of certain gags that weren't that great the first time around, the CGI animals are pathetic, and the ecological message is mercilessly rammed down the viewers throat.The only part I enjoyed was when the critters finally invaded the Forest Festival and began to savagely maul the visitors, ripping out their throats, gouging out their eyes and tearing off their limbs (that didn't actually happen: I just imagined it to help make the time pass a little less painfully).It's OK son\u0085 I still love you\u2014but if there is ever a Furry Vengeance 2, you can go it alone.",

So, with incredibly low expectations I sat down to feed a dark and sad part of of my personality--the part of me that has actually been trying to see as many of the Bottom 100 as is humanly possible. Several others have apparently tried, but I assume they killed themselves in order to be spared the ordeal! I assume this is supposed to be a comedy for kids--but the humor in the first several minutes is, to put it mildly, not at all funny and not especially kid-friendly. In the opening scene, a jerk is driving his Porsche 911 through the wilderness with a complete disregard for anyone or anything...so 'for laughs' the animals of the forest murder him. Apart from a few over-zealous members of PETA, I can't see most people thinking this is funny. Hopefully it will get better.By the way, speaking of PETA (and Earth Firsters), the plot is exactly what a card-carrying member (or Captain Planet) would love. Brandon Fraser (who appears to career suicide mode lately) is building a development that will destroy the wilderness--so the aminals all get together to exact vengeance on him and his co-workers. How do them cute aminals know about it--well a raccoon infiltrates Frasier's meeting with his boss when leveling the forest is discussed! That's one smart raccoon---perhaps smarter than the folks starring in this crap.The bottom line is that unless you have a serious brain injury, most of the jokes fall flat....very, very flat. Crotch jokes involving coffee cups spilling there and lawn sprinklers discharging in Fraser's nether regions is about as good as the humor gets! Some other lovely 'humorous' touches are a security officer who is LESS subtle than Carrot Top on Quaaludes, people being hit by car doors, Fraser falling off a cliff, Fraser bumping his head, birds pecking his face and then 'laughing', a senile old teacher who likes to sing about cows, a carload of skunks who spray him (this was so good, the filmmakers repeated this throughout the movie), Fraser in a bra while covered in tomato sauce, aminals hot-wiring a car, Fraser in a pink lady's jogging suit, an obviously computer generated white vulture chasing Fraser (probably to demand its money back), bees stinging, CGI animals dancing to \"Le Freak\" and other such 'hilarious' hijinks too numerous to mention.The bottom line is that the movie sucks. Now if it had been made with unknowns and with a rock-bottom budget, this would have been bad enough. But this came from a real honest-to-goodness Hollywood studio and received nationwide distribution!! Who says there is no Devil?! This film is ample proof that he truly exists and hates us all, as only this might explain why these idiots made this bile.By the way, thanks to the makers of \"Furry Vengeance\". As I sat and watched this god-awful film on DVD, my wife sat next to me and whimpered. I might forgive you for making this terrible movie since I am a masochist--but she sure won't! No, now that I think about it, I won't forgive them, as they used Electric Light Orchestra's \"Don't Bring Me Down\"--now I hate a song that I once loved! Also by the way, other actors apparently in career suicide mode over the last few years would be Eddie Murphy and Steve Martin. If they weren't both richer than the Pope, I am sure they'd feel really bad about my mentioning this!!",

Basically in the wilderness of Oregon, real estate land developer Dan Sanders (Brendan Fraser) from Chicago has been given the task by his boss Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong), following Riggs (The Hangover's Rob Riggle) quitting, to oversee a project that will turn the forest into a residential development. Dan's son Tyler (Matt Prokop) objects to this job he has, and his wife Tammy (Brooke Shields) is also unhappy and misses life in Chicago, the animals of Rocky Springs meanwhile, led by the raccoon, are making plans to stop their forest from being destroyed by turning the tables on the human they see as the devil. Dan soon finds himself threatened by interruptions in his progress and humiliation from the woodland animals, they cause all sorts of chaotic mayhem for him in his professional and personal life, and no-one will believe his explanations that the animals are doing it. Following many embarrassing and painful incidents initiated by the creatures he finally gets the forest ranger to capture all of them, and he is able to continue business, but he realises there is no truth in the \"eco-friendly\" plot to cut down all the trees and build houses and a shopping mall. The raccoon and all the others animals, including the brown bear, various birds and the skunk, get together and destroy the festivities of the fair going on, guests and entertainers run away in panic, and the deal by Lyman is broken. In the end Dan realises the error of his ways, and three months later the animals and their families return to Rocky Springs forest, which becomes a nature reserve, and Dan becomes the park ranger who will fine anyone who tries to violate the area or creatures. Also starring Angela Kinsey as Felder, Skyler Samuels as Amber, Toby Huss as Wilson, Samantha Bee as Principal Baker, Ricky Garcia as Frank, Wallace Shawn as Dr. Christian Burr, Jim Norton as Hank and Patrice O'Neal as Gus. Fraser is annoying being made to look stupid, the casting of Shields and Jeong is a bit pointless, it seems just an excuse to see cute animals being wily and sabotaging things, and the special effects to create the slapstick situations and cartoon like moments is a bit wasted, children may find this film funny, but everyone will find this a terrible numbskull comedy.

Brendan Fraser and Brooke Shields lead the cast with good performances, and the film does have some fun, quirky characters played well by actors including Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle and Angela Kinsey.The film is your basic \"save the rainforest\" kids movie, where cute animals torment our main character (Fraser as Dan Sanders), whom is plowing down parts of a forest to make room for urban development. Shields (gorgeous and talented, and surprisingly good in this movie considering the material she has to work with) plays his wife, while Matt Prokop plays his son, whom doesn't like what he is doing.The script is quite a mess. It's essentially \"Home Alone\" with animals, as Fraser, who looks like he's having fun in his role, is hit with various almost Rube-Goldberg-like traps set by the animals. It is very cartooney and outlandish.The film also sports some abysmal special effects. The CGI for the animals is cheap and unpolished, and the animations look like generic tests. It was like the studio ripped the film away from the CG artists halfway through making the effects- they look unfinished.I dunno... the script is awful, the effects are bad, the direction is generic, the jokes are often unfunny.

It is the worst film of the year and stars Brendan Fraser who moves his family to a forest area where his boss wants to begin a suburban neighborhood. Wiping out a forest causes animals, headed by a raccoon to retaliate causing Fraser to lose his mind. Director Roger Kumble manages to make a film even worse than his The Sweetest Thing. It use to be that he made films like Cruel Intentions. What a sad decline for a promising directing. Fraser is humbled and fumbled repeatedly by these creatures until he comes to some moral conclusion. Now he should humble and fumble the film for the ass it made of him. Brooke Shields is wasted as his wife who tries to maintain sanity in her household. What she should be doing is reflecting on how she got reduced to this. Matt Prokop plays his son who now likes the move because a girl shows interest in him. Now if a decent screenwriter would show interest then maybe he could move in the right direction. Ken Jeong is too talented to be playing a tyrant boss such as this. The previous year he was in a masterpiece comedy called The Hangover. This is the opposite extreme without a laugh or care. Angela Kinsey is great on The Office but here she is assaulted in a car by skunks aiming the stink barrels. The animal rights theme becomes lost within amateur production.

Then I watched the rest while simultaneously worked on my will. I didn't think I would make it to the end.In this green movie with a VERY constipated Brendan Fraser, we have \"highly intelligent\" animals that want to protect their precious land. Well, they succeeded in simply making me want me to litter. Seriously. I wanted to both denounce Al Gore and kill animals while running a bulldozer over rain forests after watching this movie. Too bad they achieved the opposite message they were looking for: leave the planet alone. I singlehandedly wanted to destroy it.Dan Sanders (Fraser) brings his wife (Shields) and son, Tyler (Prokop), to the deep forest to appease his boss, Lyman (Jeong) and their mission is to destroy the forest in order to build houses. In some dumb back story, for generations, the animals fight back, namely a comical/animated raccoon, in order to preserve their land.In the movie's defense, I can see where they were going: Family AND eco-friendly message with ohhh-so-cute CGI-Laced mouths/eyes on animals to target younglings. Unfortunately, the script, special effects and even its message wouldn't work on the lowest rated Disney animated movie of the 1960s. How this got green lit or how this got past audience screenings is beyond me.Each scene of the animal's attack on Dan to make his life miserable is more painful than the last. Each stunt is just as dumb as what a 0.250 BAC drunk would consider funny. Don't get me wrong: I'm not against either family friendly films nor am I opposed to green-movies, but when you combine the two with the mentality of the under two crowd, I'm uninterested. Just be prepared for a lot of poop shots (from birds) because they think: that's funny!It's not. Please avoid. This is, BY FAR, the worst film of 2010 and in one of the worst years for movies in decades, that's saying a lot. What other movie would seriously make you want to litter just out of spite?Side Note: Following the movie, I began listening to the audio commentary, hoping beyond hope that they would apologize for the crap they made (SEE: Superman IV: The Quest for Peace) but it was a no-go. They seemed like they were still trying to be \"family-friendly\" in their speech, when all they succeeded in was lying about producing the abomination they made.

The animals vow revenge and make life a living hell for Fraser as they had for another employee through their own manipulation and knowledge of the natural resources.Like a Saturday morning cartoon, the humans are the idiotic villains and the wild animals (in this case squirrels, mice, raccoons, skunks, foxes and various species of birds) are the smart ones.

Raccoons would only be out during the day if they were rabid, and they certainly wouldn't be friendly with the other animals they are in conspiracy with here in that condition.This is particularly embarrassing for the stereotypical behavior of Hispanic, Asian and Indian characters, and Leung in particular is very bad. Poor Alice Drummond is mistreated as a teacher who works with Fraser's wife Brooke Shields, presented as senile simply because she has tenure and hasn't yet retired.

How the film recycles the same footage of the logs-hit-boulders wannabe Mousetrap engineered by the unfathomably savvy raccoon adversary/antihero(?) TWICE in the first twenty minutes, as if brazenly flaunting the film's laziness. All subsequent bumped heads/skunk spraying/annoying birds mischief is so deliciously sleepy and stale the film would appear laudably self-parodic were it not despicably phoned in.But, while stupidity reins, boring the film ain't. Oh no. Before we know it, we get Brooke Shields, caught in a subplot mercilessly mocking senior citizens with dementia. Then, the film's 1950s-calibre-of-subtlety product placement (\"Honey, I know you're upset we moved away from the big city. But hey - WHO WANTS A NEW WII?\"), and the room starts to contort and spin a bit. At one point, Fraser, sprayed in the crotch by a rampant lawn sprinkler, turns to his dumbfounded family, and intones \"I made pee-pee\". My jaw plunged through the floor, interrupting the family below me having their peaceful, thoroughly sane dinner. Soon, our chirping forest menagerie (all disturbingly voiced by Dee Bradley Baker like Aladdin's Abu run through a blender) start to communicate in comic book style visual speech bubbles, one of which visualizes Brendan Fraser as a teeth-gnashing Satan. Then: strange flashbacks(?) have Fraser embodying break-dancing pilgrims and cavemen alike. Welcome to Crazy Town, population: you. We hit the level of hallucinogenic lunacy where it would hardly seem out of place if Nicolas Cage appeared as a rainbow centaur, guzzling gasoline out of a bowler hat while reciting the pledge of allegiance backwards. And I laughed and laughed, nearly fit to burst, like one of the overcaffienated weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Then, near the halfway point, the film's high wears off, and the existential despair sets in. \"Wait a minute,\" my brain, resenting its loss of brain cells, rebuts. \"You think you're all high and mighty making fun of this awful movie. But look at it this way - it's a comedy, and you're laughing. Doesn't that mean it achieved its goal? Doesn't that mean it's... an EXCELLENT movie? Hmm? Hmmmmm? Chew on that!\" \"Good god - you're right, externally personified brain! What if everything I've ever believed about film criticism and the rest of the world is a lie? What if pigs fly and cats woof and babies have babies and our perception of life is a collective dream as we nuzzle in conveyor belts in giant eggs, tended by an insectoid Rosie O'Donnell with a thousand legs? Ohhhhh no.\" Then came the stupefied sadness. If Kumble's artistic intent was to bludgeon all sensibilities out of audiences to the point where they are too catatonic to object to the film's trite environmentalist message, he is a secret genius - by the film's mid-point, I was practically weeping for the fate of the trees and squirrels and raccoons and other nature things. Or at least I would have wept, had the film not reduced me to too much of a husk to retain bodily fluids. Stray thoughts flitted across my brain.\"Man, poor Ken Jeong being in this movie must mean he really needs to renovate his house. I hope he didn't displace any forests for it. I feel like the moral of the story is that wouldn't end well.\"\"If I had a raccoon puppet, how many hands would it take to make it do the Charleston?\"\"Wallace Shawn? Playing a psychiatrist? Inconceivable!\"\"Will I survive to ever watch another film again?\"Then, I think I fell asleep for a while/my brain finally mutineered and I slumped on the couch in a vegetative state. I rebooted just in time to catch Fraser's corporate stooge's contrived third act change of heart, spelling out the film's treehugging message in capital letters, as the raccoon puppets all give thumbs up. By the film's almost apologetically reluctant closing credits dance number to a sanitized cover of \"Insane in the Membrane\" (you can now tick 'Beerbellied Brendan Fraser in a crop top party-boy-ing with squirrel puppets' off your cinematic bucket list) I was howling with disbelieving laughter again. Or maybe it was howling in anguish. Pretty hard to distinguish at this point. In all fairness, the film offers roughly three genuine but meager laughs: one at how ashamed Brendan Fraser looks throughout, one in solidarity with Ken Jeong, and one at Rob Riggle belligerently refusing to be dragged down to the film's level (in his character's own words: \"I do as I please!!!\"). But otherwise... yeesh. To all unsuspecting children who might be exposed to the mind-altering horrors of this movie: I fear for you, and humanity's future. To all consenting adults willingly subjecting themselves to the hallucinogenic, apocalyptic camp of Furry Vengeance: godspeed. Your lives will never again be the same. -1/10",

            "content": "Furry Vengeance is not only guilty of being an incoherent mess of a movie, but has its fair share of the most selfish movie characters I've ever seen. Brendan Fraser's character is too shy to speak his mind and all he wants is money, and his son only stands up for the animals because his girlfriend is into \"saving the trees.\" If it wasn't for that girl walking into his life, he'd be at home on his Macbook playing computer games, not caring if animals are killed or not.Let me bring you up to speed; Dan Sanders (Fraser) is a Chicago-based real estate employee who was passed down the job of turning a huge forest into a field of development. The boss of Dan is Neal Lyman (Jeong) who is about as dopey as an adult can be, constantly on his cell-phone like a fifteen year old girl who a brand new boyfriend.As soon as Dan accepts the job, the whole forest of animals turns against him. By this I mean attacking him in inconceivable and dopey ways. His son (Prokop) and his wife (Shields) think he has gone nuts, and the antics just get worse and worse as the film goes on.The CGI animals are ridiculous. It's not funny to see a real-looking animal's eyes pop out of his head or see them give the \"thumbs up\" gesture. In a cartoon that was an hour and twenty minutes shorter, it probably would've been cute and way less forced. No actor in this movie was funny, and all had a \"collect the check\" attitude in them.Not to mention, when is it ever funny to see adults acting like big kids in a serious situation? I find it hard to believe that Dan is a real estate agent when his first instinct to cease a barking crow is to grab a stack of papers to shoo it away. Also, if this guy is being attacked by animals, why go outside so much? Someways he treats these animals could also be considered animal cruelty. I know they're just poorly rendered CGI creatures, but still, even the thought of a grown man wrestling with animals is a sad, inexcusable thing to put in a children's movie. Real or not, it's all the same; unfunny.Its stereotypical view of the world, and most notably Asians, is also appealing. When is it okay to place stereotypical humor in a kid's movie? Never. It doesn't add to the fun of the film. Kids most likely won't get the references, but I'm sure adults will, and I doubt they will be happy.Will Furry Vengeance amuse kids? The demographic it is going for is most likely five and under, so it might amuse them. Six and seven are pushing it. Anyone older than eight will likely be bored and uninterested in this distasteful bland of animal abusive and wretched humor. Adults' intelligence will feel insulted by sitting there watching humorless hijink after hijink unfold.Quite possibly the most amusing scene in the film is when Dan's son talks about animals getting revenge on caveman. The caveman shown in the flashback is played by Brendan Fraser, and it's a reference to when he played the caveman turned exchange student in his first film Encino Man. A funny reference, but doesn't come close to saving this movie from cheap and unfunny.Note: The one thing that could've made this have zero stars - if it was in 3D. Thankfully, it did one thing right.Starring: Brendan Fraser, Brooke Shields, Matt Prokop, Angela Kinsey, and Ken Jeong. Directed by: Roger Kumble.",

            "content": "This is a cute family comedy, though it's probably not considered a classic or anything. It uses several formulas, though I would say it is unique because it puts together formulas that maybe haven't been tried together.The physical comedy is hilarious, at least to me. It's mostly Dan who is the victim, but others get attacked as well.With all the wacky comedy, there is a serious environmental message. The film does turn serious (temporarily, I assure you) before the antics start up again.The best actor is the head raccoon, though you wouldn't call what he does acting. He is certainly animatronic when showing human emotions, but this is done very well. Okay, for this movie it is done very well.The animals communicate but don't speak English. Much. There are occasionally sounds they make that resemble words. They do know the lyrics to \"Le Freak\" by Chic. Anyway, the animation and animatronic creations are quite good, if not on the same level as the great classics.The best human actor is Skyler Samuels as Amber. I really like her.Other actors stand out too.Annie Drummond is a teacher so senile she really shouldn't be working. It has been 40 years since Bessie the Cow died. She isn't in many scenes but she is memorable.I don't know his name or who plays him, but there is a demented cop who actually works for Lyman.Brooke Shields does a halfway decent job. She isn't consistently talented but she seems to be the voice of reason in all the chaos. Plus she still looks good.I'm not sure Brendan Fraser shows talent here most of the time, but there are a few exceptions. Fraser appears to play all of the unfortunate victims of the animals throughout history. Then there is the scene where Dan turns into Rambo. And finally, he goes over to the side of the animals when he realizes they are like people.I liked the bluegrass band at the festival. Because Dr. Ralph Stanley once said what he did isn't bluegrass but old-time music, I will say that bluegrass may or may not be the appropriate term. And I really wish they had played more.If you don't think anything else about this movie is worth seeing, at least stay around for the rap video with the closing credits. I think the name of the song is \"Insane in the Brain\". The cast members have a good time with it, even the historical figures attacked by animals and Shields in monster makeup as her character in Dan's nightmare. And several movies and memorable music videos are included, including Tom Cruise's famous \"Risky Business\" scene, Shields playing her \"Blue Lagoon\" character as an adult along with a Christopher Atkins type, Britney Spears' \"Baby One More Time\" and Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\".I did say this is a family movie, but there is considerable toilet humor. And other types of disgusting humor. But it really is appropriate for most kids. It would have to be, because no one over the age of ten should see it. Okay, not really. I had a good time.",

As Fraser & his family comfort themselves in the jungle, the animals try their best to throw Fraser & company out of their place, at any COST!

In acting, Fraser is the life of the show. He throws the right expressions in the right time. Although it must be said, that Fraser has put on a lot of weight!

I am sure that my son will find it amusing when he is old enough to understand it. I, however, found the movie to be a bit too sassy. Sure, it was cute with all the furry animals, and their cute little sounds, and their pranks, and their way of saving their habitat. But that was about it.Looking at it as a family movie, then the movie was alright, I guess. It is surely bound to prove fun for the youngest of kids. But for adults, well, not so much.I was a bit amazed to see the cast in this movie. Not that they were doing a bad job, not at all, just wondering why did these people decide on a movie like this. Bold career move or just grasping at whatever comes their way? I have no idea, nor will I most likely ever know. But nonetheless, I was surprised when I saw them in this movie.As for the animals, well they were fun to look at, and I have to admit that they were cute with what they were doing and the sounds they made. I even laughed at times, such as when the raccoon attacked Dan, or when the sprinklers were turned on at the squirrel. Yeah, I am a sucker for cheesy comedy.If you have young kids in the family, then this is a good movie to put on to entertain them. Sit down with your kids and watch this movie, they will love it.

But then they've never seen the slapstick of Laurel and Hardy.If the CGI was closer to 'Over the Hedge', or the animals talked, rather than those ridiculous thought bubbles, this could have been so much better. If the plot about the new family in town, making connections along the way, had been explored, and the really embarrassing sub plot about the old teacher with a poor memory had been scratched, it would have been far better. The strange sub plot about the deranged forest ranger was even more of a waste of space. He just didn't fit in.Oh, and if you're going to use a CEO character who looks Chinese, and seems to come across as that, PLEASE don't give him a western name - either a Hong Kong Chinese or a straight Chinese one. I'm sure young kids will love this, as its all about the series of slapstick scenes that don't need to hang together with a plot.Making a great slapstick though, you need to learn the techniques of the masters (L&H).

It is really poorly made and looks cheap, also, much worst, totally unnecessary especially when weird looking smirks and facial expressions are imposed to animals. Climax has the worst and most embarassing CGI.\nDespite Brandon Fraser can be likeable, here is mostly annoying, unable to escape from the \"furry vengeance\" and incapable to seek help since everybody else, especially the family, is written so dumb to recognise animals are up to something.\nAnd the animals, instead of symphatetic appear as big jerks and it's borderline impossible to route for them. So the environmental message is really thin and laughable.\nPoop jokes, skunk jokes and much more makes movie disgusting to watch at points.All this considered, the film possibly falls many times in the \"so bad is good\" territory.",

            "content": "If the main actors had been Alice Drummond and Billy Bush, rather than having them as bit parts, this film would've been infinitely more entertaining. Of course, then you would also need some writers with at least SOME presence of mind between them. Someone also needed to tell the director that animals with CGI mouths that move, and constantly make whining human noises, are just CREEPY. And CHEESY. They're CHREEPY. Leave them out. Let them be their real animal selves -- just as cute, just as funny. As for the other actors, Brooke Shields' performance as the wife/mother is embarrassing to watch, as is that of the son. I swear that in some of Brendan Frasier's scenes, you can actually see a glimmer of self-consciousness in his eyes, of a properly mortified \"Have I come to this?\". The occasional humorous moments are quickly drowned in extravagance. It's as if the writers became so enamored with their own comedic genius that when they wrote a single, small funny moment they immediately tried to top it, over and over -- the results, being something like having your older brother's friend come over and make increasingly louder farting sounds in his armpit, over and over, even though no one is laughing. There is a message of \"green\" or \"environmental preservation\" in this film, but it is so hypocritical and diluted that its presence feels more like the blatant leeching of a trend, rather than sincere feeling or conscious action. I like to imagine what this film would've been if it had been made as a horror or disaster film, rather than a would-be family comedy.Still, the worst thing one can say about a movie is that it was boring. This one did at least hold my attention long enough to be mentally present for the few-and-far-between humorous moments (almost all belonging to Alice Drummond and Billy Bush).",

What happened to the ever so cool guy from the Mummy trilogy, or School ties for that matter? Another winner Brooke Sheilds who looks as if she had one face lift too many and those eyebrows... worked for you in the 80's sunshine but sadly they need to go. The one gem as everything that this lil dude stars in is Ken Jeong, who portrays the president of the construction company that is sent to demo a small woodland area. Well the animals hear of this and decide to take matters in their own hand. Brendan tries miserably at comedy but he really needs to stick to action or something along those lines. The story is very week here as is the dialogue. I shouldn't be surprised as in my opinion director Roger Kumble hasn't really made a good film since '99's Cruel Intentions. Once again one for the kiddies however the parents should stay far far away.",

            "content": "Giving Furry Vengeance a 1 out of 10 is very generous of me. I cannot express the horror of this movie in words. OK, first of all, the set pieces look awful. It looked like the movie was shot in one small random location. Second of all, the CGI looked like a train wreck. They even had to CGI a boulder for some reason. Brendan Fraser is overacting in his worst performance possibly ever and Brooke Shields is just used as a ploy I guess. Furry Vengeance is like a poor man's Dr. Dolittle. The movie couldn't have taken more than 10,000 dollars to make. And the worst thing of all is that the movie isn't the least bit funny. There was only one tiny part of one scene that I kind of chuckled at and that was it! The movie consists of gross-out movie clich\u00e9s like crotch shots, bird droppings, skunk spray , and last but not least the classic getting covered with feces bit. It's rude, crude, cheap, loud, and annoying and I even think kids are going to be solefully disappointed if they see it. I think we all know now what the worst movie of the year is.",

Now replace all the funny human characters with painfully boring characters. Now amp up the hackneyed, overused plot to be even more clich\u00e9. Now walk out of the theater angry and demanding your money back. You've just seen Furry Vengeance. I thought the Egyptian plagues ended with the death of the first born son, so what it the explanation for this garbage? For those of you who think I'm being cruel, let me recap the plot. Some guy wants to tear down a forest, and the animals play pranks on him. That's it. Nothing else. For over an hour. Ugh. Well, as with all things, there is a bright side. Brendan Fraser CAN'T star in a worse film. Once you've hit rock bottom, (and I'm pretty sure this hits the bedrock), there's no place to go but up. The worst is over. At least, until someone tries to make a sequel.. duh duh duuuunnnnn!",

If you're watching it as an adult you'll probably be disappointed but, again, if you have children go for it. Brook Shields puts in a reasonably good comedy performance and Brendan Fraser is his usual self (strange that this film is credited as one of the things that set his career back).

It is because more and more parents, as each year passes, simply do not involve themselves with their children in the manner parents used to be involved. Teaching them how to use tablets and iPhones is not the same thing as playing board games and choosing family movies to watch -- together. There was a time when family movies were recognized as such, and not ridiculed for being such. When we see most reviewers hating movies for being too childish for adults, we know that the time of family viewing is over. Now, Family Guy is what children watch with their parents, if their parents are even in the same room. Yay.",

This movie made even Brooke Shields look like a bad actress, which she is not! The jokes were so lame, the animal vengeance scenes ridiculous. I can't even say enough of how bad this movie was!!!! I could see it appealing to very young children, that might find the animal humor amusing. But my kids' were 6 and 8 when we saw this and even they thought it was bad! I would have walked out mid way through, but figured I would see it through since I had paid $20.00! I can usually find some humor and enjoyment out of most family films but with this one, I could not!!!!",

It used some very old comedy tricks seen in many other movies and wore several of them out after using them 3-4 times in the movie. The animals in the movie were very well trained and did their parts, however it was very obvious when they were animated animals. it is a nice movie to watch but I wouldn't go to the cinema to see it. I was very slow to get started and some parts in the movie were stretched on a little long. However it was definitely a movie to be highly enjoyed for the much younger audience. I would play this once in a while on a Friday maybe but not one I remember as one that stands out. Even at the sad bits I didn't really have any connection with the characters so I couldn't really sympathise with them.",
