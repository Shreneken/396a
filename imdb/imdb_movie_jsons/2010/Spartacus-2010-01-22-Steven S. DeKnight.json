I've watched the entire series all the way through at least four or five times because it's just that good. All you have to is read through the reviews to see how beloved this series is. The entire cast is just incredible. I think most people thought when Andy Whitfield tragically died and they had to recast the role of Spartacus that it would drop in quality. It didn't! As good as Whitfield was, Liam McIntyre stepped in and was just as good. It will grab your attention from the first episode and hold it throughout the series. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!",

It is one of the rare shows where each season is just as incredible as the others, all 4 seasons are fantastic & some of the best tv I've ever seen! I've watched the entire series 3 times already. After the original actor (Andrew Whitfield) who played Spartacus sadly died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after Season 1, they had to recast it and the actor who replaced him (Liam McIntyre) as Spartacus was just as terrific! Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible series immediately...you will not be disappointed! It really is the perfect show!",

I had no recollection of Jai Courteney being in the series and I don't like him as an actor but as Varro he is just great. All the acting is great, even when it's over the top, it all just fits together so nicely. Yeah, the GCI is a bit funny now and then but after just a few episodes, I really started to enjoy it. This show is sad, exciting and just pure fun to watch. To Andy: you made such an impression on younger me and you still do. You are a legend.",

Amid all the glorious violence I had forgotten just how surprisingly emotional this series was.\nIf you have not seen it, watch it!For fans of Gladiator, Xena, Hercules, and works by Sam Raimi. You need not have seen the original 1960 film Spartacus to enjoy the series as they are not related.Warning - every episode contains nudity and explicit sex scenes. You have been warned.And don't forget to watch the 6 episodes of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which aired between seasons one and two, but could be watched after this series. This was basically a holdover for the fans while it was hoped for and assumed by everyone involved that Andy Whitfield's return would be eminent.Sadly, Andy Whitfield was taken from us a year and a half after the final episode aired. If you like Andy and enjoyed his performance make sure to check out the documentary Be Here Now. RIP Andy Whitfield.",

It was dad who assured me my goon would be okay and.......he was. Fond memories with Dad, i think of him every time i watch it since he's passed away.

            "content": "Review of Blood and Sand: After ROME, I've always been on the look out for adult-oriented historical TV series that bring ancient eras to life in all their vivid, bloody glory. SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND came out a couple of years ago, and only now have I caved in to see what all the fuss is about; I'm glad I did, because this gladiator drama is every bit the equal of ROME.I'll admit that the first couple of episodes (the first series runs for 13) left me distinctly ambivalent. The 300-style slow-mo fight scenes and lashings of CGI gore take some getting used to. However, then I started getting to know \u2013 and like \u2013 the individuals and each episode just seemed to get better and better. On the surface, the show is all about gladiator combat \u2013 and there are tons of grisly fight scenes \u2013 but at its heart it's another variation on UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, depicting the lives of the masters and their slaves and showing how the two worlds interact.This is a show brimming with talent. The late, lamented Andy Whitfield is all heart in the titular role, but it's the supporting characters who really stand out. John Hannah is an actor I could never stand, but his hammy, larger-than-life turn as Batiatus is almost legendary. Lucy Lawless brushes aside memories of XENA with the cunning and manipulative Lucretia, and watching her snappy dialogue with Hannah is the stuff of pure joy. On the gladiator front, Peter Mensah and Manu Bennett are all heart as Doctore and Crixus respectively, and Nick Tarabay is a sly delight as the sneaking Ashur.The series builds on itself as it goes along, increasing the stakes, throwing in some genuine twists and shocks you won't see coming, and eventually culminating in the best finale of any series I've ever seen; to say it's dramatically satisfying is a real understatement. As the credits on the final episode rolled, I realised I'd watched a show that had become the stuff of genius, that had engaged my emotions to the max, and that I'll be gobbling up any future sequels or prequels that come along.Review of Gods of the Arena: GODS OF THE ARENA is the six-part prequel miniseries following on from BLOOD & SAND, necessitated by star Andy Whitfield's illness. At first I wondered whether the format would work with a different character in the leading role, but I needn't have worried: it turns out to be fantastic entertainment, just as good as the original show.I particularly like the shift in focus so that Batiatus is now a 'good' character when shown in comparison to his even-more-dastardly colleagues. His character arc is engaging, as are the various cloak-and-dagger shenanigans that take place at his ludos. In particular, the characters of Crixus and Ashur bag decent, unexpected story lines, although I was less enamoured with Gannicus himself. Still top drawer entertainment throughout, excellent fight scenes combined with truly intriguing plotting.Review of Vengeance: Fans who wondered whether SPARTACUS could continue in the wake of star Andy Whitfield's death needn't have worried: VENGEANCE proves to be a decent follow up to BLOOD & SAND, offering the same kind of plotting and intrigue that fans of the show love, albeit with a few changes to the format.It's not quite as good as the first couple of seasons, and that's due to some minor flaws in the writing. The stuff involving the Roman characters is a bit repetitive, and it was a mistake to bring back a major female character whose storyline was already spent at the end of BLOOD & SAND. Similarly, I was disappointed in the way Ashur (my favourite gladiator) becomes a stock villain rather than the multi-layered personality of the previous shows. And, let's face it, none of the episodes could ever hope to equal the brilliance of BLOOD & SAND's season finale, KILL THEM ALL.It's still great entertainment though. The fights - and there are plenty - look better than ever, more detailed and almost 3D in places. It's as if the cameras are offering twice as much detail and quality as previously. The sex and violence have been upped, and the blood looks much less CGI-like than in the original show. Episodes five and 10 of this show are particularly exciting, both offering rewarding climaxes to carefully-build sub-plotting.Review of War of the Damned: Wow. Wow. Wow. WAR OF THE DAMNED ends the SPARTACUS series on a real high, proving from the outset to be an immediate improvement over the predecessor, VENGEANCE. The plots feel deeper and more complex, the characters are more nuanced and intriguing, the story arc has a wider and more dramatic feel to it. It's clear that things are moving towards the climax, so there's little of that feeling of 'treading water' that marred the previous series, particularly with the Roman characters.One of the best things about this season is the way the characters have changed and matured, given all that they've gone through. The Romans are far more interesting, too, and much better than the stock villain Glabor. Crassus is particularly good, because there's a great actor playing him, and you also feel that he's not such a bad guy really. The guy playing Caesar is a delight, too, and I hope the mooted spin-off series emerges with him in the starring role.Elsewhere, production values seem better and more impressive; there are larger scale fights, packed with effects that don't disappoint. The action is more plentiful and brutal than ever, with some truly eye-popping visuals to be enjoyed. The first seven episodes are tremendously good in their own right, but then the last three episodes go somewhere else, reaching a level of profundity you wouldn't expect to see in a pulpy TV show like this. The climax is nothing less than riveting.",

They were slaves, which isn't great. Spartacus, as some know, was the most famous of those. Romans often made prisoners of war into such to watch them fight, a form of entertainment for the Roman people and Roman nobility. The fights were very brutal and almost always many had to die. Some have achieved fame and perhaps been some kind of hero. Crixus the Gaul is my favorite gladiator. I find the Roman Ilythia very desirable. The following seasons even show free gladiators fighting for their freedom.This was good fun and professionally done. Very well presented.",

The 1st season sets the back story for Spartacus before proceeding to the next two seasons where upon Spartacus takes out his revenge on the Romans, before then finally facing off the Romans in a epic battle. The story of Spartacus to me should be a story of the ages a story that is truly inspiring both in its historical sense and in this theatrical adaption. This show is very adult so not a show for children, but everything shown is to contextual and in line with the time, period and story so I don't have any problem with any of it, but others might. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone wanting to watch a story of portrayal, revenge, struggle and sacrifice plus more, its great!",

            "content": "If you want a series about Roman history, one can watch HBO's Rome (a very fine TV show). If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.Supposedly, TV shows are by necessity tamer than movies, yet I haven't seen any movie as consistently graphic about sex and violence as Spartacus. Suffice to say that almost everybody in the large cast of mostly muscular men and gorgeous women, gets naked in the series at some point. Episode 9 in particular \u2013 subtly called \"Whore\" \u2013 is a highlight in that regard.A bit slow to start (I struggled with episode 1, but get hooked after episode 2), this admittedly not for all tastes series, was filmed in New Zealand with a mostly Australian and Kiwi cast. Its striking visual style can be compared with 300 (the gladiator's trainer, the great Peter Mensah, had a small role in that movie). The show is finely led in the titular role by Andy Whitfield (unfortunately he died of cancer after the first season, and was replaced by another actor in the following season). Yet, even if most of the cast is great, the best performance to me is by John Hannah as the devious Batiatus, the owner of the Gladiator's school. Hannah, whose background has been mostly on British comedies, excels here. While he initially seems to lack the toughness one supposes a master of a gladiator's school should have, he is eventually seen as a charming yet also very cruel and cunning man. Also remarkable are the performances of Manu Bennett as the knucklehead (but eventually noble) gladiator Crixus, Viva Bianca as the gorgeous but scheming Ilythia, and Nick Tarabay as Batiatus slimy aide, Ashur.",

            "review_title": "The slaves trembled the Rome",
            "content": "When Spartacus wisely captured Tiberius and ordered the Romans to gladiatorially fight to tribute to Chris, the roles of the slaves and Romans were switched. The slaves became spectators in the simple improvised gladiatorial arena, invigorated by the blood of their enemies, while the Romans became gladiators and were slain by the slaves. This is however an exhilarating silhouette, but not the end of the story.It was a tragic story of slaves who fought in the face of their fated end, knowing that they could not do it. The Spartacus Revolt, which took place at the end of the Roman Republic, was the largest of the three slave wars in ancient Rome. More importantly, unlike the first two slave wars, which took place in Sicily, this time the revolt hit Rome itself hard. The entire war lasted three years, and the insurgent army may have exceeded 300,000 men at its peak. However, the insurgents had limited fighting power and cohesion, and many of them were old, weak, women and children.Amidst the violence and sexual spectacle, what sustained the entire story was the strong spiritual power of the slaves. These slaves dared to rebel against their masters and against Rome. The skills they developed to survive became their most powerful weapon. They fought in blood, and they were the first to defeat the Roman legions, making Rome tremble. Even at the last moment, they never retreated in the face of the fully-equipped Roman elite like dark clouds. For them, it was better to fall by the sword than to die by the whip of the master.The gladiatorial arena of ancient Rome was lofty, but it was built on the blood of slaves. The life of the nobles was rotten, and their playfulness and competition for fame and fortune were all at the expense of the slaves. The gladiators were flesh and blood, and their lives unfolded in blood and sand, licking blood from the tips of swords, but their lives were like grass. When the dignity of gladiators and slaves was trampled, love was deprived, and survival was not guaranteed, Spartacus, the former prayer for rain, started a wave of rebellion, for love, freedom, revenge, and liquidation to the Romans.Sadly, it was ultimately a haphazard and rabble-rousing group. As the leaders of the revolt, Spartacus and the others did not share the same motive. Gannicus was the only free gladiator, after the death of Oenomaus, he replaced his best friend on the path of the Avengers. However, although he was courageous, he was more of a wanderer in the queue, unable to bring more cohesion. Chris was the second in command in the team. After Nivea was sold away and he was poisoned, Chris chose to rush out of the training school with Spartacus. After finding Nivea, he trained her as a warrior and spent the rest of his life taking revenge on the Romans, the difference in philosophy led to Chris's departure. Revenge was Chris's mission, but in the face of the absolute strength gap, death was the inevitable end.Spartacus experienced stages of mental state. After being forced to kill Vali, Spartacus was aware of the lie of glory. He found that every fight he had in the gladiatorial arena was only a futile increase in the wealth and interests of the slave owner. When he found out that his wife Sura died at the hands of Batiatus, he chose to pay in blood. In the process of leading the uprising, Spartacus treated the people as Sura with compassion. He did not want to take revenge on the Romans. Instead, he wished to spread the idea of equality and freedom, and fight for the ultimate freedom of the former slaves. Living far from the war to graze horses and sing was he and Sura's unfulfilled wish, and he hoped that others would realize it.The slave-owning class was almost entirely villainous, and their profiles were rich and three-dimensional, their desires and struggles portrayed in detail. If it were not for the never-ending greed of the slave owners, the slaves would not have met their end and would not have embarked on the path of revenge. The day of reckoning finally came, the world ushered in the baptism of blood, Spartacus, at the cost of their lives, ushered in freedom for some of the slaves, so that the slave owners were forced to improve the living conditions of the slaves. More importantly, Spartacus brought the belief in the pursuit of freedom to the people. They no longer fought for the slave owners, nor for the gods, but for themselves. They chose to live their own way.Finally, I want to discuss about the love in the play. Whether in the gladiatorial arena or the real battlefield, love was the most tender comfort in the battle where life was repeatedly threatened. Tough guy Chris's consistent love for Nivea was enviable. He kept his promise to Nivea, rescuing her from the mines and accompanying her to repair herself by taking revenge on her enemies. Though important than life, Spartacus' Sura was more of a symbol to him in the viewer's eyes. In the second season, Mira's support for Spartacus was more heartwarming. Mira's role in the insurgent army was indispensable, she was a female warrior, always cloak and dagger. Saxa was also a beautiful and tough character like Mira, but Saxa's emotional attitude was more dashing than Mira. Even if Gannicus found someone else, she was still a beautiful and strong female general, and also found her own happiness.",

It is not a soup opera and if you are one of those people that got excited by a show like CAPRICA skip this one.This show makes your hart race. The first episode is the weakest, but by episode 4 which i just saw i am swearing by all the Roman Gods that this is what i was born to watch. It is raw bloody entertainment!This show is so unique, it is in a category with THE WIRE, thought they have noting in common and their uniqueness lies in completely different places, they are bot light years away of what is being made.For a low budget with computer graphics, after the first weaker episode, the show becomes so realistic, by episode 4 it has griped me in its razor sharp clutches and the downward spiral of darkness is leaving bloody marks on my soul!

            "content": "I started watching this very belatedly in early 2019 while waiting for the final season of Game of Thrones. I figured some swords-and-sandals would fit the bill in the meantime.For the first two episodes, that's exactly what I got. Nothing special; a lot of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and colourful baroque mock-Shakespearean dialogue so over-the-top that I couldn't tell whether the acting was good or not. However, I had seen John Hannah (Batiatus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) in other things before, so I stuck with it.And damn, did the show hook me quickly after that. Yes, the dialogue is absurd and nobody ever spoke like that, but the actors deliver it with such unrestrained gusto and are clearly having such a blast making the show that you can't help but get swept up in it. Also, the dialogue has the added virtue of being clever and well-written: for example, there's a scene in the final season (don't worry, no spoilers) in which Marcus Crassus is having a discussion with his son Tiberius and a young Julius Caesar. Crassus is speaking to both of them, and they are answering him -- but Crassus is completely oblivious to the fact that Tiberius and Caesar are simultaneously having their own verbal sparring match against each other, while still advancing their three-way discussion. I rewound that scene a few times just to watch it play out.Gory violence and graphic sex can only sustain a show for so long; fortunately, the characters are beautifully written and developed, and their relationships with each other (romantic or otherwise) are allowed to evolve and progress. By the end of the show I had come to care greatly about the central characters -- and what else could possibly be the mark of well-written characters effectively portrayed?It's the stuff of TV legend by this point that Andy Whitfield, who gave a virtuoso performance as Spartacus in season one, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after filming wrapped, and that it took his life. The switch to his successor Liam McIntyre took a little bit to get used to, but McIntyre stepped into the unenviable position of taking over from a well-liked and tragically departed predecessor in a central role, and made it his own. No small feat, that.In closing, if you're not a fan of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and casual profanity, this show won't be for you. If you're a \"fan\" of those things, watch the show, and you'll be surprised by how quickly they take a back seat to the story and the characters. Enjoy!",

            "content": "Recently finished all 4 seasons of Spartacus.And yet this show grips me so that I've come back multiple times to Wikipedia / YouTube / IMDB & other sites to either read about this show or Andy or any of the other lead actors or even Spartacus himself.I'm sad that it has ended, but extremely happy that I got to experience it.Spartacus can be described in 4 words: Blood & Gore, Sex & Orgies.But besides these words also other strong contenders come to mind: Journey, Growth, Brotherhood, Honor, Respect.The drama part of the show was also top tier. Plot twists upon plot twists.The way the show was shot is just genius. The action takes place only in a few set locations, yet they really didn't need many different locations to shoot it. The Ludus of Batiatus really feels like a real location that exists.Now it will be nearly impossible to not see the actors as their roles:\nJohn Hannah as Batiatus.Peter Mensah as Doctore\nManu Bennett as Crixus\nNick E. Tarabay as Ashur\nViva Bianca as Ilithyia\nKatrina Law as Mira\nLucy Lawless as Lucretia& the many others. They all did such an amazing job. They look like the characters they're supposed to be and they feel like them too.The first 3 episodes of the show are a bit weaker as it seems that the graphics guys were also learning their craft while making the show. If you can get past them, then you're in for a masterpiece.Plus\nEpisode 9 - contains one of my all time favorite sciences from any TV show / movie that I have ever seen.Specifically this part: 40:20 - ~44:00 - Everything is perfect in these scenes. The pacing, the music chosen, the act being committed and the plot twist at the very end of the segment.",

            "review_title": "Vengeance S2 Review",
            "content": "Review By Kamal KThe death of Batiatus (John Hannah) at the end of Spartacus: Blood and Sand left some big shoes to fill as Spartacus: Vengeance began. Glaber (Craig Parker), who was the reason Spartacus (Liam McIntyre) was in this mess in the first place, stepped to the forefront as the primary antagonist this season - tasked with stopping the slave rebellion before it can gain any real moment. With all that going for him, it was a bit surprising to see Glaber start out as a bit off a \"softie\" at the beginning of the season. That isn't to say he couldn't handle himself in a sword fight or command an army, but when it came to the subterfuge and scheming that Capua is rife with, Glaber was always one step behind.Even Glaber's search for Spartacus was challenged by a young rival with a thirst for power. Seppius (Tom Hobbs), while not that interesting himself, spurred Glaber's frustrations in his hunt for Spartacus. That coupled with Illithyia (Viva Bianca) plotting to abort Glaber's unborn child and marry another Praetor actually had me feeling sorry for the very man who enslaved Spartacus.However, as Glaber started to put the pieces of the puzzle together, he grew wise to his wife's plot and everything became clear. A lot of work went into making Glaber look like the fool in order to deliver his unsettling transformation in \"Libertus\" and it was well worth it. Glaber, who finally had enough of everyone working against him, took matters quite literally into his own hands by murdering Illithyia's father, crushing his wife's scheme to marry Varinius (Brett Tucker).The fallout from \"Libertus\" delivered a changed man. The very next episode had Glaber eliminating his chief competition, Seppius, in a brutal blood bath. While Glaber had tasted blood in battle, I get the impression that cold blooded murder was new to him, and he kind of liked the power it gave him. It was obvious he was hungry for more. As frustrating as it was to watch Glaber the softie in the first half of the season, it was quite fulfilling to see him take charge of his life in the second half. He walked with a bit of swagger and an \"I don't give a s**t\" attitude that made him a lot more exciting to watch. Glaber quickly evolved into a villain I loved to hate and a worthy successor to Batiatus as the show's chief antagonist.With Glaber going through a metamorphosis throughout the season, it was left to some other characters to continue the tradition of scheming and subterfuge. Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), Ilithyia and Ashur (Nick Tarabay) were three familiar faces from Season 1 who continued to have a very important impact now that Spartacus had rebelled.The fact that Lucretia was still alive wasn't just shocking to many viewers who thought she was dead at the end of Blood and Sand - Onscreen, most of the citizens of Capua attributed her continued existence as a miracle from the gods. It's an interesting concept as religion hasn't played much of a part in the Spartacus series thus far. What's amusing is that it was obvious that none of the lead characters actually think it was the gods who brought her back. Glaber was just humoring her apparent beliefs while she was useful to him. Ashur knew the gods played no part in saving her life since it was his doing. As for Lucretia, I think the animal sacrifice was just a show to make it appear she was a changed womanThe relationship that developed between these two was, for the lack of a better word, strange. At times I genuinely got the impression that Lucretia and Ilithyia cared for each other. They share an intimacy and understanding that is unique and they both know that. Yet their thirst for power, their jealousy, and a certain amount of madness had them constantly working against each other. It's almost as if neither one was content with just being happy. Or they were so concerned that the other is scheming against them that they feel the need to preemptively retaliate. It was a continually entertaining game they played but I'm glad their story met some sort of resolution by season's end.What a great character Ashur is. He continued to be every bit as good in Vengeance as he was in Blood and Sand. Ashur learned his brand of scheming from Batiatus. He sits back and watches everyone else work against each other, then picks and chooses his moment to whisper in someone's ear and watches the pieces fall where they may.There were a few new characters on the Roman side of things who left a lot to be desired. Both Seppia and Seppius were introduced early on but provided little in the way of entertainment. Seppius was an obstacle for Glaber to overcome but hardly developed as a character in his own right. He was a nuisance and Glaber's real competitor, Varinius, could have played double duty in that role.Needless to say, Liam McIntyre had a daunting task to carry out this season. While he didn't make quite the impact in the role of Spartacus as Andy Whitfield did in Blood and Sand, he still did an admirable job in the role. He never felt out of place and quickly made the character his own. He succeeded in conveying every rousing speech and every heartbreaking setback. It was good to see McIntyre maintain good chemistry with characters already established as close to Spartacus like Crixus (Manu Bennett), Mira (Katrina Law) and Oenomaus (Peter Menash). McIntyre was a great bit of casting in a very tough situation. He did the role of Spartacus justice.Both Spartacus and Glaber's respective groups work through their inner conflicts, they butt heads at the end of the season in what was a truly spectacular finish, filled with all the blood, violence and spectacle that you would expect from a Spartacus finale, forever changing the face of the series. While the season has its ups and downs, the finale packs a punch that won't easily be forgotten.",

He is eventually purchased by Batiatus (John Hannah) as he is thrown into the world gladiators. The house of Batiatus is full of intrigue led in part by his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless). He would rebel and bring Rome to the brink.It's a Starz production. It's blood splattering gore. It's full on sexuality. The violence is over the top. The fights are slow motion poetry. The story is human depravity at its finest. The show took a look at any restrictions and laughed at its face. The first season ends with the breakout of the House of Batiatus. Andy Whitfield was Spartacus. However he got sick, and the show next did a six-part prequel without Whitfield. When he died, the show continues with Liam McIntyre as Spartacus.If this was a simple exploitation fare, I wouldn't rate it so high. The story is just so fun. John Hannah and Lucy Lawless really have a lot of fun playing the devious duo. The twists and turns come fast and furious. It's like an earlier 'Game of Thrones' with more nudity.

            "content": "For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I'm glad I didn't do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as \"gore and sex\" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can't say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the \"bad guys\" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in \"Rome\". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it's not the gore or sex that make it so.In 300, Rome and even Gladiator, to which Spartacus: Blood and Sand is usually compared, the main characters are free men and women, people who act on their generally free will(yes, even in Gladiator). This show is different. Spartacus: Blood and Sand displays the Roman world through the eyes of the downtrodden, the helpless and the people without rights - the enslaved, THE underdogs, who eventually tried to defy the might of Rome, who lost and lost in an epic and tragic way and in their fall still achieved greatness and immortality. Among the nudity, spilling blood and duel sequences, Spartacus: Blood and Sand shows the viewer why freedom is such a cherished thing, what happens when we lose it and why people throughout time have risen to regain it and died pursuing it or defending it. Some people mock the characters for being \"one-dimensional\" and demand more complexity. Others have voiced their contempt of the less than accurate representation of \"the complex social system of Rome\". Spartacus: Blood and Sand does not seek to represent the social system. For the people at the bottom of the ladder it was irrelevant whether Sulla was killing senators or Pompeus was gaining power. As for the one-dimensional characters, let me pound the obvious and say this - when you have to kill a friend at the command of your master, or be killed as well, there's no possibility for inner struggle or soul searching. You can't really disobey your master when humiliation, rape, torture and death lie just a whim away.It's early to say definitely whether Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be a great TV show. It certainly is for now and gets better and better. Unless the creators manage to screw up gigantically, which they have avoided so far, this child of Starz can become epic.",

The series is inspired by the story of the gladiator Spartacus, who led the gladiators rebellion and who died in their last stand in southern Italy. Although there are numerous facts about his deeds there is nothing about the man himself. Even the notion that he was from Thrace isn't a fact. The 2 inspiration points for the series are clearly \"Gladiator\", for the concept, a man fighting for something and using the crowd of the arena to achieve his goal, and \"300\" for the special effects.

            "review_title": "Season 1 Review",
            "content": "Review By Kamal KThe greatest strength of Spartacus: Blood and Sand, is in its intricate storytelling. The first three or four episodes work to introduce us to the hellish world of the gladiator; giving us a very straightforward rundown of the key players and their ambitions. Soon after, the stories shift into a complex stratagem of ruthless, power hungry Romans whose duplicity is only outweighed by their lust for power.From about \"Delicate Things\" onward, it's almost as if these vile, deceitful (yet utterly fantastic!) characters are continuously trying to top their scheming from the prior episode. For example, in \"Old Wounds\" Batiatus hatches a plan to frame one of his competitors for a murder. Batiatus' machinations are reminiscent of something lifted from a Mission: Impossible episode. The entire season is filled with these brilliantly hatched schemes.While Spartacus may be the title character, he shares the spotlight equally with many of the supporting cast. The story of Crixus (Manu Bennett), the Champion of Capua, takes center stage in the early half of the season as his sexual relationship with Lucretia (Lucy Lawless) is brought to the forefront. Crixus, who initially comes off as a brutish, mindless slave, proves to be anything but. We discover a conflicted man who lives for the glory of the fight yet is clearly missing something in his life. His relationship with Lucretia brings him little comfort and he soon discovers the love of one of her handmaidens.Some of the other gladiators are given their moment to shine as well. Varro's (Jai Courtney) story is compelling but at times under developed. Doctore (Peter Menash), Barca (Antonio Te Maioha) and the German brothers Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel) and Duro (Ande Cunningham) all find themselves in the spotlight at one point or another as well. Their fascinating stories are interwoven into Spartacus' quest to find his wife and eventually find his freedomWithout giving anything away, keep an eye out for Nick Tarabay as Ashur. This character nearly stole the show out from under the entire cast. He's a fantastic addition to the story who will keep on your toes for the entire season.Superb in every way, especially the amazing finale. The series started slowly, like a conjuring trick full of misdirection, and sped up to a ridiculous velocity by the end. I cannot wait for the second season. Absolutely gripping stuff indeed.",

            "review_title": "Some good some not so ...",
            "content": "I felt skeptical about the upcoming series when I first saw the trailers but thought; maybe it will be better ... the voice-overs did promise greater things. However, from the first episode I felt real disappointment. Rather than being more realistic it's more Hollywood. Yes, it does offer graphic violence - more on that later - and full frontal nudity but it falls short in a number of other areas. But first let me digress to some of the other points: By far the best performance I've enjoyed in this offering is that of John Hannah as Batiatus. His consummate skill as an actor leaves me feeling he deserves more success. His significant other is Lucy Lawless as Lucretia. She is well cast and certainly entertains and keeps up with Hannah. She's beautiful and shows it and comes through feeling like there's a nice bit of underlying intelligence I'd like to know better. One of the most fun characters is Viva Bianca as Ilithyia. She plays the part with a kind of delicious wickedness that's absent malice. She is also quite something special to look at, especially disrobed; which brings us to the male flesh offerings. Andy Whitfield as the title character Spartacus does a credible job but I can't overcome the idea he's in the part because someone in Hollywood thought he'd just look good. His antagonist in much of the episodes I saw is Manu Bennett as the gladiator Crixus and Peter Mensah as Doctore; a sort of gladiator teacher/overseer. Whitfield and Bennett snarl at each other appropriately and put up with full body depilation as their major sacrifice for their art.The costumes, makeup, sets, and other production are rendered with quality if not historic accuracy. Without researching the issue, I find it hard to swallow the prevalence of depilation. It just doesn't ring true to what I recall from studying ancient history. The ancients were rather proud of their body hair as proof of their maturity and not even females shaved anywhere; none of that is evident here. But I suppose it's a minor point but I just felt that it flew in the face of the claims that they were striving for more historic accuracy. That gets us to the gritty parts, the violence, nudity and sex. The violence depicted here is over-the-top Hollywood all the way. The copious amounts of arterial blood that appear at the slightest wounds just smacks of sensationalist violence rather than accuracy. That - the violence - is a subject I know all too much about. Even severing an artery doesn't produce that much blood that fast. The sort of violence in the real world also produces a good deal more gore; not to mention that none of the film makers can ever hope to duplicate the accompanying odors. Worse, to me, by far is the fact that the bloodiest parts seem to be uniformly rendered in slow motion; thereby seeming to emphasize the bloodiest violence as the most important part of the offering. This aspect disappointed me the most.The nudity and sex are more realistic than likely anything that has been presented by the modern media thus far, but it still falls far short of the reality of those times. Nudity then was a lot more prevalent, a lot more common and a lot more matter-of-fact.I found it curious that the violence is far more emphasized that any other part of the equation; even the nudity and sex. I had the certain thought that if the sex were given an emphasis equal to that of the violence then we'd be treated to full screen sized vaginas opening in slow motion. It all left me feeling that the sad fact is that violence - even the most brutal types of depictions - are still far more socially acceptable than the relatively calm and peaceful pursuits involving nudity and sex. That still feels like an indictment against modern society. At least the ancients were more-or-less uniformly and honestly depraved. If I watch the remainder of the series it will more than likely be to enjoy the non-violent performances of Hannah, Lawless and Bianca. They are the best of it.",

            "content": "Overall all the four series are visually stunning. The show was meant to have a graphic novel look. The stunt co-ordination is outstanding. Costumes are magnificent. The score is beautiful. The acting on this show is stellar. The actors gave it their all. Unafraid to show raw emotions, and yet be capable of subtle expressions as well. The writing, well my rating says it all, very impressive. The linguistics on the show has a subtle modern-English quality that flows easily, is accessible to everyone, and gives it an historical flavor. The show encompasses plenty of gender role reversals situations. Gay relationships are not seen as a big deal. Indeed completely normal, and beautiful as shown with Agron and Nasir. FYI: the sex scenes(not rape scenes) on this show are smokin hot! Sensual. Well done. I've seen people call this show nothing but pornography. Makes me wonder if they've ever seen a porn flick? I say no they haven't. But if I'm wrong and they have, and still see this is porn, take it as an alert of their low-brow personality no matter how superior they try and sound. Once those words break, the cat's out of the bag, run for the hills and find better friends. PORN IS ONLY ABOUT SEX. They aren't even well done to begin with! Not hot. Not sensual! It's only about the next sex scene....and the next sex scene....and the next sex scene...... etc. with bad everything else. THIS SHOW IS ABOUT THE STORY-LINES, with stellar acting and top-notch everything else. Can you see the difference now? If not I feel sorry for your brain that it's so hard for you to tell. Well not really, but I'm amused at people's stupidity.>>>>>>>>>>>>>Spartacus Blood and SandThe writing first season was a thing of beauty. Filled with richly weaved plots and intrigue. There are shocking and surprising, moments which make you want stand up and cheer because of how damn good it feels to be stunned and wowed! Andy Whitfield doesn't have many lines, but he has this way of expressing his feelings and emotions with eyes and facial expressions. Lucy Lawless and John Hannah stole the show as Lucretia and Batiatus. They are the best characters in season one. Their ambitions drives them to do outrageous terrible things. Yet they are utterly devoted to one another.These two characters are multilayered with emotions, and you see that they aren't necessary as evil as one may think. It's a testament of stellar acting to get across the screen to the viewers villainous characters that do despicable things, and yet the audience, though they don't excuse them, empathize with them, and even love them. There is a built up of all the plots which explodes into a powerful season finale. 10/10>>>>>>>>>>>>> Spartacus VengeanceIn Vengeance two new actors came in. Liam McIntyre as Spartacus. Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naevia. A little jarring at first, but after a while I got use to them. They did a respectable job holding up the integrity of the characters that were played by different actors in season one. There are some plots holes, and well frankly I had to suspend my disbelief at times because there were some unbelievable things taking place, or characters doing dumb things. Spartacus speeches were necessary I suppose, but after a ga-billion of them, it got tiring. The running around the woods scenes, bored me too tears. There were rape scenes(implied one scene) of the same character 3 episodes straight. What a turn-off that was! Even offensive! Lucy Lawless does an impeccable job playing mad Lucretia, switching from crazy to lucid with complete ease. You never know for sure if she's really crazy or just pretending. The season builds up to a climax with all story lines and characters coming full circle in the season finale, save for the war itself. 7/10>>>>>>>>>>>>> Spartacus War of the Damned In War of the Damned, the richly woven writing from season one and the prequel is back. Liam McIntyre really comes into his own playing Spartacus. Watching him strategize against Crassus kept me glued to the television. There were some other story lines I wasn't too crazy about, such as Gannicus falling for his hero worshipping stalker, Sibyl. The powerful Romans appearing bumbling in their formations was not believable. There are once again some shocking, even disturbing moments. The show culminates into a final battle that is both sad and touchingly beautiful. 9/10>>>>>>>>>>>>> GOTA has a different IMDb, but I gave it a 10. My last thoughts are that of Andy Whitfield. I think the series honoured the legacy that he left behind with his brilliant performance in season one. Kudos all the way around!8.6 average which I rounded up to 9/10",

No, it is NOT a storyless show.To get it out of the way: If you can't stand a naked breast; skip this one. I know how some people are very sensitive to naked skin, but I guess a chopped off head is OK? (Yes, I'm kicking your way you \"Oh, that's Janet Jacksons covered up breast on live TV. I have to call the TV network\"-people).Each episode added a new layer as I see it. The characters grow in dept, and the conspiracies grow ever more entangling. I always wanted to see more after the second episode. The show exploded! For a show like this to even work the producers had to make a choice between kiddy-TV and adult TV. They chose the latter and hit the damn spot. Spartacus Blood and sand is one of the few shows that is just for us \"big kids\". I don't care if people are naked or headless on TV, as long as it suits the show. In this case it had not worked without it. Praise the gods that someone had the guts to think past the double morals of todays television and just press on! Rome was no flower-covered heaven on earth.The acting can seem stale at first, but each actor grows in their role as the show progresses. A few of them impressed me, as I had deemed them to be c-graded actors a long time ago (Xena, anyone?). Some of the stars of this show seem to have found a show that suited them as much as they suited the roles they had to fill.To avoid spoilers I will not say much about the story. What I can say is: The story evolves at the same rate as the actors/characters. Nearing the end you will beg for more! It's hard even to catch your breath after what I have just seen: The last episode offers the greatest form of chatarsis I have ever witnessed/felt in a TV show.I will root for Spartacus in season 2 (and 3, and 4).Sorry about the spelling errors and such.",

            "content": "I've been looking very forward to the Starz original series \"Spartacus: Blood and Sand.\" And I'm happy to say that if you were looking forward to it, you're in for a wild ride.They tell you right in the front of this show that this is meant to be an intense depiction of Rome. And it is to a certain point. There is definitely a ton of blood, language, and sexuality (one of the female characters is fully naked), but it is all there for a reason and it defines the characters, shows you who they are.Many won't like this the same way they didn't like 300. And I can say that no one will be able to watch this without thinking about 300, and that's the biggest flaw. It has a speed up slow motion and blood flowing everywhere. It is one of the most graphic TV shows I've ever seen.However, if you liked 300 (which I did) and you see the slow motion as a way to rise the intensity and that the graphic violence/sexual content is meant to connect with the characters towards some degree, you will enjoy this show. But it's not only a story full of blood and gore and sex and nudity; it also has a lot of character to it and a lot of substance.Andy Whitfield is brilliant as \"Spartacus.\" He drives the character and makes you feel for him. His acting is perfect. In fact, all the actors are incredible, including Lucy Lawless, Craig Parker, and John Hannah.The battle scenes in this show are outstanding. Again, very bloody, 300 style battles, but still entertaining. The gladiator fights are well shot and very gritty.I know it's television and the visuals aren't always the best, best the visuals in this show are gorgeous. There was one moment where it looked like a video game, but only for a second.it's not only a story full of blood and gore and sex and nudity; it also has a lot of character to it and a lot of substance.So if you like sword and sandal epics and you don't mind gore and nudity, Spartacus: Blood and Sand is the show for you. I personally thought it was a fun, kick ass, macho show, and while it does have a little too much sex and reminds me a lot about 300, it'll definitely keep my attention for the next episode.Spartacus: Blood and Sand airs on Friday at 10 o' clock on Starz.",

What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).As a previous rater stated, the characters have shades of evil and good. Their ethics seems to match what values were imbedded in the roman civilization. The reason there is so much blood and it over indulges is because the show not only explicitly includes sensual dialogue, but the way it is directed and the tactics of capturing violence and glory are not 2D and speak to its sensuality. Bottom line: if you are a passionate person, you will enjoy the dramatic dialogue and poetry, the sexuality, and the brutality.",

            "content": "I have only seen twelve episodes so far. So my review is hardly comprehensive. But based on what I did see, I can say that \"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\" starts badly, but then improves remarkably in episodes #2-6. When I saw the first episode, my impression was that this series was not going to be successful. The first episode was like watching warfare on a computer screen rather than realistic battle scenes for which Braveheart has set the standard. The first episode was also shameless in the way it employed softcore pornography. Add to that the simplistic dialogue and the contrived performances and I came away with the distinct impression that \"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\" was not really about anything in particular, but on the contrary was a vehicle for selling gratuitous violence and sex. But the next eleven episodes influenced me to change that view. They were, to put it succinctly, far more interesting than anything in the first episode. Andy Whitfield seems comfortable in the role of the action hero, Spartacus, and he slowly establishes a connection to his audience. But Andy Whitfield also gets a lot of help from much better actors. Take Peter Mensah, for instance, a hitherto unknown born in Ghana who shines as the gladiator trainer Doctore. Mensah is born to play that role, because his performance and command is nothing short of mesmerizing. My hope is that Mensah gets recognized for the great work he has done here and is given challenging roles to play in other films. Another fascinating performance comes from John Hannah as the charismatic and inspiring head of the Gladiator school Batiatus. What makes John Hannah especially effective is that we (as the audience) do not know what to make of him. Is he good or is he evil or is he both? I will not reveal the answer because the creators of \"Spartacus\" evidently wanted the audience to decide that for themselves. Other great performances come from Lucy Lawless as Batiatus's wife Lucretia who possesses a diverse motley of personality traits; Nick Tarabay as the amoral cripple Ashur who likes to place wagers on which gladiator will win in the arena and can supply inmates with anything (as long as they give him a portion of their winnings in return); and Manu Bennett who is subtly effective as Crixus, a gladiator who is more complex than his mucho persona in the beginning suggests and may even have a grudging respect for his rival Spartacus.But the other strength of this series has to be the plot. The plot started out badly in the first episode, but since then the writers did a really good job in developing a narrative. You can tell that they had as much fun writing the script as the actors on screen had in performing this material. There is so much creativity involved in developing the different plot twists, in developing the characters so that they evolve instead of remain static (which is what happens in so many action films), and finally in setting just the right pace for the tension to escalate (which is something that directors and writers can easily get wrong, as they did with the last two seasons of Dexter and the second season of True Blood). In short, Spartacus is a must-see.",

We all know the story - the enslaved Thracian (from the lands where the country Bulgaria is right now), who fought his way trough the arenas of Rome and eventually lead a army of followers against Rome. How he died is unknown. We'll see how Starz will show that in a year. They started season 2, probably estimating that Season 1 will be a success.

            "content": "Review By Kamal KSpartacus, the web series revolves around the glory and bravery of a gladiator and tribune of the same name. It portrays the plight of Spartacus under the roman waywardness and his battle to defy his destiny. It has four seasons. The first season displays the life of Spartacus as a free man, his eventual confinement in the stinky life of Ludos as the death of his wife follows. Then it shows his emergence as a gladiator of the arena and successful conspiracy against Batiatis, his master. The Second season 'Vengeance' shows the the rise of Spartacus as a tribune and joining of Ganicus to serve the purpose of Spartacus after which they unitedly defeat Glaber, the sworn enemy of Spartacus. The third season 'War of the damned' portrays the final fight of Spartacus against Marcus Caracius and his (Spartacus) fall. Initially Spartacus was a free man who lived peacefully with his wife in a village called Thrace. But in a battle of survival for the romans against the wildings, he along with his other villagers would agree to serve the Roman's cause. But as the romans would win and their leaders would compel Spartacus and his army to get ready for another war, mutiny would break out in which some of the roman soldiers would die and Spartacus and his men would flee. But however destiny had something else saved for him. After the very night he would return to his wife, the romans would discover both of them. Then the Romans would seize a sleeping Saura(his wife) from his bosom who would get condemned to slavery while Spartacus would face a battle of survival in the arena as a retribution to betray the roman cause. However he would survive and would emerge as gladiator in Batiatis's ludos but his wife would be murdered by his master to rob his valuable Spartacus of the reason of freedom. The tale then went on chronicling the rise of Spartacus along with Crixus, Omnaeus, Ganicus and their eventual fall in the battle against Carracius.The series precisely and boldly describes an atrocious and remorseless roman empire and the tragedy and helplessness of the poor under its shadow. Moreover, in its aggression, steadiness, display of humiliation of the have-nots the content successfully rouses in audience the thirst for wealthy roman blood. However, in some parts much of violence and nudity spoils the rhythm and flow of the show. These two elements continued to be integral parts of every episode.As far as acting is concerned, Andi Whitfield and Liam Mclutyre both appears to be sharp and deft in the pursuit of Spartacus. Craig Parker also seems very skillful in portraying the fierceness of Glaber. Among others Simon Merrelles as Carracius, John Hannah's performance as Batiatis are also memorable. Hence, keeping aside the violence and nudity of it, the show is undoubtedly a must watch. So if u are a history-lover, watch Spartacus immediately to witness the historical jolt the man brought to the Roman Empire whose foundation was built on the tragedy and blood of umpteen have-nots.",

            "content": "When I first saw the opening episode of Spartacus: Blood and Sand, I found it promising, but I was cautious. With its highly stylised, cartoonish visuals, over-exaggerated violence, splashes of blood and seemingly gratuitous frequent nudity, it was clearly modelled after the movie '300' (which I liked to a certain extent) and after the TV show 'Rome' (another great serial, at least the first season), but it didn't seem very original. But as the series went on I got really hooked. After a couple of episodes Spartacus found its own style and the quality of the writing began to really shine through. Historical accuracy was never the point, and the story itself (Spartacus's relentless quest to reunite with his wife) is spellbinding enough to make up for any minor deviations from what we know of the period.Andy Whitfield is simply mesmerising in the title role (tragically, the young Welsh-born Australian actor died of non-Hodgkin lymphoma before season 2 went into production), but Lucy Lawless, John Hannah, Peter Mensah, Manu Bennett and Viva Bianca give equally strong performances (as do the rest of the cast). The best thing, however, is the script. The plot, the characters, the dialogue \u2013 the whole thing is impeccably and very stylishly written. I have rewatched the series several times since and it never ceases to amaze me.The mini-series Gods of the Arena (a prequel to Blood and Sand) is equally as good (dare I say, even better?), while the closing seasons (Vengeance & War of the Damned) starring Liam McIntyre who replaced the late Andy Whitfield are perhaps a notch below (but repeated viewing makes them better and better).",

There isn't much faults with this season and has a lot of points close to how times were back then. There is lots of sex and violence and the story line is really good. The prequel season is very good as well and shows how the main characters came to power and lots of plotting and double crossing. The final two seasons are quite forgettable, loosely based on historical events but the point Caesar infiltrates the enemy and pretends to be one of them is ridiculous.Highly recommend S1&S2.",

Each season with it's own story to tell with interesting characters and plotlines.Of course this show is about Spartacus and his vengeance towards the Romans, but this show contains so much more. The main characters are not 100% good or % bad. Both the Romans and the slaves are interesting and the series has several great love stories.As mentioned by some others, the first episode is the worst by far. It just gets better and better. Throughout the show there is a lot of violence, blood, nudity and sex. Sometimes maybe to much, but there is so much more. Interesting conversations, plot twists, love, friendship, bonds and betrayal.My personal favorites:\n1. Gannicus - love this character and his storyline. The prequel about Gannicus his time at the ludus is one of the best prequels ever made.\n2. Kore and Marcus Crassus - favorite love story\n3. Batiatus and Lucretia - the bad guys you to still love\n4. Oenomeus - very impressive character\n5. Agron and Nassir - another of my favorite love stories\n6. Spartacus and Marcus Crasus their smart tactics and mutual respect\n7. Andy Whitfield as Spartacus in season 1.Interesting untill the end with an impressive yet heartbreaking final episode",

And the story about Spartacus is well known to everybody I guess. But what a great series this is.What can I say about this series, nothing negative, it's just so great. Maybe the only thing that you can bring to order is the fact that at the last series the final fight wasn't against Crassus but I won't complain, it's done just storywise. The fight on the hill was correct as was the use of bodies by Spartacus to fill the trench. As also the split of Crixus from Spartacus which lead to the death of Crixus in which Spartacus delivered a Roman fight. But what am I bragging about, it's excellent.Not only for the fact that Andy Whitfield as Spartacus had to be replaced by Liam McIntyre due the sickness and death of Andy. He replaced him on a perfect way. And I can say that it never had any boring moment from the start until the end. You can't tell that with every series. The way it was shot with a lot of slo-mo and the use of CGImade it a special experience to watch. The acting was superb by all, it's full of extreme gore and explicit nudity from male and female so many can be shocked to see a cock here and there. Some people had problem by the way they spoke but that didn't bother me. One of his kind and a must see but be warned, some shots are rather gory and there's a lot of sex going on...Gore 3/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 4/5 Story 5/5 Comedy 0/5",

            "content": "Appropriately being played at past 11 o'clock at night, this show could have easily escaped this reviewer's attention, despite its announcement during the day. However, I am glad I did not miss it - and these words come from a man who despises shows. Spartacus has been a drug since the first episode, and proved popular not only with my testosterone filled male friends, but with the females as well.Spartacus has everything that today's public truly desires: violence, sex and a good story, ironically the same things we desired back in the Roman times when the sand was wet with blood in the arenas. And Spartacus is better than other productions that offer the same because Spartacus simply offers ten times more of it. The episodes do not drag on trying to stretch the material beyond its worth, like most other shows do. It is intense. The show warns at the beginning that it is simply violent because it is trying to portray realistically the life in Roman times. Nice excuse, but in true series' fashion I would like to say, \"what a load of @*$%\". The show simply shows what the public wants to be shown, and we thank it for it.The acting and script is brilliant, not without flaws, but nonetheless brilliant. Sometimes the character development is hard to buy; the naked warriors in the snow make you wonder if the show decided to disregard the laws of physics and commons sense, but those flaws are quickly overshadowed by the awesomeness of the acting and the interesting plot twists. The metaphors of the plot are thought-provoking, yet do not require one to turn the brain on to the fullest like some of the productions that try to be deep and artistic rather than simply entertain. We see a few familiar actor names return in this epic journey and they bring it to life marvelously, but the B-folks do their job a well.The visual style of the show borrows much from the blood festival of a movie from 2006 called 300 and, speaking of the blood, it could have been a bit more realistic looking. Nonetheless this fakeness soon becomes a welcome signature style for the rest of the show, which quite frankly overshadows the movie 300 and makes it look like a rip-off from Spartacus.Spartacus is not a horror movie, but the youngest of the youngest probably should not watch this sobering spectacle. Spartacus is not for the older ones either as the violent and sexual filler (the purpose of teenagers' lives) is too great and the story is not of fine flavour, like a good wine, but rather of an overwhelming taste, like a big juicy steak - great for some, but others just can't chew through it.Edit: it seems the website played a prank. This review is NOT for Spartacus Vengeance. It is for the Blood and Sand and the prequel. It looks like someone changed titles. Vengeance is nothing like the first seasons. Extremely cheap and dodgy dialogue. Story convenient and simplistic...Yakh",

            "content": "I have to hand it to the people at Starz and Steven DeKnight Productions for a really top notch TV programme.When you come across so many series that are constrained from letting their writers 'let rip' both from an age restrictive angle and the ever present feeling of 'don't give the viewer too much because we need to string them along to season 4', Spartacus is such a breath of fresh air.It takes no shame in being gloriously adult replete with graphic violence, swearing and nudity. Some could dismiss it as childish but I prefer to think of it as TV for the grown ups.Likewise it is happy to throw in set pieces of a length and quality that other franchises would only leave for the opening or closing episodes. Whereas as many other productions fabricate ridiculous cliff hangers to hoodwink the audience into having to tune in next time, Spartacus gives you a glorious season, that can serve as a stand alone if the plug is pulled and doesn't leave you feeling cheated by the end.Whilst other shows give you a main course but then hold off the dessert to entice you to tune in for the next season, Spartacus is happy to offer you a filling and nourishing full meal, safe & confident in the knowledge that you'll return next time not because you've been duped or forced but simply because you want to enjoy a similar experience.When the 'drawn out' format of so many recent series is becoming so apparent, you have to take your hat off to the confidence and bravery of the makers.And as for the actual series, well I'm sure it's easy to dismiss it all as a 300 style clone with slo mo violence and swirling Roman capes but it is so much more than that. Characters are given the chance to develop and flourish. You genuinely feel connections being made and that you aren't just receiving some kind of surface gloss.Likewise the writing is bold and confident and there has been many a time where you'd be outraged at the actions of a character, vocalise your response as a viewer and then amazingly a character on screen would express a similar sentiment/reaction.Characters are killed off to generate a sense of peril that people do die and hence not feel that every fight is a one sided affair and when they do go down they are given the room to do so rather than being a rushed affair.Despite the obvious budgetary restrictions when placed against a movie, Spartacus still rocks in the look, feel and invention of the moves and set pieces. Maybe they use the slow motion effect a little too often but that really is a small grumble compared to just how entertaining and enjoyable this is.Some shows, such as the Walking Dead, start with an enjoyable premise but then descend into tedious, soap opera melodrama. Others such as Hawaii Five O or The Mentalist attempt to tell an arc but have to keep including filler episodes to placate the casual, 'I've tuned in to see a forensic criminal case' crowd.I'm impressed with the makers for not dropping the ball when Andy Whitfield (the guy who played Spartacus) got cancer, for doing everything they could to hold off the production of the 2nd series to allow him to recover and producing a prologue series (Gods of the Arena) which was equally entertaining, and then maintaining the quality in their selection of Liam McIntyre to replace Andy when it was obvious he couldn't continue and unfortunately passed away.There are few series that manage to stand head and shoulders above the competition but for me Spartacus belongs in the pantheon of greatness along with some other distinguished favourites of mine such as Jericho, Angel, Quantum Leap and Babylon 5.",

Since the popularity of 300, Spartacus was remade as a terrible movie and now as this joke of a series. The characters are absolutely ridiculous, the script is terrible, the look is a ripoff of 300, and the acting is sub par. It is hilarious to see people running around in snow with just a loin cloth upon them, when you know no one would be able to suffer that cold. It is a joke to see a warrior and his wife flee a destroyed village and stop to have a sexual encounter, when in reality he would have been on alert all night long watching for the enemy. This series is awful, uninspired, poor made, all hoping to gain momentum from ripping off 300 and the upcoming Clash of the Titans. The use of the name Spartacus is to add something familiar to draw the crowd, since nothing is accurate about the legend of Spartacus in this garbage.",

Spartacus, Crixus and Gannicus just to name a few were all excellent characters and I rooted for them all the way through.I was so emotionally invested in this series and some scenes were so good I applauded. Spartacus was a true warrior in history and a show to be made to honour his skill in this way makes Spartacus in my top 5 shows of all time.There was lots of computerised blood which was clearly fake but I really liked that about the show. There was also many scenes that looked very real. If constant nudity, sex, foul languages and a lot of blood isn't for you then don't bother with this show. If it is, then this show is for YOU!!!!At the end of the day I understand why people might not rate it as highly as me because they are very picky. I never judge a show entirely on cinematography even though it's very important but I judge a show on how is makes me feel and Spartacus gave me so many emotions. I never give anything a 10/10 but if a 9.5 was an option I would give it that.One last thing. After season one the actor who played Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) was sadly battling with cancer so instead of making season two they decided to make 'Gods of the Arena' in hope of Whitfields return for in the future to start making season two. Unfortunately Andy lost his battle with cancer and died on the 11th of September 2011. Liam McIntyre was brought in to play Spartacus for season two and I have to say, he also done an incredible job. I didn't think it was possible to match Andy's performance in season one but he definitely did. Fans should be lucky to have two great actors playing the great Spartacus and should not be put off despite the change in actor.\nR.I.P Andy Whitfield",

There's a lot of blood but the effect is cool and it gives the show that graphic novel quality that we've enjoyed recently in films such as 300. Andy Whitfield plays a very raw and passionate Spartacus. Definitely not a show for the faint of heart or those who are easily offended by blood, sex or violence. Should we really expect less given that Roman Empire of that time was brutal? Folks looking for a history lesson need to tune in to the History Channel. This show is intended to be entertaining not a documentary so if it is historical fact you are looking for you're best to keep moving.

            "content": "At the time when the 1st season was airing I hadn't really ever followed or watched a show series in it's entirety before. I've since watched, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Dexter, 6 Feet Under and I totally loved everyone of those shows... but I possibly even put Spartacus above all those amazing shows. I don't have an affinity towards ancient Rome or ancient Rome themed movies, didn't like 300, but this show was just awesome. The 1st season in particular was amazing... you just have to get through the pilot (the pilot is the weakest episode of the season). A friend of mine had watched the first couple episodes and stopped watching until I told him how amazing the show was, so he went back and watched it and he agreed. A lot of people who would love this show missed out on it as a result of their knee jerk reaction. Trying to copy 300 (which it's nothing like aside from the era). The other initial reaction is, it's whoring out blood/violence/nudity to attract attention, which is a misunderstanding of the shows actual intent.The over the top gore and nudity is hard to explain. It's done in such a way to where it's corny, but the show knows it's being corny about it, if that makes any sense? During battles in the arena they'll pan into the stands and the women will be ripping their clothes off....it's actually really funny. I'm not a violence or gore guy, but the gore is so over the top that I laugh and cheer it on, rather then being grossed out and disturbed by it... actually I take that back, there are plenty of disturbing scenes. I attribute being immune by disturbing scenes, turn of events possibly as a result of this show. Whether that be Game of Thrones or whatever. Everyone will be trippin balls over a \"so called\" disturbing episode and I'll be completely immune to it.... Seriously? That was a big deal for everyone else?\nAnyways, the last episode of the 1st season \"Kill Them All\" is sooo beyond epic!The CGI is another thing that's kind of misunderstood. It's done with the purpose of being exaggerated as well (like the nudity). The blood almost looks as though it's 3D, actually a lot of the Arena scenes have a cool 3D feel to it.The first half of the 2nd season takes a little endurance to get through. It's a combination of getting used to a new actor playing Spartacus and being outside of the arena, which is just a much more challenging premise to write on. Unfortunately Andy Whitefield was irreplaceable, which everyone knew and accepted. In the 3rd season the new Spartacus Liam Mcintyre begins to find his foothold. The 3rd season also overcomes the difficult premise challenge of the 2nd season and surprisingly does extremely well. I actually wasn't very excited going into the 3rd season, but man was I wrong.The 5 episode mini series is excellent as well and on par with the first season. Definitely watch that after the first season, it builds several characters necessary for the rest of the series.",

None of the characters is sympathetic enough for one to root for them, Spartacus for example is too stoic for his own good. Curiously, the most interesting character is not Spartacus, but the scheming Batiatus, without him the SB&S would be nothing more than a soft-core porn video about old Rome. SB&S will appeal to juvenile audience, more interested in boobs, butts, blood and gore than a good story.",

He passed away in 2011, not without leaving impression, as an actor but also as a commentator (you can listen to him on audio commentaries).Another actress did not return later on (I won't spoil the character name or her real name), because of payment issues. Her replacement (while as beautiful) wasn't up to the task either. One special mention has to be Erin Cummings. While I had seen her in other stuff (like Bitch Slap), I have never seen her as beautiful as in this show. Which makes some decisions you see and let's a running story line in the series, very believable.But enough about the actors, though they are beautiful and have their moments! That is down to some fine actors (Hannah and others) and some very fine writing (though it is of a very mature nature obviously). There is Blood and there is nudity! Obviously the sexual themes might be a problem for some, but there are far more explicit shows and I'm pretty sure it isn't the main thing why most people watch. It's the fact, they don't shy away from things of that nature.Remember one thing when you start watching this: First comes Season 1, than you have to watch the prequel series (Gods of the Arena) and then Season 2 and 3.",

Captured by Glaber , Spartacus (Andrew Whitfield who sadly deceased , being replaced by Liam McIntyre) is condemned to death as a Gladiator , whilst his spouse Sura (Erin Cummins) is condemned to slavery . Thracian slave Spartacus gets a new lease on life when he is taken by the owner of a Roman gladiator school named Battiatus (John Hanna) married to ambitious Lucretia (Lucy Lawless) . Brought back to Capua in a gladiator's school , he becomes a notorious gladiator along with Crixus (Manu Bennet) . Meantime , Spartacus falls in love with a gorgeous slave (Katrina Law) . Sentenced to spend out the rest of his adult life laboring in the harsh Gladiator school and moved by vengeance , Spartacus leads a slave uprising which threatens Rome's status quo . This is a new version about the true story of gladiator Spartacus , formerly adapted by Kubrick in a famed masterpiece . Spartacus escapes and stirs up all gladiators and slaves in a revolt (73 B.C.) against the power of Rome .This is a violently graphic and strong retelling about the greatest gladiator of all time . Impressive epic version about Spartacus' existence with exciting drama and overwhelming combats , Spartacus history is imaginatively brought to life on breathtaking images with great production values and outstanding scenarios . Sword cross , intense drama , nudism , sexual scenes , gladiator fights abound in this spellbinding adaptation on audacious Spartacus' life , one of the most rebels in the history . Magnificent climatic battle scenes and fights on arena including lots of blood and gore ; and adding colorful computer generator images . Although redundant to original movie , it is a \u00a8Sui Generis\u00a8 description of Spartacus character , however it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence . It's all immensely epic , though predictable, as we have seen the former classic movie , but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic performances of excellent starring , including flawless portrayals and all around for the best talent available . This TV series was well starred by Andy Whitfield , however he announced that he would not be able to appear in the second season because he had been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and was pursuing aggressive medical treatment , then the Australian actor Liam McIntyre had been chosen to replace Whitfield as Spartacus ; in September 2011, Whitfield died at the age of 39 . Other important characters are : Doctore excellently played by Peter Mensah , the astute nasty gladiator Nick Tabaray , the violent Crixus/Manu Bennet , the intriguing Glaber's wife performed by Viva Bianca , and Jai Courtney as Varro , in fact Andy Whitfield stated numerous times that the reason his on screen friendship with felt genuine was because they were inseparable on set .The Spartacus life was previously adapted by Riccardo Freda (1952) with Massimo Girotti and Ludmilla Tcherina and following to 'The son of Spartacus'(1962) by Sergio Corbucci with Steve Reeves . Of course the classic and prestigious version by Stanley Kubrick with Kirk Douglas , Jean Simmons , Tony Curtis , Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton .

Each character has their own motives and deceptions, and the plot twists are piled on so thick you never really know whats going to happen next. The story of Spartacus (which is based on an incredible true story) starts out from very humble beginnings, and grows until Spartacus is not only a God of the Arena; he also becomes the most feared enemy in all of Rome. He is betrayed countless times, and the viewer is made to really feel his pain and eventually want blood and vengeance just as much as he does. After the first season's huge success, the show and its fans suffered a very tragic loss in the untimely death of Andy Whitfield. I didn't think the show could go on, since Andy played Spartacus so masterfully that any other actor would pale in comparison. But Liam McIntyre came into the 2nd season and did a very admirable job. Both seasons (and Spartacus: Gods of the Arena) were very well written and acted, and I can't wait to see the final season- Spartacus: War of the Damned",

Well, it hasn't.The acting is strictly average, with some highs, and a lot of lows. Hannah and Lawless do passable jobs, they are veteran actors after all. A few others also hold their own (Varro, Doctore), but the rest is just plain abysmal. The acting of the main actor makes me want to cry at times, i really find it that bad.The series is filmed with a minimal set, using mostly CGI (i swear 90 percent of the scenes could have been shot in someones backyard). That is not initially a problem, but when the CGI is bad, then it becomes a problem. And when its bad not because their graphical artists suck, but because the director wants it to look bad, it becomes ridiculous.The fighting scenes is very similar to the movie 300, with slowdown shots, flying limbs, buckets of CGI blood, etc (there were even some utterly ridiculous \"inside the helmet\" shots in some fight scenes that had me giggling in disbelief.The show also has a monster budget apparently (4.5 mill per episode or thereabouts.. god knows where they put that money, it certainly wasn't in good actors, sets, passable CGI, etc). I've seen 10 year old video games with better and more believable graphics than this :) The progression of the show is basically fight - sex - fight - some stupid plot - fight. They throw boobs at you like you've never seen, not because it fits the setting, but because they can. Im male, and love boobs as much as the next guy, but that was interesting for all of 5 minutes. Its very much like the wet dream of a teenager who just hit puberty, which may say something about who they aim for as their target audience.Its difficult to describe it properly, words simply escape me when i try to express how bad it is. As a series, the only thing it can be compared to is Rome, and while Rome had lots of nudity and fighting, it was always when it was appropriate to the setting. Spartacus does it \"just because\", and tons of it. If one adds movies to the comparison, the natural thing to compare it to would be 300 and Gladiator.It is very similar to 300 in fight progression (but 300 had far superior actors), and it would be a gigantic insult to Gladiator to try to measure Spartacus up against it.So in short, to sum it up, this literally... sucks",

The blood is a bit much, but if you look at this like a soft-core comic book, its really quite fun. They really dig the demented, old school, bloody, gory, GRODY torture on this show, but don't worry -- in between every fight, there seems to be sexual tension and it crosses every line imaginable and everyone gets what they need (wink, wink).

Spartacus role is based on a gladiator who led a revolt among the slaves against the Roman Republic. The days of the gladiators are a fundamental part of Rome's history and it is interesting to watch the days of the gladiators on television. Spartacus is enslaved by the Roman empire and forced to fight in the arena. He organizes now only his freedom, but an army to hopefully destroy Rome. The sadness of the Roman gladiators speaks to my heart and the stark reality that this is all based on true stories. This is how Rome was entertained - by watching horrific battles to the death. Now we have TV and Spartacus is a very entertaining television series without the stark realities that initially lie beneath. This series is filled with blood and violence. The cinematography is amazing and they didn't spare an expense in making this. You'll enjoy each and every episode. - Asif Zamir",

            "content": "This was actually a really entertaining series. Sure, the nudity and violence gets a bit stale after a while and I just wanted to focus on the story later on. But it knew how to incorporate these elements pretty well for the most part, although there is a lot of nudity in this series. Watching this show was like watching a more developed version of \"Gladiator\" with the violence and action similar to \"300\". As a matter of fact I wouldn't be surprised if that is where this show got it's idea from when it came to the concept. The plot is riddled with treachery, manipulation, backstabbing, bickering, lust, vengeance and longing for legacy and power. And those elements are integrated quite well. Season one was my favorite, since it centers around the Gladiators training and has good character development and relationships. It also has Andy Whitfield who was just perfect as Spartacus and I liked how the character was written. As this multifaceted and flawed character that is actually not that predictable. However because of Andy's unfortunate cancer issues he got replaced by Liam McIntyre, who was alright but the direction of the character made Spartacus boring. He basically became The Hero right off the bat from \"Spartacus: Vengeance\" which was my least favorite season. The supporting actors and actresses did a good job though, which made the series more enticing. Some of the character transitions though seemed a bit inconsistent at times, like when it came to Gannicus who actually seemed like more of the protagonist in \"War of the damned\". And Spartacus that seemed like some nobleman than a anti-hero, maybe they could have done a better job building him up to be the hero. Also when it came to Caesar and Crassus,at first it seemed like Caesar was the brute and Crassus as the rational and smart leader, but as the show progresses the roles seems to reverse. The prequel season was my third favorite season with \"War of the Damned\" being my second favorite. It revolves around war between the slaves fighting for freedom against the Roman army. And the build up was just compelling and entertaining. With a final battle scene that doesn't disappoint. It's kinda sad to see the series end, but I do believe it ended on the right note instead of dragging it on. Overall, this is a entertaining and underrated show that is actually bloody awesome.8.3/10",

            "content": "Like the gladiatorial games it draws from, 'Spartacus - Blood and Sand' is a spectacle of violence, gore and sexy naked bodies.That's why it's such fun.'Spartacus BaS' definitely has its roots in the Raimi & Tapert school of \"fun\", though.Both '300' and 'Gladiator' are often over-rated; like 'Spartacus BaS' they are also \"fun\" movies that weren't brain-dead yet didn't require much more than simply sitting back and enjoying them. While I rank the likes of 'Rome' VERY highly, it was more of a period drama (like 'I, Claudius' before it) than an action series, and it boasted a far higher budget and attempt at realism than BaS.Unlike some shows (even many excellent ones) the episodes are extremely well-paced, never feeling overlong yet a lot happens in each; every one almost feels like a mini-movie, and while we are left wanting more, there are so far none of the forced \"cliffhangers\" shows like 'Lost' and '24' make us suffer through over and over again.On the casting front, I'm very glad (and not just for the obvious reasons) that Lucy Lawless was so up for this, as she really has fun with her (admittedly Attia-like) role, also proving to mainstream audiences that Xena was not just a \"fluke\", while John Hannah lends weight to proceedings and Viva Bianca really \"gets\" what this is about and provides an enormous addition to the sense of fun and enjoyment as she plays the kind of spoiled rich girl that crosses genres. Special note to Craig Parker too, who was so woefully underused in 'Legend of the Seeker' (playing perhaps the most neutered villain of all-time), obviously relishing being the \"big bad\" and playing a right bastard we love to hate. In fact, fans of Australian and New Zealand made shows will recognize a lot of the cast, and its great to see cameos by some old RenPics favorites.While the overuse of CGI gets annoying (it reminds my of late 90's \"movie\" video games like 'Wing Commander III' when ALL the sets were green screens!) I'll take that over NO scope or action (even 'Rome' - though for their own reasons - never went the \"huge scale\" path with massive Colosseum events or field battles).Spartacus (played by Andy Whitfield with just the right mix of determination and self-pity) gets on my nerves a bit for being such a blatant idiot at times, making both typical \"movie mistakes\" (\"let the bad guy live\", etc.) and very human ones. But it is very nice, on the other hand, to have a \"heroic\" series/character who is still very flawed and (thankfully) far from the best fighter in the show.'Spartacus BaS' takes a while to get going, and the pilot definitely visually and stylistically feels more '300' than perhaps it should, but once we get to the training school, we're in much more solid territory.It isn't original... those who've played the PS2 game 'Colosseum - Road to Freedom' will find a lot of similarities, as will fans of 'Gladiator' of course. But this is something to expect in a genre that is both based in history and has a fairly narrow list of (decent) fellow entries.So far, I've seen only three episodes, but - for what I understand to be a \"startup\" network's first big show - I think it succeeds wonderfully and shows great promise... I'm looking forward to where we will be taken next with these characters.So long as they keep things entertaining, bloody and sexy yet refrain from going so far as to be TOO gratuitous, I think it will be a big hit.",

This show (as all TV Shows) is meant to entertain not educate and if you expect yourself to be educated through TV Shows then you are a fool.Moving on; some said/wrote that the series is nothing more than a porn with gore and cussing. I beg to differ. For starters, wouldn't you expect from people of that era that treated other people as slaves and entertained themselves by having gladiators fighting to the death or by throwing Christians to the lions to cuss like that or have orgies? Wouldn't you expect from people that fought every day to stay alive just to entertain their \"masters\" to be so violent? If you like everything to be sugarcoated and \"politically correct\" then this series is definitely not for you. Now that I kinda explained why there is so much sex, gore and cussing let me tell you why I loved the series. The subplots are AMAZING! You could never figure out how the 4th episode would end. It is brilliant how the personal goals of each character get tangled with the goals of the other characters. I really like that in every episode there are so many things going on. I think the casting is also well-chosen and combining all the above with the whole rawness, blood, gore, sex, violence and awesome visuals would explain why I believe that this series is a must-see (at least its first season).Sine Missione!",

            "content": "The Good= Spartacus delivers! When I saw the first episode, I was hooked. Yes, it had the cheesy 300 CGI, but it had the awesome messenger of the Persians and plenty of action! Spartacus is full of blood, gore, sex, and profanity. This is NOT a show for your kids. However, it isn't supposed to be! There are plenty of other themes and conflicts going on with the plots and subplots to give this show credibility, besides the violence/sex. Many people complain about that--\"the show is just boobs and blood\". Well, it has plenty of those, and maybe a bit too much, but the actors and script are amazing for such a show. Each episode is better than many actual movies in theaters. I can forgive the CGI blood, the overused naked people, gay love affairs, etc. when the script and historical setting are this well-written and interesting. Overall, a fantastic and bold show that I have longed to see on TV since I was a kid.The Bad= Some of the dialogue is funny, and borders on absurdity, with all the F-bombs and 4 letter words. However, I assume the writers are trying to make it realistic to today's viewers who hear the same banter in daily life, and we are to assume that this is just a rendition of whatever crude profanity and insults they might have used. The CGI is cheesy, I admit, but probably works easier with their budget and production. I can deal with it, as much of it is done for effect or even to change to the next scene, after a deadly gladiator match. To me, the pros far outweigh the cons for this show, as long as you can deal with adult subjects and nudity/violence.The Ugly= So sad that Andy Whitfield died, and had to be replaced, as well as Naevia. The creators did a GREAT job, however, of throwing out a short prequel season that ended up being as good or arguably better than the regular seasons. Gannicus was introduced as the total bad- ass that he was, and we got to see the beginnings of the devious Batiatus and the deadly Oenameus.",

The fighting scenes didn't interest me much and the sex scenes added little to the story.The story writing itself was generally solid. The first half of season 2 was the most notable letdown: like watching a daytime soap opera.The sets are decent and the acting mostly good. Most of the series portrayed characters in a way that felt historically genuine (unlike Black Sails that was comparatively frustrating for many of the episodes).Probably the most standout performance was Lucy Lawless who could change personality rapidly and believably.Most of the drama and conflict was excellent. If you love gratuitous sex and violence and gore, this show will give you a fair fill. Overall, it has a good balance of history, action, drama and decently played male and female characters with the exception of one female warrior in the final season.Much of the series sticks to basic historical facts. At times, you'll be surprised at what is historically accurate.",

            "content": "Spartacus: Blood And Sand Season 1 review I watched this series with great reluctance, having been urged to do so by my 20 year old son. Episode 1 actually does it a disservice, being overly influenced by 300. Gratuitous, slo-mo violence and gore, and a stunning palette of colours. I declined to watch it again. However. As luck would have it, I walked into the room when episode 5 was on weeks later. Mocked, sat for a few minutes intending to depart. And was hooked. By the incredible dialogue, brilliant acting and excellent casting. I have watched every episode of season 1 since. When I saw the finale- we were actually clutching each other and shouting at the TV.I would URGE people to see 'Spartacus: Blood and Sand'. Take a deep breath as regards the violence and nudity. Because plot,dialogue and character-wise? This was redolent of the best of English theatre acting, such as the Royal Shakespeare Company, or the National Theatre.John Hannah- an actor I have never rated- was MAGNIFICENT as Battiatus, the owner of the Ludus (gladiator camp).Cunning, ambitious,humorous, vicious. Villainous, yet at times getting the audience's sympathy. Lucy Lawless was a revelation as his wife, Lucretia. I loved her in Xena, but would have pegged her as a light comedy actress. But here? She showed a range and power that made me long for some theatre producer to grab both her and Hannah and get them to do 'MacBeth'.Yes, Lucy Lawless would make a phenomenal Lady Macbeth, based on her performance over this series.Lawless and Hannah are playing complex,three dimensional characters. As are the rest of the cast. Ordinarily, in a show like this,you get a great lead character, then one or two good ones and the supporting characters are two dimensional. Not here. The writers-led by Stephen DeKnight, fleshed out a good 15-20 characters. The casting directors then did an incredible job in finding the actors to portray them. Characters like Crixus, Barca, Varro, Ithylia, Doctore, Solonius, Naevia,Ashur, Mira, and of course Spartcus (Andy Whitfield) make this a powerful ensemble.Experienced character actors who usually don't get to have the story focused on them, took the opportunity and ran with it. The level of talent is on par with HBO's 'Rome', and at times exceeds it.I grew up on 'I,Claudius' and would have said there would never be a series about historical events in ancient Rome that could match it.Wrong. 'Spartacus:Blood and Sand' is 'I,Claudius' on steroids. Its 'Rome' on crack. Watching it as a viewer became addictive. I will be bingewatching the other series that make up the whole 'War of the Damned'.The main actors should have been nominated for Emmys,was a travesty that it didn't get the full range of prestigious TV awards. It should have got a Peabody Like Battlestar Galactica. Awesome",

            "content": "Though \"Spartacus: Vengeance\" has many episodes yet to air, I am writing to applaud the brilliance of the series in general and of the episode \"Libertus\" (2/24/12) in particular. I never expected a television series about the ancient world to exceed the atmospheric and well-acted \"Rome\" on HBO. The \"Spartacus\" series has eclipsed any of its TV predecessors about the Roman Empire with a combination of action and drama that, at minimum, must be described as riveting. \"Libertus\" left me breathless with its climatic surprise that bears genuine comparison to Atlanta's burning in \"Gone With The Wind.\" Like GWTW, \"Spartacus\" serves up (rather, carves up) big doses of epic soap opera, but when such fare is done well, nothing is better. Enormous credit is due Lucy Lawless and Manu Bennett, who have revived the memorable chemistry and romantic tension of their Antony and Cleopatra in one of the best \"Xena\" episodes. Liam McIntyre has given Spartacus his own compelling signature while honorably not seeking to replace Andy Whitfield's depiction of the character. Finally, Craig Parker as the seething and complex Glaber is this season's breakout star. We know the historic Spartacus meets a tragic fate, but I must hope this hero, along with his allies and enemies, will live forever.",

My only complaint i have at this time is some scenes the blood looks to fake. I just might have to rent the old movie now. So i can compare the two.

            "content": "I liked 300, but the visuals were an acquired taste. I liked ROME but found it a lil slow and plodding. I liked Gladiator but found it a lil too Hollywood clean, and it sagged a bit in places, overall it never lived up to the likes of Braveheart for me.So, now we have SPARTACUS. Its the best of all 3 I mentioned, but thrown into a great ongoing series! Who would have ever thought TV could get as good as it has. Its quickly surpassing many movies for me. Lost, Dexter, Prisonbreak etc, all way better than most recent films.Spartacus is no different, Its high budget, high stylised art, bloody, steamy, and each episode has as much action as 300.My only 2 gripes with Spartacus is the Language is a little TOO colourful. I don't mind swearing, but in this show its very frequent and very coarse and I feel with some viewers it could be the shows downfall, it distracts too much.The other gripe, is that the guy playing Spartacus NEEDS to be cast as CONAN in the upcoming reboot, he's perfect for the role and the guy they did choose looks awful as Conan. Still, thats not a flaw with Spartacus, its just a fan pipe-dream.For those new to the show or looking to give it a go, the pilot (which hooked me) is not the best episode by far, it just sets up the characters but feels more stylised than the rest of the series. So give it chance, the characters really grow, as does the story.Verdict... 10/10, Highly addictive!!! If you can see past the naughty bits.",

            "content": "Spartacus became of interest to me in the old movie with Kirk Douglas as a boy. In college I took a history class that covered this period so I did a paper on Spartacus and the slave rebellion as a term paper. Getting rock solid FACT on events from the last millennium before Christ is a bit difficult, but his fame at the time was so great that there were 3 sources considered relatively accurate at a high level for the period and left me with a life long interest in the person, the period, and the events of his life. I think this is a relatively accurate telling of a compelling story without much variance from what is considered historical fact. The gore is over done with all the slow motion spurting of blood, but as the series progressed the gore and nudity became less absurd as the quality of the story was sufficient to provide quality entertainment. Given by all accounts of my studies Spartacus was never confirmed as captured or killed and lean towards that he escaped to return to end his life with the many slaves he freed. The facts about the crucifixion of the many that were captured in the final battle along the roadway into Rome to scare the BeJesus out of slaves from further uprising is well documented making it easy to have the story end with his death. Given it was over 2000 years ago we'll never truly know so all I can say on the finale with his death is it would not have changed the overall quality and been just has accurate to have him escape AND live instead of having him escape and die from the wounds inflicted during the final battle to procure safe escape for the slaves that weren't the core band of warriors. I find the story awesome and this script well done. The over use of gory shots of blood gushing got old, and the graphic use of naked men and women \"just because they could\" got old, but the times were such that the slaves were treated as property and the Romans were recorded as being quite \"loose\" in their morals as their thirst for blood in their entertainment in the games with the Gladiators. Men taught to fight to the death is easy to use as the basis for a group that would make up a formidable fighting force when set against warriors, and the success of Spartacus, Crixus and the leaders in the rebellion believable. His training as a commander and his unorthodox strategy brought them recorded success as their army of freed slaves grew to be a large one that had they had the ability to deal with the logistics of staying supplied while fighting Rome could have had them have even more success in wrecking havoc on the empire at the time. I watched the series on Netflix streaming all 4 seasons in a month and once I numbed myself to the overuse of low quality gore was quite pleased with the telling of what I believe to be a great story in history. Given the lack of information as fact it was good to see the writing stick to a largely supported set of underlying facts for the story to play out and produce a good show. When watching season 2 I was surprised by use of an entire season to tell the story of what was history by the end of season 1, but when all was said and done I thing the choice was a good one to allow the additional characters to be brought in for seasons 3 and 4 and have it make sense. Someday a truly good series will be made to tell the story without the unnecessary gore. But this was the best job to date and I love it!",

            "content": "Now, let's face the elephant in the room; there's a lot of sex, a lot of blood, a lot of gore, and a lot of foul mouthed characters. I for one couldn't care less about this, but in no way does it diminish it's writing; in fact, it enhances it.This show does a very good job depicting the brutality of the ancient Roman society without political correctness standing in it's way. Watch as sick schemes, plots, and breathtaking twists unfold with the help of very dynamic character development. One thing about this show is that it's not afraid to kill off main characters, and if anyone is familiar with the history of Spartacus, you would know that a few characters, their death is inevitable. So not much of a spoiler there.The writers wrote into this at a amazing angle. Now, the Spartacus legend has adopted this mob mentality in the house of Batiatus, which all comes together beautifully. Batiatus and his wife Lucretia is a match made in hell. You'll see their true love burn bridges and form allies with unpredictable consequences. All the while Spartacus is adapting to becoming a gladiator, not knowing nor having any intention of becoming the leader of the largest slave rebellion that waged war against Rome. It doesn't follow history to the point where it's educational, but it does manage to fill in the blanks about the story of Spartacus with an outstanding imagination. All that being said, this show does have a few flaws. The armor in the show is pretty much pointless; even a butter knife can penetrate it. Aside from a few scenes in the second season & third season, there really isn't any real military tactics used at all in the battle scenes like we saw in Troy or in 300. They usually consist of slow motion swinging and grunting followed by poor CGI. The language seems to be a mixture of Shakespeare and Pulp Fiction, which may ruin the immersion for a moment. But you shouldn't allow that to stop you from watching this, nor should the mediocre pilot, because believe me; it gets way better. Spartacus consists of four total seasons, including Gods Of The Arena, which is a total of 39 episodes. Watching the vast plots, characters, environments, twists and emotionally captivating scenes will leave you hanging at the edge of your seat. You will get consumed in this exciting, disturbing, sad, psychotic f*cked up roller coaster and you'll love every minute of it.",

And the new season doesn't deserve anything above 5.Dialogues are stupid and pompous, action doesn't move and what is presented as a leader of gladiators is nothing but a pretty face attached to a clumsy untrained body.

The series was inspired by the historical figure of Spartacus, a Thracian gladiator who from 73 to 71 BCE led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic departing from Capua.After the completion of the first season titled Spartacus: Blood and Sand, production for another season was delayed because lead actor Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma so Starz produced a six-episode prequel mini-series entitled Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. When the actor's cancer recurred and he later died on September 11, 2011, Starz had actor Liam McIntyre take on the role of Spartacus in the second season titled Spartacus: Vengeance. On June 4, 2012, Starz announced the third and final season, titled Spartacus: War of the Damned.This captivating and compelling action-adventure spectacle chronicles the saga of a heroic Thracian warrior turned Roman slave turned gladiator turned leader of a rebellion against his Roman captors. In the Season 3 premiere, Spartacus (Liam McIntyre) sees his army grow and deal a serious blow to Rome's fighting legions, which leads Roman officials to seek empire-saving funding from the aristocratic and ambitious Marcus Crassus (Simon Merrells). Troubles continue to thwart Spartacus and his rebels, however, as they deal with food shortages, shelter problems, betrayals, mounting casualties and a spy in their midst. In the end, Spartacus and his outnumbered rebel force prepare for what could be their final, pivotal battle against the Romans.",

This show is not for the faint of heart. And I am glad. What you see portrayed on screen doesn't even come close to the reality of life in Rome. Life in Rome was brutal. If you would be unfortunate enough to be born a slave, you would have been treated far worse that is depicted on the show. Rome as a culture was totalitarian to the 'T'. The slightest bit of dissidence was treated as treason and the punishment was severe. When I watch this show, I feel as if I have been transported to that era. The revelry, the rivalry, the politics, the treachery, it all seems to real, so reminiscent of that time. The show started off with Andy Whitfield (God bless his soul) as Spartacus and boy did he deliver. He will be sorely missed. He gave way to Liam McIntyre who is the new Spartacus and it took him some time to get under the skin of the character and sort of grow on you. As we move onto season 3, I assure you Liam is Spartacus and he is doing justice to the role. Manu Bennett as Crixus is awesome and I wonder why he's not being considered as an action hero. I wouldn't mind seeing him taking up the mantle from the likes of Dwayne Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yes there are times when some of the peripheral characters' acting and expressions are wooden but this is forgiven owing to the screen presence of the main characters. I love this show and was eagerly awaiting Season 3 to air. And it has not disappointed. If you want to witness the brutality of the reality of a life of a slave in the roman era. WATCH THIS SHOW!",

In particular, Vengeance had no arch-villain like Quintus Batiatus like Charlton Heston who played the cardinal and masterminded the necessary (perceived) evils that actually held things together for everyone.That had been remedied by Simon Merrells who gave a spectacular performance as Magneto...no wait, Crassus.And if you think you know your history, scattered across the series are a few curved balls thrown just for you.",

Yes it is probably going to go down in history as the goriest and most vulgar show to ever air on any TV station but its just such a satisfying story, although a little predictable if u have already seen any other iteration of the story of Spartacus. This is a show that many will not like because it is so violent and the sexual content is very strong, so if u don't like seeing things like peoples faces being skinned off, or countless arms limbs being severed, or like seeing full frontal nudity in every episode then go watch something that doesn't have that. For everyone that does like the above for-mentioned then this is a show for u. Watch it if u liked Rome, 300, gladiator, Braveheart, Spartacus the mini-series, or Spartacus the movie.",

But most of the series isn't about him, it's about the machinations of the Ludus owner, Batiates, and his wife, Xena, Lesbian Princess. Or whatever. So all of this involves complicated plots leading up to fights in the arena punctuated by gratuitous sex scenes...And, yes, the battle scenes look way too much like 300.",

From the first episode of this, i thought, \"WOW\" this is how it should be when it comes to a TV Show.If you are one of those people who expect lots of blood and gory battle scenes, Really nice shameless language in between, naked woman in every corner and of course a gripping storyline that holds you to the edge of the seat.

            "review_title": "An elegant foray of blood and damnation",
            "content": "Presenting greater carnage and fornication than its peers, Spartacus returns to form after its less stellar second season. Everything works at highly dynamic pace with distinguished script, and most importantly a more comfortable cast. This rings especially true in the case of Liam McIntyre who had a demanding job of replacing Andy Whitfield as Spartacus after his unfortunate passing. Liam McIntyre establishes the role more firmly as opposed in second season where he seemed more of a glorified replacement. Now he projects a legitimate gladiator turned fugitive worthy of his own interpretation of Spartacus, after all a series can only be as good as its titular lead.Story follows Spartacus and his army of rebellious slaves as they trade blows and tactics against Marcus Crassus and Julius Caesar. Simon Merrells as Crassus is the richest man of Rome who strives for honor of defeating the persistent rebels. His character is a stoic father figure who regards discipline highly; he displays more wit and valor than previous pursuers, making him a viable imposing antagonist. Todd Lasance plays the young Caesar, cunning and wild, he has a respectable screen presence. Having slight debonair presence, he surprisingly fits as a brasher Caesar prior to the time of his leadership, a reiteration which isn't often seen of the character.Manu Bennett and Dustin Clare reprise their roles as Crixus and Gannicus, respectively. Bennett dons rougher looks, it does differ much from his previous more gladiatorial image, but the character is now overly invested in vengeance and rather one-dimensional. Dustin Clare headlined Spartacus: Gods of the Arena before as Gannicus, he returns with likable charm. He has plenty of screen time; one of the episodes actually features his story, and proves he could be a proper leading man.One of the appeals of Spartacus' storytelling is how unique the script is. Characters speak with elegant tongue, sometimes with flamboyant analogy and indirect metaphor. It's pretty odd that slaves possess such eloquent vocabulary, but it gives the series a sophisticated tune of its own. This third season sees the rise of expletive curses aplenty, the volume of this f-bomb is a bit jarring and might be tasteless in few executions. Nevertheless, it defines the cruel and tenacious tone more, as they are now in all-time high.Action has been a staple of the series, trademarked by decently choreographed set pieces and abundance of slow motion use a la 300. It admirably invested effort of making the cast look like bona fide warriors, even the women. They carry themselves with gritty disposition and toned physique, some moves might lack refinement but they do the tumultuous war theme justice. If there's one concern, it's the quantity might be a bit much. Seeing men do the same aerial assault in slow-mo, often several times in one episode, is rather excessive. The first season had more diversity of weaponry and combat, but it's understandable since it had gladiator gimmick.Along the gruesome combat, it has also seen its fair share of CG. Most of the setting and some fight scenes play out in animated background. This shows some flaws since its forest, desert and city vista seem drab and uninspiring. It has some genuine setting, such as inner city or villa, but it lacks the scale of what should be thousands of people fighting for their lives. Some effects are still presentable, albeit over-the-top like blood geyser or swiveling snow. Be warned that this series is teeming with gore and nudity, mutilation and intercourse are as common as bread and butter. For those with more fragile eyes and ears, it'd be wise to avert them as this is one mature rating that's gallantly earned on all aspects. Despite the rough exterior, Spartacus: War of the Damned has thorough characterization, great acting by its cast and stylish dramatic storytelling. It stands as an equal bloody alternate of other acclaimed series, and possibly above in some terms.",

If you are on the border of whether to watch this or not I will try and help you:Sex - there is a lot........no there isn't!! I timed the 1st episode yes I was bored and frustrated with bias reviews, there is maybe 2-3 minutes of simulation. This carries on for the next 3 episodes. OK through out there is constant breast/penis etc but after a while you get bored of it and are paying attention to the script.CGI - Don't know how to spell it out to some people - this is exactly how this is meant to look, and they get it perfectly right. Its meant to be a comic book. Anyone who is a comic fan will notice all the effects used. Blurred back grounds, the front on shot (when they are fighting), over the top blood. Geeze people really need to sometimes relax and try to enjoy things.The acting and characters are also very solid. The characters are well thought out and after the 5th episode you can see the development. Someone really summed it up - all the characters are a shade of grey. The 1st few episodes is all \"Ahhhhhhh poor Spartacus\", the second and 3rd are all like \"My god that guy is a bastard - kill him Spartacus, kill him NOW\", but after its \"Well he's not soooo bad\" and this is great.This show falls into the Fun genre - if you like serious don't bother with this, if you like your Smallvilles, 2 and a half men, big bang theory etc and you also like swords, this is for you9/10",

If you can get past that, it is a well written interesting story, with fantastic visuals.I am a bit partial to the first series, but more recent episodes seem true to the original. I'm adding this section at mid-season... As of the fifth episode \"Libertus\"' the story has picked up quite a bit from the first few episodes; the program is feeling more like the first season now. This series is a good reason to pay for Starz as I very seldom actually watch movies on Starz.

Some scenes are emotionally insane - when for instance Spartacus kills ... (I won't spoil it for you). Really it's something that makes you feel bad. There are many sex scenes too.The whole impression of it all is mixed. Suppose the Roman era of gladiators is depicted quite truly but the need to show everything in such close and uncomfortable details is questionable.It reminds me of \"God of War\" PS2 game. The use of slow motion during the fights is extensive and it makes you almost feel the taste of blood as the screen catches the drips of it.Don't have any complaints to the actors' play. They do the right thing. Everybody is believable. Even fantastic. Also sometimes the characters pronounce such phrases that it all sounds simply schmutzy and hysterical.Strictly \"AO\" material. Quite sure that it is the most brutal film about gladiators. The rest directors shouldn't bother - to shoot a more powerful film about bloody gladiators' fights and remain serious is impossible. Add more blood and it will get ridiculous.Hard to rate this. I'd give a solid 9 for the powerful drama, an undoubtful 10 for the fight sequences, a good 7 for the rhythm (still I'd prefer a solid 3-hour movie instead of the serial which makes it impossible to watch it all during one evening).Too many naked female bodies, bad language plus gay topic make the movie even more scandalous while loosening the dramatic impact (at least to me).Watch at your own risk. And by the way, it all ends perfectly. To continue it not a must.An 8 out of 10 (it delivers too much now and then \u2013 NOT during the fight scenes, which I rate as top-notch).

            "review_title": "Why I Like Spartacus Blood and Sand",
            "content": "Why I Like Spartacus Blood and Sand1. The rather Byzantine and complex plot. I agree that the first episode is not all that hot, but as you stick with it starts to expand and get more complex as more characters and their motivations are brought into the mix. I think that fundamentally this show is about a struggle for power from the angle of several characters, and what they do to achieve it. I find the plot gripping and it makes me want to tune in. And this is saying a lot, because I really can not be bothered to watch most of what is on TV.2. The characters are layered. The villains are not purely bad, the heroes are not purely good. Everyone is a variation on a shade of grey. In episode 3 I saw a side of Spartacus that I actually never expect to see manifest itself. The character is not a noble goody two shoes. I also very much find myself interested in some of the minor characters in the show. Crixus and Barcaa may come across as two thugs. But you can see that there is more going on there and I long to see what it is. Another thing...because the characters are so well layered and interesting. It makes me interested in the cast as a whole, not just one or two characters. 3.Spartacus relationship with his wife and devotion to her. I hope that that this is expanded as the show progresses. I can't say for certain. But from the first episode I get the impression that they are very close and have a strong bond. They love each other yet are straight and honest with each other. It's more of a partnership than anything else.4.The portrayal of the women. This is probably some of the best portrayal I have seen of women on TV. They are both sexy, smart and dangerous. They use their wits and cunning to get what they want. Not their sexuality. With Lithia and Lucretia, you can practically see the wheels turning inside their heads.5. Andy Whitfield as Spartacus. I think that Andy is absolutely awesome. I love the way that he portrays Spartacus. As a man who was given a raw deal and sold into slavery. While it's so noble that he wants to rescue his wife and get her back. He still has to struggle to...get out of his own way. He is not exactly a team player and sometimes acts against his own interests because of his own pride. It's often been said that our biggest enemy is ourselves. And I think that this is so true with Spartacus. It would have been easy to have made him a noble hero right from the get go. But instead the producers and writers are showing us the development of the character from who he is...to who he will become.6.I like the fact that they are not shying away from certain subjects. As it has been reported, there is a gay character in this show. Now given the fact that they are showing every other form of sexuality. For them to ignore homosexuality would be disingenuous. However instead of making the gay bit some old queen who is a house servant who chases after boys (like in Rome or Gladiator) they actually made it one of the Gladiators themselves--one of the meaner tougher ones. I also love the fact that the show looks at the unfairness of life and how easy it is to be a victim. But it also shows that you don't have to be a slave (pun intended) to your fate, and the importance of learning to look after yourself. 7.The settings. This show is mostly being done on the cheap in terms of sets and CGI. I am guessing that this is so that they don't blow their budget. However because of the minimalism that is used it almost makes the show look like a stage play. And Iike a play you are more forced to concentrate on the characters (which is where your focus should be) instead of the pretty settings.8.The way that the film has incorporated themes from various films, mini series and books. I can see elements from Gladiator, 300, I, Claudius, Braveheart, James Bond and The Count of Monte Cristo. Yet I only see this because I am familiar with this material it. It is not as if those elements come out and slap you in the face (like Avataar which is an almost verbatim re-tread of Dances With Wolves). SB&S while incorporating several themes and from other sources, still manages to stand on its' own.9. And I would be dishonest if I did not say that I liked looking at the men. Andy Whitfields hot. But I get a real charge watching Manu Bennet parade around naked... like a proud lion. I tend to be attracted to big manly men. And this show has it in spades.",

Where Andy played him gracefully, with the gravitas, sadness and self-doubt the character deserved, the new actor, whose name I ignore, carves a sneering, humorless, self-righteous, vengeful, fairly dumb and ultimately boring man. In fact, we care more for Crixus or Lannicus now than for Spartacus himself.

It really draws your attention and you can't take your eyes off the screen until the show is over. Production is amazing, great cgi, great stunts that bring lots of reality to the fight and war scenes. The plot and script are perfect. Lots of twists, drama, action, some soft porn (sometimes they do exaggerate to bring up the audience) and all the ingredients needed on a good TV show. Somehow the production managed to put together a great cast of no well known actors, but they all blended in perfectly and really got into the characters. Great acting from the main actors. To bad the first Spartacus died (the actor) on season one, he was better (more believable) tham the second guy, but the show managed to keep it up and honor him with a great season two and three. The side stories are very good too. Bring lots or realism into the show, showing how corrupted Roman society was. Really gets your attention. I could go on and on, but to make it short: WATCH IT and draw your conclusions. Don't listen to the haters or the so called critics that have never done anything, but criticize!",

            "content": "Focusing on the aestheticized violence (the slow motion gladiatorial bouts, the CGI beheadings, etc.) and the nudity ignores some important surprises. I thought the show was just going to be a homoerotic \"300\" ripoff, and actually it's far better than that. Much more so than that silly film, this show is actually very accurate: about the Roman class structure, the position of the gladiator, the squalor of slavery, the religion and superstition of the Romans, their mores, even the desperation of of a Roman town without a reliable source of water. I was expecting them to be very loosey goosey about historical accuracy (like \"300\" with its ridiculously portrayed Persians). To my further surprise, I discovered that the extremely well-muscled gladiators on the show (the abilities of John Hannah go without saying) can actually act, and that the character conflicts are both interesting and believable. It's true that the show creates some adversaries in the arena scenes whose abilities and scariness are literally superhuman, and it's true that some of the combats portray skill and endurance that belong more to video games than the human body. But it's also true that Roman economics -- the desperate need of families below for the patronage of those above, the possibility of freemen falling into slavery, the possibility of earning money as a slave and buying your way out -- are accurately portrayed. The sets look right, the costumes (allowing for the universally padded breechcloths on the gladiators) look right, the dialogue sounds right, the relationships feel right. There's even one homosexual gladiator with a younger slave minion, and -- accurately -- the other gladiators think nothing of it. Yes it's a stylized show and a sensationalized show, but Rome really was just as violent and dangerous and precarious and sexed up and cruel as the show portrays. The surprise isn't that somebody created a show that looks like a high-end video game, or that it contains a lot of nudity and graphic violence. The surprise is that they bothered to give it so much substance and class. This, to my astonishment, is quality television.",

However, the writing goes from contemporary speech to some pidgin of expected dialogue often enough to jar you out of being sucked in far too often.

I like the cast. I liked most of the visuals, a few times it seems like they tried too hard to be a comicbook/300esque homage. The talent attached to this show is huge when you look at directors, producers and writers - Angel, Futurama, Smallville, Carnivale, Dollhouse, Alias, Heroes - I didn't even bother listing stuff Raimi - hey look its a Xena!. The cast is familiar and a nice mix from the previous projects of these folks, but the show itself falls really short of the mark.Again, the language really bothered me, not that it was \"bad language\", that was expected, but that it was out of place. I had bad flashbacks of the Xena/Hercules episodes when the cast would play people in contemporary times and the whole show seemed out of whack. It was cute then and a little comical, but that was the intention. Here it makes the show feel like a freshman essay paper written by a bunch of PhDs. I hope it gets better. It has a ton of potential based on talent on screen and behind the camera so I will hang in and check out further episodes, I think...",

            "content": "I am a serious amateur historian and of Roman history in particular. Because of this I've driven a lot of my friends mad by pointing out faults in a lot of films over the years. Some of these I've hated and some I've really liked but in all I've found fault. Some of the ones I've liked; e.g Gladiator, Centurion, The Eagle and the series Rome the faults have been few but still there. Due to my persistence in things like that when I embarked on watching Spartacus I was truly expecting to despise it. I thought I would slag it to death and warn everyone away. The reviews I had heard was sex, violence and no attention to history or actual story - just graphic imagery. I hired this series from a mail order DVD company and therefore could only watch one disc and have to wait until I received the next. Thinking I would hate the first I didn't consider this to be a big deal. The series was filmed in the same way as The 300 and that was a film I didn't like for the reasons I stated earlier, i.e at what point did the Persian Empire include hiring the army of Mordor as that was how they were depicted in the film - as mutants and freaks. So on receiving DVD number 1 it went into the machine and I sat back expecting at best a laugh. I've never been as glad to be proved wrong. Spartacus was one of the best series I've ever seen. Ever! This was a truly fantastic experience and one that drove me mad by having to wait to see further episodes. I will be buying this box set and telling everyone to watch it. This is a tale of one mans internal journey within himself and is acted with Oscar worthy perfection. The 1960 film of Spartacus will never be surpassed but this doesn't try to. This is something different altogether. Although the film was long for the time it wasn't long enough to truly set out what drove one man to rise up the way he did AND embark on a civil war. To fight back and escape is one thing. To fight back and continue to fight is something else. This series is what led to that. The history of Spartacus is something that we do not know. The Romans did not tell us. They themselves probably didn't know the full story of the man so it's open to the directors to play with and it's been played with brilliantly here. I cannot deny that the sex is graphic and the violence is brutal. On top of that the language is seriously strong. All true but the subject matter isn't exactly a picnic is it? Slavery, gladiator fights, political corruption and murder. It's not for kids. Whether you're into history or not give this a watch. I am, and this is ten out of ten. Nothing is hidden but the accuracy is still there. Acting superb throughout. There had better be a season two. There is a prequel coming but the reasons for it are not good. The Spartacus actor Andy Whitfield has cancer. All the best for him and thanks for series one. For his sake, along with everyone else's here's for series two. Fantastic. Thanks Andy - and everyone else involved.",

            "content": "When the first season of Spartacus arrived, it seemed like nothing more than a swords and sandals affair smeared with blood, nudity, and interesting use of foul language, all in the spirit of 300. By the end, it proved to be a witty, firey swords and sandals affair that boasted more \"oh $%^&\" moments than your average action series. Thanks to some smart writing and delightful performances, the series established itself as the epitome of television guilty pleasure. Suffice to say, season 2 has a lot to live up to.While I skipped the prequel, as I had little interest in the back story of the house of Batiatis, I have anticipated the return of the original series for the year and a half since. And so far, two episodes in, I am pleased. With the epic ending of season 1, it was really a wonder where the show would go. We already know what actually happened in the time line of the real Spartacus, and it's been covered several times before, but a show like Spartacus isn't built around history. It's built around rather shallow elements like sex and violence. I say that lightly, as the show has proved to be more than just this, but a historical opus it is not. Sure enough, season two kicks off with the right kind of bang: Spartacus and fellow escaped slaves/gladiators killing Roman soldiers in glorious fashion. With the arena gone and the drama no longer grounded in the Lutus, the show has had to migrate the same kind of attractions elsewhere, and I would say it successfully has.It's not quite the same. We no longer have the tension created by the one on one battles of the arena or the politics behind the sport, but instead have a bit grander of a story. Now, Spartacus and men are on the prowl, hunting Romans and attracting Gaius Glaber and wife Ilithia to hunt them down. One on one fights are now battles between squads of men and the arena is replaced by various, random locales like a whore house or a villa. This takes away from some intimacy as the focus is wider, with a grander vision. It's a suitable direction for the show, but leaves some to be desired. There's so much going on that we are forced away from even Spartacus for other characters like Glaber or Ilithia, who have their own tales to tell. Sadly, the new Spartacus, Liam McIntyre replacing the late Andy Whitfield, does not have the same charm or attraction Whitfield had. In fact, much of the show feels like Spartacus is only apart of it and not the lead.None the less, everything you might have initially enjoyed about the first season remains. The action is even better this time around, if a little bloodier, there's no shortage of sex and nudity, and the dialogue and scripting still have the bite of a serpent. If you weren't a fan of the first season, stay away cause everything in season 2 is ramped up. It's only episode 2, and I've had the kinds of goosebumps I started getting midway through season 1 when the writing improved ever so much, so I anticipate good things to come. Even without it, the show is still a grand time on the small screen.",

The characters are all awesome and there is tons of drama and the relentlessness of the writers leaves u not knowing who could possibly live for anyones life seems to be on the line.

            "content": "This series started out pretty decently, with generous lashings of sex & nudity & some of the most imaginative CG killing & maiming you'll ever witness, but it also had a lot of vividly well-rounded characters! Sadly, after the first season the lead actor, Andy Whitfield, suddenly died & had to be replaced by Liam McIntyre, an actor not quite as intense, tho not for want of trying. (The continual strain of trying to live up to Whitfield's charisma probably contributed to McIntyre's slightly wooden Spartacus. He did what he could, but stepping into a lead role already popularized by someone else has got to be a hard row to hoe no matter what & Whitfield was a hard act to follow.) To make matters worse, Batiatus (the brilliant John Hannah), the almost likable rogue who owns the lutus, gets killed off at the end of the first season. As do Batiatus' rival lanista Solonius (excellently played by Craig Walsh-Wrightson) & Spartacus' bumbling friend Varro (Jai Courtney). But what the hey, we still have plenty of great characters left.By end of the second season tho, the remaining characters portrayed with any real depth \u2014 the conniving Assyrian Ashur (Nick E Tarabay), Batiatus' scheming wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), her snooty airhead frenemy Ilythia (Viva Bianca) & even the indomitably dignified Oenameaus (Peter Mensah) all get whacked too.Tho the script tries to compensate with lots of bombast, the surviving characters become increasingly shallow & the third season rapidly degenerates into a lot of verbal & physical wrangling interspersed with wooden love scenes & otherwise unrelenting slash & bash action. No matter how brilliantly choreographed, after two seasons, all this fighting stuff gets pretty tedious. Two new characters do manage to somewhat enliven the third season tho: Attius (Cohen Holloway), the venal but plainspoken Roman blacksmith who casts his lot with the rebels but \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 lasts only two episodes & Laeta (Anna Hutchison), the public-spirited young Roman matron who ends up a slave herself. Nevertheless, by the end of the final ep, I was impatient for the mortally wounded Spartacus to just hurry up & finish dying so the series could finally be over.",

Having seen the pilot, I honestly do not know what to think.Based on the previews, I knew I have to expect something more in veins of \"300\" than something resembling a realistic historical movie. However, this being a series and all, I hoped that the stylistic approach and reliance on nudity and gore will be complemented with a good story and interesting characters.What I got was a prolonged computer game cutscene, although sadly I was never asked to grab my controller and do some fighting on my own. Throughout the whole episode I was served with endless slow motion, more then obvious green screen sets and buckets of CGI blood. EXTREMELY fake-looking CGI blood, the one that looks sparkly and completely wrong shade of red, gushes all over the place yet evaporates in mid-air. After the eighth time my TV screen was bathed in red pixels, I gave up on taking the series seriously. After the twenty-first time, I was exhausted. This is neither stylized nor cool - it just serves to make suspending disbelief an utterly impossible feat to accomplish.Interspersed between the rather silly yet endless fight scenes is some resemblance of the plot and quite a lot of breasts (with occasional gift of full frontal nudity, female persuasion). Breasts are nice, but I have Internet for that. Plot is the beginning of the Spartacus story, already seen in, well, \"Spartacus\", or even in \"Gladiator\" in some fashion. Only this time it is accompanied with rather theatrical acting, not really bad per se, but also reimbursing the computer game cutscene feeling.All in all, this is Spartacus for the XBox generation, the only problem being that the age group that would enjoy it the most is the one not permitted to see it because of its rating. On the other hand, kids have already seen that stuff in modern computer games, done better and in interactive fashion for that matter.However, I am not the one who will dismiss a series based on a bad pilot. I wasn't (too) bored with it and I guess I have at least some interest in seeing what happens next. But if it continues in the same fashion (and keeps insisting with not giving me a chance to actually control Spartacus with my gamepad), I guess I could live my life quite happily without ever seeing the ultimate fate of this particular iteration of Spartacus.",

            "content": "I've been seeing previews for Spartacus: Blood and Sand for a long time. I have to admit, it looked intriguing, and I gave more than a moment's thought to subscribing to Starz to check it out. I was in luck a few weeks ago when there was a free preview, and I had a chance to catch 2 episodes. I only watched 1. I was appalled. There was little more than gratuitous sex and violence that added absolutely nothing to the plot...not that there was much of a plot.It was visually stunning, but that's the best that can be said for it. The acting was wooden, and the cursing was both inappropriate and overused. Perhaps they took a page from HBO's Deadwood by dropping profanities all over the place, but in both situations, it didn't seem in keeping with the era. Though I'm not an expert on either time period, I just can't get my mind around the idea that ancient Romans would use that kind of language, especially since the etymology of the words as they were used don't suggest the terminology was in use that far back in history. (Yes, I did a little homework before writing this review.) I'm all for meaningful cursing, but it was excessive in Spartacus: Blood and Sand, and completely unnecessary. The movie \"Gladiator\" with Russell Crowe was superior in every way to this made-for-TV tripe, and all the more captivating for the lack of swearing.Another thing I had trouble getting my mind around (through no fault of his) was the choice to cast John Hannah as Batiatus. John Hannah is a fine actor, but after seeing him as Rachel Weisz's goofy brother in The Mummy movies, seeing him as a calculating Roman aristocrat didn't work for me.Not a single cast member stood out as being exceptional. Maybe my opinion was colored by the fact that this series was so incredibly over-hyped, but it was really a letdown, and I wasted an hour of my life watching the 1st episode. I was so turned off that I didn't care to bother with the 2nd episode. I think the program caters to the lowest common denominator with shocking violence, needlessly graphic sex and cussing that would be far more appropriate in a modern day sports locker room than ancient Rome. Beautifully filmed, but not even the soundtrack was good. Bad taste all around, best left to the teenage boys it seems to be trying to attract, and not worth a second glance as far as I'm concerned.",

            "content": "Since each season has its own characteristics, I decided to write a few words on each one and a separate review. Season 1. A clumsy pilot, full of directing errors and what looks to be a poor production. But, it rises above the surface and delivers one of the best series ever made with an amazing grand finale!!! The acting is beautiful, the lead actor for the role of Spartacus is amazing, so are the others like Crixus, Asour, Batiatus etc. Violence and bloodshed (just like the Manowar song!!) and much sex. The script is also great. 13 episodes to be remembered!!Grade for season 1: 10/10Season 0. After season 1 the lead actor was sick and could not participate at the filming so they made these 6 episodes where they show us the story of Gasnnicus and other characters that we already know, before the arrival of Spartacus. Very well done, keeps at the same high standards like the first season. Only that in this season I would like it to see: Opening with the battle of Enomaos (Dottori) with the Shadow of Death See Varro in a small part, gambling and losing money (which would end to his surrender to the house of Batiatus to pay the debts). Those would make the show a little better in my opinion. Still, great show once again, with great acting. Grade for season 0: 8/10 Season 2. Oh my god what a nightmare! The new Spartacus cannot deliver. He is weak, looks weak, even the writers made his weak as a character (where he spares the life of Elithiya (did anyone know that Elithiya means stupid in Greek??? Its true, look it up!), the woman that tried to kill him, the woman that he tried to crash her neck when he realized it was her she was having sex with... Not only that but the script has holes everywhere. Lucretia rising from the dead (didn't anyone look at the house of Batiatus after the mass slaughter, didn't they gather the dead bodies, where was she? she should have been found). Also the Romans appear so weak and damn stupid, they get so spanked and fooled around, more that a \"Ast\u00e9rix and Ovelix\" movie!!!!!!! They put some gladiators to die in the arena yet no one ever thinks that Spartacus would come to free them and double/triple guards. The result? thousands of Romans (may first class citizens too) die at the burning and falling stadium. Still, they have assigned just a few men to hunt Spartacus down instead of sending thousands to end this rebellion. The Romans always attack in small numbers so that the rebels can easily kill them. They do never send scouts before proceeding. I could go on on and on with stupidities on their behalf (al credit goes to the script writers) but I would bore you. Regarding acting, everyone here seems to have given up too. Crixus is bad a playing the lover that seeks his beloved (the script is bad here too), we said about the new Spartacus that is not only different in appearance and as a character also, but also is not as good actor and not convincing as the previous lead actor. My favorite actor though in all the show is the one that plays Assour. I have to admit that he shines, and he delivers a great performance every time he appears on screen. Great work and should be rewarded (looking to hear from his soon again). The others are mediocre or above average (Legatus was also good). Directing also became bad. Too many slow motions (I think Spartacus only moves in slo-mo, haven't seen him in real time for a few episodes). Everyone bleeds from the mouth, even for a cut at the thigh!! *true fact* But what is more important is the fact that I mentioned earlier, that the ones that gave up first were the script writers. They turned a great show into a damn soap opera. Season 2 grade: 3/10 Season 3: I would not watch it after the disappointment of the second season, but my girlfriend was watching and I had nothing to do so I sat and watched. Now Spartacus has made an army of misfits and ex-slaves against the Roman empire and he is the general in command. OK, lets see how it goes (only 2 episodes aired so far). At least now they have created the character of Krassos, a rich, ambitious Roman, that outmatches everyone we have ever seen in cunningness, ability, skill etc (even skillful as a gladiator). Finally they realized this series needs a worthy opponent. So I hope it will at least be better that the previous season. We'll just have to wait and see.",

'Spartacus' is very similar in style to '300' and story wise to 'Gladiator, and would be pointless watching if you are not a fan of either. Actors, colours, choreography are all top notch, the must have spent a fortune doing this.Overall really is just one of those shows you just have to let go and enjoy it for what it is, Blood, Gore, Extreme Violence, Nudity in Excess, and the C-Word in Abundance...if you can, you will be in for one hell of a ride.Simply Spectacular.",

            "content": "I could probably go on for days talking about all the things I love about the Spartacus series, but for the sake of my fellow IMDb users I'll keep it as short as possible. After careful consideration I have created 3 main reasons why audiences everywhere are getting hooked on this show.1). Spartacus himself: If the movie series is a proverbial arena, then Spartacus must be the gladiator that breathes life into it. The audience is instantly drawn to him because of his \"human qualities\" just like of all us, he feels pain, sorrow, joy and anger. This is a true underdog story, about a man (with all the odds in the world against him) who rose from nothingness and became a hero. Audiences love this man, because he is just that...a man, who just happens to be a total bad-ass. The writers do a wonderful job portraying Spartacus's pain and joys, making him more of a lovable character.2). The Whole Cast of Characters: Even though Spartacus may be center stage, he is certainly not alone. Each character has their own story, complete with their own ambitions and challenges. I can describe the series as a clever web of plots-each character spinning their own string of twists and turns. There is a beautiful contrast between those deviant Romans, who are constantly maneuvering for higher position, and with Spartacus along with the other gladiators/slaves who maneuver for survival and freedom. All of the characters serve a purpose, none are out of place, and you can't dislike any of them. You either love them, or you love to hate them.3). The Brutal Honesty: Spartacus is what it is. And what it is, is a portrayal of ancient Roman life. The story is based on actual events that occurred in the Roman empire around the year 73 B.C. So naturally this series has a bit of a dark side. Was there frequent and public sex in ancient Rome? Yes. Was there brutal, unforgiving violence in ancient Rome? Yes. Back then these things were accepted as just a part of life, so the producers were right not to shy away from them. But what makes this show special is that everything has a purpose. Every sex scene, and every killing serves to establish the next plot line, or conclude a previous one. While it's true Spartacus may not for everyone, the show at least deserves a chance, you may be surprised at how quickly you become accustomed to it's brutal reality. You may even come to expect such things just as audiences everywhere have. Overall this is a well written, well produced, and well acted series.",

            "content": "I was really looking forward to the premier of a gladiator movie/series that had the look of 300, the name of a classic movie, and the nuance of another soon to be classic Gladiator. However, I found the premier episode to be a bit over indulgent on the gratuitous violence and soft core porn to be taken seriously on the same level as the aforementioned movies or for that matter HBO's Rome (character development people). I do believe there is promise for this series as I am a fan of most sword and sandals movies (also a fan of most biblical films such as The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur) and hope that it will have a successful run that will please everyone who enjoys the genre. I would like to point out that trying to make a series that looks like 300(not that the acting was Oscar worthy) and putting the name Spartacus on it... won't do it. The acting was OK, the battle/fight scenes were good (except for the 3 gallons of blood spewed from minor wounds)and I did get wound up for the arena scene once it got there. I just wish I would have gotten a little more character depth instead of a slow motion stallion rearing in the air which we've already seen before. Overall, the series needs some work. Blood (lots of it), and boobs(lots of them) probably won't carry the show from episode to episode but who knows I'm sure I'll keep watching to see what happened next.",

            "review_title": "Underrated show after the End of Andy Whitfield",
            "content": "I don't even really know where to start with this review. I'm not going too be complex on the words to write as if I'm a vivid movie \"reviewer\" but I know entertainment and a good show. Spartacus is certainly that. Since the beginning of this shows start... I have been amazed at the fight scenes, storyline, rich acting, cinematography, chosen actors, progression, climaxes, fear, sadness, shock, riveting scenes, drive and boldness to do a story of a man who went from the very bottom of the totem pole to the top in a historical event that will end God knows how.I didn't know much of the history behind Spartacus and the ways of the Romans and their movement and corruption too. But this show has brought too light a lot that hasn't really been portrayed in such a way. A feeling like \"300\" and storyline strong like \"ROME\". Nevertheless the show is of its own caliber in so many ways. As I'm on the 4th episode of War of Damned which may be one of the hardest episodes to watch knowing how this adds up to the end many historians have spoke concerning Spartacus movement, I have seen that the people I know have given up on this excellent show for a sad reason. Andy Whitfield was a major priority to the strength of this show in his presence and acting. He led this show with such prowess that we all are sad to his leaving of this world (He died of cancer). But for the producers, writers, the director and Starz to allow this to continue is a major present to us all. This story had to continue and they made a bold move in replacing the original Spartacus with a new one to keep it moving. Liam Mcyntire has taken a role that is hard to fill and because there are many unsatisfied and unrealistic TV show watchers... this movie can't even make it past 9 in rating due to them replacing Andy Whitfield. He is doing SUCH a amazing job in his place and is maybe on the same level as Andy as Spartacus. But the show is more than Liam Mcyntire's role as Spartacus.Again, this show is a movement for this historical piece. Crixus played by Manu Bennett, Peter Mensah as Doctore, Lucy Lawless as Lucretia, Ashur played by Nick Tarabay and so many others that take a actual role of those that played part in the history of the grand scale of a act for valor. They help more than enough to make this show one of the greatest of all time. I hate more than anything people who will give up on a show that everything you can desire in a adult program is depicted in. You have to watch this or continue it past (for those that have stopped) the Andy Whitfield Spartacus, so you can have memory of something special. I wish I could give more detail into why this show is amazing and needs the support to be watched by all that are mature and adult. To give more into this story for those who can handle all it will throw at you but that will give away the many surprises in store for a good watch (No Spoiler from me but you can get a idea of what you in store for by doing a background check about Spartacus rebellion against the Romans slavery). Spartacus is more than battle and wit but of courage, bravery, endurance, pity and knowledge into how far people will go for so called glory and what one will do to make the glory right. Don't just take my review and compare to Newsweekly, Entertainment, Roger Ebert, Rotten Tomatoes would say but just watch and give the show a chance, even past Andy Whitfield. Liam Mcyntire is a practical choice for a sad leaving of the original but he will give us the Spartacus that all that have reason and logic will understand and root for. Thank You....

If you are looking for a series with a poor script, lots of unnecessary sadistic violence, explicit sex no necessarily between man and woman and litres of blood, bad words in almost every phrase, bad taste -to say it softly- dialogs (sorry -did I say dialogs?) and total lack of historical accuracy you've come to the right place: this series are right for you. This have been said, it is a shame some money has been wasted producing this kind of trash but it is even shaming lots of people like it and it should make us think about where the (human?) race is going to. Humm, let's analyze it: here we have a story about a bunch of heroes...err. well, not exactly, better say real people...well, not much real really but...let's say simply people who have and ideal -to be free. But, just a minute. This is not their main reason to fight - because they fight, that's it! They fight! This is certain. So let's start again: this is the story of a fighting bunch of people who fight for their ideals...well, not exactly, but that is not important really, because you are not watching these series looking to identify yourself with any of them -well at least I hope not, since many of them are clearly psychopaths- but because of...having a good time? (Better redefine the concept good to yourself if this is the case). And romans and slaves spent the day having sex and killing other people -mostly for fun, and when there are no enemies around...well, they could always could kill the neighbor- gosh, I forgot they already killed them some chapters ago- or someone passing by. You can also learn about politics - ejem- and..and...well that they had a lot of sex and violence-sorry, did already mention that? Well, better do not keep analyzing it. In fact, you do not need to justify why watching rubbish and enjoy it...or maybe you should.",

            "content": "The wait is over. Starz has made the first episode of Spartacus: Vengeance available for viewing on their website, not only for free but also a week earlier than its expected premiere date (January 27th)! If you are new to the Spartacus series, you probably want to start with Spartacus: Blood and Sand but be warned, this show is not for everyone. It contains a lot of raw, vulgar, sex scenes, with a huge amount of cursing and a lot of bloody, gory fight sequences\u2014although those are precisely the reasons (along with an incredible storyline and great acting) why Spartacus: Gods of the Arena made it to the No.2 spot on my Top 10 TV Shows of 2011 list.The show left off in Season 1 on a really high note with the closing scene where Spartacus gives the \"We will make Rome tremble!!!\" speech and the Season 2 premiere starts off with a pretty intense opening scene that doesn't disappoint. The story takes place a few weeks after Season 1, Spartacus and his group of escaped Gladiators are causing ruckus in Capua. We are treated to a pretty awesome fight sequence with Spartacus taking on a group of mercenaries on horses that is apparently sent by new character, Seppius, a young noble. Returning Spartacus fans will be happy to see the usual cgi blood, slow motion, 360 degree camera spins and gory fighting style that we've grown accustomed to. The story is now opened up to the whole outside world of Capua, it was refreshing to see fight sequences that didn't just take place in the Ludus and arena.I guess the main question people will be asking is how does newcomer, Liam McIntyre hold up as the titular character. To his credit, he carries the role of Spartacus pretty well or as well as he could since he's got some really, really big shoes to fill. He definitely looks believable as a gladiator and manages to bring the honourable, just and humble characteristics that Andy Whitfield brought to Spartacus. However, I still think fans will prefer Whitfield's Spartacus. There's something about Whitfield's Spartacus, maybe it's his eyes or demeanour that just brought so much more intensity and humility than McIntyre's Spartacus. Having said that, I think McIntyre's Spartacus definitely feels different but it's not necessarily a bad thing, just different. I have no doubt that fans will learn to love his Spartacus as the season continues.Please read the full Episode Review at: http://www.thetvsamurai.com/search/label/Spartacus",

To do this review, I'm going to break it up into two main parts; Spartacus Blood and Sand & Spartacus Vengeance. Spartacus Blood and Sand (9.5/10) .:Plot & Twists:. -Absolutely fantastic. Steven has created a perfect balance of drama and action. I can't say enough of how tremendous it is. Each episode will leave you wanting for more and more! .:Acting & Characters:. -To put it simply, fantastic. Even with a dozen characters roaming around, there is no lack of professional acting. Andy, Manu and Lucy really spearhead the way and invoke the imagination. -Now, onto the characters. I have to say, the characters are amazing once again (shocker, eh?). Both Spartacus and Crixus share the sand as near equal rivals, each with their own personality and agenda. Never once did I favor Spartacus, to my surprise. Lucretia, Batiatus and a host of other characters make a strong drama filled backing to the inter-Gladiator events. .:Action:. -Bloody, to put it simply. Though it does not overkill on blood, if you were not a fan of the level of gore that a movie such as 300 had, then you might not be fond of this. Overall very well done. Spartacus Vengeance (7/10) .:Plot & Twists:. -Solid. Unlike the previous, Vengeance does not do as fantastic as a job as its predecessor. The Season starts off in a oddly dysfunctional environment and goes on a fairly linear path. It does not start to get truly enticing until the mid-late part of the season where tensions rise and it gets interesting. The ending is very satisfying and is very redeeming. .:Acting & Characters:. -Acting was marvelous. Really well done, with the exception of Andy's successor, Liam. Liam did his best, I can tell but he clearly did not fit the role. -Now, the characters were mixed. Both good, and not so good. Spartacus seemed to lack proper leadership skills, Crixus was mopey and plainly lacked his Gladiator prowess (not sure why), Gannicus was the neutral party, \"Doctore\" was mentally unstable and it was just a mix of emotions. On the Roman side, tensions sky-rocketed to a whole new level and was very amusing. More so, then the Gladiator counterpart. The inclusion Asher and the Egyptian were much needed and refreshing. .:Action:. -Meh. Not nearly as action packed as the previous seasons (by a long shot). Romans were like sheep to the slaughter (which was amusing at first, but got old) and the Gladiator on Gladiator fights were sparse (to be expected). Though there were some redeeming scenes particularly near the end. Overall decent job.",

I absolutely love every second of it but my favorite is Lucy Lawless as Lucretia and her badass sexy self and watching her in Xena changed my life! She can really do anything and can make any role her unique own! She is so naturally georgous and really pushes her limits and shows her magnificent genuine talents as a real goddess in my eyes and I just think she is the best actor of all time and the greatest human being in real life! She will always have my heart! And just love all the great special effects and slow motion shots of this series with all the blood but tastefully done as a real biography to history and this time period...the whole cast and crew has just out done them selves to the fullest!!! And I'm a female and absolutely love all the graphic violence and emotions put into this series. Nothing else even compares to the limits and boundaries in its raw true nature as it depicts ancient Rome and what gladiators endored and its ruthlessness from this time period!!!! If you haven't watched it you are missing out on true raw art from this milacious time period in history and shown how it really was so brutal!!! Also it just captivates me the love Spartacus and Sura had for one another...physically and emotionally...so powerful a love two people shared with such passion and living for each other...it's just so sad and disappointing how she got taken from him and how Spartacus gives it his all but still dies in the end! Just wish every terrible thing he fought for was him living in the end!!! He didn't deserve to die for he was the definition of what all men should shrive to be in life!!! Still a great depiction of his life and memory!!!",

More than likely, after having witnessed the first sex scene, they turned off the TV and commenced writing a review describing the horrible event. In contrast, this show presents nothing but pure quality. Indeed the sets at times appear to be cheap, and the blood spillage excessive, yet nonetheless the show prevails on account of its fantastic writing. This is why the show is not as shallow as these reviewers claim it to be, for it has a very exciting and intriguing story, that is guaranteed to have you hooked, if you can look past the sex and gore.On a side note I would like to address the sex and violence that appears in this show. Like in show Rome, sex and violence are found commonplace. However, I believe that these elements portray a realistic and interesting atmosphere, that ancient Rome most certainly pertained to. It would be absurd to write a show based in ancient Rome, and expect its society to be completely like ours. For in these times, sex and violence were actually a very common thing!

Whether the film USES it as a selling point to make money on gimmicks is another matter. In my opinion, the plot line is very clear, the plot twists and turns, of course, some details are not surprising, because to reflect the era itself is very challenging.Back in history, why did spartacus rise up? Why try to lead slaves out of the apennines? In fact, the reason is consistent with the previous two Sicilian slave revolts - where there is oppression, there is resistance, and when this oppression becomes unbearable, it will be expressed in the form of violence, either your death or my death. So we don't need to focus on women's legs and blood to appreciate this film, and maybe we can understand more about the biggest slave uprising in ancient history.",

Most of the fighting looks good at first,but after a couple of fights you see the pattern in it.=wide telegraphic blows,and never go for the unprotected feet,always give opponent time to gather himself and stand up,after he had been sent to the ground.Just so you can prolong the fight scene. People in here complain about the all the cussing.Make no mistake the series is full of it.Every Other word is F this and C & ball up your a** But what bothers me the most is the endless mind numbing babbling from actors who look bored.Though in all fairness their character is suppose to look rich and bored,there's just too much of it. Only broken by an occasional sword fight or an orgy, just so you won't change channel. It pick up the pace a bit midway during second and third season but not enough to save it for me. Spartacus fights too fair, when he should have fought as dirty as can. and too primitive for the story to work.And the cgi is still crap.The whole thing is like watching rocky vs the roman empire. Rocky always win. They always hold long speeches before killing someone,or pause in the midst of the battle.That was what annoyed me the most. The whole stop and pause in the middle of a battle against overwhelming odds,just so the hero can take a smaller flesh wound. Oh did I forget to mention that every little nick & cut spout fountains of blood.The material is there,so it could've been good.But they ruin it with too much dialog and too much fake blood and slow motion where its never needed.And a severe lack of tactic.The only battle I ever saw tactic in was the last one *******warning spoiler******spoiler******* ****spoiler^****** Where Spartacus dies in the end simply because he pauses,when she should have killed his opponent. conclusion.Watch if you wanna see Lucy Lawless/Xena the warrior princess T&A and full frontal.

If someone gets sliced and diced their insides bare no resemblance to what the inside of human limbs, necks and torsos actually look like. The blood looks nothing like blood (they couldn't even get the shade of red right!!!) and has the consistency of colored water! The acting is fine, especially when John Hannah lights up the screen with his polished delivery of the lines that they gave him. But most of the dialog seems to have been judicially edited to the point of losing the connection between the beginning of a speech and the end of it. This show appears to be written for teenage boys, not adults (which explains the over use of lesbian scenes that involve full frontal nudity).

Or about the dreadful special effects and the ridiculous overuse of slow motion. And let's not forget the basic dialogs and unconvincing acting delivered by Barbies and Kens. There is nothing good in the entire series to be pointed out. Nothing is real. No appeal whatsoever.

Subject matter is the only thing that remotely connects 'Spartacus' to the vastly superior HBO drama 'Rome' or the supreme 'I, Claudius'. Quality-wise it is a lot closer to guilty-pleasure trash, whereas I could find little pleasure in watching it, to be honest.

That's why this show deserved 10/10.At least from me...As i've seen some reviews, i agree that this show is not for everyone. But not from the violence or in other words not of the blood or the fights.Yet, fights only take 1/5 or less of the runtime.The reason, i think, most of the people won't like it is that the sense of humor and the storyline is out of this world. I see this piece of art as an 'experiment'. Which is extraordinary; unique; and %100 successful for its type.As i stated, i really hated 300 because of the camera angles and the slow motion effects that really disturbed me. I'm fully aware that it was also an experiment but for me it was not a successful one.But Spartacus here gives promise because of its unmatched atmosphere and far more better slow motion effects that 300 could never satisfy me. The fight scenes... don't expect anything like Chan or jet Li movies or even the tactics of 300: This is pure and bloody and ugly fight. Neighter charismatic sword games nor acrobatics. Because in real world they hardly exists. Especially for its dark time. You kill or be killed.I cannot write any comment to the cinematography, especially the camera and slow motion effects because i couldn't find any flaw. But as i told you before it is not a 30 out of 50 minutes fight. You get the background story; why and what happened?To sum, i highly recommend this 'artwork' to anyone who wants to experience something you have never seen before. The script is not so tempting or wow but how the creators draw it... Just give it a shot. Regards.",

I keep waiting for a very muscular Fabio to come out in a loin cloth and say \"I can't believe it's not Rome\". A lot of the acting is very stiff, and the script is SO predictable! Good guy gets captured and beat up by bad guy. Good guy regains his strength, fights, and wins over bad guy. Yawn.

Battles were bloody but realistic. Spartacus grew form a soldier to a extremely good hand to hand fighting gladiator and a charismatic person. In the end off course he escaped the Ludus together with some of the gladiators after thrashing the place and killing everybody inside.Second season got a little more unrealistic, a small group of dedicated and well trained warriors can do a lot of damage as we all see on a daily base on the news in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria etc. But taking down a complete arena in the middle of a Roman occupied town??? Second season ends like it happened in history with a victory for Spartacus on the slopes of Vesuvius.Third Season.....here it gets a bit over the top. Starts to look like a B-action movie, outnumbered and out gunned \"Good-guys\" take out hundreds or thousands of Roman trained soldiers (\"Bad-guys\") with only minor losses... It's even getting a bit slapstick to watch Spartacus, Crixus and Gannicus running toward Roman formations (known for being impenetrable) and just jumping on top of them hacking and slashing cutting them down by the numbers.. For me personally the rebels have also lost my sympathy after roaming, pillaging and killing \"innocent Romans\" just minding their business, specially after the taking of the City Sinuessa when they murdered everybody except a handful of Romans. It got a bit over the top, I'm waiting for the final episode now only because I'm curious how the producers are going to kill this historical story even further...Long story short, started good but ended like a b-action slapstick movie with a lot of blood and guts.",

The storyline, the character development, the acting... all these aspects of the series were treated with unflinching precision. This is not a typical blood and sex show. All the gore, and naked flesh, a viewer can take or leave, depending on their views, but everything at the core of the series is simple beauty. Personally, I tend to think that show's depiction of sexual content is a bold and accurate portrayal of the roman culture. The absurd amount of blood on screen,adds to dramatic effect and emphasizes the cruelty and ruthlessness of powerful characters. The show is sexy, violent and captivating. Men everywhere will love it. Women everywhere should love it. For whatever reason you love it, whether it's the blood or the sex, if you look a little deeper, you'll be shocked to find that you are bearing witness to a masterpiece.",

Still \"Rome\" was another show that I loved. \"Spartacus\" has a lot more action and gore than \"Rome.\" It's funny because when I first watched \"Spartacus\" I got half way through the first episode and wasn't too impressed.

Obviously thats a bit heavy, but in my opinion it is true.I first stumbled across Spartacus about two years ago and it looked intriguing, I watched the first two episodes and wasn't very impressed so I pushed it aside and hadn't thought about it since. Just earlier this year I started catching up on the first season of another Starz original Da Vinci's Demons and was captivated. Upon start of the second season and the week long wait between new episodes I started looking at other series to watch during the wait and came across Spartacus again. I decided that whether I liked it or not I was going to watch the first season and make up my mind from there, and I'm glad I did.I do think it takes about 4-5 episodes to get completely enveloped by the story. The sex may be a bit too much for some as they do not hold back at all. The violence is less objectionable as the blood and gore clearly have a graphic novel over-the-top look.The characters are juicy and their motives are not always clear. I was completely blindsided by many twists that I did not see coming. The dialogue is shakespearean-esque mixed with some modern terms added in. The sets are beautiful to look at and you really feel that you are in the middle of the action. You will be rooting for your favorite protagonists and cursing at your favorite antagonists.I do think Spartacus is a series you should check out it you want some conniving characters, jaw-dropping story lines, brutal, stylized, fun fight scenes, and an over all feast for the eyes.",

            "content": "I decided to give this review two stars as an amalgamation of the two different series (new one coming out today) associated with it. In the first season/series, Andy Whitfield plays the titular character with enough machismo and inventiveness to make you truly care for the character. In addition, Nick Tarabay, Viva Bianca, John Hannah and Lucy Lawless make for very interesting and three-dimensional villains, all in it for themselves, but all also displaying truly human feelings of shame, pride, and even compassion. In addition, the various other gladiators have their own various issues with one another or with their owners. In all truth, the series is full of all the nudity, sex, and gratuitous violence that one can stomach and much much more. That aside, there is plenty of character and plot development to recommend a watch. Also, in addition to the messy arena deaths many of the gladiators one becomes familiar with succumb to, the treachery of the villains ends many lives as well, and one manages to care for most of the even relatively minor characters and feel the impact of their passing.Unfortunately, after the first season was filmed, Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. The producers released the fairly decent Gods of the Arena series, introducing Gannicus and a fairly new set of characters that did a decent job of keeping the continuity of the series going as well as adding some depth.The next step in the series, unfortunately, is the one that proverbially broke the camel's back. For starter's, and before I start bashing any actor in particular, it should be pointed out that by this point the series has taken a drastic turn, as we are no longer operating in arenas or at the House of Batiatus, but instead in the open and with actual battles with Romans. This change of scenery, rather than adding a fresh new look for the franchise, instead makes all the fleeing and running very repetitive and boring. In addition, Glaber makes a very poor substitute for John Hannah's ambitious Batiatusn as a villain.Finally, most of the characters from the original series are, by this point, either played by a different actor (unavoidably in the case of Spartacus) or dead at this point of time, and all the new main characters (Meera especially in this case) are one-dimensional and played very poorly. In addition, there are only so many times the new Spartacus can deliver the same speech and expect it to make any effect on the audience. By the end of the season, I was fully rooting for the Romans to get rid of Spartacus' band.If you want to take a chance on this series, I would strongly recommend the first season as well as the entertaining Gods of the Arena. You will be best served avoiding everything after that.",

I love Epics and being a fan of the Epics of the 1950's and 1960's, and the original SPARTACUS with Kirk Douglas in particular, I was very interested in what would be done with this version. I have no problem with differences in the interpretation of the story since the true history of the actual Spartacus is very sketchy. Historians know very little about many of the details in his life and the military campaigns, so I'm open to changes in one dramatic version over another. The problem I have is mainly with the production values of this version. Let's start with the script. I realize that all films cannot take the course of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE Christ and present a subtitled film with the actors speaking the original language of the historical period. Kevin Costner brilliantly used this technique as well with the Native Americans in DANCES WITH WOLVES. However, a film maker doesn't have to take it to that extreme. In the historical epics of the past, scripts were often careful to not include dialog which sounded too contemporary in order to give it the illusion of a past time. This helps the audience's acceptance of the story having taken place in times past. Ben-Hur (1959) is a good example of this. Spartacus (1960) has some dialog problems but is also, for the most part, a good example of this. That said, this version of SPARTACUS seems to go out of it's way to sound every bit like Martin Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, complete with use of the F-bomb every couple minutes along with every other contemporary expletive one might imagine, including the \"C\" word, the \"B\" word, the \"S\" word, etc. Simply put...It sounds absurd. Can we at least try to give this some semblance of ancient history. With the expletives and the grunting and groaning of the muscle bound performers during the battle scenes, it sounds and looks like the warriors originated with the WWE.Next up is the violence. I stop short of referring to the violence as exploitive, which it is, but it is SO extreme that it is silly. The use of slow motion, normal motion, slow motion, normal motion mixed with squirting blood all over the camera, all over the other actors, squirting out fast, squirting out slow from this angle and that angle is once again, absurd. It is SO overdone that one is desensitized after watching 45 minutes of the first episode. At one point a character gets punched in the face and even THAT is in slow motion. It's laughable! This viewer got the impression that this was being filmed by students in a high school film class who couldn't get enough slow motion and gory blood spilling. Most of the blood spilling is CGI anyway and looks fake.That brings up my next criticism. I highly doubt that there is one scene in this travesty that was filmed on location. EVERYTHING, including the most simple scene appears to use the CGI technique and it makes the entire production look like one massive computer game.Next we have the overuse of sex scenes which are equally as silly as the violence as they are all choreographed to look like the covers of cheap romance novels with men who look like they're from Chippendales and women who look like they stepped out of the Victoria's Secret catalog. No one looks natural. It's buffed bodies and big boobs. Because of the sexually explicit nature of some of the scenes, I can't go into detail here. I guess the tamest way to put it is that some decadent scenes appear as if they were filmed in an S&M club.This is truly an exploitive piece of garbage that falls just short of being pornography....bad acting and all, but I'm sure it will find an audience. After all, Shakespeare said it best, this kind of exploitation is there to \"Split the ears of the groundlings who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise.\"",

In fact, all characters - whatever their intentions and actions are - are very likable and their behaviour is well justified from their own twisted way of thinking. On top of the brutality of and reality of the times of slavery of the pictured times, Spartacus shows us that we are all human and we all have our own demons to fight. And yes, these series are brutal, contain violence, blood and hardcore sex, but it is just a cherry on top of a great story and dialogue, winning my heart over Game of Thrones any time of the day.The first season is just a masterpiece of plot twists and tension, which - if watched alone - makes for a perfect story on its own. The effects and lighting are what may put you off, but bare with it, it gets better, although never perfect. However, it is all worth it in the end for the best story you will ever see.",

Who can resist all those beefy men sweating and leering at each other? Anyway, I stray. I was a fan of HBO's \"Rome\". Amazing actors, top notch names, great writing, great art direction, wit, sex....the whole bit. So, I embraced the two previous seasons of \"Spartacus\". Great actors, great scripts, great sex, great art direction. I think the basic story line is also appealing. The underdogs against the bosses.When I watched the prequel second season (Gods of the Arena) I was very pleased to see the same quality as the first season (Blood and Sand). I mourned the passing of Andy Whitfield, but frankly I was totally taken with Dustin Clare as Gannicus. He was brash and even funny...not to mention seductively sexy.This third installment is a bitter disappointment. Liam MacIntyre is a real letdown as Spartacus. He broods well, but lacks fire and intelligence. Frankly, he looks like he climbed out of an office cubicle, not the 1st century BCE. And the lack of a solid villain, like John Hannah, makes Lucy Lawless' Lucretia much less effective. Craig Parker's Glaber is wooden and one-dimensional. Viva Bianca is truly evil as Ilythia, but her character isn't very well developed in the writing.It's probably all about the writing. Just not up to the standards of the previous seasons. The effects are the usual, but this show illustrates that blood splatters are best left to \"Dexter\" as a plot element rather than a central theme.

From what is a reasonably capable cast (some more capable than others) comes see-through emotion and cheesy one-liners; a perfect example of poor script writing and mediocre direction. John Hannah really carries this series through and if it were not for his efforts it would scarcely be considered watch-able. Almost (but still not) convincing CGI and meagre sets highlight the lack of budget, which would be forgivable were it not for the fact that 'spectacle' is what the series is promoting.

I'm aching to see the revolt Spartacus led that came very close to overthrowing one of the greatest empires on earth, but until then I'm well pleased with the love, passion, intrigue and violence that the writers choose to offer us, portrayed by an array of fine actors.The more puritanical may be offended - the values they hold dear had not been invented in roman times, and I'm glad they chose not to depict yet another HollyRome, but be prepared for sex and violence in abundance.

I do not subscribe to Starz but have been watching it on Netflix. As some others have said here, do not expect a \"Rome\" type series which was on HBO. I saw that as well and liked it better than any mini-series I have seen. Spartacus is meant to be a modernized violent lusty cartoon style version of the story and is filmed in that modern slow-mo style. I would think many more males will like it than females. Very little is known about Spartacus so do not expect historical accuracy much. I do have some negative comments. They really did not need the vulgar language as much. I highly doubt the use of it draws viewers nor were the Romans known to use it that much (I've studied Roman history most of my life). Some script lines almost seemed sillier with the vulgar words in than when I repeated them in my own head without them. Definite over use there. The amount of nudity was not really needed although there were some hot women on there and I didn't mind. But it was not all needed to keep either viewers or the intensity of the story. A little less would have worked fine. At some points it actually got old. My final negative comment concerns some of the fight scenes. They were fine except very inconsistent! Spartacus would be thrown a little and seemingly not be able to get up for minutes yet when hit full force in a slow motion shot with a weapon to the face, he continued to fight and not even fall down. This was getting more irritating than anything in the series. It is fine to stylize fights and make them larger than life, but keep some consistency that at least resembles real life.",

And since this series has received such a high rating (8.8), there must be a lot of people out there who like blood spurting all over the place and soft porn scenes at every other turn. Gets the blood flowing, eh mate (uh, figuratively speaking of course). And oh, those skies over Batiatus' villa. Almost always ominous scudding clouds or dark and gloomy. Makes it seem almost like a supernatural horror flick. The location is supposed to be Capua, near Naples. Southern Italy, you know. Hey I guess back then sunshine there was less frequent. Maybe Vesuvius had recently erupted and spewed up a bunch of ash into the air.Any good points? I found the rendition of 1st century BC Capua with its narrow streets, animals being driven to market, slave sales in the street, the open public latrines where passersby could relieve themselves, the rather primitive amphitheater typical for that time and so forth sufficiently convincing as were the costumes. Did all Romans treat their slaves like subhuman chattel? Some did. Some didn't. Batiatus was clearly one that did.Re the gladiatorial games depicted, most fights to the death were between convicted criminals, not gladiators. Think about it. A man purchasing a slave and having him trained as a gladiator meant that a significant amount of money was invested in the guy.* He was expected to fight skillfully and display his courage in the face of possible death. He was, however, generally not expected to die (kind of like losing a bundle in the stock market). Of course some gladiators did die in the amphitheater, but their chief purpose was to entertain the spectators with skillful fighting, not die a bloody death. Gladiators that lacked skill or showed cowardice were allowed to be killed.The chief problem I have with this series though is there's a lot more to life, even among the Romans, than blood spurting all over the place and soft porn scenes at every other turn. But you won't find it in Spartacus. The characters are pretty one-dimensional. The HBO/BBC series Rome, which takes place chronologically about twenty-five years later, captures ancient Rome with its political and social complexities a lot better that Spartacus does. Admittedly I've only watched Season 1 of Spartacus, and perhaps the series improves in its later seasons. Right now though the series seems aimed chiefly at the high-on-adrenaline crowd.4/10 * BTW there were female gladiators also. Not as many as men, but they did exist.",

            "content": "I bought this series thinking about the \"Rome\" series from HBO and the 1960's \"Spartacus\". Big mistake! While the graphical effects by themselves can impress video games fans and teenagers, and the graphics artist did a good job depicting liquids in motion, there is NOTHING for an intelligent audience. The graphics and the boring slow motion is copying everything from the movie \"300\" and gets incredibly repetitive. You basically see gallons of blood flying in the air in slow motion, like people would be some soft of bags full of liquid ready to burst and spill at every impact. And then the gross historically inaccuracies. Basically, the movie starts with the Thracians under Roman occupation, and in the situation where are they get raided by no one else but the Getae, a Thracian tribe, basically their brothers. The Getae, while considered barbarians by the Romans due to their own ignorance, were quite civilized, though feared warriors nonetheless. The Getae end up being depicted as some sort of masked savages, with stone axes, coming from the forests to sack villages and rape Thracian women. They look more like Germanic tribes, maybe Goths, or maybe some stone age people from a different age! While historically, the Getae were riding the Romans and trying to help their Thracian brothers. The Thracians are depicted more like Spartans (maybe because sounds similar with Spartacus?) wearing the stereotypical English longs swords which doesn't belong to this place and time, when in reality both Thracians and their kin, the Getae, used to wear Phrygian caps, clothing (yes!), had horses, and above all, curved swords called falx and sica. And these are just some scenes in the first episode! So much for history! And then the dialogue reminds me of porn movies (...) I think this series is only suitable for uneducated teenagers and shallow, immature adults, maybe to some computer geeks, looking to see some blood, soft porn and adventure packaged in a very stereotypical and ignorant fashion. Unfortunately these days so many movies and series head in this direction where graphics replace acting, dialogue, historical facts, directing, everything! All we watch is violent computer games.

They make a weak effort of subterfuge but you can tell who hates who and who's not going to make it to the end. Sadly this show lacks surprises. Gratuitous sex scenes and blood, though well filmed, get old. It's like \"ooh let's shock and awe them with dry humping and blood fountains!!\" was the main plot synopsis and the characters were just Spackle and bric-a-brac. Lucy Lawless' character's legs up by that dude's head (in one of her few dry hump scenes) was hilarious. For a better series in that era watch \"Rome\", for a better gladiator flick watch \"Gladiator\", for nice use of slow motion fight scenes watch \"300\", not sure if the producers were aiming at any or all of these but somehow got lost along the way. This series is the equivalent of pop corn, fun for a snack, gets sickening if you eat too much and is not a very good substitute for a good meal.

From what I can tell he was a fine actor at still a young age with decades of acting still ahead of him.I still have about half of the episodes of the season to watch, and it will be with a sting of sadness to see them now. However, I still look forward to it as the series is of such a high quality and plan to portion them out to enjoy them to the fullest!

I know some people have been put off by the some of the fight scenes but to me they are a minor quibble when compared to the overarching storyline. As for the sex and nudity, they *say* it's to give the show a sense of historical authenticity, which is debatable. However I didn't find it to be gratuitous at all.Lawless and Hannah do an excellent job, as does Whitfield of course, but the supporting cast is equally good and compelling.

Well after watching all of the 13 episodes (very fast) I can honestly say that \"Rome\" has an enemy and it is Spartacus: Blood And Sand!First let me get rid of the bad things. I feel that the nudity does feel a bit forced at times. And the actresses are all too beautiful. In \"Rome\" there were some that were not but in this show every girl gets nude and they are like supermodels (though seeing the ex XENA star Lucy Lawless topless is a good thing in this section)!Now for the good things. every actor plays his role perfectly! I especially like John Hannah who plays the \"dominus\" in this show. He was arrogant, eccentric , cruel yet likable. Andy Whitfield also did a fine job portraying the man who eventually led the slaves to freedom (not a spoiler, historical fact). Lucy Lawless was also good and the role suited her. Even the characters like Crixus and Doctore were very well portrayed. The visual effects were brilliant though the amount of blood spilled can be bothersome to some. But what really makes this show great is the historical accuracy. Every known fact about Spartacus is in this show (from his wife being a prophet to Crixus and Doctore) and this is a new thing because it is rare to see a show with such historical accuracy to be that good and interesting.Sadly only 13 episodes have been aired, but the creators are promising more!

It became a much more accurate (well not as accurate as HBO's Rome) portrayal of a society extremely different from our own, where what we now considered morals were non-existent. Remember this happens before Christianity and widespread Judaism, so morality is of a different nature.The show is violent, bloody, almost pornographic and extremely incorrect from a 21st century political point of view, but at the same time it feels fresh, bold and unchained by the conventions most shows shove down our throats. It's as much a step forward in TV shows and BG was a few years ago. The characters are maybe not as humanized as we are used to, but considering the period they have the level of depth required (with a few exceptions - Crixus and Doctore which I find a bit bland).Combat is bloody, over the top and uncensored, this is not a show you should let your 10 year old watch. Sex is treated as just another commodity, human flesh is bought and sold by the pound.The writing starts off weak but as you gain accustomed to the style (which matches the writings of the period to a degree) it begins to grow on you. The different speech patterns and expressions help with immersion, help transport you to the society that, along with Greece, gave birth to our modern Western civilization.My only complaint, besides the slow start, is actually about the main character.

The special effects are great, the fights are awesome, the cast is impressive (worth to mention John Hannah, Lucy Lawless, Viva Bianca, Andy Whitfield, Dustin Clare, Katrina Law, Manu Bennett, Liam McIntyre,Lesley Ann-Brandt and Craig Parker), i hope desperately Spartacus return in all it's glory for more seasons and prequels, the show mixes historical events with great action packed scenes and revenge plots, it's like 300, but 1000 times better.",

As for season 3 of Blood & Sand, I do not think it will have has many viewers as the previous seasons had once before, Losing its major contender Andy is going to be hard on the television series. I myself, do not care to really watch it. But i will give starz a chance for the first couple of episodes. The least they could have done is got a replacement that looks like Andy.

            "content": "The show Spartacus blood and sand is an action adventure type of show, great for people that love ancient times, ancient Rome and amazing visual effects combined with outstanding actions scenes. I think that the ones disappointed with the show expected a real portrait of life at that time, they don't really understand the graphic novel look.The story follows the misfortune of Spartacus who was betrayed by the roman's,pulled into slavery to end up as a gladiator. Spartacus a name that we find on our history bocks as a man that defied Rome's will. The action is awesome using the same type of techniques of the movie 300 witch by the way the actor Peter Mensah that plays Xerxes messenger the one that Leonidas kicks into the pit as he says the famous phrase \"This is Sparta!\" plays the role of the gladiator trainer. Spartacus blood and sand is not for all ages, there's a huge amount of violence and of course multiple sex scenes and nudity a reflect of the ancient roman morals so different from our own now. Usually when we have something so driven to visual and physical details we end up with a lack of acting skills, but this is not the case here. Jonh Hannah (from the mummy movies 1, 2 and 3) plays Batiatus the owner of the ludus of gladiators. Jonhs character is a multilayer villain the kind that hides his cruelty under a charming personality. Lucy lawless is another fine example, she plays Batiatus wife a woman so different from the hero Xena warrior princes that she played years ago. I find this show so good that it leaves me hungry for more episodes every time I finish seeing one. We never know in witch direction it will go next, no one is safe from death or any other fate so they take away that safety net that makes us positive the hero's will always prevail.",

The last two are sexually explicit and we like that. So when he suggested Spartacus I thought this was just another gory series--sex wouldn't be enough. Indeed, by the end of Series 1 Episode 1 I said: Yes, looks interesting but a few sex scenes and computer generated scenes are not going to be enough to keep us interested.But I decided to give it a try for the next 1-2 episodes, considering the great reviews. It turned out that the fake landscapes via computer and the fake dripping of blood from episode 1 could be easily overlooked for the wonderfully absorbing story over the next 30+ episodes.To add to above, this series was the best introduction to the ancient Rome's society.We just finished watching the last episode of the last season (Season 3, episode 10).

If you cannot stomach the amount of nudity and gore that this series has to offer then best not watch it at all, however I will say you would be missing a treat!I'm really glad to see Starz trying to relive that era of history/myth, in such a bold manner. Story of gladiators and their lives in their Ludus (Gladiator Training Grounds) and the events that take place when a certain man comes to try and defy all of the natural order. Andy Whitfield was a phenomena, the depth of his acting and connection with the character was well what the show needed, and surprising enough I don't usually see a series where everyone is so unique to their characters and connect just as strongly. The entire casts seemed to have gotten a degree of some sort because they all did an outstanding job portraying their characters. The dialogs in the series have revolutionized the way of roman dialect! The way they speak alone, in poetic, yet vulgar, tongues just gets you thinking and wanting to say the same things because it sounds beautiful. Batiatus being the most Shakespearean with his dialect is one of the best villains around, in the series and even in whole of television. I was so disappointed to see him killed off the show at the end, however glad to have been able to see him again in the next prequel mini series that is \"Gods of the Arena\" Brilliant Show!

I really loved the epic battles in 300, and in Spartacus it's really all about those. You'll see limbs flying around, people being decapitated and during all of this there will be Quentin Tarantino-like amounts of blood flying literally everywhere.Spartacus is not a refined tale about the struggle of becoming a top-gladiator; It's all about the brute and hard fights to get there.

And the photography, camera angles and movements are not enough elements to help me continuing this show. Maybe it deserves to be seen, maybe, but in a TV show, aesthetics are very important, more than in a two hours film. I like new characters arriving regularly in a TV show, every season or every six or seven episodes, arriving and dying too, maybe there was this kind of scheme here, maybe, but I repeat, the way of filming jeopardizes this perspective. Why slow motion is so obligatory? To attract blood thirsty audiences? I belong to this kind of goons, I admit, but not this way, too obvious for my taste. But, I repeat, that's not a bad show.

That's about it in a nutshell. They portray the people of Rome like some wild beasts and the women all hang their breasts out while they scream and eat bread.. I guess it wasn't really the point of the maker to portray a story based upon truth. It's brought to the viewer like a myth, distasteful and vulgar. The lines are kind of cheesy and not at all truth based. There were some plus points though: - the acting wasn't that bad.. it was OK. - the special effects were kind a cool.

            "content": "There seems to be a tendency in making \"historical\" television shows that excessive cursing and full frontal male and female nudity equates to \"authenticity\". \"Rome\", as a perfect example, had massive amounts of f-bombs and the like, yet managed to balance it out with a very well developed script and adherence to historical sources and events, making it very accurate in its portrayal of the way events were perceived by contemporaries and modern historians. One can never get 100% accuracy, so certain elements are always sacrificed on the altar of entertainment. A fact that can be easily accepted if it's done properly. Deadwood took the cursing a bit too far for my taste, but I suppose people of that era had less class. Spartacus: Blood and Sand, takes it to a ridiculous level. Not because of the frequency but because of the way it is incorporated into the extremely wooden dialogue, which frankly tries much too hard to be \"authentic\". There are good elements in it, though. Lucy Lawless and John Hannah are well cast and fight to elevate the bad writing to something more acceptable. Whitfield is not horrible but not a vision either. The main problem with this particular show lies in what came before it. I have seen those who state that you cannot compare this to \"Rome\" even though it has obviously been spawned by a wish to create a show of equal quality, much like many writes attempted to create the new \"Lost\", which never really succeeded. \"Spartacus\" tries to combine the intrigues and well-written script of \"Rome\" with the macho images and fighting from \"300\", yet the graphics department on this show were either not very talented, ill-instructed or poorly funded. Or maybe even all three because the CGI is horrible. It looks like the cinematics of computer games from the mid-1990s and while they looked awesome then, now, they look old-fashioned and less realistic. Additionally, it hurts itself by drawing inspiration from \"300\", which was really, really, really bad. I mean super horrible. The constant slow motion fight scenes and super-buffed and oiled men gets old really fast. Bottom line is, that \"Spartacus\" had the potential for being fantastic. Had they brought in more inspiration from \"Rome\" and the original \"Spartacus\", with Kirk Douglas, instead of letting itself be diluted with the unmitigated crap that excretes from \"300\", it could have brought us a great spectacle, which would have been utterly enjoyed. Instead, you find yourself waiting for it to end, so you can move on to better things. Ducktales, perhaps.",

He is unfortunately replaced by a less talented actor. Same thing goes for Naevia and her replacement is even worse. Indeed it seems like the overall quality has taken a serious dive. The dialogue is stiff and pompous. Probably meant to sound like something out of Homer, but merely coming out as terribly bad grammar. They try to compensate by giving us even more outrageous battles, but it soon gets kinda old. Warriors flying through the air shouting \"AAAAAARRRRRRHHHHH\", more blood and gore in slow motion, (I can't even begin to imagine how many gallons of fake blood were used), and no really good villain since season 2.

They tried to make it shocking an grab an audience with the swearing but it wasn't consistent let me explain. One second the character spoke in almost old English and the next the same person would use an cockney accent and say c**t. Now in those days they wouldn't have used those words and instead they would have used different phrases relevant to there time. Fair enough they makes tried to make the show relevant to now, but they relied to much on special effect and didn't bother to get the talent. If a actor plays the role of a soldier in very well spoken English then they shall be consistent. Now i have no problem with cursing an nudity and blood all that is great but with out the acting talent that was need from majority of the cast it was over compensating with the special effect which were no doubt very good, even though sometimes the back drop was below average.

Basically if the sight of blood makes you sick and wanna puke then don't watch this. The other thing that I thought the director pointed out in the special features is that he wanted to take the story of Sparticus, the only very little that we know of him, take the entire Roman times and put it all into our society. The thing is, in reality the Romans weren't that much different from us today. They were just as ruthless and dirty like parts of our society is today. They practiced and faced many of the issues that we face today. They had their own religious, and secular believers out of their religion back in the day like we see now in our world and time. They were just as corrupt and strong in their day like we are in our time right now. Thats just a few things to compare with. In the show you are seeing the Romans in their every day life doing the same kind of things that we do in our daily lives today. That society really is not that different from ours today.Now I always give credit to originality. So movies like Quo Vadis, The Robe, Sparticus (1960's version), Ben Hurr and so many others are good movies. However Hollywood romanticized the Roman empire a little too much. So its really good to see someone step up to the plate and make a show that basically shows that the Rome that most of us grew up watching on film really was not so...soft and pretty. And thats what I like about Sparticus blood and sand.",

Normally, one might hold out hope for later redemption whilst viewing a disappointing premiere of a new mini-series. But, in this case, one is left with the great? expectation that mediocre CGI, comic-book gore, and (admittedly) very attractive breasts will be expected by those responsible to triumph over character development, plot, and historical accuracy in the battle for viewers' attention on a weekly basis. If the opener is representative of the whole, this Spartacus is not only an embarrassment to the memory of the classic film, it should not even be spoken of in the same sentence as a mini-series like Rome, except as a study in contrasts. I cannot fully express how disappointed I was. I watch a LOT of programming on premium channels, and I cannot remember seeing any series on any of them that started off this badly.",

I'm referring to the last, 2013, season) season only. The First 3 seasons were excellent in every way. If you are going to watch Season 4 expecting to see the expansive scenes, the complex character development, the Machiavellian plot twists, the political intrigue, The close connection to the actual history, and the justifiable amount of sex and violence, then you will be sorely disappointed. The graphics are overtly CGI, the plot, what I will call laughingly\" twists are transparent and uninspired, The battle scenes are ridiculous, the character development is non-existent, and the dialog is amateurish and lacks any real depth. It's almost like they ran out of money before they started this Season. Here's what you get.. Plot-Crassus hates Spartacus and kills anyone that is connected to him, cue multiple battle scenes where 3-5 Spartaconians fight 20 or 30 Romans and of course beat them all, lots of grunting and slo-mo blood splurting. Spartacus and co. kill some Romans, Cue grunting and slo-mo blood splurting, Romans chase after Spartacus and kill some of his crew, Cue grunting.... I think you get the picture... If you want to save yourself about 10 hours of disappointment....you won't be disappointed if you're <16,,aside from that, go to your nearest game rental place, rent God of War and watch the promo video before the game. After that 5 minute video you've pretty much seen all of Spartacus... Oh, unless you're after the gratuitous sex.. There's loads of that ... I'd recommend a soft-core porn, the playboy channel or some other method of seeing some T&A because at least you won't have to waste hours and hours of juvenile dialog and copious amounts of red gelatin flying around in slow motion. Bottom line, Spartacus 1, 2, and 3 are excellent, Spartacus 4...pathetic!.. (Spartacus gets killed, that's it. They could have covered what took 10 hours in less than 5 minutes at the end of last season. there I've saved you 10 hours of wasted time.",

He already showed us brilliant acting in \"The Clinic\" and \"Gabriel\" but in Spartacus he takes it one step further.

No offense to Starz in particular, because that's all TV is to me these days. Filler-time until something else comes up.I started seeing previews for Spartacus in front of my movies and was instantly intrigues and slightly troubled that they seemed to be taking notes from 300 a bit too much. A lot of people add \"Gladiator\" to the mix, but Spartacus has enough differences in story... so I disagree. However, the \"300\" inspiration is painfully obvious.Now, I liked 300 for the most part, minus that borderline pornographic sex scene... And now Spartacus is trying to take too many notes and try to fit in at least one sex scene, one set of breasts and maybe one bare penis for good measure at least in every single episode. I'll never understand this. Yes, sex happens from time to time, we get it. I'm not going to sit here and type \"Think of the children!\" because I'm a 21 year old who STILL thinks there's no room for it in this.The worst part is, they seem to be trying to hard. It's like all the sex was filmed after the REAL episode and everyone thought \"Let's just plug this in anywhere\". 90% of the sex in this has no place. Scenes like that should be used sparingly, and it's not.Pointless sex aside, the rest is admirable. Good actors, they all seem to fit in the role they're in. I don't mind the liberal use of slow-motion, but can understand how it might be annoying for some people. Like the sex, the slow-motion should get some more careful use. Still, I find it neat.The actual character development could use improvement but the story seems to be going forward rather well. I don't expect this to last more than a season or two, but it'll be a fun ride.",

            "content": "I really wanted to write this because of my admiration for Andy Whitfield. He was by all estimates in reality a good husband and father. And a hard worker. He started out in engineering and construction and was a late bloomer in show business. He went first mostly into print. He was in his mid-30's when he booked Spartacus and it was his big move. He lasted one season before being tormented and killed by cancer and dying at 39. Just terribly sad. As he told his little children, his body would not work any more he aid. He told them he was like \"a butterfly with broken wings.\" But, on to Spartacus. It's over the top. It fools the eye and does it very well. It is sometimes outrageous and over the top. It lives for one fight scene after the next and one nude scene after the next with not a whole lot in between.Put away your thoughts of Romans, historical accuracy and all that other silliness and just take it for what it is: over the top eye candy. There are places in the screenplay that are just dreadful. Slow, ,moronic and preachy. There were times I wanted to call up the directer and say,\"We get it now. You can move on with the story.\" And some of the dialog is like listening to a couple of Chicago construction workers having a beer after work. It's NOT a masterpiece. It is however very good eye candy and lots of blood and gore. Some people live for it.Now to why I check ed the spoiler alert. I won't spoil any of the plot for anyone. Go see for yourself. BUT, I spent 3 years in film school (a LONG time ago) before I decided I was better off selling condos. I made close friends with a married couple who are still in the business and expert make up artists. (Sci-fi blood and gore a specialty.) The sex scenes are FAKE my friends. Guaranteed.Remember the Seinfeld scene between Jerry and Elaine discussing \"faking it?\" One time after another she says, \"Fake, Fake, Fake.\" But that's how it is supposed to be. Without going into all the details of SAG & AFTRA regs, contract clauses and exhibitor demands here's the scoop: Frontal female scenes are almost universally done using a mer-kin. Prosthetics and socks and make up for men is very, very common. Some actors (male and female) are assigned body doubles (not stunts) for some scenes either due to restrictions negotiated by their management or due to other personal circumstances. YES, it looks real. NO in mainstream film and TV it is not. It's staged. That's what, in fact, makes it all so \"hot\" as commenter's have said.Costumers and make up artists work at this fake very hard. They protect their trade secrets. Moreover, producers and directors and even the actors want you to THINK they did all that even though they didn't. Contracts generally specify that actors and crew are prohibited from revealing what was done and how on pain of salary hits and not working.Stage work is different with different rules. And unrated stuff like Caligula, 9 Songs and Intimacy all fall into a different category (and a usually far less profitable one). So enjoy this series and think of Andy who left us all way too soon. Just don't make too much of it.",

I highly recommend this show despite different Spartacus casts. Both Andy and Liam were great. I thought some of the female characters are replaceable (like Melitta and Sybil (sp?)), but all of the male characters were very convincing. Spartacus is similar to Game of Thrones, but better, imho.

I don't swoon at the idea or sight of blood, guts, decapitations, etc. on television or in video games, nor do I think they should be banned or even regulated all that strictly.It's just that having what-looks-like gallons of blood splashed across the screen every five minutes or having 3-4 soft-sex scenes per episode does not contribute to, aid, or benefit the show in any way. It doesn't make it more realistic; it doesn't make it more entertaining (unless you're a cocooned 12-year-old seeing \"violence\" for the first time); it doesn't make the viewer feel more involved or sympathetic. It appears that such scenes are there only to shock the prissy old grannies who still care about violence on T.V. It's like: \"Hey, look at us, we've got blood galore and sex galore on a show about a historical topic. We're real f!@#ing pioneers!!\" Give me a break.And what's with the British accents?!? Has Hollywood's supply of talent and wannabe talent dried up?

For instance, the character of Crixus is played as a brute to begin with, then we see him fall in love with the gentle Naevia (beauty and the beast-type love story then develops) Crixus' affair with Naevia and their separation i'm afraid to say you do see coming.Whereas the relationship between Barca and Petros is a little less obvious. They don't play Barca as any different in his cultural setting because he is gay, but actually down-play his relationship with Petros, making it all the more shocking when Barca is killed, leaving Petros to the mercy of the other gladiators.And Varro and Spartacus! Good lord, just wait and see! The graphics are good for what it is, it appeals to men because of it's rawness with the battles scenes and sex and to women for the same reasons but also the sheer passion of the relationships (I am now an avid Manu Bennett - Crixus fan and think he is smokin' hot!)

Do not let the sub-par filming turn you off; it is worth it.Season 1 - half of Season 2 is full of \"blood spatters\" that break up scenes. Probably the most annoying thing in the show + the tomato-soup looking blood- which improves as you make it half way through the second season.Over all the concept is original, plots are ever thickening, favorite characters are NEVER \"safe\". With main characters dying every season, Spartacus is far from boring. The biggest downfall is that the main man that plays Spartacus dies from cancer before Season 2 is filmed- you can tell he's not the same man. I almost quit the series due to this, it was sad to know he passed. Season 1 remains the best.Be prepared to hear c*nt and c*ck ALL the time. No kiddos in the room while viewing!

The acting is forced with the actors unable to connect with their characters, with Viva Bianca at the top of the list. Viva's voice makes you wonder how she got an acting job in the first place, which can only be answered with her willingness to get naked. Her lack of acting skills is followed closely by her husband played by Craig Parker, who although playing a Roman Legion officer, seems about as menacing as the ant I stepped on this morning. More forced than the acting is the writing, which poorly attempts to cover up the amateur acting with nudity sex and blood. These things can usually keep me entertained, as with most men, for endless amounts of time. But in this show the sex is more of a tease than late night Cinemax, but with worse acting.

I can't praise it enough. What they did with such a small budget is truly remarkable. 8.6 would be considered a great rating for any show but I genuinely believe for this one it's a gross underrating, there's nothing like it. It's a shame shows like GOT are rated higher when this show stands head and shoulders above everything else, certainly in this genre. Incredibly raw, you'll have to see it to believe it. :) Good luck! It's one hell of a ride. \"What lies beneath your feet?!\" \"Sacred ground, watered with tears of blood!!!\"",

            "content": "I personally loathed the Stanley Kubrick version of this tale. . .although he was a great director, for sure, it was still the early 60s, and studios hadn't gotten over the Quo Vadis, Ben Hur slog that mandated stories set in the Ancient World had to be viewed through that 50s, Judeo-Christian mindset, even if the story itself had nothing to do with Jesus or the early Christians (just watch the opening of Kubrick's movie to see what I mean). Here, the producers at Starz have created what many thought at first must be a rip-off of 300, complete with poor script, green screen effects, and pointless sex. And that's what I thought at first as well. . But keep watching! Believe me when I say , it gets so much better. Around episode 4 or so, the writing takes a gigantic leap in terms of quality, the acting starts to crystallize as the performers grow comfortable in their roles, and you start to forget that there isn't actually an ampitheatre there (surely saving the show millions in production costs, unlike the doomed HBO series Rome). The story, for the most part, is set in a Ludus (gladiator training school) and the Domus (townhouse) attached to it, in the Roman city of Capua in southern Italy in about 80 BCE. The townhouse and training school are owned by Quintus Batiatus (John Hannah), a scheming social climber, aided and abetted by his equally ambitious wife, Lucretia (Lucy Lawless). Into their world comes Claudius Glaber, a Legatus (commander) in the Army of the Republic. Fearful of losing the opportunity to defeat Mithridates, King of Pontus, menacing the Roman colonies in Asia, Glaber breaks his promise to destroy the barbarian tribes threatening the homes of his Thracian soldiers, who rebel when he orders them to march to Asia Minor. Those rebels not killed are taken in chains back to Italy, to be executed in the arena for treason, it just so happens, in Capua, home of Senator Albinius, father of Glaber's wife, Ilythia. All are killed quite quickly in gladiatorial combat, all, that is, except for the very man who led the rebellion in the first place. Watching the executions is Batiatus, keen on winning favor with the Roman elite by providing ever more sophisticated blood sports for popular festivals. As the rebel kills every single gladiator sent to do him in, Batiatus is duly impressed, and offers to buy him from Glaber. As a pretense, he insists that the rebel won't last two weeks among his school of professional gladiators. The man, whose name no one has cared to ask, is thus inducted into the Ludus, and given the name Spartacus, \"after that Thracian king of old\". The rest of the series lets the viewer into a front row seat to the hellish world of the unluckiest of the unlucky in Ancient Rome. The Senators, schemers, Kings and Queens, Emperors and Courtesans are all pushed into the background as we see the stories of the 90+ percent of people in the Roman world; the slaves, the poorest of the poor, and the people just above them on the social ladder, struggling to climb up while equally terrified of falling into the abyss. This is the story of human beings who have lost even the designation of \"human being\", to become, in effect, living tools, sacrificial entertainment for the wealthiest of the wealthy, or sex toys for bored housewives. It is an unforgiving, despicable world, but not without it's points of light and levity. These people love their children very much, treasure their husbands and wives, and fight for what they think is right. They also have no qualms about watching a man be brutally slaughtered for their child's entertainment. This show is heavy on the blood and sex, sure. But that doesn't mean it isn't also a deep character study of people making a life in one of the worst situations imaginable. It's also one of the most frank depictions of life for the slaves and the downtrodden in the ancient world that I've ever seen.",

The first episode was kind of slow, but after the characters were developed and the gladiatorial games started, this became a roller coaster ride of emotions and action. There are so many twists and turns throughout the series, that there are no shortage of shocking and devastating scenes. In describing the style, I would say it is cross between Gladiator (storyline/character development) and 300 (cinematic style). With the gratuitous nudity and blood, I would say this would be more geared toward a 18 - 40 male crowd, but the story really would appeal to almost any audience, as long as they don't have a strong bias toward the old roman films/shows of past. This is unlike any show you have seen on the roman era. Very innovative, and I highly recommend and can not wait for season 2.",

These series differs from what I've seen before, but in a good way of course.If you enjoy watching violence, blood, conspiracies and so on, you should definitely give this a shot.

I was a little doubtful as we moved into a cartoon like time compression scene (seasons pass quickly.) And by the next big scene the 300/cartoon style was nearly too much to bare, and then the dialog just killed it. I had to quit.Maybe it got amazingly better after.

If I were to use one word to describe the recurring style of contemporary TV drama it would be \"intense.\" Small emotions and quiet moments are out of favor it seems with today's audiences. Intense human drama is all the rage. There was a time when TV could never match the darker, more adult and emotionally wrenching plots of theatrical films. What an unexpected reversal of fortunes to see TV offering steaming heaps of adult fare and the movies turning more and more to children's stories and superheroes.\"Spartacus\" is proving each succeeding week that it is a unique show, surpassing \"Rome,\" if not in artistic quality, in violent and engrossing drama that delivers the goods every episode. This is sword and sandal sleaze lifted up to Olympian heights. The quality of the show- including acting, costumes, CGI, and fight choreography is so uniformly good it sometimes goes unnoticed in the increasingly complex Machiavellian plot lines that have the denizens of the Batiatus ludus weaving dark and self-serving webs of deceit with the feverish industry of a nest of spiders. When the viewers find themselves grieving at the loss of a major character, or incensed at the act of betrayal of another, then it can be honestly acknowledged that the show is succeeding as much more than just a bloody toga party.SPOILERS AHEAD! This time around there was a great deal of nefarious plotting driving the story line. Spartacus was working on a plan to outwit Batiatus and gain freedom for himself and his wife. Ashur was setting up Barca to avoid paying off on a large wager. Barca was looking to buy his way out of the ludus and depart with his life partner. The only major cast member guiltless of these shenanigans was Crixus, who was busy lying comatose on his sick bed. Two major characters took a fast boat to the afterlife in scenes that packed emotional wallops. I am sorry to say that Batiatus, a character to whom I had grown fond, revealed an even darker facet to his character. It is one thing to be a ruthless manipulator, but in this episode he engages in an act of ultimate betrayal that hypocritically twists his own expressed personal code. Others, I am sure, will continue to view him as an amoral hustler trying to succeed by his own rules at the bottom rung of the Roman ruling class.All in all, Episode 6 was heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, dramatic, and of course, intense.",

            "content": "This show is my favorite. It look like 300 Spartans a lot. but there are some problems with quality of this show. I mean that sometimes fights are very unrealistic. Spartacus seems very weak in every fight (season 1) except first and last episodes. and it looks like he is more lucky than good fighter, and that's why he is always winner. first episode of first season is the most unrealistic part of this show. background in fights seems like cartoon. and blood is very unrealistic in every season. in every fight fighters are losing a lots of blood, and its is very unrealistic that after that they are continuing fight and winning. Also Liam (actor) is not as good as Andy Whitfieldn (RIP) was. you should have found some other good actor for this role. On Andys face it could have been seen that he had an aim for what he was fighting and he was sad and that he was fight with some purpose to achieve his goal. but Liam has very kind face, that gladiator must not have. on his face I cant see any feelings that he feels. Despite of all these problems this is my favorite show, I love fighting scenes, I love how Crixus is fighting. and I like Gannicus and Spartacus fights as well. fighting scenes are great in whole movie just because of much blood sometimes unrealistic because wounded man cant fight as good as in this movie they are fighting. I still give 10 points out of 10. Because i saw many things have improved after first episode. but I still don't like all actors, I hate girlfriend of Crixus who was very kind in first season and become very evil in 2 and 3.",

Rome ended up taking a back seat to this i watched this entire series. where with The Rome series I threw in the towel somewhere toward the beginning of episode 5. Spartacus Blood and Sand and Rome are both Soap opera's But Blood and Sand is a focus on Action Violence and sex. I have to admit i was thinking about turning Blood and Sand off if the homosexuality got anymore detail. If you thought 300 was Gay. then you defiantly will turn Blood and Sand off.I just let it pass. because I was entertained by good characters and humor. it's soft core porn, a lot of Breasts. More then average male nudity. when someone slices someone and the Computer generated blood goes on the whole background .Come on, thats a visuall thats definitely gonna get fazed out I'm giving Blood and Sand 10 out of 10 star's because I always wanted to watch the next episode. And I see that Rome has a better rating than Blood and Sand. So I want to promote how entertaining this Series is.",

The stories of these gladiators and this ludus are stories of passionate love, unbridled determination, tear-jerking romance, personal transcendence, metaphysical visions, hubristic arrogance, Mercutian camaraderie and choreographic physical feats. And all this is delivered flawlessly; visually orgasmic, a dramaturgical tour-de-force and with writing that makes one reminisce of Shakespeare. What more can I say.",

Each episode is a gem and the season finale is just amazing. I sat there with eyes and mouth wide open in complete awe. There is nothing like this on TV at the moment. The main reason for that being the amounts of sex, language, nudity and violence contained in this would even make HBO blush lol. Since it's now completed it's first season run I would encourage people to pick up the Blu Ray/DVD sets when they are released (no date yet on amazon but pre orders are being taken) if they have not seen it.

            "review_title": "The future seasons (if they ever come out) may be disappointing to their audience",
            "content": "The first Season of this show revolved around the Ludus and the Arena. I believe that a lot of the audience that didn't care about the history actually enjoyed the show due to the raw gladiatorial fights and nudity. That would come to an end as the \"history\" unfolds. And here is where I think the entire show may lose audience. I am afraid that the history of Spartacus campaigns across the Italic peninsula is of little interest to those viewers that have enjoyed the show thus far mostly for its gore and nudity related to the arena and the ludus. The first season was enjoyable because it relied on very little historical data, therefore allowing a lot of \"playground\" for creativity and speculation. Not much is known about Spartacus before the rebellion, therefore anything could be reasonably acceptable.Now the childhood of the show is over and the writers will have to make fly what they have created thus far. I believe that this can spell the show's demise. Do you remember in the first episodes how they portrayed the battles against the Northern \"getae\"? That shows the absolute lack of knowledge of the writers of the historical theater setting of that period. The demonic \"getae\" were no other than the Northern branch of the Thracian people, the Dacians at that time organized in a large empire extending from nowadays Ukraine to present Germany under the rule of mighty king Burebista (82-44 B.C.). Dacians were not barbarians nor demons, just a different kind of civilization of the Roman one. Some good references about Dacians can be found in the international productions \"Dacii\" (1966) and \"Columna\"(1968). Spartacus fought as a Roman auxiliary in the wars waged against Mithridates in Asia Minor. His later military exploits are suggestive of a high education and training in military arts, strategy and tactics. In one regard Maximus/Spartacus are the same: the general that became a gladiator. The historical Spartacus must have been by far more than just a very skilled fighter, survivor of the gutters of Rome as portrayed in the show. This speculation in the first season about the \"creation\" of Spartacus the leader makes me very curios how the show will continue given the offered premises.By many modern historians Spartacus achievements match Hannibal's, if not outranking them considering the weak start-up and the eclectic resources Spartacus had at his disposal. As Hannibal in Italy, Spartacus remained undefeated until the last battle. That is not a military feat that can be accomplished by a simpleton no matter how well ripped or ferocious in the arena he would be. That is a military genius on a par with Napoleon in terms of brilliant strategy and light-speed execution. Over 3 years of campaigning Spartacus defeated the best Roman armies (several consuls and generals) sent against him. He crossed the entire peninsula twice, South to North and back. From a military point of view this can only be explained by a very disciplined army of gladiators/slaves capable of lightning fast, long forced marches, geared and trained on a par with the Roman armies. That removes the picture of \"rabble followers\" and if there were some their numbers were only a fraction to the rest of the army. It remains to be seen if the show will continue on to same clich\u00e9, built over time, of a rabble of slaves marching through Italy and magically defeating Roman army after army for 2 yrs in a row.As said above, the gladiators marched twice the length of the Italic peninsula (South to North and back) in less than 3 years. That cannot be done with a lot of children, women and elders on the trail. A rabble like that can't explain the consistent military exploits Spartacus achieved. Glaber was only a minor lieutenant of Lucullus, the general fighting Mithridates. Glaber was the first Roman general defeated by Spartacus at Mount Vesuvius soon after the escape from Capua and by far wasn't neither the greatest general nor had he the largest army sent against the gladiators. I'm not sure why the screenplay emphasized Glaber so much when other historical characters would have offered a longer \"shelf-life\" as Catilina or Crassus. Any role for Glaber beyond his initial total and fast defeat it's mere fantasy. There are records of the gladiator school in Capua counting up to 10,000 fighters. Similar numbers exist for Ravenna and Rome. That's the scope of the history that was poorly reflected in the show. This group of roughly 30,000 gladiators formed the back bone of Spartacus army. They must have helped train new recruits, which by all means many could have been war prisoners themselves, not strangers to warfare. Movies have created a lot of clich\u00e9s of gladiators being caged in cells and behind bars. The history says that most of them, especially the champions, enjoyed a relative freedom to roam the city, the taverns, provide services, etc. Due to the open field for speculation in the absence of historical data I have enjoyed the first Season of the show, but as we move to the more historically defined period I fear the show may lose its appeal and/or audience, based on the path of the story the writers will choose. The gladiatorial fights in the arena will give place to battlefield combat. The budget required to recreate large CGI battles may be beyond the reach of this show. We will see.",

When I'm watching it, I'm not grossed out or anything by the sex and fighting, rather more annoyed as it completely dominates the script and I feel that this could have been an excellent drama if they'd focused more on the politics but maybe it's not for people with intellect.

Here's what I really disliked about this series....can you say OVER ACTING!! OMG this one takes over-acting to a new extreme and makes the characters comical and totally unbelievable. I really grew tired of the constant slow-motion action scenes, the directors/producers love to slow the action down and then drown it in fake blood which I found totally unnecessary. I also hated the Shakespearean dialog they used in a failed effort to make it more realistic, when in fact what it really did was make a large portion of the spoken dialog so ridiculous and absurd that the emotion and effect they were striving to interject was completely lost. Finally I found the gratuitous overt sexually content redundant and cheapened the over-all attempt to be a serious series. So all that being said I rate this a soft 5 out of 10 only because there was just barely enough content to keep me hanging on until the final over-due bloody end.",

However as the series movies along you can see flaws in every character, CGI looks a tad more realistic and isn't as overused as the pilot episode, and the action sequences are graphic but very well choreographed. At first it seemed like just a simple guilty-pleasure for me. By the end it's still a guilt-pleasure; but I realised that I was much more invested into the characters and and it was very deep at times. I cried in parts of it. By the final episode you could see good and bad in every character (Yes even Spartacus), and the suspense was extreme.

Great, awesome. BAM, we're sent to a council meeting where the Legatus (Haldir from Lord of the Rings) is attempting to get the Thracians to join the Auxlliary of the Roman Army. Bearded guy asks what it would be worth and Haldir promises that they'll kill all the Getae which have been raiding Spartacus's village.The next scene is pretty much sex, and then a horrible rip-off of 300. I was expecting a \"come back with your shield... or on it\" from the Sura(man). Eh whatever, it's a TV show. Cut to a battle that includes only 14 people. Yes, the great Getae horde of 7 men fight against Spartacus and his 7 Thracians. Now, they got the action sequences from somewhere, but I have no idea where. Whatever.Haldir goes back on his promise to destroy the Getae, instead he wants to catch up with someone else for his own personal glory. Spartacus gets the Thracians (and some other guys) to revolt under the thought that their villages are in the path of the now discarded Getae.They kill two Romans and knock the Legatus out by making his horse jump. They run away after that and THEN THE MOST SHOCKING THING HAPPENS.WARG RIDERS ATTACK SURA.Why are they doing this? Don't the Warg riders have the WHITE HAND on them? Are they not in the employ of THE ONE THEY'RE ATTACKING? Oh, two different people? Sura? Saruman? Whatever, this is a show for idiots.But still, the question remains, why are the Warg riders in Spartacus? Shouldn't they be raiding Rohan's villages and helping Sharku? Man, what the hell is going on here. This is the stupidest part of the show for me and the moment I saw this I considered not watching it.You've seen the rest, honestly. It's called \"Gladiator\", and it's a much better tale.It also doesn't have Warg riders in a historical setting. You know what could make this review better? Toaster Strudel. I'm going to make some.",

I watched one episode, and I couldn't wait until it was over. I would rather be forced to watch the same episode of Sex in the City over and over while being spoon fed a goblins vomit.

Even Liam his replacement did a fabulous job. The whole season has some breathtaking moments played by some amazing actors. This shows how the makers were so committed to tell this story.You need time, patience and an empty space in your mind to grab and capture the minute details with which this show has been developed.

The character is written so well for the actor of the series, arrogant yet so blind of love for his wife which was taken away from him. He might not be the best fighter, however his will is the thing which makes him a magnificent fighter.The style the series is created is well made, however some might claim there is too much blood and too much sex I beg to differ. This is so realistic, the blood just makes everything become fantastic. The series has the a fantastic storyline, I actually will go as far and say that I guarantee you will be hooked if you watch to Episode 5.

            "content": "Apparently more people watch this show than watch the terminated Star series \"Boss\", which was vastly superior on every level. Spartacus cost WAY more to make than \"Boss\" but still it remained. So I am seriously trying to figure out who watched Spartacus in numbers enough to usurp \"Boss\" AND justify the high budget and I cannot come to any logical conclusion. Religious folks wont watch it- too much nudity and the \"F & C\" bombs. Nerds don't watch it because its not sci-fi. Women don't watch it because its too gory and testosterone loaded. Teenagers don't watch it because they're too cynical and are too busy in their school and socials lives. College students don't watch it for the same reason teenagers do along with the fact most college students don't own a TV. Educated people don't watch it simply because its so stupid and pointless. The only demographic I can come up with is older male rednecks. The series is wildly inaccurate on all fronts: dialog, story, history of Rome, geography, gladiators. They steal a lot from the movie 300 with oodles and oodles of semi- naked men with CGI abs, and steroid -fed muscles, ridiculous amounts of ( poorly-rendered) blood gushing, and over- used slow-mo. The F and C words didn't exist at that time, neither did English accents in Rome. By the time the 4th season rolled around SOME of the gratuitous nudity was abated, which obviously was ONLY there for blatant pandering to pervy T&A appeal. The music score never seemed to make up its mind as it meandered from African Tribal to Pseudo- Phrygian Arabic to generic \"Roman\" ala Miklos Rozsa-to cyber electronica to Barbaresque strings ( think Platoon) . The worst of the post production values was the ADR blending with the folly, sound FX and music tracks: MOst of the dialog was at whisper level which competed with the folly and ambient audio tracks. Whenever there was any type of action sequence the audio program would elevate 6-24dB above the level of the dialog track. I am guessing when the audio was mixed it was done so in surround with the vocal center channel being up too high in the studio for the mixing engineers to make qualified decisions on how the overall mix sounded, OR maybe it was the producers way of glossing over the 2-dimensional script. At any rate, this is the last season-so sorry to see you go.....",

I do believe this show attempted to capitalize on the success of the movie 300, and there's nothing wrong with that at all. It's a classic good guys vs. bad guys narrative with a ton of beautiful women and over the top violence to add some fun. I certainly am bummed that the Spartacus of season 1 passed away, as he played the role exceptionally well. The new Spartacus is also good. Though I don't think he's as good as the first one, but that may be just because I was partial to the original (Rest in Piece Andy Whitfield). Season 2 end in a very satisfying way, with the good guy Spartacus besting his enemy (though not without significant casualty). And I loved the integration of Gannicus in the end.

All those aspects of Spartacus' character/nature must've been the writers, not Andy Whitfield (RIP). I feared the show would degenerate into nothing but battles between the Romans and the escaped slaves. It was worse: the characters became flat, uninteresting, with totally different personalities. And the brothel scene was gratuitous and egregiously violent. (This from one who adores seeing Lucy & Viva nude, and seeing well done nude scenes, but that brothel scene: what was the point?

            "content": "I don't think is possible to speak about Spartacus: Blood and Sand without mention the movies Gladiator and 300, since it shares elements from the story and visual effects from both of them. Although this is not a merely merge of both movies, since it takes you to another level due to the amount and explicit of violence (which would make Conan The Barbarian hide under his bed) together with nudity and strongly explicit sexual connotations.Even though it might be consider too much of both (nudity/sex and graphic violence), in my opinion they come into the right amount, in the way that none of it was spared to avoid hurting susceptibilities, being therefore a TV show with absolutely no reservations. If you are intended to see a face getting smashed, a man who has just been castrated or a blade slash that lets someone with their guts sliding out, YOU WILL SEE IT.I have to confess that the first 2 or 3 episodes were disappointing because of story was to much of a Gladiator's bad retell (and I was expecting more), but right after that it starts to take apart becoming to gain new and multiple dimensions, both in terms of the plot and in the character's/conflicts development, as well as the great acting starts to show up.The fighting visuals like 300 in terms of great amounts of digital blood and image speed altering between slow-motion and speed up, don't intent to be realistic but to be expressive of the violence and aggressiveness, but even so, combined with the immoral and raw sexual implications, provide what I think it's a very accurate portrait of the living style from that age, where life has little value and slave's life none at all.It is a story that gets better and more interesting at each episode and I think the greatest flaw in Spartacus: Blood and Sand is that it eventually had to end, leaving us to wait until the next season comes out.",

Its extreme similarities to 300 has been able to produce a strong effect and liking in terms of the action, how the blood flows, and how the sex is portrayed. Despite several critics, negative remarks, and skeptical reviews, Spartacus offers a full range of characters, enveloping the true essence of what a character should believe in such as Spartacus fully entrusting in his sense and instinct of freedom. Many may immediately drop the series right after 1 episode due to its grotesque and gruesome scenes, or offering the shallow characters portrayed throughout the episode. Those who do so do not realize the first couple of episodes may show that the series is merely based upon its graphics, repetition of nudity, and one-dimensional characters. However, as the series goes on, the plot thickens and the characters begin to develop, still bringing the strong action of fighting and the justifying pleasures of sex scenes. As the episodes adventure further, you may find yourself rooting for Spartacus, for Crixus, or even the sneaky character Asher. Spartacus is able to develop powerful emotions thrust within us to enjoy the series, but also think about it for the rest of the night, day, or even week. All in all, Spartacus offers intense and excellent action scenes, influential sex scenes, strong potential of acting, the development of every character, and a plot that is able to keep us on our toes and drop our jaws at some times or have us feel enthusiastic and jovial, bringing more than satisfaction to us for this renown and potentially great series.",

It seemed to me that between sex scenes, beefed up men enjoyed hacking each others limbs off with swords while slow motion, gushing blood flew through the air.What started out as a good idea somewhere got lost into the muck and mire of nonsense.In the end, all I can say is I stopped watching with the thought, that's an hour of my life I'll never get back again.",

Fake blood everywhere, that's right, blood is in abundance and sometimes you don't even know its source. This also qualifies as a gore-fest, with all sorts of body parts flying around with one swish of a sword. There are Sex scenes without any reason or plot. If this series had been advertised as soft-core pornography, it would certainly be eligible for stars.To sum this up, imagine clich\u00e9d Indian films combined with CGI done by a 10 year old and soft-core porn.",

At first it was very tough for me to watch because I found that the way the blood and fighting scenes were done made it seem very fake to me, but as the show continued I became glued to the screen and also found that the Sin City like blood and gore aspect made the fighting much for intense. With the sex, blood, and intense plot this show was a 10 out of 10 for me...it hit every guideline that a Spartacus show should have been. If you are a person who is interested in history you realize that without the sex being so open in this show it would not have been a good interpretation of the culture Spartacus was born into. The creators did a great job making this nearly exactly what it would have been for a gladiator back in this time with all the deceit, corruption, and SEX that was going on.",

Then I started second season, And because of season two I had to bring my rating down from a high seven to a very low six only because this is a review on the whole series if I was just a review season one I would give it a 7.5 to 8.As I said The writing of the first season the mystery of the intrigue the fighting all very good. It did seem our a bit rushed and they could've done so much more with it like the Game of Thrones they could've had a similar situation except between gladiator houses. But I know the show Spartacus and it was about Spartacus and the first season did a very good job of showing him transgress through his different stages and his character from warrior to slave to hero.I wondered where second season was going to go I figured it would be about the slaves escape and trying to find a new home and it was, I enjoy the first two episodes and then I watched episode three. I'm not sure what happened I don't know if the writers had high school children give them advice on how to write that episode but it was so insulting and so many ways that it ruined the series for me and I could no longer continue to watch it. Without giving too much away I will just say the plot of the season is not real complex, not remotely as complex as the first season but episode three took it to a new level. There is a scene in a vast mine in fact the largest mine in it's time where Spartacus and cruxis are to rescue cruxis's true love. The writing was so simple and so insulting that it took Spartacus and his Group, a guide, and a map of the mine, and it took a long time to find her. And wouldn't you know as soon as they do the Romans miraculously show up, somehow they managed to magically show up in the exact location they needed to in this vast mine without a map or a guide. Then to top it off like something you'd see in a high school play, Spartacus the hero, abandons his friends and warrior brothers all for a girl. What an insult how sad and what an embarrassment for the series.So my recommendation watch season one for sure and go no further!",

Maybe that's a part of the fantasy of television and film, making things different from the real world - because a Roman cohort is nothing to shake a stick at. Apparently they feel the need to prolong the show's longevity by inserting episode upon episode of now of Spartacus taking on legions by himself.

Nothing like homo-erotic tits'n'ass softporn mixed with vats of fake blood, hacked limbs, ingenious death strokes (the guy who got his face chopped off: outfrickingstanding!) and more conspiracy than November 22, 1963. But, as I feared, all of my favorite characters died. (SPOILER) That's because I find the evil Romans far more interesting than the virtuous slaves. \"Vengeance,\" like \"Arena\" before it, was jammed with villains I loved to hate and nominal heroes I hated to love; the ignoble Romans had a variety of character flaws with saving attributes-- their motives were base but believable, their actions debauched but presented without hypocrisy, their manipulations far more creative, their energy levels far more sustained than the competition on the other side of the line. Spartacus, now played by Liam McIntyre, has become a pompous bore, speechifying at a moment's notice about all the words that came through the rain in shouts to Lt. Henry in \"Farewell to Arms,\" while Crixus is a baby, Doctore doesn't have much to do and Gannicus is far too pretty and shallow. And, yes, the slow-mo eruptions of corn-syrup plasma do become tiring. More importantly, how will the series survive without (SPOILERS) Glabus and Ashur the Syrian, much less Lucretia (it does look like Ilytheia has survived, and perhaps she'll arrive in \"War of the Damned\" as Crassus's new mistress; and speaking of Crassus, whoever plays him in \"Damned\" better have some chops. I could see John Hannah, in modest disguise, for he had the snivelly cunning necessary, and it would be a help, as this year certainly missed his diabolical energy.) Still, with great episodes in three and four and the sudden, bloody demise of simpering Seppia lighting up nine, it offered enough pleasure to get a little more than by. I thought the vine gag to get the boys off Vesuvias was thin, and Glabus vs. Spartacus not much in sword choreography and the flying fireball machines a little too convenient as force multipliers The whole ending was thin, except for Lucretia's death dive, an unexpected moment exactly appropriate revelatory magnificence. I will indeed pony up for \"Damned,\" in hopes that DeKnight can regain the tragic yet epic grace of the original. But Doctore DeKnight, get us a Crassus equal to Olivier's; what about . . . Christian Bale?",

Clearly, time and effort were spent on fight sequences, which captured the feel of a Frank Miller graphic novel. They were perfectly lit, perfectly paced and used the visual effects with style. Everything else in the pilot, however, suffered. The scenes in the country, clearly shot on green screen, lacked lighting consistent with the background. The sex scenes went beyond stylized into the realm of tacky. The dialog contained expletives place more for shock value than effectiveness.I considered giving up on the series, but I'm glad I didn't. By the fourth episode, the production found its stride and began to exceed my expectations. No episode is without an awkward transition or unnatural conversation, but overall improvement makes these easy to ignore. The fights are compelling as always, but now the expletives in dialog are used in context and sex scenes serve purpose for the story, not just the taboo.

But then, something pushed me to see the forthcoming episodes, i was amazed to see how the writers have fared, bringing in-depth detail to each character... slowly un-winding in the knot (it appears to be) and again tying a new knot of unexpected twists and setbacks.! Rome! indeed was a great civilization, but the blood-thirst of the people portrayed in the graphic-novel style, during a gladiator fight, overwhelms everyone and fix you on the screen.Doctore, Peter Menshah... don't really disappoint you- A master of strict obedience and compassion revealed in forthcoming scenes.Batiatus, John Hannah, the Master of the house needs to be watched well..Coming to Sex, nudity... couldn't be avoided , but yet exposure could be down sided.Now the story is increasing on a good scale.. and hope to see it one day a successful show !",

With its over-stylized fight scenes,the obvious green screen shots, and the general look this series totally lends itself to 300. The way the violence and injuries are depicted is totally ridiculous. As an example, one gladiator in the first episode gets both of his legs cut off no blood is flowing from his nubs as he crawls away. Of course these gladiators still have all of their teeth after being pommeled and kicked in the face and mouth. Why is it that these Hollywood writers, producers, and directors expect us to believe that ancient Roman and Greek warriors went into battle nearly naked? A disclaimer at the beginning of each episode states that is a \"historical\" depiction of ancient Roman society. The only think historical about it is that there was an ancient Roman empire, they had a Colosseum and gladiators fought there, and some of the characters bear the names of real figures.",

No need even to say, that the movie has nothing to do with real history. No need to talk about poor graphics, \"fantastic\" battle-scenes like in mid-budget MADE IN CHINA movies. Of course the movie's goal is to be attractive and cover large auditory, but from season to season it became from an epic historical movie to an epic historical porn. The one thing really violated in this movie are not the slaves, it is history. Today watched the episode titled \"Separate Paths\". And I give solemn oath that it is the last part I am watching. The pathetic rape-scene of Julius Caesar filled my patience out. I address movie creators and scenarists: how do you dare to retell this really great story this way and bring to people your perverted and uneducated seeing of things? How do you afford yourselves to record a pathetic rape-scene of such a great historical figure like Caesar (BTW played by an actor, who is, least to say, inappropriate for this role). All the HARDCORE, GANGBANG, GAY, SWINGER porn practiced in these movies wasn't enough? It may seem that this movie is not produced by such respected \"Starz\", but some \"BangBros\"-ish porn studio.

            "content": "First off, the first episode was probably the worst, so I wouldn't put too much heed to reviews of people who never got further than the pilot. I don't really see how you can write a review of a series you've seen 1/13 episodes of.The first episode basically sets the scene for things to come. And still, I don't think it was bad at all. Sure - the sex scenes were rather overdone, a recurring thing throughout the series. But besides that, the storyline started OK.From there on, it rapidly grows better. As more story lines and characters began to develop and started intertwining, the story got much more depth. You could really see the characters growing. Crixus, apparently a rather empty-headed warrior type, fell in love and grew to realise there is more to live for outside the arena. By showing how complex and political life in ancient times was, the reality of the story becomes much enhanced.The acting was also very good. In fact, I think all actors did an excellent job. Each and every one of them was played with an astonishing reality factor, and very seldom I doubted the actions or emotions of any of the characters.The sex and the foul-mouthing really make the thing more realistic in my opinion. It just isn't satisfying to my imagination that bad-ass guys like gladiators would only speak in politically correct terms. Although the use of the word \"fuck\" seems a bit overdone, same goes for the sex. But it's better than pretending they didn't have sex at all, and never foul-mouthed. In fact, the Romans being a horny bunch makes a lot more sense to me than them being like a Puritan lot.Also I felt that the writers have made a good effort to prevent the plot to be overly clich\u00e9. In fact, the plot was quite surprising at times - for example in the \"Ashur\"-storyline. The schemes of Batiatus at times were also quite ingenious.Overall, I think the criticisms are generally quite prejudiced by the standards and expectations. This series is really unique, the best of its genre. Everything from plot to acting was great. This show, as opposed to Rome or movies like Gladiator or 300 (although not entirely comparable), made the ancient world come far more alive. Great job!",

This type of language was not heard of until the 12th and 15th century Not 109-71 BC which was Spartacus's era! so why did they feel the need to use them in the series?

Im sure with out the slow-motion this show would only be 5 minutes long.As i have said i tried 3 times to watch it and all three times i got 20 minutes through and turned it off feeling stupid that i put myself through it again.

I get that the Romans were enthusiastic about sex, but I didn't really need to see them orgy all over the place. The cast was excellent as well, and the CGI, though iffy at times, was quite good. I wouldn't really call this a spoiler, but there is a moderate of penis in this movie.

Having watched the first three episodes and giving it an honest chance, I've decided to pass on the rest.There are very few things going for Blood and Sand. Apart from the actors who play Crixus, Doctone and Batiatus, the rest of the ensemble is horribly cast and he writing is just plain awful. Emphasis is put on X rated dialogue with an afterthought given to character development. Don't go looking for a hero who makes you want to cheer in this particular Spartacus. On a positive, I don't mind the set design. Realizing epics can be expensive to produce, I'm willing to make allowances for CGI. It looks good in HD. My only complaint here is the blood splatter scenes which seem to cheapen it. I'm not sure how to put my finger on it, but it just doesn't seem to work well like it did in 300.The only other thing I'm going to bother adding is a comment on the costumes. The gladiators are wearing panties most of the time. While I'm sure it might appeal to some women, red blooded men might find it an unpleasant distraction to the fight scenes.I can only see this series appealing to the bubble gum crowd but parents should be concerned with the language and sexuality.

A bit more historical research would improve this show - as would some variety in the sets. The costumes are historically accurate. The actors are attractive and the show is fun to watch. There is a bit too much repetition of the gladiator fights. Also, many of the scenes are too talky and run much too long. Where was the scene timer? Also, the \"outdoor\" scenes are obviously done on stages. More back lot scenes and more variety in the situations would improve this show.",

On first impression you assume it is a Rome rip-off, quite badly done while overusing 300 style visual effects and throwing in far too much nudity.Those of us who get off on scoffing at historical (and geographic) inaccuracies are richly catered for. But that was to be expected when recreating such a famous tale on a small budget. Unlike the 300 it didn't bother me that the entire cast spent half the film wearing nothing but banana hammocks, as they spent the other half fully naked, so you were relieved they were at least wearing budgie smugglers for the some of the time.But, and this is a big but, actually if you can overlook the lack of a wardrobe department, the plot is quite good! The dialogue is for the most part believable, there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. It is basically a pretty good yarn.A note of warning, I was disappointed that the sequel 'gods of the arena' did not pick up the story where blood and sand finished. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that events leading up to Spartacus' revolt, where blood and sand finished, is only half the story. The historical Spartacus went on to raise a slave / gladiator army, rout a couple of legions against the odds but was ultimately defeated by Crassus once Rome awoke to the danger. Worthy of a sequel, or even a movie I'd say. Oh wait a minute, did someone make that already?Blood and Sand is no 'Rome', but worthy of a couple of hours of your time.",

That series, in true fashion to the time period, is filled with sex, violence and betrayal; however, the storyline at the core and the characters' motivations are what drive that series and occupy the vast majority of the screen time. When fianc\u00e9 brought home Spartacus, I expected another Rome, given the hype and praise it's received from those enamoured with the former and this show.After three episodes, I'm absolutely bored and fed up with this series. It's a shame, because the cast is mostly strong, and when the show is good, it's very good - Rome calibre. However, where Spartacus goes horribly wrong is its indulgence in glorified pornography, to the detriment of a storyline. Endless scenes of nudity and sex feature in the series, and while in Rome they felt important/fitting in pitch, in Spartacus, it's to the point where the series is a classy porn movie. There's a minimal exchange of dialogue that moves the story ahead very little, some violence, the same five insults thrown at Spartacus by the other gladiators, more uses of the words 'c*ck' and 'f***' than my own potty mouth would ever find necessary in a single conversation, and then more sex. Sex, sex, sex. I'm a bisexual woman and I'm bored because there's too many breasts bobbing about! One of the worst moments -- and I feel terrible for Lucy Lawless, who deserves better -- is when her character makes one flirty comment and then tells a male character, \"I need your C*** in me.\" Thus begins, yep, more sex.Rome did the same period with its same overindulgences and full nudity, yet retained a level of class and ultimately, never lost sight of its story arc and character dynamics. Spartacus fails miserably in this endeavour. It's a shame, since the show is shot beautifully and there is a good story buried in here somewhere. But when five minutes of the episode, during a key moment of political interaction, is interrupted to watch a gladiator screw a female slave while women and men bet on his stamina and ogle his 'beastly thrusts' for the next three... it's just ridiculous. I'm sure my fianc\u00e9's enjoying it; I'm wagering it's for the wrong reasons, though.",

The politics of Rome are better portrayed as is the Roman equipment, though there still are occasional flaws like the use of Boeotian helmets for cavalrymen and stirrups, which the Romans did not use since they were invented much later. I like the intrigue between the two leading ladies on the Roman side, and you start somehow to feel a little for the character Lucy Lawless portrays. However I miss Marcus Licinius Crassus. It is of course a fact that he only comes into the equasion when the praetorians under Glaber fail miserably, but still.There are a few plot lines (the Syrian ones) which are very predictable.On the whole a much more enjoyable series and recommended !",

The acting is also pretty ludicrous at times and had me laughing at the emotional scenes and macho bull-crap alike.Its not all bad though, there's some nudity and sex (though completely pointless and rather boring) and the fight scenes can be entertaining as they look almost exactly like 300 fights with slow down speed up shots and CGI blood everywhere, but to the point where its obvious they just copied the style directly from 300 rather than borrowing a few aspects.This might be a show that you can sit down with a few mates and have a laugh with, but don't look for any real content or realism because there is none.",

(I'm one of the people who thinks \"Rome\" was better than \"Spartacus\". I own both Seasons of \"Rome\" on DVD.) I really enjoyed the story line of Rome quite a bit, much more so than I have to this point for \"Spartacus\"To this point \"Spartacus\" still had a Gladiator copy-cat story-line quality to it. Tonight though? (Episode 10) Things have changed. The political back-story finally is getting good! (Spoiler) Battiatus is going to be out for BLOOD now! Additionally - every single sub-plot for all the major & minor characters involved in this series is relevant to Spartacus & the Battiatus family. Everything for the next several episodes will have a major impact on how, where and what happens to everyone involved. And even better? I know find myself interested in all those people, and what happens to each one of them.In short?? It just got really interesting. Interesting to the point I am starting to place \"Spartacus\" on par for my interest in \"Rome\" at the end of it's first season. That's a pretty big compliment (coming from me), as the 1st season of \"Rome\" was actually on the Christmas Wish-List I wrote for my wife! If you weren't watching it - you should be.

This is one of those series. The extensive blood and gore, computer generated to staggering levels, along with plenty of sex scenes and semi and full nudity, will guarantee that the viewing figures will be high, but add to the fact that once the adult comic-book violence slightly lessens after episode three or four, the plot becomes far more character-driven, and you start to see that this is one of those rare things - an original TV show. Don't get me wrong, there is still an abundance of extremely graphic violence, nudity and sex, enough to shake the proverbial stick at, but steadily more and more detail is given to character development and the dramatisation of the known historical events. Decadence abounds as if lifted directly from the script of Caligula (1979) and the gladiators stride around like extras from 300 (2006). There's no subtlety to this series, there's no doubt who are the 'goodies' and who are the 'baddies', you're not expected to work hard in trying to find any 'hidden meaning' in any event, it's all there in front of you. Don't get me wrong, that's not a criticism. This series delivers what it promises in every way, just like other series or films have in the past - but what makes this series different and stand apart from the others is in the manner in which it delivers. They even take the trouble to try to couch the script into translated Latin syntax, which can sound a bit cumbersome at times, but adds to the uniqueness of this show.'Spartacus: Blood and Sand' is bound to invite criticism from many, but taken at face value it's a adult comic-book series come to life, and as such I enjoyed it. The acting in the early episodes can be cringe-worthy at times, but persevere - it does get better, and along the way there are some good performances. In particular John Hannah comes across as wonderfully corrupt and scheming. In short, if you liked Gladiator and 300, give this a go and you shouldn't be disappointed.I'm looking forward to series two, and wish Andy Whitfield a speedy recovery and return to work.",

            "content": "I like the show and the concept but they need to cut down on the cartoon like scene's. Its an adult show. The sex scene's were appropriate and place at the correct time. They were also tasteful. Lucy Lawless is doing a great job. However I think they should let Spartacus grow his HAIR back. He is not as hot with short hair. I like some of the blood sequences but some of the blood scene's again did look kind of cartoon-ish. Maybe they should cut back on some of the special effects and that might help the show be more believable. His wife would look horrible without makeup. PLEASE let keep it. though it takes away from the Authenticity but who the heck wants to see dirty , ugly women on TV for an hour? NOT I and Im not a lesbian.",

            "content": "The shocking and dramatic television that was a staple diet of Blood & Sand and the excellent Gods of the Arena made way for politically correct, formulaic nonsense. They well and truly jumped the shark with Spartacus Vengeance. Women fighting alongside men in combat? Crixus, the Champion of Capua, reduced to a blubbering wreck by a slave girl? Spartacus continually saved by archer extraordinaire Mira? Every major male character was emasculated. Ashur getting his comeuppance by Naevia was the last straw. The acting has never been this shows strongpoint but when former Neighbours actors Brett Tucker and Luke Pegler act most of the cast under the table you know you've got problems. Cynthia Addai-Robinson, who replaced the lovely Lesley-Ann Brandt as Naevia, set new standards, making Manu Bennett look like De Niro in comparison.",

            "content": "This show is very entertaining and with a good story indeed, however i wonder why the made it end in this way !! Spartacus made a promise to Crassus that he will kill him the next time they meet , we don't want the bringer of rain to be unable to keep his word before his death , I'm not saying that Spartacus should have defeated Rome, of course that would be unlikely, but i think it would have been better if he killed Crassus and Caesar before his death , and then maybe he dies at the hands of Pompey's army, leaving the task to be continued by his people , but now you feel the ending is just copy and paste from 300 , which was disappointing for me and could have been much better if the writers thought of the ending for extra 30 minutes.",

No words can express my admiration for this series! The blood, gore, sex, acting, sceneries, visual effects, intense sensations and plot are out of this world. I loved 300 but I adored Spartacus Blood and Sand, I just can't have enough of it, simply addicted to it. I've seen Season 2 prequel: Gods of the Arena and can say it is nothing less than a masterpiece of a production as well! Hands down Spartacus TV series is the best TV show I have seen and strongly believe I will ever see unless it's followed by future seasons and episodes!",

            "content": "Such a shame. This show could have been s do good. There's so much wrong with this. I need TV shows to at least try to convince me. First, what bothers me the most is the dialog. What? It's way way too modern and when it isn't, it seems like the dialog is way overdone. \"F!=k\" is constantly used yet realistically, such a word was never said at the time- especially in that context. At one point a fighter tells, \"I'm going to f#&k all your women\". What? No. He would have said rape or anything else. Mascara? Why must shows like this have women airbrushed and wearing mascara? These women are older than me yet have no imperfections on their face. Rough them up a bit. At least Waking Dead got that right. Attire. Really? Those are some awfully modern looking clothes. I'm pretty site that polka dots weren't a thing back then. Why do all of the women look like sluts? Wait, why ARE all of the women sluts? Why must there be so much sex? If I wanted to watch a porn I would. That being said, if this show were classified as a porn, it'd be amazing. But.... It's not. Why aren't the men a little dirtier looking? Don't get me wrong, they're hot as hell but men didn't look remotely like that. Seriously, they look like models trying to play the roll of a gladiator. Why are men always naked in these types of films? Really hot but would someone just not make these more real? I hate this show. Can't do it. People need to fact check history before making such a film. Oh and the cgi is horrendous!!That being said... I do love the slow motion effect that it's frequently used and the exaggeration of blood. Win. (Hence the rating of 4)",

I tried this show several years ago as this time period in history is a personal favorite and what my degree is in.\nI gave it two stars for kinda cool special effects.\nThe acting could not possibly be worse if they tried. It feels like you're watching a comedy skit, the parts with any romance are especially nauseating.\nThe females are overdone. If their acting wasn't so terrible maybe I could get lost in that but it's impossible.\nThe set designs look like something from a high school play.\nI'm not even going to touch the historical inaccuracies, but I will say the true story of Spartacus is amazing and blows this rubbish (that looks like it's acted out by people that should play Vikings) out of the universe.",

            "content": "I looked into this show because of the high ratings on IMDb and had hoped for a poor man's GoT. I'm choosing to write a review because there is such a huge discrepancy between the ratings on IMDb and the quality of the show.A quick note on the action style: It is similar to 300. Exaggerated blood and alternation between slow motion and sped up cameras. It's heavy on the CGI. Whether or not that's a good thing is a matter of personal taste.There is indeed a lot of nudity and violence in the show. I don't mind either one bit but it seems plausible that the show's staff is trying to thrust these elements into the show because they believe it will sell. Neither is presented as a natural part of the story or human nature but instead they play out with the plausibility of pornography. The gore is cartoonish and detracts from the tension of the show and the nudity is so out of character in some of the scenes that the actors look uncomfortable going along.Speaking of the actors looking uncomfortable, the acting is pretty bad. It's not the worst thing we've ever witnessed in a sword and shield movie but the majority of the cast seems to have been chosen for physique rather than their ability to deliver even a modestly convincing line. Although Andy Whitfield's performance is one of the strongest in the show it is merely mediocre. The praise he receives on this board is particularly baffling. One has to wonder what people have been watching that they think he's a fabulous actor.The sets are poor for a show with a budget so large. It's hard to figure out what they're spending their money on with such a shallow talent pool and such poor sets. The first episode's \"snow\" is an especially telling example.The absolute worst part of the show is the writing. Most of the lines would easily work in a badly done parody of Gladiator (think Scary Movie, not Monty Python). At least half of the lines are so banal and poorly delivered that it becomes impossible to focus on the story. I watched three nonconsecutive episodes searching for an improvement in the acting, sets and most of all the writing. I was unable to find relief from any of the three. As such, it would be unfair for me to comment on the story but I find it unlikely that these writers are going to come up with anything original plot-wise.",
