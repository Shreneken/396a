            "content": "I don't think Skyline is a bad movie as such. While there were better movies from 2010 such as The King's Speech, The Social Network, The Fighter and Toy Story 3, there are also worse such as Fred:The Movie, The Last Airbender, Vampires Suck and Clash of the Titans.Skyline is not a good movie, but it isn't in my opinion bad either. If anything, my feelings for Skyline are very mixed. I have seen some comparisons to Battle:Los Angeles, and I do agree this is the better movie, while Skyline did have a lot of problems Battle:Los Angeles was clich\u00e9d, under-directed and over-edited and other than Aaron Eckhart, a decent idea and one or two decent scenes there was little of redeeming value.Starting with the good things of Skyline, the visuals look absolutely great. The cinematography and editing are slick, the scenery is striking and the colours and lighting are bold, but the real star is the special effects which are superb. The sound is another plus, very explosive and authentic, and the soundtrack is memorable, not too generic and fits decently with the mood. Also, the action in general is explosive and exciting.Skyline does also have its flaws though. The characters are not as clich\u00e9d or indifferent as those of Battle:LA and some of the worst of the year, but to be honest I did find some of the characterisation underdeveloped and irritating. The dialogue is often cheesy and seems to be taking an exercise in high camp, and the climax while quite freaky and atmospheric feels like a different tone to the rest of the movie and this was a tone that jarred a bit. The story in its structure is quite soap-opera-like, and can get predictable and pedestrian, the direction is sometimes good sometimes flat and the acting is also uneven ranging from over-eager to bland.All in all, Skyline was not a bad movie in my opinion, certainly not as bad as I'd heard, but it is a hardly exceptional movie either. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I'm surprised this move is not higher rated. I think its one of the best science fiction/monster movies to come out in some time.Awesome special effects in this one, with nice designs for the monsters and the alien ships and tech. The movie is creatively shot and I like how focused the plot was on the few main characters. A wonderful sense of doom pervades the whole film, with no cheap typical Hollywood miraculous escapes or happy endings. It was refreshing to see a movie focus on a grim and frightening reality of an unstoppable alien invasion without the typical cheesy silliness of movies like say, \"Independence Day\".Maybe people don't like it because of its pessimistic and unrelenting dismal tone, but I appreciate a director who steadfastly focuses on this aspect of hopelessness in the face of a vastly superior advanced alien force and it makes sense and feels real because of this decision.Another thing I enjoyed was how the movie at first seemed like it was going to be a shallow, typical Hollywood movie focused on young attractive people who like to party but then the movie shifted gears abruptly to a deadly serious tone which it then kept until the end, which I very much liked, how it faked me out in this way.Would love to see a sequel and I think the movie hints strongly that the story is not done.",

It's not academy award winning material, but i think pretty much everyone involved gives competent performances. And i'm not sure what people wanted from the dialogue. These are regular people in way over their heads in the middle of an alien invasion. I thought the dialogue was not an issue. The ending DID push the limits a bit, but at the same time I guess it was the only conceivable way to end on a hopeful note, given that the entirety of the film showed us how screwed humanity was against these guys. This was not anywhere near the abomination that was Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem. I'd probably rank it a solid 6.5/10. And i have to admit i'm as surprised as anyone by that. Movie does NOT deserve the critical hate it's getting.",

I admit it's pretty clich\u00e9, but doesn't come from nowhere and is satisfying. How could one actually not understand it is incomprehensible, unless someone didn't actually watch the movie.

The conversation among our group is stilted, and actually lacking (like you know: dead air) for the longest minutes. Were they waiting for the script to come to them? Very boring. Reminded me of the movie, THE HAPPENING where nothing happened in the entire movie. After 40-minutes or so, the aliens make their presence known. Weird looking things. Kind of octopi with more than 8-arms going every which way. But, the CGI was terrific, I have to admit. The group tries and tries to defeat the aliens and to make some sense of all this. They should have fought with the Director, Producers and yes, of course, the script writers. I held on because the CGI was really good.

            "review_title": "Great Effects, Godawful Script",
            "content": "First, let's work on some maths: \"Skyline\" is an alien invasion flick that has a touted US$10 million budget! This amount is a shoestring for an alien attack film - it is not even enough to pay the salary of an A-list star! So now you can do the maths and understand why there are no big stars here.If you had seen the trailer you might have been impressed by the CGI effects of the tentacled UFOs. This is probably where all the money have gone. Everything else, from its lame script and B-grade TV stars to its sets, are all hotch-potch and downright rudimentary. It is an exploitation film that seems destined for DVD.Synopsis: After a night of heavy partying at a posh condo in Los Angeles, a bunch of friends are awakened in the early hours by mysterious beams of light from the skyline. Those who gaze on the light get entranced - like moths to a flame and get 'burnt up'. Yup, the alien ships have landed and the survivors at the condo unit, Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his fianc\u00e9e (Scottie Thompson, pictured below with Balfour), and their friends Terry (Donald Faison of TV's \"Scrubs\") and Candice (Brittany Daniel) must find a way to escape the aliens' grasp. But where can they run? There are so many things wrong with the movie that I don't know where to begin. The film, directed by the Brothers Strause who did the effects for \"The X-FIles\", centres the action inside the condo unit so much that we get the impression that LA is deserted and the only folks left are those in the half-empty building. No attempt is made to show the scope of the 'body snatching' and its effects on the millions of other city-dwellers.Next, the main characters are being portrayed as such selfish and unsavoury people that we root for the aliens to take them away. This may be because the writers have not bothered to flesh out their backgrounds, except for a few predictable turns. The only one who comes on as real is David Sayas (of TV's \"Dexter\" fame) who plays the building supervisor. Also, the dialogue is lame and clich\u00e9d. The writers must have had the notion that audience interest can be sustained if they have the characters yell at one another.There's no doubt that Strause brothers provide exhilarating special effects - but they need to work on getting a good story to go with their CGI magic. Otherwise it is just a damn waste.",

Yes, It's certainly not a masterpiece, and doesn't have an incredibly clever or elaborate script, however it has a lot of virtues that deserve a whole lot more than a poor 4.5: First the visual effects are really, really good. Second: the acting in my opinion was also very acceptable, very natural and according to the situation, the way normal humans would react to an extraordinary terrifying situation, an alien invasion; a few clich\u00e9 dialog but nothing really to be annoyed for. Another plus is the end: incredibly bizarre and surprising, didn't see it coming. Finally and most important, it kept me interested all the way till the end, which is what a movie should do. Now, knowing that the budget for this movie was $10 million I honestly think the producers and the whole team did an excellent job. 7/10 seems a fair rating for me and I truly recommend it to sci-fi lovers despite the bad ratings.",

            "content": "Aliens descend on Los Angeles out of the blue, surround the young casts condo, and prepare to finish them off, then the movie switches to \"15 hours earlier\". What more import information could we possibly need to know, what the characters exchanged for birthday presents? The switch-up kind of made me want to leave the theater. Instead of wondering, who got what as a housewarming present, I was wondering if the theater would give out a refund 10 minutes into a movie. Guess I'm OK with skipping character development. Skyline picks up quick enough after the reset, I did like the movie. In other films, such as the recent District 9, character isn't really developed - the hero's character is revealed as he's exposed to greater and greater stress.I should admit I'm a fool for these alien invasion movies, I even give Battlefield Earth 8 of 10 stars. Some of the dialogue in Skyline seems a bit off, but at least it's not safe, politically correct or predictable. At times the dialogue is off on purpose. When one of the characters says something like, \"we're OK now\" you just know something really bad is about to happen. It's almost a cue.For some Skyline will conjure up images of 9/11. Other's have already taken parts of the movie as a metaphor for rampant consumerism. I felt the attack was a metaphor for the 'illegal alien' invasion of the present day. More specifically, I guess, a replay of the phenomenon of black guys sleeping with a lot (I assume) of white girls. Tragedy after tragedy befall our young heroes and in the end one of the young girls sums it all up by saying, \"I hate Los Angeles\". In no way is it funny.There was some infighting among the groups of survivors, perhaps less than in some movies but I felt there was still a bit too much of it. The sympathetic adult our cast befriend has to keep telling one of the young men something like, \"Don't bury your head and hope this goes away\", \"It's real\". When the alien machines turn out to be powered by human brains the guy beside me at the theater cringed. He had a valid reaction. White people aren't That smart. The evidence isn't looking too good on that. Besides, brains don't really seem to be what they are after.At times the movie switches into the mode of fantasy. Some of the American aircraft appear to be models we've never seen before and they have odd sizes and shapes (not sure I've ever rooted for American airplanes this much before). At other times the cast remain remarkably unaffected by the action on screen. It's not even just narrow escapes. Skyline is such an intense movie, and frightening, the fantasy element may help cut down on the tension. I wonder if the disjointed beginning also keeps the movie from being too frightening. When it's revealed we're sort of fighting ourselves it adds even more creepiness and perhaps provides some afterthoughts (of hopelessness) to the experience.Do we ever actually see the aliens? Did they even bother to land on Earth, or just send army sucking probes here? Why didn't the aliens use robot brains instead of harvesting zombies. Are they tapping into some kind of unknown 'life force'. Is it a matter of invading on a budget? We'll never know unless there's a sequel. Maybe instead of Alien vs Predator, Cloverfield vs Skyline. Both movies are very similar, actually. Maybe both attacks come from the same intelligence. A sequel seems unlikely, though, this movie can be summed up with the words 'we lose'. The main thing going for Skyline (aside from the fear, action and horror) is the ending. The ending is atypical: bleak, realistic, frightening, with again just a touch of fantasy to ease it through.",

            "content": "The movie is an entertaining ride for the most part as long as you go into the movie prepared for something that will have no unique characters or a decent script. - I saw the movie fully expecting a bad script, characters I wouldn't like, no artful directing, and a plot that fails to do anything new or interesting. But I allowed myself to be entertained by it as a simple piece of sci-fi/monster action! This is what you must do if you go to see it!!I was mostly inspired to do this review because I think the film doesn't deserve some of the really nasty 2/10 reviews I have seen. Basically the aliens and each confrontation against them are generally exciting and save the film. Considering the film was made on quite a small budget they did a great job with the effects. I think fans of video games like the RESISTANCE series or HALF LIFE should be able to enjoy it a bit more than most. A lot of people have been to harsh on this film, it is clear from the trailer this is just another alien invasion movie. Anyone who watches it expecting a modern sci-fi classic like District 9 will be disappointed - so don't do that. Basically if you are unsure about seeing the film but enjoy sci-fi/monster movies for nothing but quick entertainment you should get something out of it.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Skyline",
            "content": "District 9 probably rejuvenated the science fiction subgenre of an alien presence / invasion on Earth all over again, with no less than three films lined up close to one another that tackle just that - Skyline being the first, then Monsters followed by World Invasion: Battle LA, where the latter had caused the Brothers Strause's Hydraulx effects company probable woes since there is what's deemed to be conflicting interest in The Social Network sense. That aside, Skyline demonstrates that an independently funded film is still feasible, with the usual merits and expected demerits that come with an effects laden movie, but certainly not one that deserved the kind of backlash that it got.The Brothers Strause Colin and Greg, responsible for AvP Requiem, bring their visual effects wizardry and know-how to making a film that's skewed toward being just that - a special effects extravaganza. How else can you explain the 10 million dollar effects cost against everything else that was budgeted for 0.5 million. Granted that this film was made on the cheap in Hollywood terms, the look and feel was polished, and there can be no qualms about its effects quality, but the story by Joshua Cordes and Liam O'Donnell let it down somewhat.Unlike District 9, Skyline didn't have anything new to add to the genre, deciding to repeatedly give audiences what we have already seen in a number of genre films, putting them altogether into a single film, be it the Matrix-like sentinels, large spaceships bursting out of the cloudy sky, War of the Worlds like tension between nasty aliens and humans silently hoping everything will turn out fine, with shadows of Transformers, the harvesting of humans for some dastardly alien plan, an Independence Day equivalent of an all out air strike against the aliens albeit with updated weaponry and planes, or even a human-alien hybrid of sorts that opens up the film for a franchise to happen. You're begging for one original thought that the filmmakers could come up with, and you'll find it really tough to get one.What it did successfully translate however, is how everything was doomed from the start, and gradually we get to realize it's no way out for all the characters, since every conceivable plan that they, and we, come up with, get closed, and closed good. The protagonists are stuck in a penthouse condominium, and escape outside into what's essentially the alien ships vacuum cleaning the entire city of LA of people doesn't sound like a good idea, with the bigger world out there at large, zero communications and a zilch mass media, means questions are constantly raised, with no clear answers.This fear factor was what I thought the Brothers had successfully translated on screen instead, and frankly will be something quite close to what you or I will do when we panic, and let fear creep in. After all, aliens of all shapes and sizes, flying or on the ground, forcefully ensures every single human being in their sights get sucked into their bodies in the most unsavoury of terms. Think of it as reverse birth, where humans get sucked into what's essentially looks like an alien vagina with plenty of goo, mucus and muck, sometimes with the aid of tentacles shaped like umbilical cords. Bickering is common, with no alpha males stepping up to lead the way because, well, everyone gets picked off one by one.Characters were expectedly cardboard, although the story did take some unnecessary and uninteresting pains to give us a little bit of a background of those whom we follow. Alas, somehow there's a profound lack of interest in the rich and famous, who stay in swanky apartments and drive cars with the prancing horse logo. There isn't the blue collar, hard worker to root for, and seriously, a bunch of rich pansies don't quite cut it for a film like this where it's about survival of the fittest aided by street smarts. Then again, it does go to show rich or poor, we bite the dust in the same manner when faced with common danger threatening our lives, that Death (by way of Aliens or otherwise) evens the playing field. The premise - you're stuck in a building where all else outside, and soon inside turns into Ground Zero, what will you do?And also, I suppose films that trumpet the American military might will get the kind of support it does back home, with films like Independence Day and even Transformers 1 and 2, which made it seem like an advertisement for the US Military. Here the military response seems muted and had taken a backseat (well, the budget could be a prime reason), but for what it can muster with the drones and warplanes, one nuke, and a couple of gung-ho boots on ground heli-dropped to nearby rooftops, it isn't the all out war that many perhaps have wanted to see the US forces driving the unwelcome guests away.With a more original idea and story development to boot, perhaps Skyline could have lived up to its promises and matched the quality of effects put on screen. There's a deliberate void of verbatim answers here, with the filmmakers preferring to keep some cards close to their chest, such as an origin of sorts, or explanation why things occur the way they did, since we're observing from the third person point of view, and the narrative hardly following anyone who has got an idea or a remote clue on what's exactly happening. It's a setup for a follow up film, especially the ending montage, so let's let's hope the area of storytelling gets shored up to develop and add to its mythos.",

Eric Balfour plays Jarrod who with his girl friend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) journey to California for their friend Terry's Donald Faison) birthday. Once there, the Apartment complex and indeed the entire world is invaded by some mysterious cosmic Army. With their powerful Blue lights, the aliens soon began collecting thousands of Earth's inhabitants for their diabolical purpose.

The high point arises when the world's military launches a counter offensive only to leave the audience wondering what if anything was learned by the skyline air war.

            "content": "Stop me if you heard this before. Aliens invade earth and a handful of survivors try to escape their impending deaths. It's another War of the Worlds-esque invasion flick but what's nice about this is that it's played straight with no comedic one-liners and there's not a teenager in sight.Directors Colin Strause and Greg Strause are no strangers to special effects after bringing to life the Predators and Aliens in AVPR (2007) and the rest of the team behind Skyline's extraterrestrials are clearly talented making the best out of a budget. It's visually wonderful, the special effects are fantastic. Nevertheless, Aliens (1986) designers and suit wearers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. creature designs appear to be an unoriginal mix of The Fly, Independence Day, Cloverfield and The Matrix. The acting is above average and the leads including Eric Balour and Brittany Daniel carry the emotion well. David Zayas is notable as the Hotel manager but his screen time is limited. That said, the script lacks enough meaty dialogue to keep you enthralled and you find yourself waiting for more glimpses and shenanigans of the alien invaders.Overall, it looks great but it fails to connect and grip you as much as it should. Even so it's a lot better than critics would lead you to believe and recommended to those who don't need a stereotype hero lead, Skyline 2 is more than welcome. The Brothers Strause will hit gold but Skyline just isn't it.",

            "content": "After a hard nights partying a group of people in Los Angeles wake up the next morning , see bright blue lights in the distance and realise with horror the city has been invaded by aliens In 1898 British writer HG Wells wrote a novel called The War Of The Worlds chronicling a Martian take over of Planet Earth . The work was pure fantasy at its most imaginative . The novel pushed back the very frontiers of both literature and the human imagination . It's impossible for any of us who were born in the 20th Century to realise what it must have been like to exist in a world without science fiction . Wells as did Marx and Darwin changed and shaped the world we live in . One wonders if humanity would have ever travelled to the Moon and back if it wasn't for Wells . Jules Verne did pre-date Wells and wrote of Moon travel but we wanted to go to the Moon to see if the Selenites lived there and returned disappointed when we found nothing there . Maybe we'll have more luck on Mars ? In the mean time let's hope the Hollywood hack factory doesn't dull the Wellsian dream Step forward SKYLINE which has raped the mental corpse of Wells . Bad enough that Hollywood ripped off Wells with such films like INDEPENDENCE DAY but when a film like SKYLINE comes along and rips off a rip off that's grasping for creative straws in a stagnant sea . Every single scene here will remind you of a science fiction movie you saw from the 1950s , the 1960s , the 1970s , the ... got the idea ? Good because at least you've got an idea of your own which isn't something SKYLINE can claim The worst thing is the premise is totally stolen without any type of logic to it . The aliens - a CGI steal from the ones seen in ID4 - come to Earth and steal human brains ! Why do they do this ? It's never explained but the whole concept collapses if given any thought . Does the alien home world have humans that are farmed for their brains ? I've got a problem swallowing this ill thought idea which only seems to exist to create a film around . Wells was rather vague about the Martians motives for invading Earth though it's insinuated Mars is dying so the Martians want to colonise Earth ( Wells of course wrote the novel as a critique against European imperialism ) while Nigel Kneale wrote his 1979 QUATERMASS serial about aliens harvesting the human race for their pheromones after a gap of 5000 years . Kneale's previous Quatermass serial from 1958 also had a premise of Martian colonisation of Earth by proxy means . You don't need to have everything spelt out to you , you don't need to believe in life on other planets to buy in to a premise by Wells , Kneale , Wyndham or any other science fiction writer but the premise must have a credibility to it . SKYLINE doesn't",

We don't have a ace pilot or elitist hacker we don't have a superhero to fix it all, we be in trouble if something more advanced than us comes to play.To me this makes it an awesome film and strangely I found the rest of the people in the cinema of the same mind as soon as the film finished people I didn't know started discussing it as a bit of fresh air.If you like your films like independence day or Armageddon or any film where humankind are groomed and praised where a prayer to the gods or a speech by the president saves the day then you probably won't like this movie.I look forward to seeing skyline 2",

            "content": "They drop from the sky with no warning. They do seemingly inexplicable things. They are capable of things that defy human experience. And we see it from the perspective of people we have no real connection to.My first thoughts were something like, \"How are K-Fed and Bobby Brown gonna save the planet?\" Turns out, I need not have wondered.What I thought the movie did very well was tell the story from the point of view of a handful of people that have no extraordinary attributes whatsoever. Disaster movies tend to have characters able to overcome improbable odds to somehow accomplish some measure of victory for Earth and/or humanity. Not so in Skyline. We have an apparently successful recording artist living the high life in L.A. and his friend, who possesses some measure of marketing talent. Rounded out with girlfriends, other assorted attractive female hangers-on, and what appears to be one of the security guards of the condominium complex in which the recording artist resides.As far from \"everyday normal\" as this group might seem to be, they could very easily be real people, particularly in La-La Land. And the best part is that they reacted to events in a very normal, everyday human way. Weird stuff happens, and so they try to make sense of it, try to get a look at what's going on. And what they see makes no sense. There are no moments of inspired intuition, no really extraordinary feats of heroism or even ordinary ones.Every plan of action the characters come up with fails, their safe-zones continually diminish, and characters are inexorably picked off. This is mirrored by the larger reaction of the military and their attempts to resist the alien menace. While slightly more successful in causing some injury to the aliens, their ultimate futility is seen when what looks to be an incredibly agile stealth bomber dances and dodges its way through aerial combat to release the Hail-Mary tactical nuke missile even as it is finally shot down. We follow the missile as it tracks toward the largest of alien craft and BOOM! Lots of bright light and big noise, and we see the alien vessel crashing to the ground as a smoldering wreck. Yay! But wait, holy crap, and oh noes! The aliens have regenerative/repair abilities congruent with their clearly organic-machine nature. The actors best moments come when they convey the despair and frustration of seeing every soap-bubble of hope unavoidably popped.Earth is a rich and rare cache of resources presumably not found in many places in the vast, cold reaches of space. The aliens are here to secure their own continued survival with our delicious goodies. Our own species does this exact same thing to plants and animals across the globe. So what more motivation do the aliens need? And how could we realistically resist? None, and we can't, any more than the Amazon or marine life could. I don't know how much more \"real\" the story could get.The movie doesn't satisfy the audience with a heroic victory for mankind. Or any victory, for that matter. And in this, it bucks the seemingly inescapable trend for reassuring us with some message about how adhering to noble virtues will allow us to win out in the end. To me, the film demonstrated exactly how fragile and small we and our planet are in the grander scheme of the universe. It's an ugly, cold truth, and we might prefer to be deluded that we can overcome if we just (add inspiring platitude here). But if our real-life local and global disasters are any indication, those sorts of wins only come at the very end and from the efforts of survivors after the fact. In the scenario this movie presents, we won't get that chance. Were aliens ever to come knocking, humanity as it is now is simply boned. And that's it.Lots of people will not like or want to hear that message from a work of fiction. But I think the makers of this film deserve credit for their much more likely message of futility. It's not something we get a lot of from movies. Every now and again, it's a nice change from the improbable happy ending.",

It was by no means a great movie but props to the film makers for skipping all of the alien invasion clich\u00e9s and going with something original. One poster compared it to a zombie movie and I did notice the similarity when I was watching it. The plot does have far more in common with a typical zombie movie than you usual alien invasion movie.

I was surprised to see such hate towards this little sci-fi film, but now I understand why. This isn't a major film. It's a direct-to-DVD or made for TV movie. In that realm, it's one of the best. Had I seen this on the Sci-Fi Channel, it would stand out more. What we have here are two effects wizards, trying to showcase their talent. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The film follows a small group during an alien invasion. Most alien invasion films focus on the big wide world outside. This territory is usually tread by the zombie genre. The build up is clich\u00e9d and dull. Pregnant girlfriend, new job offer, affairs hinted at etc. but the main chunk of this film is non- stop action. I liked how it built up to the big scenes. At first, there's a sneaky alien in the home. Then a big bastard outside. Soon there are aerial battles and soldiers. The effects are a mixed bag. Some of the big aliens look fantastic, but look closely as they interact with the world and you'll see huge flaws. As Balfour goes hand-to-hand with an alien, it's easy to tell that he was just swinging at nothing. The Brothers Strause can certainly render an effect, or deliver some reliable action, but when they try for their dramatic moments, they often leave it feeling clunky and amateurish. If you like your B-Movies, then give this a try. Unfortunately, it punched above its weight and ended up being torn apart.",

            "review_title": "Alien Invasion or Zombie Apocalypse?",
            "content": "(Originally appeared as \"Alien Invasion or Zombie Apocalypse?\" at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)There are certain elements that you expect to find in an alien invasion movie: massive spaceships, all out war, maybe even a bit of mind control. You certainly get that and more in \"Skyline\", directed by Colin and Greg Strause, the story of a few friends in Los Angeles who wake early one morning to find extraterrestrials have arrived (and they have not come in peace). Blinding blue lights beckon humans irresistibly to the alien spaceships, which harvest the humans for ...Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, meet our heroes. Eric Balfour (24, Haven) and Scottie Thompson (NCIS, Trauma) play Jarrod and Elaine, a pair of lovers who are visiting LA on their friend's birthday. Donald Faison (Scrubs) plays Terry, who Jarrod \"always knew would make it big.\" Terry wants Jarrod to move to LA permanently, though that causes some issues with Elaine who has no desire to embrace Terry's lifestyle. While I've always been something of a fan of Scottie Thompson, and knowing that Faison and Balfour have their own followings, I have to say that they do not make the greatest transition from the smallscreen to the bigscreen (though all have had minor-to-supporting roles in previous movies, this is the first time they've headlined a major production).Most disaster flicks try to focus on the main characters and how the \"disaster\", whether it's an alien invasion, an asteroid crashing to the Earth, or some other \"end of the world\" scenario, changes their lives and relationships. \"Skyline\", however, has no problem abandoning that particular story arc in favor of a straight survivalist narrative for the remainder of the movie. The characters, faced with aliens that not only abduct humans by the hundreds but also turn them into mindless shells in the process, quickly if imperfectly abandon all personal issues in their efforts to escape the threat while they still can.That's where the genre comes off the rails a bit, I feel, in this case. In most alien invasion movies, you form a resistance and you push the invaders off the planet. After all, unless you want your movie to have an unhappy ending, there's simply no other way to end an invasion. On the other hand, if you're going for the \"gritty realism\" that seems to be the order of the day for all movies now, how do you realistically expect to stop an intergalactic fleet that can wipe out whole cities in less than a day? As clever as the ending to H.G. Wells' story \"War of the Worlds\" was, you just can't expect a hyper-advanced race, capable of decimating the human race in a matter of days, to not have considered the common cold (or hackers, Mr. Emmerich).While the United States military is certainly not idle during this crisis, we soon enough learn that there's little they can do against this menace; so, you can imagine, there's far less that our heroes can do. One particularly clear-thinking character points this out several times while trying to keep Jarrod from leaving the relative safety of their apartment, and, not incidentally, increasing the feeling of hopelessness for the audience. I found myself repeating a mantra at one point during the movie: there is no escape, there is no rescue, and there is no resistance. If the Brothers Strause accomplished one thing with their movie, besides some of the greatest special effects to hit theaters since \"Avatar\" (which they also helped to create), it's a realistic scenario in the event that an alien invasion ever occurs. In short, Stephen Hawking was right.So, where does that leave us? And with what? We have a small band of survivors facing what could be the end of the human race against a foe that seemingly can't be killed (or, at least, won't stay killed). They try to run, they try to hide, and they try to lock themselves in a hotel until they can be rescued. They face the everpresent probability that, not only could they die at the hands of these monsters, they could even face something much worse than death. Tensions flare between the survivors as they struggle to think of and stick to a workable plan. Mistrust and doubt lead to \"dissension in the ranks\". No one is sure who the \"leader\" is, and they're even less sure of what their fate will be. The question is not can they survive, but for how long. As I watched, I realized that's never really a question I asked myself while watching alien invasion movies before; but I almost always ask it while watching zombie movies.I enjoyed this movie for its amazing visuals and special effects. The Brothers Strause have proved their proficiency repeatedly, and this movie is absolutely an example of doing more with less (much of it was shot in their own apartment building). They even did a fair job of directing the characters in what was essentially the first major outing for everyone involved. While it had hints of M. Night Shyamalan, Roland Emmerich, and even a bit of Steven Spielberg, it was the Strauses own film, right up until the strangely compelling closing scene. I wouldn't call it deserving of an Oscar, but I am eager to see what the duo produce next.",

Meanwhile, they encounter a couple of strange light beams which shine very brightly and attract anyone who looks at them. As predicted, they're being attacked by aliens so a painful fight for survival begins.It is a movie which tries to present an alien invasion but fails miserably in every single aspect imaginable. Its characters are as retarded as they can get, although we're talking about grown up men and women, almost every single action or decision taken makes you scratch your head in wonder. They simply insult your intelligence with everything this movie depicts, from the way aliens attack and can be attacked to the way each human being decides to fight back or stand and wait for rescue. I thought that its visuals would sweeten even a bit the sour taste that its retarded, pointless and mind boggling events left me, but they didn't. I'm not saying that they're bad, but it's very hard to enjoy some good CGI when the characters that interact with it desperately want to be killed and are capable to do anything in accomplishing their goal, although they try to tell you that they are struggling for survival.Furthermore, to put the cherry on top of the cake, the finale is as stupid as it is unexpected. I'm not going to tell you what it is in case you actually want to see this garbage but it is as disappointing as the movie itself. It makes me wonder...How hard do you have to try to realize a movie as bad as this one?It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I pray to God to let this one be the last \"creature\" of its kind I am to see.

While this room does have a nice view of LA laid before it through the floor-to-ceiling windows, unfortunately most of the movie is spent in this room with the blinds closed, and any attempts to leave this room are quickly thwarted by the aliens. That leaves us with boring one-dimensional characters loafing around doing nothing but sneaking peaks out the window for much of the film.For all its faults I still enjoyed the movie overall.

However in his defence, the script sucks, I could write a better one over breakfast. The special effects are certainly effective for the most part.

The trailer was certainly interesting and the film simply doesn't back up the premise. War of the worlds and Independence Day have had a baby, it's called SKYLINE.

It's a definite step up from ALIEN VS PREDATOR: REQUIEM, the previous movie made by the Brothers Strause.The plot is very simple and sees a small group of people trapped in their apartment while an alien invasion rages on outside. The film is heavy on the CGI effects and most of them are very respectable; certainly when compared to bigger-budgeted Hollywood fare. Despite the paucity of originality this is a suspenseful film throughout that expertly builds tension and features some great shocks and set-pieces all the way through.SKYLINE isn't a perfect movie by any means; the script has a problem in that none of the characters are sympathetic, so with better characters it would have been truly masterful.

In theory, the film is inspiring as a way of showing what can be done when two filmmakers pool in their own resources, keep things relatively inexpensive, don't hire big-name stars but keep the aesthetic one that might appeal to a mainstream audience like an alien-invasion picture set in the backdrop of Los Angeles. On paper it looks like it should be a sure thing as far as what its story is... and then you see the movie, and it's not good. At all.Skyline posits the alien invasion as we have seen before (ID4, War of the Worlds, The Matrix, even Return of the Jedi!), with a couple of little twists, barely enough to register as unique for anyone with a cursory knowledge of the sub-genre of sci-fi. In this kind of situation where the aliens come to earth and will (for realz) eat your brains to gain knowledge or, um, something, you need some good characters to stick with. Skyline's characters are upper-middle class white kids (and Donald Faison) who have a big party at a hotel in LA and get drunk and loud and freaky and stuff like that. Oh, and one of the couples (Balfour and Thompson) have just realized they're pregnant, so they're a whole ball of wax unto themselves, sort of. But on to the invasion! It's, um... lame, kind of.If you're watching the alien invasion from inside an apartment, and have the Night of the Living Dead-style argument of being closed in but what to do from there like going outside or staying in or fighting back or where to run away, it can be done with captivating motivations. There isn't any here. It's just a bunch of people who are mostly brainless or just argue to the point of it being banal and lame. And what they see outside from their blinds (the alien light burns the skin for one thing, and puts one into a trance, or lets the aliens know there's fresh meat for their um alien-sucker-vagina things), or on the TV(?) is pandemonium from just the immediate area. One only gets a sense of the alien apocalypse from the view of an LA window, and with the requisite alien fighters going against the fighter pilots from the army. I'm not sure what could've been done with the material to make it fresh. No, that's not true. What could be done is better work on characters, to make us care about their situation. What could be done is to make someone like the Maitre'D at the hotel played by David Zayas the protagonist (the best actor in the movie which is saying a lot mostly in comparison to everyone else), but instead the filmmakers go the route of Cloverfield- nay, would-be Cloverfield- with self-absorbed twits who are led by a guy (Balfour) who may be one of the aliens or might not be or what's up with that(?) And the action outside that the filmmakers put together is just... repetitive and not very exciting. It's a reel for their fx department that is passable- though the directors aren't that adept at framing their shots some of the images in their rip-off manner are decent- not a movie that tells a story that gives some kind of context for something, ANYTHING.But most of the movie, as far as a somehow-slipped-into-theaters SyFy channel or (yes) Asylum DVD product that has hack actors with little genuine expression to their performances and dialog that is turgid and occasionally ludicrous (listen to one girl describe how the light appealed to her), is just forgettable junk. It's not \"good\", but it's not the worst that one has ever seen, or at least doesn't offend with its voracious attitude against logic like a Transformers movie. That is, dear readers, until the ending. This is where any logic that came before, even in the scope of an alien invasion flick done for dirt cheap, gets shredded into a thousand pieces and most of is flushed down the toilet. What happens when two of characters end up inside one of the spaceships? Well, if I revealed it I wouldn't be spoiling so much as doing too good of a favor to let you know why not to see the movie.The ending of Skyline reaches up to the heavens as a \"twist\" that suddenly makes most of the rest of the movie seem totally ludicrous in retrospect. What the hell happened? Did the screenwriters not read what they had written or tried to pass as writing to the Strause brothers? More to the point did the directors know that by trying to do a \"leave open a sequel?\" possibility that it destroyed whatever tiny shred of credibility the already loose and stupid plot had before it? The movie left me bored and dissatisfied at the hack-like nature of the material from all fronts, but the last scene left me flabbergasted and just speechless.",

They come across like smug smartass film students full of theory and no practicality. 'Clueless geek' is the catchall term for batches of the bad reviews appearing here.If you want to file a bad review, go slaughter Independence Day - a disgusting insult to the intelligence which mystifyingly still rates a 6.6 on here; gives you an idea of the mentality of those proclaiming to be sci-fi aficionados who have jumped to berate Skyline.I'm no happy-clapper when it comes to giving up my time for a piece of someone's creative effort. I'll approach with cautious interest even the well-hyped and I'll call it how I see it, as my smattering of reviews will show.I watched Skyline last night carrying a headful of the godawful reviews posted on here, and I'm sorry I paid them any heed at all. I'm a veteran of sci-fi movies, loving the genre since childhood, reading the classic novels, mags, comic books avidly. Always waiting for something to re-invigorate my enthusiasm for it...Skyline is refreshing. Derivative as can be expected (alien invasion, Cleetus - there's not a whole field of originality to pick from), but laden with grim misanthropy, dripping with suspense, chock full of great special effects which are well concealed for the first half hour, giving them a greater impact when released on your taut senses.Script - sadly, and ironically, many here site the script as a failure when in fact it is the EXACT opposite. It is perfectly pitched. No stirring heroic speeches. No intuitive insights into human nature or that of the terrifying aliens. Just normal people facing extinction in gradually increasing installments of denial/horror/grim realisation.In situations like that, as in disaster zones or war zones, the last thing you'll hear spilling from people's lips is impassioned pleas/epiphanic psychobabble. They'll follow the line of quiet clich\u00e9s, murmured despair. The dialogue plays second (or third) fiddle to the fraught terror of the situation, the characters' emotional reactions and mankind's imminent end. Correct.And the acting is fine, understated and completely believable. Everyone is terrified, and rightly so. No-one feels like saving the world entire by hijacking octopod alien starfighters curiously designed to be just the right snug fit for a human biped. EVERYONE wants to get the hell away/hide from the monstrous threat.This film does not do heroes, and thank God for that.The aliens are brutal, remorseless and just perfectly, well, alien. They've no empathy for us - we're nuts to be harvested, cracked and the useful bits extracted for their own use. We are nothing, being pulped, hunted and farmed to nothing.The chilling message is enforced here better than most. I grew to admire the hopelessness of it all, wincing at the dead end at every desperate turn.Thoroughly entertaining, grippingly suspenseful, acted with admirable restraint, and well shot with great effects.Well worth an hour and a half of your time and much much more credit than fussy tarantulas have given it. A solid SEVEN (7)",

I read a lot of negative reviews on IMDb, how bad and unwatchable this film is - actually most of them says how BAD this film is. I HATED \"AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem\" - the first directed film from Colin Strause and Greg Strause. So, my expectations to this film wasn't high. Now i can say, this film isn't BAD, it's just Your expectations to this film are wrong. This is NOT a \"Schindler's List\" or \"Inception\" type film and it not tries to be one. It's a fast paced science fiction / action popcorn flick. It has really cool visual effects (and just look at the budget!!), good action sequences, nice acting. The plot isn't original, but so what? How much movies today has one? The trailer says \"from a makers of \"2012\" \". Actually, i liked this film much more than big budget \"2012\". Look, i now what a \"BAD film\" means. Watch any of Uwe Boll's \"films\" just to now, what is a bad film. \"Skyline\" is a masterpiece comparing to those. Watch this flick, just don't expect much, and You will be very surprised.By the way, i still HATE C.Strause and G. Strause for \"AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem\" - Guys, You just CAN'T do THAT with titles like \"Aliens\" or \"Predator\", even if your are visual effects geniuses.

            "content": "The premise of skyline starts off like every other sci-fi invasion movie. Strange lights transcend to the surface of the earth with menace and power harvesting unsuspecting victims from their beds. In the movie this sequence holds the most power and entertains but unfortunately that takes place in the first 20 minutes. What follows is a journey with cardboard cutout characters and their relationship problems.We are introduced to the lead character \"Jarrod\" as he is invited to LA by his special effects wizard friend for a weekend visit. During the course of the night he falls out with his girlfriend and we find out that his \"friend\" is a persistent womanizer who beds every and any woman he can find. OK concept. Nothing wrong with that. But where the movie starts to fall apart is when the aliens attack the building where the five protagonists dwell. The entire movie's premise is set up that it will be a nerve shredding tension induced hour and a half as they suddenly come to the realization that they are surrounded with little chance of escape.But this is not what happens instead we are treated to an hour and a half of clich\u00e9d characters with even worse clich\u00e9d dialog. The directors have badly homaged the superior works of Alien, invasion of the body snatchers and war of the worlds to name but a few. It is a hodge podge of other movies which never feels right nor original.By the time David Zayas character comes into proceedings we are teetering on the edge of boredom as we have been subjected to a series of \"close calls\" with aliens that hold no tension. We care very little for any of them and their constant whining and bickering between one another makes matters worse.When we finally do manage to escape we do so to the roof top of the building. In a finale that is unexciting and unthrilling the character of \"Jarrrod\" must take on an alien single handedly squashing the human brain that is contained within its outer casing using his bare hands. This shocking Revelation is in stark contrast to the other 60 minutes previous when we have seen a legion of army f16s bombard them with smart bombs and even, at one point, a nuclear device - both times failing miserably to even so much as put a dent in the aliens Armour. But \"Jarrod\" is super human he has what no other human being has on the entire planet - a red glowing brain - yes you've read right a super saturated red glowing brain that the aliens desperately want to add to their ever growing arsenal of glowing brains. Yes it is that hilarious.To differentiate the importance of \"Jarrods\" brain and every other the filmmakers treat him to a different color - red versus normal green. In the finale \"Jarrod's\" brain is harvested and placed neatly within the cavity of an alien's casing, after much twoing and froing we suddenly realize that Jarrod's brain is alive and has taken over the alien. Go Jarrod. Just before the final credits roll we see as Jarrod is single handedly going to take down the alien hive from the inside...End credits.A shocking conclusion indeed but a more shocking one is the fact that I watched this movie until the end credits rolled. Avoid so we don't have to sit through Skyline 2.",

In the last third they pop outside in a half-hearted attempt to escape and the directors are able to use their special effects background to include a huge numbers of explosions and aliens. As the characters are so brash, stupid and unlikeable that you're more likely to cheer the aliens on. The film ends on what it thinks is a cliffhanger, which is a nice way of saying that they didn't have the budget or the brains to bring it to a proper conclusion.

Skyline is ready to consume! Of course, as ever, my biggest problem with this movie are the scenes where the addition of (or paying attention to) a science adviser was not considered important. By far the most heinous of these is the \"watch the nuke through a telescope\" scene and not be instantly blinded. And when I say telescope, I don't mean the Hubble Space Telescope via a monitor. I mean a shitty little scope with the naked eye at an explosion happening just across the city. Not only this, but the effects of the blast wave seem about as effectual. Which is to say, nothing more than a hot wind.There is additional nonsense involving the aliens seemingly using human brains as duracells or some kind of expendable resource. It's not explained and, as ever in such films, the reasoning behind the invasion is not clear at all. About the best I could come up with is \"They want our brains!\" like the tag-line of some cheesy 50's scifi B-movie.It does pass the time, though, and is mercifully short for such an epic concept.

Donald Faison has a knack for comedic timing which is very important for such a intense movie.

It begins decently and establishes what I thought was going to be an intriguing sequence of events, although by the end of the first act it's evident they had no desire to focus on mundane things like character and plot development. The Strause's also have no control over their actors, allowing the third-rate cast to let loose on clich\u00e9d facial expressions and corny dialogue delivery (Zayas is the worst offender) with characters that are already lazily stereotypical.There's very little to criticise about the otherworldly creatures on display though. They have been fascinatingly conceived and the photo-realistic CGI is predominantly flawless. They interact with the real-life components on the screen seamlessly and provide the sole positive aspect of the movie. Stick around during the end credits too, the entirely CGI prologue is by far the best sequence in Skyline.Coming from a visual effects background, the Strause's sure know how to wrangle a decent fx shot, but perhaps they should've concentrated more on everything else.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",

It was of the caliber of Cloverfield, without the annoying jittery camera movement.What I think people did not like was that humans, in the face of overwhelming force, will behave like in the face of anything else, with no higher power to protect them from the evil aliens. The feeling of hopelessness is something that I find brings realism in any film, but probably pushes away most of the audience. Well, if you expect a bunch of aliens would cross interstellar space just to come here and be defeated by Bruce Willis, you are probably naive. Nothing personal, Bruce!The plot: Intern Turk asks old buddy Haven 90210 to come work for him because he is cool and has lots of money. Aliens find out about it and decide to invade, prompting Eric Balfour's bitchy girlfriend to say \"I hate L.A.\". The aliens reciprocate and start wreaking havoc on the city. Meanwhile, the group starts making survival plans leading inevitably to someone dying and are saved in the last minute by Angel Batista-No-Relation. In the end, his own machismo is his own enemy. The ending is a bit on the happy side, since it pretty much makes Skyline 2 a sure thing for 2012. And THAT is what the Mayans predicted!Bottom line: stop whining and watch the movie.

I wasn't bothered about the actual characters trying to survive but i mean they was ok for what it was but the overall actual film was a decent watch & there's plenty of Extraterrestrial action & i liked the Glowing blue light that used throughout it's visibly Cool & the action sequences are pretty good but it just needed some more interesting characters but all that is completely rectified in it's superior sequel BEYOND SKYLINE with the Awesome FRANK GRILLO say no more!!! A decent start to this creative Alien Invasion Franchise & for the most part \"Skyline\" is a fun Alien invasion Thriller that is packed with really great special effects & i really like the Alien creatures & their ships & stuff.For a fairly low-budget sci-fi movie it's well made, exciting & incredibly inventive for what's put on screen.Eric Belfour i recognised from the excellent remake of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" & he's the best actor in the little cast but he's not that interesting but the best of the bunch & his best buddy here is one of the guys from the t.v series \"Scrubs\" Donald Faison, the rest are pretty much unknowns to me but again for a small B-movie the cast do a decent enough job.The SKYLINE franchise are like a fun mix of \"Independence Day\" & \"Aliens\" & \"Predator\" & its all pulled off in very action packed & creative ways.",

But after a great party they find themselves in the midst of an alien invasion. Alien drones search the city and mass abducts people with a strange blue light. The young couples try to escape but find themselves trapped inside the building, following the battle for survival that takes place outside their window.The first thing that hit me is that the effects are spectacular. Despite the design of the drones being just a little too similar to those from Matrix, the combination of light and biomechanics is effective, impressive and in a weird way quite beautiful. It is easy to see that a great deal of attention has been put into the visual effects and the cgi.However, Skyline is unfortunately a good example of how good effects can't rescue bad writing. While the idea and premise of the story is a movie classic, and a rather good one at that, it doesn't work. The couple are just bystanders to the events, they don't control their own fate nor force the issue nor drive the story. In fact, as for the story, these characters are uninteresting. In addition to that the chemistry between the characters are not good. Dialog is forced, and I don't believe for a second that they are lovers or partners. I wouldn't believe friends either. They just don't work together.So even if the visual is just stunning, I lost most of the interest as the story is just not exciting. I don't much care for the characters or their fate. Despite that, I still got disappointed at the end, which wasn't an end at all, but just a setup for a sequel. Why I would want to watch a sequel is beyond me though.4/10",

To not make the same mistake that I did. Paying money to see this movie will probably be one of my all time regrets in my life.The script is the worst script I've ever seen/heard.. I can't believe that a movie studio would give the green light to this. I came home to check who wrote it, so I can steer clear of any other scripts they may have written. And turns out it's 2 guys who do visual effects for The Brothers Strause. And they've never written a script besides this one. I honestly believe that anyone on IMDb writing reviews could have written a script at least as good, if not better.I can't really comment on the acting since the script and directing are too poor. Maybe the actors really can act, but you'll never know from this movie. Reminds of seeing Michael Clarke Duncan in Streetfighter The Story of Chun Li. I already know Michael Clarke Duncan can act, but that movie was so horrible it made him look horrible.I can only guess that the people giving this movie high ratings are the people who either worked on this movie, or friends of someone who worked on this movie, or the actual studio itself trying to drown out the normal 2-3 star ratings.. There is no way that this should be 6 star movie.I wish I could go back in time and undo the horrible wrong I've committed by staying for the credits to roll. I feel so low class for watching this..

I think the trailer pretty much summed the movie up a lot more accurately than most. So go with your gut on that one. If you expected 10 times as much action in the movie as in the trailer, then you haven't learnt anything from recent movie.Right, so yes, it's not a brilliantly conceived movie, yes it's kind of a remake of Independence Day (but not as directly as some would have you believe) and yes, there's not a lot of brilliant dialogue.But...For the budget I think they had (I've not bothered to look it up) they got some well known faces, an interesting concept and knock out effects. Seriously, if anyone knocks the effects in this movie then they are simply trying too hard to slag it off. There were much bigger, more expensive and well made films this past year and a half which had much bigger problems in their effects dept. So don't bother.For my money, it was actually refreshing to see some small screen actors taking to the big screen and owning it. OK, there weren't too many to compete against, but they did a good enough job for Independence Day. This isn't Shakespeare, so get over yourself.I've been watching a lot more slower movies recently and enjoyed them, but what I really needed last night was aliens, special effects, cars getting stamped on and some damn spaceships. That's what I got. I didn't care about the characters and I didn't care about caring for the characters. So that's OK.The final word.If you want a movie with the above, don't care about the characters too much, want to care about the SFX and not the blonde, then see this movie.If you want something intriguing, deep, emotional, well thought out, complex or whatever, then leave it alone until you do. But you will, sooner or later.The ending is not what you expect and yes, think about it afterwards and it does throw the rest of the film into a new light - even if it's not particularly bright, it's something to think about for a (little) while.4/10 - I enjoyed it, it's not Aliens, but at least it's not Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants.",

Then this review does not have spoilers because it doesn't ruin the movie, it actually saves you 93 minutes of your life. Skyline is the trash of the trash that the trash threw out. It is that bad.At first the movie doesn't seem all that awful. I was actually a little surprised that I was enjoying the movie\u0085 at first. The script was of course: garbage, but honestly that didn't bother me too much until about 20 minutes into the film. The characters were mildly interesting at first, but as the movie dragged on you realized just how unlovable they all are, and just how stupid they all are. There is not a single intelligent character in this film, and the one person in this movie that was slightly likable (the one chick) dies near the beginning of the movie! Now that was a real bummer. All of the characters are 2Dimensional and actually when the main character was first going to get his brain sucked out, I was actually hoping it would happen\u0085 it doesn't, but 15 minutes later it gets sucked out but we don't see much of it. Darn.The sets are all the same in this movie. The movie really could've been more interesting if the plot had been mobile, and had actually left the apartment building, but when our\u0085 \"humans\" try to leave the building the two best characters die. Ginger snaps! So that means all of the movie takes place\u0085 in the SAME building. Very tiresome indeed, but the ending does change things up a little but read on and you will see what happens\u0085 actually read what happens.Now the movie as mentioned before seems sort of interesting when you first get into it, but remember I said \"SORT OF\" interesting so I felt more like I was watching a high-quality sci-fi channel movie. The special effects are OK, and actually aren't all that impressive. The movie tries to trick you into thinking it has great effects, but the effects are actually just standard, if even that. I actually laughed when I saw the people getting sucked up because it looked so funny and bad at the same time.Now the action in this movie isn't necessarily bad, there are some cool aliens that look fairly standard and remind me a little bit of Crysis. I feel like this could have been an amazing video game, because it really plays out like one. The aliens have this constant theme of not dying, like an alien gets hit by a car\u0085 it doesn't die\u0085 then it gets its brain ripped out\u0085 it doesn't die\u0085 then it is still alive and does this very disturbing thing to a girl that reminded me of the worm scene from Galaxy of Terror. Either way the aliens don't die even when they get nuked, which made no sense. The alien ship gets nuked and all of the little ground aliens survive, and they rebuild the ship! But later in the film one alien dies just by simply getting hit by an airplane! What? To make things worse the humans (I won't say main characters because a main character has to show some sign of being not being inanimate) survive the nuke when they are a mere couple of miles away! WHAAAAAAT! Oh yeah and apparently drones (airplane drones) fly hundreds of miles per hour, and apparently a drone can fire a 300 pound rocket that is actually a nuke! Who knew?!? The movie doesn't even try to hide all of these problems. Especially when one of the main chara\u0085 I mean humans heroically *laughs* turns on a gas stove, and lights a match to try and destroy a giant walker\u0085 you can stop laughing now. And the explosion from the stove is HUGE! Who knew one could use a stove as a bomb.Well you can obviously see this movie is goofy\u0085 but just wait until you see the finale. Apparently the main character Jarrod is able to get super human strength from the aliens blue lights. The blue lights attract humans so that the aliens can suck us up and take our brains\u0085 and then put our brains in their own machines! So in reality the aliens are humans\u0085 odd. Never in the entire movie do you actually see an alien that isn't being controlled by a human brain, which begs the question of where the aliens are. Either way Jared is the only one who seems to be able to control this power, and when he and his girlfriend (who is pregnant) get sucked up, his brain is stolen and put inside an alien. But guess what! He actually controls the aliens body, and now he is a hulking alien, and he rescues his girlfriend right before she is about to get alien surgery done on her baby. But it gets better, the girl figures out that he is an alien. So now they are in the alien ship, all of Earth is under attack, and Jared is an alien. For once in the entire movie the set is not the apartment building, but inside a ship. So you would think that maybe Jared would sneak in, destroy some sort of central core, and save the world! Right? WRONG! The movie ends with him being an alien! The movie ends with him saving his girlfriend momentarily, they look at each other for a couple of seconds, and then the movie cuts instantly to the credits. I kid you not I yelled when I finished this movie, and started talking to myself for about 15 minutes afterwords about how horrible this movie was. IF you want to watch this movie, be my guest.

I first sensed it with \"Iron Man,\" and I have finally accepted why people hate movies such as \"Skyline.\" \"Iron Man\" took the approach to scientifically explain what Stark was making or how his creations functioned after the fact. This approach was smart, as it allowed a plausible and new way of telling the superhero story without a sense of wonder. This was not a problem, as that movie was entertainment genius. The issue that \"Iron Man\" caused was that the general public and critics wanting film to become overly real world. Meaning, movies should explain \"why\" without leaving a sense wonder. Everything should happen based on how the real world functions; including ALIEN invasions. Alien invasion movies are great concepts in that the film crew can create the invaders any way that they want. \"District 9\" made the aliens a metaphor, and \"Independence Day\" made the aliens bent on the classic \"death to humanity just because we can\" model. \"Skyline\" presented something new and absurd; its presentation of the aliens is entirely new, and the motives of them being more or less implied based on the imagery seen. The details are very specific and engrossing, as the intentions are so out of this world, no person can even fathom what the heck the film makers were thinking. I loved the presentation, as the thoughts the alien invasion provide have me continually guessing. It reminds me of \"Signs,\" as the aliens were never explained, but focused on actions and the adventures of the main characters. This new and VERY creative approach, I feel, put off viewers. The ending is crazy weird, not one a person with a closed mind would appreciate. I read reviews expecting crap, but what I got was a fun movie that even beat \"Deathly Hallows\" for me. Weird? For sure. \"Skyline\" is totally awesome, the problem is that the trend of down to earth believability takes over and makes people think \"that's bull-crap, aliens wouldn't do that.\" I wish I knew what aliens would do to me, maybe I should as those haters. I'm sure they have all the answers! In essence, open your mind. The movie is cool! Sure the acting can be a bit much, but the storyline and possibilities the movie opens up are insanely amazing! Go see \"Skyline,\" you won't be disappointed (unless you want a very Down-to-Earth logical movie that follows the new trend I mentioned).",

They leave it up to the imagination of the viewer, or to future films. I felt that this is good because all to often we know what the aliens want, and \"wham bam\" the hero steps in and fixes it. General audiences will like this, but sometimes it gets a bit boring. I really enjoyed how the characters seemed hopeless up until the very last scene, in which Jarrod's brain makes an epic takeover of one of the aliens. SO AWESOME!!! This leaves the ending to the imagination, and is the true beauty sometimes. Leaving the audience wondering....what if?Now, to address the actual script. Halfway through the film I began to realize that these characters were simply your average Joe, and were not going to be a huge impact on the man vs alien outcome. This led to a feeling of \"why is this worth watching?\" because when we go to see movies, we want to hear fantastic tales! We want highlights! We want great stories! Yes, the directors took a different approach by having their characters be very \"average people\" which is liked by some, and despised by others. It took going out on a limb to do it. Did it work? A little. Much of the movie the audience doesn't have much to root for, as few of the characters really have redeeming value. I feel Elaine was the only character who had pure intent, yet she played a very passive role, and didn't take much forefront. Next time, make Jarrod less of a jerk and make him excited to be having a baby!As far as the script? C-. The dialogue was all too clich\u00e9, as the characters were not very developed. They didn't give them much time, as they wanted to quickly jump into the visuals and play to the films strengths. However, this oversight led to a lack of \"realism\" with the characters. A little bit more time with the script and character development would have given the film at LEAST 2 more stars. Yes the characters want to stay alive, but that is only so inspiring after a while. When they have a reason beyond themselves, that is when films go from good to great!Across the board, a well put together piece by the Strause Brothers, as they showed they can make a movie that sells. Now they will have more chances to prove that they can make movies that capture the hearts of the viewers!",

I don't care if space ships go wooosh in a vacuum. But I do prefer that there be enough scientific basis to a movie that it is at least plausible. Skyline goes so far beyond believable, its not even preposterous. An alien race arrives on Earth to harvest humans. OK, I can buy that. But not for food. Or any other believable purpose. They do it to harvest their brains so that they can....uh....put them in new alien bodies to make more aliens? Huh? Let's see, an alien can grab a person, violently rip their head off, and then pluck out their brain and spinal cord, completely intact and unharmed, with about as much effort as pealing a banana. Of course, that's believable. Nothing wrong with that picture. And then this brain is handed to a new (baby?) alien who sucks it in and shazam, a new, fully functional alien. Got it. So are we saying that this alien race can't procreate without human bodies to pluck brains out of? So how did they get started to begin with? Then there is the idea of why the aliens would even want the brains of the people in this movie. Who would want a brain of anyone that dumb? Let's see now, we're hiding for our lives from big bad aliens who will do anything to catch us. I got an idea. Let's hide in an apartment, on the outside top floor of a tall building, in plane sight. The apartment with the great big, floor to ceiling windows. Oh, wait, we taped bed sheets over the windows. That'll fool them. Should we go down in the basement maybe? No. They might find us there. Oh, and how about ships that have legs hanging out the back, and when they want to move, they pull in their legs and then push off with them, causing the ship to lurch forward. Like frogs jumping. OK. I can see that. Even if they did borrow it from the movie Altered. Perfectly plausible. Hey, if I was a super race capable of interstellar travel, that's how I'd make my ships work.

We need to be open to new approach to art and judge them within their own context. At the same time we should also take into account how others feel about movies. But if you are lucky enough to watch Ferocious Planet, then you who think Skyline is the worst movie ever, should question your own ability to rate a movie.

So far Skyline is more \"humane\" rather than the squared box ending that we are used to, making humankind THE all time winner and Master of the universe.

Old Sci-fi, foreign sci-fi. . .I've even been known to sit through fan-made movies at sci-fi conventions without the crutch of massive amounts of adult beverages in my system. I love sci-fi that much.After watching Skyline, however, I have, for the first time in my 40-odd years of watching good/bad/indifferent sci-fi, actually walked away not only confused, but feeling as if I had been violated without the usual afterglow peck-on-the-cheek. . .or even a few bucks on the nightstand for cab fare.The concept was very promising. I won't go over the. . uh. . \"plot\" of this movie because you can read it here on IMDb, but the teasers led me to believe that this would be rich in opportunity.And rich in opportunity it was. . .but apparently the pickaxes of the gold-diggers missed the mother-lode. . .at this point, I'm not even sure they were on the same mountain.There I sat, eyes glued to the screen with what I can only hope resembled a slightly puzzled look on my face as I waited (and waited, and waited) for some explanation of what was going on in the movie. From the opening credits, of which there are many. . enough to make me question how many promises had to be made by the producers that donors to this cause would get their names on the opening sequences, to the ending credits, the moviegoer is whipped along in what can only be compared to an experience similar to viewing a foreign-language experiment in modernizing MacBeth. The characters seem to be similar to what you've seen before, but there's seldom a clue as to who is whom. Unlike others, I don't have a problem with the acting. . .I'm sure everyone involved with this venture was a bit distracted at actually being INVOLVED with this venture.The \"plot\" had so many holes in it from beginning to end that I'd be surprised if the working title hadn't been along the lines of \"The Swiss Cheese Project.\" From Jared's reason for going to LA (to meet his friend who did. . .what?) to the end where his central nervous system was used in a way that appeared to be some sort of soothing suppository for inflamed alien orifices, I just couldn't figure out why anything was happening (SPOILER. . .hey guys, the reasons the aliens aren't out over the water is because humans don't LIVE on the water in large numbers).With Plot holes this large and no redeeming qualities other than \"Love Conquers All. . .sorta,\" it was like going to a major league baseball game and having the pitcher roll a kickball at the batter.So, if you are thinking about spending your hard-earned cash on this movie (or even going on a dare), wait for it to show up on broadcast TV. . .or even better, just don't do it.If you think I may be simply a disgruntled moviegoer. . .go watch any of the other movies and stand in the hall when this movie lets out. Listen to the comments from those who have just experienced Skyline. I haven't heard so many negative comments at the theater since they stopped using the good oil to cook popcorn in.There are two reasons for my not giving this a \"0\" rating. . .first, there is no number lower than 1 on the ratings guidelines and, second, the special effects were phenomenal.The most shocking part of the evening, however, was experienced as I was walking out. Another patron mentioned that they are already considering a sequel. The resulting groans and looks of disbelief that greeted his comments were stunning.",

I don't know why people are complaining about a lack of plot, it's basically a slasher movie - lots of dislikable people get knocked of in entertaining ways. That's worked for many movies before it, and it works here. It's basically a knock off of Cloverfield, and not as good, but still good fun.It's not a 'Plan 9 from outer space' but it does have a 50s B-movie sensibility about it. I think the only thing it was missing was a bit of humour to acknowledge the basic silliness of all - Independence Day was better in that regard. To be honest I enjoyed this more than Spielbergs War Of The Worlds, which I found annoying, disjointed and boring.Great SFX I thought, lots of video-game images brought to the big screen (Quake, Gears Of War, Resistance Fall of Man etc.) and couple of scenes that are genuinely spectacular, especially given the budget relative to something like Avatar (now that was a boring film!).I can't say I was one of those really desperate to see this from the trailer, and perhaps lower expectations helped, but it no way deserves the critical panning it has received.",

To give you a feel for my style, my favorite movie is Avatar, followed by this here Skyline, followed then by The Matrix, The Abyss, Galaxy Quest, and District 9 (top six).People say \"If you like War of the Worlds, Cloverfield, and Independence Day you'll like this.\" Personally I didn't like Cloverfield or War of The Worlds much at all, and this just blew Independence Day away.The acting was great in my opinion. I think people found it bad because they are used to more script-oriented movies, however this one is much more natural and sounds more realistic, which I guess people mistook for bad acting. In real life, we aren't all good actors though.Whoever wrote this movie was amazingly creative, the ending was great in my opinion, totally unexpected. Used a lot of interesting and unique ideas in this movie, such as the blinds on a timer, the alien technology, and the use of telescopes.Everything had a perfect buildup, showing the audience specific ideas so they could be returned to later during the invasion to make more sense, such as Jarrod putting his hand on his girlfriend's nose.One thing that rather irritated people was the lack of sensibility from the plot. Two responses to that, one being that it is science fiction, and I believe that the movie viewers have been straying away from what's fun and enjoyable about science fiction, and the second being the purpose of the confusion. This movie wasn't supposed to be understandable. It's following an experience boots-in-the-mud in which the characters have no clue what exactly is going on, and this feeling is planted into the audiences mind as well, which didn't go down so well I guess, people just complained that they didn't understand it. Sorry.A solid 97/100, I love being blown away by people's creative take on another species, especially in contrast with the nature of our own species.Can't wait for the Blu-Ray.",

And they try to introduce the movie with a flash back sequence, but the flash back is only like 15 minutes in movie time. They're not even trying to get you interested and the only reason they use the flashback is to develop some sort of character development, which doesn't work anyway. At least they have the decency to bring the aliens in fairly soon into the movie. There were really only a couple good things about it. One, the special effects are pretty cool, especially when the Air Force gets involved. The Aliens are decent enough and I liked how they used the old school motivation for the them by using tractor beams to capture people and then stealing their brains. And finally the very ending was actually somewhat cool. I won't ruin it by telling you what happens so just watch the last 45 or so minutes and you might enjoy yourself.

This can take the form of natural disasters, biological threats or the quiet ( or not so quiet) arrival of hostile visitors from beyond. The recent release, \"Skyline\", takes on the alien invasion plot with the opening scene being luminous and ethereal blue lights dropping from the sky onto a sleeping Los Angeles. We flashback to the day before and meet our main characters of Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) who are traveling to L.A. to visit an old friend of Jarrod's who has made a successful go at fame and fortune in the movie industry. Very quickly we get the necessary but shallow set up for our characters. Jarrod is a knight in shining armor who helps strangers with their luggage on the airplane and Elaine is appropriately uncomfortable with the L.A. lifestyle they stumble into. Jarrod's friend, Terry (Donald Faison) has become a bit of a sleaze and has a girlfriend (Brittany Daniel) so instantly unlikable that you know attempts to humanize her later will fail. Terry throws a blow out party in his penthouse and we're ready for the invasion scene this hungover group will awake to early the next morning.I'll render my final judgment early and say that if the goal here was to create a group of vaguely unlikable characters and kill them off over 92 minutes, then they succeeded. There are obvious similarities between \"Skyline\" and 2008's \"Cloverfield\". I was a fan of the latter and despite any gimmicks used like the hand held camera work, I related to the characters and cared about them in the way an audience should. That just did not happen during \"Skyline\". The first obvious issue I had was with the two leads. Jarron and Elaine have very little chemistry as an on screen couple and the casting choice was odd. The actors have such similar and distinct faces that they look like siblings. It was as if they came from the same very pretty Eastern European, Calvin Klein \"esque\" family of models.\"Skyline\" also lacks creativity and suspense. The aliens must be keeping up with Earth pop culture because they are a mish mash of creatures from \"The Matrix\", \"War of the Worlds\" and the recent Terminator movie. Out of the 92 minute run time there were only a couple moments that reached edge of your seat anticipation and those involved the decent special effects and an air battle that conjured a feeling of \"hooray for U.S. military might\"\"Skyline\" should have ended with the forlorn scenes of the world's capitals in ruins and under the same type of attack as L.A. but instead we get an overly long ending that screams \"SEQUEL\". In fact it is so long it continues in snapshot scenes during the credits. I'll spare you. You can exit the theater as soon as possible because there is nothing left worth seeing.",

            "content": "What a bummer! \"Skyline\" had a very promising marketing campaign - posters that hook our attention, a seemingly high-concept plot, and shocking trailers - you have in your hands a recipe for success, no?Most unfortunately, the film sadly just fails to deliver. There is no substance, no characters you actually care for, a hackneyed dud of a screenplay, and well, bad acting throughout.The actors, most of which are unknowns (and the ones who aren't, aren't big-time superstars) simply cannot act. The person who delivers the closest thing to decent acting is David Zayas as, well, another unmemorable character. Donald Faison seriously needs to change his agent. The ladies look gorgeous but that's it.What can I say about the screenplay? Absolutely dreadful. The below sub- par acting is made worse with the horribly-written lines that come out of the actors' mouths, shredding any hope of credibility left in the screenplay and making their acting actually worse than before. Oh man! The premise had so much potential, and there's (very sadly indeed) a missed opportunity to see a certain message about \"evolution\", like fellow IMDb user dtssound mentioned, but to me it could've been fleshed out more instead of the damn useless cardboard characters.Now onto the good news. The special effects are actually, genuinely well done. The creature effects and designs are very interesting and creative, thanks to veteran designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr. The action sequences are genuinely kinetic and engaging, and they look like they belong in another, more superior movie (the inter-cuts between the action sequences and the characters just did not feel natural). The cinematography is good, big and (here's one of the film's best things) you see everything that is happening. No shaky camera to speak of. That's great. The production design is good, especially at the end. The music is kind of corny though.Considering that the overall budget for the film is a low US$10 million, it is a triumph for the visual effects industry and it is proof Hollywood can contrive great special effects without ballooning their budget to the hundred-millions. Having said that, would it kill the producers to spend a little bit more money on script doctors, consulting producers AND acting coaches?In fact, I think this is just an exercise of CGI by the Brothers Strause. The directors have a great eye for visual effects, but they have to look for a script that is not just all eye candy, plus with better actors. Veteran sci-fi filmmakers like James Cameron and George Lucas should hire these two for whatever projects they got lining up, I'm confident that they'll do a great job under their watchful eyes.It's sad to see a great concept sadly destined for obscurity thanks to the horrible treatment the screenplay has given the film. And plus, just when it's getting really exciting and interesting, the film just ends abruptly. Aargh. Room for a sequel? With quality like this, don't get cocky. This film is lucky that it's released theatrically and worldwide to boot (no doubt it will regain many times more than its original budget in the United States alone). It honestly looks more suited for the direct-to- video audience. \"Skyline\" is a bad film, and let's hope the Brothers Strause learn from this folly before it's too late.Skip this one for the Blu-Ray rental, folks.Overall rating: 32/100 (20% went to the special effects, action, the premise and the concept)",

However, the fact of a modest budget to realize a brand new type of alien invasion should earn it a little respect. That is the main attraction of this movie - New Aliens. It's not more predators or \"aliens\" aliens or new twist on greys(AKA - Independence day) but actual New Aliens. The movie doesn't spell out everything you would like to know about the invaders, but you should be able to get the gist of it. In My humble opinion a larger cast(forbidden by this budget) would have served the movie well. If a sequel is under consideration it should expand the setting, double the cast and delve a little bit more into the aliens(maybe a brief recent history or something). It's impossible to make an honest review without mentioning my dislike for the one-sided reviews that just want to label it an awful movie and possibly stick us with nothing but a neverending supply of sequels and remakes of already successful franchises. It really didn't deserve the 9 stars I gave it, but all the supercritics out there were just bagging it so unmercifully that I felt the need for a little counterbalanceBottom line - Skyline is a movie with a lot of potential that wasn't fully realized, but was still very much worth watching. Give it a chance - it's kind of a mix of independence day/war of the worlds/the mist.",

            "content": "The thing that struck me about this movie was how humans were treated just as we treat other species we consider \"lesser\". In fact, it looked like a retelling of the destruction of the passenger pigeon! The passenger pigeon was once so numerous, the flocks would blot out the sun as they passed. People went on killing sprees when they saw this, and shot them by the dozens at a time, and merrily threw them into pots (or sold them as delicacies for the pots of others.) Of course, one day people woke up and wondered where all the passenger pigeons went. The Skyline aliens were shown doing _the exact same thing_. I think people wouldn't like this movie, just because they know that we would have no moral grounds to object to being treated this way by a superior species. We wouldn't like being treated this way, but we do have such a vested interest in treating others this way, we don't like to think what would happen if we found ourselves as the \"dumb beasts\". We might think ourselves special, but I bet these aliens do, too, and would insist that what they want automagically trumps what we want - just as we do to our lessers. And why would they want to try to speak with something they consider inferior? We barely try to communicate, as well. Yes, there were the experiments with dolphins, apes, and parrots, but most of those have fallen by the wayside and are now ignored. Noam Chomsky, linguist and rabid leftie, was so appalled by the idea of apes using human language that he redefined language itself to take it out of the hands of apes - and also out of the mouths of children younger than about 5. If we were to meet aliens that are \"like us\", well, the treatment we get in Skyline would be exactly the sort of treatment we could expect. And that's why I give this movie high marks - it's more realistic in its dismalness than any of those movies where some \"hero\" saves the day single-handedly with a Mac computer or some tripe.",

However, i really can't say that this is the worst movie ever made, and im really annoyed by the people trashing it so strongly. The first half of the movie was actually pretty good, started building up slowly for the Alien invasion, and then when the Aliens first pop out of the sky and descend into the streets of L.A, i thought that was shot in a very good way and it was enjoyable to watch. the footage of L.A skylines were amazing and the way they added those effects were cool. the special effects were really stunning. But the movie still disappointed me, because the storyline did not add anything original, the characters development were poorly executed, and they were mostly boring and clich\u00e9d. and as many mentioned earlier, the ending was lame. so in summary, i wouldn't say it is one of the best sci fi movies out there, but not the worst movie either. it is just about average.",

            "content": "Well, this movie can be summarized with a single line: \"Special effects galore, but at the expense of a shallow storyline\".When this movie ended I was feeling somewhat cheated and I was left with questions like \"why was this movie necessary?\", \"what was the purpose of this movie?\" and \"was that really it?\". The movie is full of really nice looking and awesome special effects, but that is where it ends. From there on, the movie is just an empty, shallow shell that has no leverage or meaning what so ever.Now, the actors and actresses, in my opinion, actually did a good enough job with the roles that they were given. However, every single character seemed generic and cut from the same block. None of the characters in the movie stood out with their own unique personalities, traits and such. It somewhat appeared that the characters were only filling for the special effects of the movie. And truth be told, the special effects alone carried the movie all the way. And actually, somewhere along the movie, around midways through it or so, you start giving up on the characters and just let the movie continue on with its monotone CGI festival.This movie had potential, and it did look nice in the trailers, but it turned out to be somewhat of a lukewarm experience. I know that I will not be returning to this movie ever again. There is no second watching of this movie. You see it once, and then bag and tag it. The CGI effects were grand, but not enough to make you want to pick up the movie and watch it a second time around.There are lots of other nice alien movies out there, such as \"Cloverfield\" or \"The Host\". This one failed to punch through and make a mark on the alien/monster market. This movie was a disappointment, but perhaps I had too high hopes for it after having seen the trailers for it.",

The only thing worse than a movie falling short of expectations is when it falls short after appearing on countless advertising slots and theater previews. There are warning signs right from the beginning that the film isn't going to make it. When a director opens with a scene and then shoots back in time to show what lead up to the scene, they should probably show something of significance. Otherwise, they've just wasted time and created filler. The character development (or lack there of) does nothing for the movie. Outside of thinking \"hey it's the funny black guy from Scrubs\" I don't think viewers felt any sense of connection. Lastly, I don't understand the modern approach directors take these days of making sure every movie has an opening for a sequel. It's laughable in this case when you consider the fact that this movie was a failure. Do they really think someone is going to pay them to make another one? Bottom line: take the Sentinels from The Matrix, effects from Independence Day, and some story line from War of the Worlds you get a really bad movie.",

This has to be some of the worst writing in a movie this year. The dialouge is so bad it's funny with lines such as; \"We need to survive.\" and \"Don't make me hurt you.\" It looks like they tried to give the characters some depth but just gave up and the characters end up looking like stupid morons. I didn't care about any of them. This movie should have been called \"What Not to do in an Alien Invasion\" The movie never gives us a clear reason as to why the aliens came to earth other than to suck out our brains which the aliens use as a battery to power themselves and their machinery. The story is stupid because we never see what's going on elsewhere. The acting is also terrible. David Zayas got on my nerves with his speech impediment. I usually like Donald Faison(Turk from Scrubs), but he just isn't good in this, playing the sort of stereotypical black guy. Brittany Daniel, while I found her funny in Joe Dirt and It's always Sunny in Philadelphia, in this I kept thinking; \"Just die already.\" I found the ending to be lame, stupid, and hilarious. I was like; \"Really Strause Brothers, you are going to go in that direction.\" The only good thing about this movie are the effects but even they seem to get worse as the movie goes on. There are like two action sequences which are OK. The Strause brothers need to go back to creating special effects for movies instead of making them, because effects seem to be the only thing that they are good at. In the end all this movie is is an Independence Day rip-off.",

The special effects are probably the only thing that this film can offer to the viewer. See the trailer and that is enough.

I'm pleased to say that it did not disappoint as there are too few films, in my taste, that leave me feeling so energised. Right up until the end, when the film enters into the supernatural environment and we break from what had been a familiar world of apartments, swimming pools and the outdoors, with excellent graphics, it's easy to get lost. All chatter in the cinema had quickly ceased and it had been a long time since I had noticed an audience so transfixed on the screen. Following the events of a vacationing New York couple in Los Angeles and their companions at the LA-based mate's apartment, we witness the arrival of extraterrestrial beings who syphon humans into their craft. The group holds out for as long as it's able, hiding in the apartment and eventually looking for an escape when it becomes apparent that the aliens are everywhere and are scouring every rock, presumably on the planet, for every last human being. Half way into the film, we realise what the purpose - to some degree - is that the aliens have for us, and this is very much a break from what I could have envisioned. The heroic couple eventually succumb to the aliens and are likewise abducted and treated the same way as everyone else not clever enough to find suitable hiding: perhaps aboard a ship at sea or deep under the ground. It's at this point that the film loses a lot of its believability. Well, as far as alien abduction on a planet-wide scale could be, and the graphics slip a bit in their awesomeness. Overall, definitely worth an hour and a half on one's behind (don't think that the relatively short duration means that the film's in any way lacking). I would liken the feel to a mix of The Matrix, Independence Day and Dawn of the Dead.",

But to see a new film so unrelievedly miserably awful from start to finish cries shame on every producer, executive producer, writer and director involved. What were you thinking? Eric Balfour's character, who for some reason is considered to be incredibly creative, arrives in L.A. to go to his friend's birthday party. His friend is unbelievably successful at something, so much so that he has -- can you believe this? -- a penthouse apartment in Los Angeles. Everyone in L.A. aspires to be so successful they can have a penthouse apartment overlooking the marina! Eric Balfour's character is so impressed! His so-successful friend says, \"let's hit to pool!\" and everyone goes and sits around the pool that is shared by everyone who lives in the three-building complex. Does this sound like someone incredibly successful to you? Probably they made a deal for the use of the building.So, there's this party, and this incredibly successful black man's birthday party is just chock-full of white people. And a bunch of people spend the night on couches and such.They are woken up at 4:27 a.m. by blinding bright lights outside. What could it be? It's very strange! And the effect of the light does AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS to your skin. But then it goes away, so that's okay. And then -- more AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS! Spiny, insectile spaceships arrive from the sky -- you know if they're insect-like, they've got to be evil. And bunches of people are hauled up into the sky, oh no! So, what do you do if space ships are sucking people up from the ground? You -- get on a boat and go out to sea where you're a sitting duck, right? Probably, faced with an alien invasion, there are people somewhere in the world who are making interesting decisions, figuring out a way to save themselves and others, and fight the good fight. But this film isn't about those people. This film is about a guy who, when faced with trouble, breaks into his neighbor's house to steal the car keys to his cool car, so he can drive it three blocks to the marina. It is about people who, finding themselves surrounded by evil invaders, go back to the penthouse apartment and go to sleep. Three skimpily clad women, after a brief, horrendous encounter with aliens, go back to the apartment, and instead of clearing out the debris from the party, filling containers with water, and making sandwiches, lie down and go to sleep. And remember they were woken at 4:27 a.m.? Well, not much has happened since then. The sun has just risen. It's morning, but they lie down and go to sleep.Nobody would want to know these people! Fortunately, by the end they all get their just deserts, but unfortunately, it was not nearly soon enough for us, by about two hours.So who came up with this? A bunch of -- who could have called this? -- special effects guys. So, what is this? A bunch of guys saying, hey, we can write a better movie than those guys can, and we can use all our AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS! So here it is, and they have proved themselves profoundly in error. There is an art and a craft to storytelling, guys, and you have none of it. For ten million dollars you have managed to make an entire film without a single enjoyable moment in it.

            "content": "\"Skyline,\" the latest entry in \"The War of the Worlds\"/ \"Independence Day\" science fiction genre about aliens invading Earth, qualifies as an above-average opus with spectacular-looking alien spaceships as well as exotic airborne creatures with twitching tentacles galore. The first forty-five minutes of the Brothers Strause epic lures you into its enigmatic storyline with its vast horde of aliens and their way of mesmerizing their victims with blinding lights before they gobble them like snacks. Unfortunately, the second half of \"Skyline\" doesn't provide any exposition and we are left watching helpless humans playing cat and mouse games with these ugly \"Cloverfield\" style predators. Meanwhile, the human characters in \"Skyline\" are neither compelling nor sympathetic. First, they consist of clueless civilians confined to a high-rise apartment complex. Indeed, unlike the original \"War of the Worlds\" (1953) and \"Independence Day,\" \"Skyline\" doesn't trot out the usual array of high ranking military leaders plotting strategy from secluded bunkers while bespectacled scientists scramble to invent new technology capable of exterminating the aliens. Second, nobody seems to know anything about these intergalactic predators except you can either stun them if you crash a car into them or blast them to smithereens with anything from an assault rifle to explosive missiles. Nevertheless, they outnumber the heroes, and they give no quarter. Mind you, the aliens themselves never let us in on why they decided to devastate the planet. Instead, they are munching bunches of humans as if humanity were a buffet, and the prime human delicacy for these entities is the human brain. They chomp them like broccoli. Okay, a mind is a terrible thing to waste in \"Skyline,\" but there is something unusual about these aliens that distinguish them from most aliens. When they shine their blinding lights on these poor humans, the light that strikes our heroes turns them into slightly grilled zombies. Sometimes the light enables our heroes to muster enough energy to fight back. Worst of all, \"Skyline\" doesn't so much conclude as it simply ends on a cliffhanger, leaving the hero and heroine in a beauty and the beast situation.Elaine (Scottie Thompson of \"Star Trek\") and Jarrod (Eric Balfour of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\") are recuperating for a birthday party thrown for Jarrod's best friend Terry (Donald Faison of \"Next Day Air\") in Los Angeles when blinding lights penetrate the shutters of Terry's apartment. Elaine awakens with a case of morning sickness and stumbles into the bathroom. Afterward, she rouses Jarrod who checks out the light and his skin crinkles into a veil of lines. At this point, sophomore co-directors Colin and Greg Strause, who helmed \"AVPR: Aliens vs. Predator \u2013 Requiem,\" and freshmen scenarists Joshua Cordes and Liam O'Donnell back up the action by fifteen hours and we see Elaine and Jarrod getting off a jet at Los Angeles International Airport. Jarrod is surprised when a uniformed chauffeur awaits them at the curb with a limo. The chauffeur takes them to a scenic Marina del Rey luxury penthouse apartment with giant windows where they meet Terry and the celebration begins. This is about the time that we learn that Elaine is sick and Terry wants Jarrod to relocate from New York to Los Angeles and work with him. Later that night after everybody has passed out from too much liquor, the night skies over L.A. scintillate with a shower of incandescent meteors. One of Terry's friends sacked out in the living room opens the shutters and the lights lure him onto the balcony. Veins appear like burn wounds on his face and protoplasm-like extraterrestrial invaders suck him and thousands of others into their mouths. Eventually, Jarrod and Terry investigate, principally through a telescope that they had used the evening before to spy on other residents and are amazed at the flotilla of bizarre looking alien spacecraft filling the skyline. They figure out that they must not look into the light and close the shutters. Before long the alien creatures flying around like inquisitive squid send their tentacles into the apartments to feed on the residents. Naturally, our heroes learn nothing from television news sources and they venture outside for a better look. Initially, the military respond with marauder jets and snipers armed with .50 caliber rifles. Jarrod notices that nothing appears to be happening over the marina and Terry and he pile into cars with their girlfriends and c0-workers and head for the marina. They don't get far before a humongous \"Godzilla\" like predator stomps Terry's car. This gigantic beast chases them around the high-rise about the same time that a new character, Oliver (David Zayas of \"The Expendables\"), joins them. Earlier, during Terry's birthday part, Oliver had warned them to keep the racket down. He has keys to everything in the high-rise and the survivors regroup in Terry's apartment and watch the ensuing battle between mankind and these aliens.Essentially, if you've seen one alien disaster movie or television mini-series, you've seen them all. Only the aliens themselves change. \"Skyline\" boasts some terrific looking aliens and these elaborate predators steal the show. Meantime, the humans are a dull, dreary lot waiting to be eaten. After the novelty of the aliens wears off and the Strause brothers show that these invades are vulnerable to conventional weapons, \"Skyline\" loses its grip on us because we still don't know anything about these predators, except that they love to feed on brains. The last thing that the Strauses do is take us within the belly of these beasties where our heroes wind up with little hope for them and then \"Skyline\" ends with a whimper. Clearly, a sequel is in the works from this cliffhanger ending, but you walk out of the movie feeling like you have been cheated despite the film's trim 92 minute running time. The only thing worse than a bad movie is half of a bad movie!",

The first 20 minutes were a total bore; I was like \"where is this story going?' I understand they were trying to establish some sort of character relationships at the beginning, but it was so uninteresting the way they present it, and you still don't really care about any of them afterward. At least it got better when we finally got to the aliens attack. Still, there is no plot whatsoever, just a lot of running around, and the characters getting killed one by one in predictable fashions. They also tried a couple of slow-mo scenes when it's not necessary. You could see they borrowed heavily from other sci-fi movies, but the result is very mediocre in term of engaging the audience and delivering the total package. Like my boss said after the movie, it feels like an end-of-class project by some visual effect graduate students.",

It never redeemed itself, it was worse than AVP:R.This guy named Jarrod goes to see his friend Terry (Donald Faison, the only actor I heard of before)in Los Angeles. And then all of a sudden aliens come to steal our brains. And they use this light to attract humans so that they can steal their brains. But the light has a different effect on Jarrod which was never explained.The special effects on the aliens were good, but the special effects on the fighter planes and stealth ships that we have in real life look like garbage. The story was horrible, the acting was horrendous, and the ending was really, really bad. I heard they're making a sequel, and I hope they don't because I can't see them doing anymore stuff with this garbage. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

There have so many of them in recent years, the genre has become a bore. Couple this with the fact that \"Skyline\" is lacking in story and character development, and you will likely be disappointed. However, the \"blue light monster\" does turn out to be fairly substantial and the special effects are nicely corralled by brothers Greg and Colin Strause.

            "content": "\"Skyline\" is such an awful film. I don't mind the lack of any originality displayed by the plot of this movie, but this is boring, uninteresting and shallow that I hardly could watch the whole thing.Basically, \"Skyline\" tries too hard to be like \"Cloverfield\", taking every bad aspect from that movie (The shaky camera movements, the bad dialogues, the fake \"realism\", the lack of explanation of most of the things happening in the course the story, focusing in the uninteresting lives of the boring characters instead of the action and science fiction elements of the story) and making them way more annoying. At least the characters from \"Cloverfield\" were much less annoying, and there were some thrills and excitement. This movie doesn't have anything of that, being a boring mess with zero entertainment value. What's the point of having incredible special effects if most of the film consist in seeing the uninteresting lives of uninteresting (and annoying) human characters? This film seems more like a really bad soap opera with very little science fiction elements. All the scenes concerning the alien invasion are way too brief and flashy, while the boring, mundane scenes of the human characters reacting to what's happening took almost all the screen time. That doesn't work for me, and in my opinion it doesn't make this movie more \"realistic\" or mysterious, just more annoying and boring.\"Skyline\" it's a complete waste of time, being the only saving grace are the quality of the special effects. Sadly, those good special effects can barely be appreciated since this movie focuses way too much in the uninteresting human characters that seem like stereotypes borrowed from a reality show.0/10",

Most 10 year old's love to see cool aliens, and explosions, right? Skyline was the first time I hated a movie-going experience in my life. I did not like this movie even as a 10 year old.Skyline is full of very uninteresting characters, which right off the bat, felt like they were lacking story behind them. The story of this film is very boring and non unique. Another typical \"end of the world\" or \"alien\" type movie does not sound promising anymore; and Skyline proves this.Skyline takes place in the same location during the 1hr and 40min runtime (which felt more around 3 hours), except for the last 5-10 minutes of this movie. There was no sense of discovery in this movie, or character development because of this, along with many other reasons.The action scenes in Skyline are there, which are the only watchable part of this movie.

A small group is trapped within a Four Seasons Hotel and struggle to survive. Among them only Eric Balfour and Scottie Thompson contain any depth. Thompson is pregnant and Balfour isn't sure what to make of it but an earlier encounter with the bright light has something infecting him. Unfortunately the ending is a disappointment and wrecks all expectations. Among the other cast are Brittany Daniel and Crystal Reed who are basically victims to be sucked into oblivion. They can all hope that this is not the height of their careers. This is basically a no way out situation where dying seems like the only option. Every angle played out is met with disaster and death to the point where there are no rooms to hide in. While the ending is a complete letdown the directors Colin and Greg Strause are backed with effective visual elements including electric octopus aliens that are the limits here. That pretty much sums up the purpose of the film, and the Strause brothers one marketing pointer. It is ruled by CGI and as little imagination as possible. Even the computer generated animation Monsters Vs Aliens took this theme to a more respectful level than what is seen in this laser light show to nowhere. Score: 3 / 10",

In fact when I found out the very low budget for this alien invasion movie I was hesitant on seeing it, but I thought it would pull off a \"District 9\" so went to see it anyways. Now I must say, this is very far from being good as \"District 9\" was and is actually boring for the most part. The characters aren't interesting, the acting isn't good and was hoping it for it to end as soon as possible during the scenes with the character build up. I really didn't care if anyone of them lived or died, and it's tries to be ballsy with the ending and all but there just wasn't any emotional impact for you to care.

Just pointless action, poor acting and hollow characters. This film along with another film I watch around the same time called \"Ultramarines\" is not typical of the load of eye candy everyone thinks will make a good movie.Imagine: You wake up and all the sudden you see pretty lights sucking people away. You look into a telescope and see hunderds of people being sucked up by exotic spacecraft. Your confused, you have no idea whats going on and your survival instincts kick in to the point of self preservation at any cost. Thats what we were shown in this movie and the audience never has seen this before and they saw it as negative. Well get real guys, if this did happen, more than likely your cowering in a basement waiting for it to blow over while thinking over and over again of an escape even though you would be throwing yourself out of the frying pan into the fire.There was no explanation of course. Most sci fi movies provide an explanation to prevent confusion but this one used the confusion of the audience to enhance the realism. However for an audience used to explanations it was a negative reaction.The Person of interest in this story is Jerrod. Jerrod was kinda of a selfish person who didn't think ahead. He lived in the moment and when the crap hits the fan it was always about him and his way. The story more or less revolves around him.For a low budget movie, only a million dollars they did a good job with the pretty lights and exotic space craft and aliens. The actors were good for the roles and during the epic dog fight, I was making the same facial expression the actors where when they watched on, holding on to their last glimmer of hope. Like Ultramaries, the producers allocated the money to the right places.This movie isn't for everyone, it makes you think, its very psychological. Ending was rather astonishing and the dog fight in the movie is how it would be in real life.

This is why I had to write this.I consider myself as a demanding movie lover: after watching movies almost weekly, sometimes daily for more than three decades, I only own about 350 DVDs and BluRays; moreover I am curious by nature. So, after hesitating I decided to try and watch Skyline... And it was really worth it.From the very beginning, I found it globally amazing. The visual and sound special effects are incredibly efficient, especially with a HD screen and a high quality sound system. If you liked Cloverfield and Edge of Tomorrow, then you will probably enjoy Skyline: it is fundamentally the same kind of movie.Of course, you have to avoid Skyline if you are looking for a good story and subtle character development: nothing like this here. No high quality acting, no psychological introspection; you could even say that Skyline has no plot... But it is not the point: Skyline was entirely designed to entertain and frighten the audience, not to make people think. What you will see is a hair-raising alien invasion. And I can tell you I WAS ENTERTAINED AND FRIGHTENED!!! (as far as a movie can frighten you...)So, what can I say? Avoid all the bad reviews and give it a try: it is definitely worth it!8/10.(I apologize if my English does not seem fluent, since I am French.)",

There was no direction, no plot, no overall theme, no reason to see this film at all.

I don't know how else to say it. NOTHING HAPPENS. Even the end, where finally something occurs, is cut off and contrived. At most, the end of this film should have been the end of Act I. Instead, the writers passed it off as an entire movie.And speaking of the writers, these guys must be out of their minds arrogant. The characters are depicted \"living the large life\"-- girls, cars, and style-- even though they are just CG artists. Why is that arrogant you ask? Oh, maybe because the writers of the film are all CG artists. And if this movie is any judge, they should stick to that.I like aliens. I like explosions.

Believe the mostly honest ratings and reviews here as there are some pathetic moments here such as the stealth bomber being shot from the sky, hitting the rooftop where are 'heroes' are lying prone and then somersaulting over heroes to miss them and career into an alien, without even an explosion, wing dent or scorch mark on the rooftop. There were only three of us in the audience to watch this film in its first week and all of us just broke into derisory laughter at this scene, and also the 'touching' scene of an alien claw sensing the five week old heartbeat of the pregnant mother.

Sure the ending was possibly a bit unrealistic, but hey, we are talking about a whole genre of film that could be considered unrealistic too.The acting was quite OK in my opinion, not cheesy, just generally showing what people would do in a \"this is really happening?\" situation.Some of the \"YEAAAA!\" moments were not unrealistic as in many other movies i have seen. You won't see little 13 year old Billy suddenly flying a jet plane and leaping 50 foot across a gap to make it to the other side. This is a good thing, because those moments in films i do class as cheesy.I would say this is not a fantastic film, but it is not a bad film either.

The set up is clunky, and the characters are thin and rather dislikeable leaving no room for tension and drama. It all kind of passes before your eyes without you ever really noticing its there.However, it is difficult to hate a movie as technically ambitious as this. The director's, whose background is in SFX, have created very believable aliens and space craft considering the films meagre budget. It is just a shame that in the end the movie has no real heart and for all its huffing and puffing it just made me want to go and watch Independence Day again!Oh..and the ending is awful.

There are many other reasons to their preferences of why other critics and alien film fans might like or dislike. I think this film deserves to be one of the best sci-fi films with aliens.If the sequel is good and way better than Skyline, then I would agree to see how good it is.

The movie is great as you gain the characters perspective as they try to find ways to escape and survive. The movie gets quit action packed when the military gets involved trying to tackle the situation. Worth watching no doubt.Well the part above is actually a review for Cloverfield from 2008. essentially its the same thing as Skyline just worse. Substitute the monster from Cloverfield with the aliens from War of the Worlds and you got yourself Skyline just on a much worse level. The acting is poor but mainly the dialogue. The movie is bag of clich\u00e9 lines after clich\u00e9 lines. The movie could serve as a comedy from the amount of times I laughed. You know that feeling you get when you know something unexpected is about to happen which that means its expected like in a horror when the ghost appears in the bathroom mirror? Well this movie has about 75 of those. You could always see the next scene in advance but you just wont want too. Also an annoyance is the camera angles. They seem to be done by a college student at best. Most of the movie is worthless plot and no character development. I found it very boring as its all restricted to a very small venue. It seems they couldn't get funding for them to film in other parts of the city outside of one SINGLE building. Thats right, 90+ mins, one SINGLE building. Needless to say I LOVED IT.",

Apart from the special effects which were nice, nothing else really seems good. The acting was bad, the dialogue was rather boring and the characters were just annoying and not worth fighting for. I was actually rooting for the aliens. It seemed like many of them didn't have any motivation and it was hard for the audience to root for any of them. Though, I liked Donald Faison's character Terry- but it was a shame that he ends up dying first, and is only in the film for the first half (he dies around the 40th min). I feel like the film goes downhill from there because he was pretty interesting then when he dies, we're left with the lead character (Jarrod- annoying and cowardly), his pregnant girlfriend (Ellaine), Terry's girlfriend (Candice), another female friend of Terry, and another large guy from the hotel.This movie had a great premise but the writing was just horrible and so was the plot. It was basically the group of friends hiding and running around from the aliens outside. Throughout the film, there isn't any mention why the aliens are here to invade the earth- they just want the humans brains for brain power?. Also the movie was genre switching quite randomly. At times it was sci-fi, then suspense, then horror-slasher, then love story and finally it ended as the beginning of Jarrod, Alien Warrior. Terrible, horrible ending. It seemed as if the directors just left- but it was a signal to a sequel. The ending was basically that the main character (Jarrod's) brain gets sucked out of his head, put into an alien body and then he becomes a \"good\" alien? I think he is good because he apparently helps his girlfriend from the other alien trying to get her brain and Jarrod/alien form is shown to be stroking her face like he did earlier in the film (scene when he was trying to convince her that he was himself earlier in the film after lifting the big guy off of the floor and his face/skin/eyes changed.) Anyways the film was awful and one of the worst sci-fi films I've seen, and one of the worst of 2010 I've seen.",

For us humans this outcome is more likely in such circumstances, mainly because it deals with our frailties and the perceived technological gulf between our species and any intergalactic visitors.Like other alien invasion movies there is a ruthless efficiency about the 'aliens', no quarter offered and none conceded, but unlike those mentioned no pesky bacteria or flawed anti hero is going to deliver us from this evil. I think this may well be the problem for many of those giving Skyline a 'bum rap', it delivers little in optimism and that just isn't Hollywood, well not when the battle lines are drawn on planet earth.Skyline is a decent attempt at what the more grandiose high budget alien invasion movies have aspired to, perhaps it could have done with a bit more duologue and character development.

The only flaw to this movie is really the script and dialogue. The actors are ok (not good, not bad), and everything just feels very REAL.I'd say the closest thing for me in terms of feeling is Cloverfield, where you see the action along with people who have no clue what is going on. If you like that kind of movie (minus the nausea-inducing camera work of Cloverfield), then you might enjoy this.I'm surprised that the CGI was this good (watching a 2010 movie in 2021) for a low budget film, and I did enjoy the ending quite a bit, even if it's weird.Not for everyone, but I do think it's a rather unique movie in the B-movie Sci-fi world.",

This is the first IMDb review I've written. It was THAT bad.**WARNING** Spoilers beyond this point **WARNING** Okay.. the main thing that rubbed me the wrong way, was the pregnancy thing. There's an ALIEN INVASION and she's offended by the blonde girl smoking near her. She also isn't that far along, but the aliens hear a heartbeat at the end. I've seen movies where a girl jumps wrong and has a miscarriage, but this girl is near a nuclear explosion, falls down a lot, is under the stress of an ALIEN INVASION and she's still good to go? She must have super-womb.Second thing that bugged me. They need our brains to power all their vehicles and behemoths, but what power source were they using to get to earth. Unless they had a ton of humans on their planet and ran out just as they got to Earth, which isn't explained at all. The ONLY brain that is orange is the main guys, because of his ultra-love for his girlfriend (who he wanted to get an abortion 10 minutes in because he wasn't ready to be a dad). How is he the only person that can look at the light 19 times and not get sucked in? Why bother showing the growth in his stomach if it never comes up again? Third thing was survivability. The aliens survive a NUCLEAR EXPLOSION, but if you hit it with an axe it dies. If you beat it with a cinder block it dies, if you punch it a bunch of times it dies.Fourth (and this is just a normal movie thing) why don't the aliens kill people faster? The giant vagina monster lays on top of the pregnant chick for like 3 minutes while her boy wakes up and tackles it.Also, they suck up THOUSANDS of people at once, but spend the entire movie trying to get these 5 people... these 5 dumb LA people are the only ones that can elude the aliens? Really? I didn't like any of the characters, and right after the \"15 hours earlier\" scene, I was rooting for the aliens. It wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't anything good. The trailer was more exciting than the entire movie was. I can't believe they charge people money to watch them take a dump for 2 hours and CGI it to make it pretty.I hope nobody else on Earth suffers through this pile of garbage. Seriously.",

They don't have to lay an annoying soap opera on top of it.All the human characters in this movie are unappealing. So unappealing, it's hard for the audience to develop any sympathy, empathy or concern for their welfare when the aliens attack.I'm not an expert on the actor Eric Balfour. But I've never seen him in anything good. Either he's a bad actor. Or his agent keeps sticking him in bad movies.Jarrod (played by Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend travel to LA to celebrate his friend's economic and occupational success.His friend offers Jarrod a job. Jarrod never says, \"Thank you, let me think about it, or let me talk to my girlfriend first.\" Instead he reverts to his movie long state of tortured angst and says, \"I don't appreciate you springing this on me like this. I'm already having trouble making ends meet. But it's not about the money. \" What ??\nJarrod's girlfriend tells him she's pregnant. He doesn't say, \"That's terrific, I'm so happy. What do you think? How do you feel?\" No. He again reverts to his movie long state of tortured angst and says, \"I can't handle this right now.\" To which she replies, \"Well, how do you think I feel?\"Jarrod and his girlfriend have terrible communication. They fight, argue and disagree a lot. Matter of fact, Jarrod doesn't get along with anybody. He's constantly fighting, arguing and disagreeing with everyone.\nJarrod's friend is cheating on his wife (or live in girlfriend) with a female friend who ends up getting stuck in their condo with them when the aliens attack.The first night Jarrod and his girlfriend arrive, they are treated to a party where the number one form of entertainment is spying on others having sex, and broadcasting it on a widescreen TV for the whole party to enjoy, jeer, and make fun of. Not just the men. But women too.After the aliens attack, all of the human characters (even a couple we meet in the parking garage trying to flee) spend most of their time fighting, arguing, disagreeing and/or screaming.It's movies like this that prompt viewers to say, \"If this is the best we have to offer, maybe it's best aliens from outer space exterminate the whole human race and take over Earth.\" Of course, this is a gross exaggeration. There are many fine individual humans. Just none are portrayed in this movie.I gave it a 10 for special effects, the aliens and action. And a 0 for writing, dialogue and acting.

This beater falls into that category dead square.I watched this turkey on rental DVD, so I could make prolific use of the fast forward to get through the really awful parts -- mainly where people were talking. When a monster was on screen I slowed it back down to normal speed. When a particularly annoying character was getting eaten by a monster I could play it in slo-mo or rewind it to enhance the enjoyment.Zero plot. Zero science.

I should start with the good things; as it goes there was only one good thing, which was the special effects as I thought the Aliens were pretty cool actually and quite pretty too with their sparkling lights. Bad things about the film, story line was non existence, predictable and heaven knows where they got the actors from. The main character was a b lister from 24 and that was it! We all knew there was going to be no happy ending, we all knew the earth wasn't going to be saved this time. The acting was wooden and no one really cared if they lived or died. The stroking of the nose thing.... please! Clearly stolen straight from \"Face Off\" with Nick Cage. It felt short too, (thank heavens) as it felt like it started, the aliens came, the end! What was that ending all about for heavens sake? How lame? I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all, not even to people I don't like.

Besides the unsatisfactory ending, I didn't get into any of the characters. In addition to the lack of character development, some were even unlikable. It basically did a Cloverfield where most of the movie is from the perspective of a few people but with less camera shaking. But nothing seemed particularly interesting about the characters. I wasn't a fan of the soundtrack. It's not that any of the music was particularly bad but the shifts in styles kind of disrupted the mood of the movie.

            "content": "'SKYLINE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This is the type of movie that falls into the 'so bad it's good' category. The acting, dialog, character development and story are all pretty cheesy and ridiculous but it's still a lot of fun and extremely entertaining. The most impressive thing about the film is the visuals, the special effects are amazing and it's an even more impressive achievement considering the ultra low budget the movie had to work with, $10 million reportedly. This is an extremely low budget by Hollywood standards and most movies produced for this amount don't even get released in theaters.The film is directed by the Strause brothers, long time visual effects artists who also co-directed 'AVPR: ALIENS VS PREDATOR \u2013 REQUIEM' (which was the second, better, 'ALIENS VS PREDATOR' film). The film was entirely financed by the Strause brothers without the help of any big studio and filmed almost completely at Greg Strause's condo building. They also filmed it completely on new Red cameras with the Strause brothers 'Mysterium-X chip'. The film was co-written by two visual effects artists as well, Joshua Cordes and Liam O'Donnell. The cast is full of experienced TV actors like Eric Balfour (from '24', 'BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER', 'HAVEN', 'KIDS INCORPORATED' as well as many others) and Donald Faison (most well known as Turk on 'SCRUBS').The film tells the story of an alien invasion that begins one morning in Los Angeles. Strange lights draw people outside who are then sucked up and used as brain food. Balfour and Scottie Thompson star as a recently expecting couple who traveled to L.A. the day before to visit their successful friend Terry (Faison). The movie follows this small group of survivors as they battle the aliens and fight for survival. The main goal is to make it to water where there are no aliens, and it seems to always be their weakness in movies like this. Many things are not resolved or explained but a franchise is setup and the first sequel is already planned for 2012.The movie is described as a low rent 'INDEPEND DAY' or 'WAR OF THE WORLDS' which it is to a certain extent but considering the budget and the imaginative and spectacular visuals we get from it, this is a pretty impressive achievement. The entire film is a visual effects labor of love, which is an art from all in it's own. I like character and dialog driven movies a lot but I also like special effects films as well, when the visuals are this good. I also enjoy cheesy bad 'B' sci-fi monster films. If that's what the movie is trying to be than you cant fault it for delivering on that promise. Obviously if you go into this movie expecting good character drama, witty dialog or a plot that makes sense you're going to be disappointed but if you just want a good old fashioned 'B' alien invasion film, with stunning visuals, this is the movie for you.

I haven't seen Skyline since it came out back then but due to the somewhat sequel Beyond Skyline on my watchlist, I figured I'd give it another watch. It's still not all that good, and the worst part is I liked it better this time than before.Skyline is about aliens using rave lights to ensnare humans so they can use/re-use our brains. See, I am not too sure what the purpose of human brains in this was. Sometimes the aliens would take them and rebuild their broken bodies. Again, not sure how. In fact, I am not sure how anyone in this version of Earth gets anything done, as this movie features a lot of scenes where the characters are stuck because of locked doors. Some of these doors, they even have keys for, they just forget how to use them. Honestly, with that display of brain power, it's not easy to see why the aliens want our brains. I did enjoy the alien design. For the most part, it's a mix of metal and creature, but after that Skyline offers very little in anything interesting. Except during the end credits. The still shots in the end credits should have been the beginning or at least the middle of Skyline. It makes for a way more interesting story than what we were given. I understand it may have been a budget thing, but honestly, even in 2010, if you don't have the budget for it, maybe you shouldn't be trying to make a big action sci-fi spectacle.After almost a decade, Skyline is still not good.

Anyway after a mini intro to the characters ( we are talking ultra stereotypes ) the invasion starts. The Fx were good and kept me interested the main problem was the characters and lack of development emotion or tension. As it went on however I realised what the film was trying to do and it caught my interest. However the ending was a little on the comic book side and left me scratching my head at what the point was and where it was heading. At this point the film ended....... I figure we are either left with a sequel or its just very open for a reason. The problem with it being deliberately open is that the film didn't say enough to make us think.

They are awakened, just before dawn, by an alien invasion. Now, they must figure out how to keep out of reach of the aliens, deal with the pregnancy of one couple, the whoring of the other male lead and his assistant, and try to escape this supposedly rich condo (which actually looks like government housing), to get to the nearby marina and snatch a boat to head out to sea.Really! That's the plan? As so many have stated before: No plot, little acting ability, no concern for the main characters.And what do the aliens want?

That said the script had very good things, but the outcome didn't use all the potential there was. For example how people, government etc react is not shown properly. Not all the people are taken at the same time, so one could expect to find out more what is going on in Los Angeles, whole America and even globally.I'm sure it would be a big mess if similar happened in real-life, but there should be more to it than just a one condo apartment with a few people running around.It's is a good sci-fi movie, but not with the end one could expect.

OK if you don't like scifi and its not your cup of tea then fine, but DON'T bother writing reviews with zero score because that's just not even remotely representative of the films actual quality. If you don't like scifi its safe to say that you WON'T like this film. HOWEVER if you enjoyed District 9 and Independence Day and wished they'd have a baby together then you will be amazed by this movie.I really have to tip my hat to the independent film production, I mean how many directors or studios can churn out a movie this bloody good for only 20 million bucks?? Its a miracle pure and simple.to be more specific, the film doesn't bore you with a load of exposition and flying the American flags etc, like ID4 did, and it doesn't try to sell itself on a big actor name, it is purely carried by the amazing pacing and action and the shockingly good special effects. But don't let that fool you into thinking that the film is shallow and special effects reliant because it genuinely isn't. The film gets rolling and throws you into an unbelievable situation and it doesn't try to insult you with loads of crumby one liners and big actors giving lots of slow-mo dramatic close ups. I was also seriously surprised by the performances, they weren't hammy, weren't overly done and weren't poorly acted which is usually the case with a young/unknown cast.Anyway I personally guarantee that if you enjoyed ID4 when it came out but looking back feel disappointed and wanted something BIGGER BETTER and more gruesome then this is for you. I cannot praise this film enough, the shocks keep coming and the aliens you see are simply jaw dropping.A truly fantastic triumph of a scifi which seriously makes a change.SEE THIS FILM if you love scifi and want to see what can happen when a genius idea is actually executed well and isn't ruined by its A: big cast, B: rubbish dialogue, C: awful acting.Pro",

            "content": "I didn't think this would be blockbuster movie with a huge budget. But I did think it was gonna be an enjoyable sci-fi flick but what I got was far from that. The sci-fi part was good, the concept of aliens, their technology and even purpose of being on Earth. But the characters are flat with no or awkward emotions, you wouldn't even thought Jarrod and Elaine were a couple because they show no such feelings, Jarrod doesn't even show sympathy or concern for his girl. Eric Balfour as main star is also totally wrong, the dude can't act and he badly needs a shave.The story about the aliens is none except that they're here, on Earth, and want brains. OK fine, but we wouldn't be unprepared and some sort of news would be heard before their arrival. But the most annoying thing is the beginning of the movie. WTH is the flashy high roller thing about? I could've stand it if it were not for the lack of character development. Who are these people, why should I care for them? I dunno. For all I care I want them to get eaten or whatever.Though it was good that focus was on ordinary people with \"normal\" reactions. But at the same time, why is Jarrod so special that his brain manages to overcome an alien's, he shows no such attributes during the whole movie. His primary feelings are confused, angry and stupid. Still, the best part was the ending and a sequel may satisfy my thirst for sci-fi. This movie did not.This could've been good, as so many other movies, but was executed badly and with a story that's half finished.",

            "review_title": "There are some special effects and some aliens, but this film wasn't very good.",
            "content": "I'm not going spend a huge amount of time on this one, because it came out four years ago, and honestly, it's really not worth it. But it's not often that I'd rate a film so low. I've seen a lot of films that would be easy to criticise, but I always salvage some kind of entertainment value. At the very least, you're along for the ride. With Skyline, I can't even say that.This film just happened to be on TV this month; I'd heard of it, and I saw that it had Donald Faison in it, who was always funny as Turk in Scrubs. Skyline isn't a comedy, and he's wasted, although he's clearly the most engaging member of the cast. As if to rub salt in the wound, he disappears fairly early on, but not before setting up a trite soap-opera love triangle, the tension of which is completely destroyed when all the parties are unceremoniously offed. The rest of the cast is even more forgettable.The film opens with a mysterious blue light filtering through the window as our characters wake up in a penthouse apartment. Just as something interesting might be about to happen, we flash back to the previous day for some character exposition. We have to sit through everyone partying in the penthouse the night before, meeting each other and even more unnecessary extras that will vanish completely come morning.I understand why they wanted to have an intriguing credits sequence. Nobody would sit through twenty minutes of inconsequential partying if they film started that with without any other explanation. We'd have no idea where it was going or what the film was even about. The problem is that we still have to sit through the inconsequential partying in order to find out what it's all about.The answer is that it's an alien invasion film. The blue light has a kind of enticing beauty that causes anyone who stares into it to walk willingly into the aliens' death machines. I do think this is an interesting idea. The concept that the aliens possess intelligence so superior to our own that they can manipulate us as easily as we draw moths to a deadly electric lamp (or how deep-sea fish lure their play with a glowing lure) is truly chilling.The effects are good, as they should be considering that the directors are really visual effects artists by trade. The visuals cost $10 million of the film's budget, while the live-action stuff was done on the cheap, shot in the directors' apartment building for half a million, almost as an afterthought. There are big monsters, alien spaceships swooping around, tentacles grabbing people and all the rest.The film just falls down completely on any kind of convincing plot or characters. You simply do not care about anyone. They behave unpleasantly towards each other and formulate ludicrous plans, such as making for a boat to escape the flying aliens, or driving across town in loud, high-powered sports cars. You spend more time questioning the stupidity of these half-baked choices than invested in the story. But this is just talk: the characters barely leave their apartment, and don't even die as the result of their bad decisions. They seem to be dispatched at random, as if nothing matters.Conceptually, everything's incredibly derivative. Some aliens fly around trailing tentacles like the machines from The Matrix (1999), the large monsters stumble around and crush cars like in Jurassic Park (1993) and climb buildings like King Kong (1933), and the government unsuccessfully tries to nuke the mother ship like in Independence Day (1996).Similarly, it can be no coincidence that the film came out around the same time as Battle: Los Angeles (2011), a higher profile LA-set invasion film. I haven't seen that one, but the effects for both were done by Hydraulx Entertainment \u2013 the visual effects company owned by Greg and Colin Strause: the directors of Skyline.If the characters blandness wasn't egregious enough, you even question the logic or motivation of the aliens. They possess invincible ships with regenerative abilities and lights with the ability to utterly entice humanity. They can suck billions from the streets of a city in minutes, but need to devote resources to sending scouts door to door to pick off every last individual human, and they feel the need to supplement this with a pack of gigantic monsters whose motivation is to wreck up the place. Finally, they want to harvest our brains, which for some reason can perfectly interface with their technology.The simplicity of the name 'Skyline' carries a certain amount of elegant gravitas which it utterly fails to capitalise on. It may have some merits as a special effects exercise, but nothing more. There's nothing here that isn't done much more successfully in other movies. If you want tune out your brain (before the aliens abduct it) and watch an overblown invasion, do yourself a favour: go back and watch Independence Day (1996).",

Bits of Jurassic park and Godzilla was there too.Hey!!!! this is not the first movie to copy from others. This was a great movie apart from the borrowing stuff, i wouldn't mind borrowing things for good purpose and this movie does the job right by borrowing. All the chases, the concept of monsters and the heroism among humans were very interesting aspects of the movie.Finally i must say the ending was the greatest part of it. I never even guessed it would end like this. I wouldn't say much, you must watch it for your self and i basically loved the comic book style awesome ending.This was a great movie and i thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Independence day, Cloverfield, Matrix, The Host etc. I don't understand why some good movies are put down and bashed in IMDb by the IMDb it self and the people.

We live in this building now!

Why can't we signal for help and rescue?\nWe're at War.\nNo seriously, he don't trust the human military, because \"they're at war.\"\nYes! Yes you are at war!\nAnd you're civilians!\nI actually asked a friend who served in the British Army, and apparently they are ordered to keep civilians safe in a firefight and escort them to safety when it's safe to do so.\nSo I don't know what this guy though they would do, and it's especially dumb, since this character is the same one who insisted they hold up and wait for rescue.\nThen when rescue comes, can't trust them!But the biggest kick in my pateince comes with,-THE ENDING\nSo our \"heroes\" are abducted by the aliens, and the people being taken have their brains taken out and used to give life to new soldiers. But because our main character is super special and important, he takes control of the alien body and uses it to save his girlfriend from a Baby extraction machine (I don't know why. The directors have a weird thing about unborn babies in this and their other film Alien vs Predator 2).\nSo he gets ready to protect her from the aliens and....credits.\nIt just ends.\nIt sets up a final battle and doesn't deliver.\nI've actually seen people praise this film because it break from traditional Hollywood endings where the humans beat the aliens and everything is all heroic and \"unrealistic\",\nBUT THIS FILM SETS UP THE HOLLYWOOD ENDING, AND THEN JUST STOPS!\nIf the film ending with them being abducted, accepting that there is no escape, that would be one thing. But they undercut this idea by setting up a fight and bailing before anything can happen.\nHaving an ending is not a cliche that movies need to move away from like evil businessmen making money while making a monster, or the third act break up. It exists, because a story has to come to an end at a logical point!\nIt's like if Star Wars just abruptly stopped as the ships approached the Death Star; you would feel rightly ripped off!Is there anything good?+THE ALIEN DESIGNS\nThe monster design is really interesting; they use a light to hypnotise people and then abduct them, harvesting brains which give life to their machines of war.\nIt feels better than standard aliens that just want destruction.\nI just wish they were in a better movie.CONCLUSION\nIt's a flat, dull movie populated by idiots that I don't care about.\nCool aliens, but they're wasted on a movie that doesn't even have an ending.",

I'm very good at lowering my expectations for films that I KNOW will be bad, and, therefore, I can enjoy just about any motion picture. But THIS. THIS is just garbage! The script must have been about 10 pages long. Honestly, I could have written it in grade 4 as a project for bonus marks... Dialogue never gets more dramatic than, \"What was that?\" or \"Oh my god!\" And it never gets more personal than \"I'm not leaving without you.\" And that's when it's trying its hardest, ladies and gentlemen.You are hardly given any time to get to know the main characters at the beginning; it's just small talk dialogue anyways, even when there aren't CGI aliens running around everywhere. My point being: you won't care what happens to them. The acting is lame. Eric Belfour, who I remember from 24 (he was pretty good on that show in his brief role), is as forgetful as the rest.One thing I will give it credit for: the effects. Yes, effects don't make a film good, but they sure as hell can give it 1 or 2 stars out of ten can't they? Without them, this is a zero. No question.The film's plot is hopelessly simple: aliens, breather, aliens, breather, explosions, aliens, breather, plot twist that sucks, end.One of the worst films I have ever seen. Don't even rent it.",

And so it should be as the directors have led the industry in special effects from the Titanic to Terminator.

I just watched this movie tonight and after sitting for about 15 minutes especially when the real threat happened, I feel that this movie will be like \"hero wins\" as usual like War of The Worlds , but there's something different in Skyline, this movie offers you a plot twist which is I think it's very brilliant, you'll never know what will happen next. And The Aliens are also very powerful and unpredictable, I can't even imagine if I'm going to fight that one. There are some similar scene that reminds me to the War of The Worlds too.Graphics and Music are well-done, I like the Aliens' design, there are a lot of variety in graphics, and the music is quite epic especially in the near end scene.What surprises me is the Ending! The ending is very surprising, Hell yeah!! This is the best part of the movie, the Brothers did very well in the ending, I can't spoil you the ending, but if you understand what's the meaning of the ending, you will say that these brothers are doing brilliant plot-twist.The bad thing is lack of character development, bad dialogue, and I think that the war between military and aliens is not as epic as I imagine, they run too fast, we need a gap between thriller, action, and relaxing scene.I'm so sorry to say this, but don't let the bad reviews fool you, because they're most likely an amateur and don't know how to make a brilliant movie.cheers.",

I'm starting to wonder if maybe the directors are behind those statements. \"Way better than Alien vs Predator: Requiem\" was one. Dude, AVPR is a rosy dream compared to this. \"This blew Independence Day away\" was another. Well again, dude, ID is a masterpiece in comparison. Really! And there are SOOOO many things wrong with ID, but those things are all OK with me in comparison to this thing! Jeezz! Actually - and I kid you not - I found myself pausing the movie about 20 minutes in, and telling myself: \"I will never again criticize Roland Emmerich for his short character introductions!\". (And I usually hate Roland Emmerich's short and lacking character introductions.) This thing starts with a TV-show teaser that shows you what is going to happen, i.e. the invasion, then we go back in time 15 hours, like some bad episode of \"The Event\". And then we have to live through 20 minutes of completely useless \"character development\" to get to that point again. \"Character development\" of characters that are utterly annoying, and that we care nothing for. By the time we catch up to \"real time\" we hope and pray that these morons will be exterminated by the aliens as quickly as possible! Usually, for the story to make any sense, we start out with a bunch of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, who then rise to the occasion and discover talents they didn't know they had. This movie however, is about a bunch of morons who are caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and then continue to be just as moronic, through-out the entire film. They don't evolve, they don't find hidden talents or resources. They are just as uninteresting and unimportant in the end, as when the movie started.OK, so now for the spoiler bit: I'm sure the screenwriter thought he was very clever when he wrote this thing; with the aliens winning and all... But what's the point? I'm sure we all realize that we wouldn't stand a chance against aliens that traveled here from across the galaxy. But we'd all like to think that we'd have some chance of avoiding being squashed like bugs. Otherwise the movie is just pointless, and you're just wasting my time! If you like CGI for the sake of CGI however, I'm sure you'll like this thing. I, on the other hand, who work with CGI, don't ever want to see this thing again! Ever!You have been warned!",

That's one reason why I liked it so much. That and the fx are amazingly well done. The movie takes place in an intimate setting and I liked the every day regular folks feel to it. The sense of no one knowing what is happening combined with deeply flawed characters let me feel as if I were along for the ride myself. The characters are on their own and left to make mistakes. Skyline definitely has a plot, just not a typical Hollywood plot most people are used to. If you ever watch foreign films, you know that in comparison, American films always tie everything up with a bow. Skyline reminded me of a lot of French films that don't have typical happy endings. Just endings, which let you think about what might have happened afterward. I enjoyed using my imagination and coming up with our own theories after the movie. SPOILER ALERT Film ending discussed below.I was really taken by the graphic novel feel during the final credit roll. It certainly left you with more questions than answers. I can't wait for a sequel.There is only one thing about the film that bugged me. There is no clear reason why the main character ended up as he did at the end of the film (red instead of blue made him easy to spot but why was he different?) nor why there weren't others like him if he wasn't special or a hero. It had a rushed feel to it as if it were tacked on to the end of the film to satisfy critics. I think It would have been much better to end with the kiss.",

For 10 Million Dollars this was a Great Movie which blows away many movies costing much more. I was entertained and that is all that matters. Now these guys are smart they made a nice sci-fi movie within a decent budget and have already in the first week made their money back which means we will get a sequel which may adhere more to peoples ideas of how a movie should be or how it should end.

Skyline is the latest \"masterpiece\" from the Strause Brothers, or pardon me, The Brother's Strause... Waking up one night a group of \"friends\" are subject to the sight of hundreds of thousands of people being sucked into giant spaceships hovering above LA. In any decent movie this is where things would turn interesting or at least exciting; not in Skyline, oh no. Here we're subjected to a bunch of the most unlikeable characters sitting in a a guy's \"luxury apartment\" before they decide to try and head out; which entails the black guy who cheated on his girlfriend and his mistress to go in the same car. Really The Brother's Hacks? Couldn't you be a bit more obvious? I'm not sure the blind kid ten blocks down got it! Guess who bites the dust? Oh yes, the black guy(black people shouldn't think they're allowed to live in a horror movies) and the mistress.Running in panic after trying* to kill one of the attacking aliens the group once more return to the \"luxury apartment\" and decide to sit there with their newfound Cuban friend. *:Trying as in; The thing can regenerate itself due to having an extra brain or some nonsense, it's a recurring thing in the movie. Now, the main character , Jarrod, has by now been staring into the Bright Blue Light of Brain-killing twice...And he's starting to act oddly, or he would could the actor actually act rather than behave like he's mildly grumpy about not getting his man-diapers changed. His girlfriend, after seeing the deaths of countless thousands(probably millions.) breaks into a hysterical fit after the girlfriend of the black dude starts to smoke; apparently it's very important to remember that second-hand smoking hurts the unborn child of Miss Hysterical(what I'll call her from now). The Cuban dude, who's by far the best actor by now, just stares dumbfounded at her...I did too.The Us Government attacks, nukes the ship which regenerates and then sends in cannon-fodder.Okay, fast forward; Blond girlfriend lady dies, Cuban blows himself up. Miss Hysterical screams and Mr Man-Diapers kill an alien with his bare hands, a piece of concrete and help from Miss H. They get sucked into the big spaceship, Man-Diapers get turned into an alien, kicks other alien's butt to save Miss H and then ending credits roll.To sum it up before I go on further; This is the worst, the dumbest and the most annoyingly inept movie I've seen in years, it beats out The Other Guys, Avatar the Last Airbender, Moby Dick 2010, Clash of the Titans 2010 and many, many more as probably the worst movie I've seen since Leprechaun in the Hood. The fact that these two bozos get any jobs, or that their movies can make roughly six times their budget saddens me more than knowing Uwe Boll can continue to make movies. That people can call this flawed piece of trite intelligent or good sci-fi is a bit like calling Twilight as good as Romeo and Juliet; it might technically be an opinion but it's coming straight from your a**.What is wrong with it then, in detail:1; The Actors. When the best actor in your ensemble is the guy from Scrubs playing his character from Scrubs without JD then you're tough out of luck. And since he's black and cheats he's pretty much a walking corpse. When the second best actor is a guy who can't decide whether he's completely loony or if he's just trying to survive and going for the middle road of \"I'm a Complete Loony who Tries to Survive in a Soap Opera.\" A very classy performance there. The other cast, compromised of three bimbos, an old man and a middle-aged couple with some red-shirts in the background. The three main girls are bland, bland and horrible. Horrible is reserved for Miss Hysterical, who's so horrible that I don't think even the porn industry deserves her. Oh, and I almost forget the Strong Manly Protagonist, Jarrod. The actor is horrible at what he does and can't portray emotion. The Plot: While I can understand the \"You don't stand a chance against aliens of this magnitude\"-thing, it's dull and wannabe-edgy rather than handled well. The aliens are annoyingly stupid and their threat comes from one weapon that gives people superpowers if they avoid it, and from the Strause's decision to have them be invulnerable due to a Deus Ex Machina power that lets them regenerate EVERYTHING. Honestly, it's written so badly that you don't even get to root for the bad guys like you can do in most B-movies.Music: Generic, low-budget action flick stuff. Most of the time I didn't realize there was a musical score.Looks: Decent, as long as the things aren't shown up close or interacting with people, then it looks like crap.Rating: A resounding ZERO out of ten. I hate the Brothers Pretentious for creating this piece of crap. I hate myself even more for watching it.",

Why someone in any fram of mind would think that spending the rest of your miserable life in a cell surrounded by dead or dying people waiting to be harvested is a hopeful ending should be beyond any rational thinking being.

I finally broke down and rented it on-demand. (I was scratching the bottom of the barrel looking for something \"new\" to rent) I was admittedly hooked by the trailer. In it, there is a quote from Stephen Hawking about the certainty of aliens being malevolent. Also, you're treated to news reports of lights in the sky. That kind of stuff is like candy to me. I love suspenseful buildup. Sadly, these scenes failed to find their way into the film.Instead, what we do get is a suspense-less mess - a hodgepodge of thrown together scenes which barely keep the narrative intact, and utterly fail to get the viewer invested.The initial scenes of the lights descending and the near abduction of the main character is the equivalent of a magician yelling, \"I'm going to pull a rabbit out of my hat. Oh, and by the way, my hat has a false bottom and the rabbit is hid in the table beneath.\" It doesn't take a screen-writing genius to know you keep what's behind the curtain hid for a little while to pique your audience's interest. A low budget isn't an excuse for poor script writing.The first 20 minutes were pointless. We never get a clear understanding of what Jarrod's talent is or what Terry's motives for summoning him to L.A. are; we never find out why Elaine is opposed to moving to LA other than she prefers 4 seasons; and we discover that Terry's unfaithful to Candice. Upon looking back, it seems this stretch of the movie was put in solely to extend the running time.The next 40 minutes or so is the characters playing hide-n-seek with brain sucking, District 9/ID4 rip-off aliens (unsuccessfully I might add).Where the movie transformed from a so-so sci-fi flick into a 1 star groan-fest was when a nuclear bomb finds its way into the alien ship and explodes mere miles from the character's penthouse loft. And what effect did a thermonuclear device have on our characters? Umm, their blinds fell down. No flash burns, broken glass, blindness from seeing the detonation... just... the, uh blinds... they fell... down on the floor... yup.The finale' was some ham-fisted attempt to convey the futility of humanity's survival against an alien blah blah blah...Its like someone gave Tommy Wiseau a special effects department, 10 mil, and said, \"Have at it!\" If you've got a few bucks to spare and want to see stuff get eaten and blown up by aliens, then go for it.

But seeing that the army has deployed before and immediately after the invasion it's clear that the government is aware of their coming.The alien is something like organic machine, but I think the true form of the alien is like a virus or nano organism capable to invade machinery and living organism.They invade the earth to harvest human nervous system, which acts as a control unit and somewhat power supply.so the one controlled those alien units are human brains, but after the virus overwritten and taking control of them.this would explain alien's regenerative and resurrection ability.It's told subtly in the movie that Jarrod being scouted for Terry's work so Jarrod somewhat a genius and that's why he was able to resist alien control, or maybe he just acquired immunity after being exposed to the light many times, or both.this is a great movie not inferior to cloverfield, normally i would've given it a 9, but to help this movie I'm giving it a 10.

Also shooting a nuke that close to a city would wipe the city out, not just make buildings shake.....nuclear fallout.....6. BRAIN harvesting????? They would pick up captured humans and slice their heads off leaving their bodies to fall lifelessly away then TRANSPLANT??? them into mechanized exoskeletons?????? W.T.F Mate?!!!And now onto why I even bothered to rate this movie.1. As some might find distasteful this movie is the clear and evident truth to what would happen if aliens ever attack (the power needed to even get to earth from wherever they live should be clear of their might). We'd all turn into alien happy meals, or they'ed harvest our brains like blueberries (see above). I only wish it had even more of a desperate pace to it. Had the movie been more gritty looking and had the filmography not looked like typical low budget Hollywood, then it might have been better.2. The main characters are dumb as hell. Seriously. MUTHA^*^&%@&#&@&^%@#^*%@#*&$ dumb. However in this instance that works for them, as many a review have stated this gives them an element of realism. (It is a representation of the sheer stupidity that human beings will act upon given something larger than themselves that they cannot begin to comprehend.3. The bluish light-- nice touch, makes their animation not seem as crappy because it blinds out the horrible modeling that they did on the main alien models. 4. Realistic plot-for rich suburbanites...oh hey one of them has a gun, well big whoop, aliens have laser gun tentacle mouthes, Humans weapons lose Aleins weapons FTW....5. The ending where the aliens win...don't think that one dumb guy ('s brain) in this alien exo-suit will be able to do crap, he is microscopic to the big alien that initially chased the \"partiers\" Enough said, go watch it then laugh, because if were ever invaded, I would laugh as well, we'd be screwed and everyone knows it.... (Even as the mother ship was going down I was thinking , either they have a forcefield or regenerative abilities like the iron giant, either way, their gonna win...)",

The characters were hard to care about.BUT the creatures were creative and it was a little more down to earth - these people were trapped, not somehow magically able to get out and avoid attacks.I enjoyed the creature designs and the special effects. I was genuinely interested in the plot, just wish I'd cared about the characters more.There were 2 occasions where they made it seem like that was the end of the film, when in fact it wasn't, and I wasn't sure if I should be happy or not that the film was going on. In hindsight, I should have been happy as it was enjoyable and creative, and the part at the end within the alien ship was a pleasant surprise from the 'YOU guess whats in there, I'm not going to bother myself' attitude that some filmmakers seem to take.Nice opening for a 2nd film, although I would have liked it to be a little longer. If they'd had more of a budget, they could have made it longer, and gotten some better script writers in. It would have been good with better actors but I don't think it needed big stars - just good actors. These guys were OK (and Eric Balfour did his best to carry the weight of the main character) but the acting and the script combined didn't fully pull me in, although not to an extent where I rooted for the aliens. The only reason I felt bad at one character death is because he is well known from a TV show.",

I spent the entire movie waiting for it to start plot-wise. They totally ruined a great concept with a pathetic attempt not even worthy of direct-to-disc.And the characters.. ya, I'm with everyone that couldn't wait for the aliens to kill them, just so I would be free of their 'acting'.. perhaps this was intentional to make the audience side with the aliens but the movie would've actually been better if all the actors had been sucked up in the first minute and we spent the rest of the movie just watching the aliens wipe out humanity. If the aliens were smart, they wouldn't touch those brains with a 10-foot sentinel tentacle.The aliens definitely are a ripoff of the machines in the matrix and hopefully a well-deserved lawsuit will prevent a sequel from invading the earth.Avoid this one.. it's not bad, it's super-bad and right up there with District 9 in the over-hyped, makes-a-good-commercial but \"why did I want to watch this?\" category of movies.",

There would be no great fight back with good looking scientists inventing some crap that wins the day. There would be no elite team of wise cracking soldiers who fight there way to the mother ship and destroy the aliens. There would be no rallying call from some president or other which inspires the human race into working together to defeat the alien menace. Whatever the aliens wanted they would just take and if we got in the way we would get our asses well and truly kicked. That's why Skyline works so well. It's realistic. A bunch of scared residents try to escape an alien invasion as all around them the human race is sucked onto alien crafts to fuel the invasion. The fightback is futile and easily defeated although the aliens do miscalculate as one of the humans is a little bit different. This seems to be the basis of the Skyline 2 film set for 2012. It's a shame as Skyline worked really well. Some great effects, passable acting and decent plot. It's ending bleak and hopeless as the aliens triumph over man's puny efforts. Their last fightback just seen at the end in the sinking burning ships of the fleet sent to save LA and the cities around the world suffering a similar fate. It will be a great shame if 2 trawls Battle LA territory with whooping armies somehow discovering a weak alien link and Jarrod helps to save the day. But I guess even the crappiest film must have sequel after sequel until the cash profit runs dry.

This is brilliant because no matter what species you are, human, animal and very probably other alien races - you will always want to look at a bright light! The SFX here are truly fantastic and keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through! The ending is also great because i was wondering what the point was of giving Jarrod the powers they did yet do nothing with it but then they showed exactly what they had planned in the end.Both my partner and myself can't wait for the second one to see Jarrod take them down in his new 'guise'! Go to see the movie with an open mind and with the attitude of just wanting to see a fun SFX ridden alien movie and i guarantee you wont be disappointed. If on the other hand you go in expecting to see an Oscar winning story with Oscar winning performances then you WILL be disappointed! Its a lot of fun and im sure thats all its intended to be!!!",

Needless to say, it turned out just as I expected: the worst movie ever. The only good thing about this film was the amazing CGI. The aliens and color looked really cool, but it ended there. Other than that, the acting was terrible, the plot line was empty of any real creativity, and the ending was simply weird and ambiguous. It was as if the producers were hoping for a sequel. Good luck with that. I honestly don't know how this film didn't make the Bottom 100 list, it's so bad.

Like they had this concept for a film with this great panoramic shot of LA like you see in the trailer. But that's it, a concept that's used up in the first 20 minutes of Skyline. For the next 72 minutes the actors run aimlessly around the set playing with the shades and begging for some direction.

The list does go on.Mainly though the look and feel seemed to be aimed to work off of the back of Cloverfields success but it never worked.The characters are at best 2 dimensional and I truly didn't care about their fate. This is generally the biggest problem as if you can't invest in the characters and see something to either be empathetic about or to bring about some emotional connection or response, you are dead in the water.In addition to that it to me appeared that they had some great ideas for some special effects and set pieces and came up with a story to try to justify spending the money and putting it on screen. Never enough.I always consider that Sci-Fi and Horror are about something else and the genre is just a story telling device. Think of Dawn of the Dead being more about consumerism than zombies and The Matrix being about perception of computer worlds in conjunction with an actual reality rather than machines running the planet.In Skyline there was little plot, no good characters and no message.Must try harder....

With that being said; if any other director did this film it would be getting praise after praise. It is also interesting to see that the people writing the bad reviews have really dodgy nicknames making you think they are possibly the same person or company hired to sabotage the film?anyway, enough about why the reviews are bad and onto a review of the film... The acting wasn't the best, I will admit that. But it wasn't so bad that you didn't get brought into their world and feel the desperate hope to survive. I am really hoping this film does well so Skyline 2 gets a better budget and can concentrate a little more on the story and acting. The action was brilliant, the cgi was amazing and the hopelessness was captured brilliantly. I found myself sitting with a big grin on my face at certain parts of the film. It's a shame I almost let the reviewers sway my decision to see the film cause I would be kicking myself big time if I missed out on seeing this at the cinema and ended up watching it on DVD.

Independence Day 2. War of the Worlds 3. Skyline 4. Cloverfield 5. District 9 6.

            "content": "Alien-invasion movies. They're essentially a staple of science fiction cinema, dating back all the way to the 1950's. From numerous versions of The War Of The Worlds to Independence Day to Invaders From Mars to Mars Attacks!, the concept of aliens showing up to kick our butts has been no surprise storyline to audiences. Thus enters Skyline, the newest flick to spin this particular kind of story.Kicking off the attack right in the first scene, Skyline concerns a small group of people who find themselves trapped in an apartment complex as aliens begin sucking away people, either to their massive ships in the sky or into themselves as they patrol the ground and air.That's pretty much it for the whole movie, in a nutshell. The characters don't really do much at all. Of course, they try to escape early in the movie, as one would expect, but when it fails they essentially just sit around and talk (or scream) until the final moments. This wouldn't be such a problem if there was captivating dialogue or interesting character development, but sadly, Skyline holds neither.Skyline falls into the common trap of effects-driven movies of either ignoring or de-stressing everything else. The characters are generally one dimensional. Two male characters are hinted at having previous partnerships in early scenes, but no explanation of detailing is given as to what, as if the movie simply forgot. Outside of this, there is almost nothing to give any sort of relevance or connection to any of them. The characters rarely have anything interesting to say as well, generally spouting something along the lines of \"They're out there\" or \"What are we gonna do?\". This is made even worse by the terrible, terrible acting in the movie. Almost every single actors delivers dialogue or reacts to things in the least effective manner. It's as if a cheesy 50's monster movie and a Sci-Fi Channel original movie got together, made babies, and those babies were these actors. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the final third of the movie becomes ridiculously silly and hammy. And as if THAT wasn't bad enough, the very final moments of the movie become so absolutely bonkers that the movie becomes beyond any sense of redemption.There is some light of value to Skyline, however. The visual effects are absolutely top-notch. From the image brilliant blue orbs raining from the sky to that of alien ships sucking up thousands of people, the alien sights of the movie never disappoint. The aliens themselves are fascinating as well, taking a number of different forms. And if one chooses to enjoy the movie as a source of unintentional humor (Who doesn't love watching bad movies with friends every once in a while?), I can't currently think of a more perfect modern movie to watch and laugh at.Overall, Skyline is a disappointment compared to other films of its sub-genre, unless it was intended to be so silly. Had their been a better script and more competent set of actors and director, this could have been a truly terrific movie. But in the end, this invasion doesn't impress.",

'Cept this time, in Skyline, these things don't get damaged by our weapons. We all cheered when the UAV drone survived the gauntlet and fired the low-yield nuke into the ship. It wobbles and crashes, YAY!!! But then - and this was a painful moment - the dam thing reassembles itself with nano technology... NO!! The ships don't register damage from missiles; even the biological meat-slab monsters survive point-blank RPGs, and when a heroic F-22 pours cannon fire into one, gets waxed, and crashes into the burger being, IT STILL DOESN'T DIE!!!! Well, let's allow the propane to fill the room, light a match to vape the place and take yourself along with it - sorry NO EFFECT!! None of the main characters get it easy, except for the pregnant woman at the end who is \"spared\". Skyline takes a \"realistic\" approach to how an invasion by extraterrestrials would actually pan out in terms of there being no contest.Skyline takes us into the motive of the aliens, something which not too many other alien invasion movies do. Yeah, we are usually told or it's hinted at, but never shown. The jarring sight of seeing ... ewww... brains and spinal cords removed and implanted into the dormant burger beings - - so THATS why they're here... Remember the scenes in The Animatrix with the machines using catatonic humans as guinea pigs. After years of seeing the humans prevail against the aliens, this time NOTHING works. Heck 2009 and 2010 have seen that theme played out - human paramilitary guys get wiped out by the Navi in Avatar, and the prawns in District 9 kind of beat the police at the end.For my tastes, Skyline wouldn't have been any better if the \"beautiful party people/melodrama and infidelity\" first act was absent or changed. I would have liked to see us get to actually know and care about the characters, but that wouldn't have changed the idea of \"nothing can stop the aliens; no, sorry moviegoers, we don't win this time.\" A pretty good spin on the usual \"Humanity triumphs\" ending.",

            "content": "The loads of both positive and negative reviews prove my point. Look back at great movies like Blade Runner and Soylent Green(from way back when) Trashed when they came out, very emotional responses to them and what do you know: Cult-status with all kinds of mysticism surrounding it. I won't go so far that Skyline will have that kind of status over time, but its a kind of unorthodox that puts it more or less in that category.Indeed, the cast is not very nice at times, but certainly very human. It takes place, most of the time, in the same apartment , but at the same time the movie provides the reasons why: the group simply can't go anywhere. They tried, killing two of the group in the process and barely get back alive. The events happening around them are on such a scale and has such an all-encompassing impact, they simply don't know what to do. What people really don't like about that scenario is that you sometimes just can't escape your faith. This fuels the kind of emotions that are confrontational, because it shows a person(as yourself) can be fallible and more to the point, really is mortal. You don't see that very often in films, at least not in the popular genres. The aliens are great, but I must admit look in some form a lot like the ones from Independence Day and WotW. For the rest, they are as they should be (for this movie) No human like emotion, no communication, alien. they only see us as vehicles, our brains a sort of battery/CPU component. That's all we are to them. It makes the film all the more bare. There is no escape, no dialog, nothing that can possibly help to save humankind. It all fits and there it is: you either like that or not. There are no heroes, really no other ending possible. Great ! The twist at the end makes it even greater. To me its more of a pun to the the many sequels that are made and where you know, it will not happen here. In short: refreshing. Bye !",

Not that kind of movie.What you see on the screen is YOU. This is how you would look in a similar situation. This is you with your not so engaging life and not so smart and funny friends, and not so interesting girlfriends, and with quite average conversations you have with your average friends. This is how your life would look, not very cinematic, trust me. Mine too. And this is how you would react if all of a sudden everything around you turned upside down. With a twist of violent alien attack.This is exactly what makes Skyline feel so real. It doesn't matter whether that effect is created intentionally, or accidentally - it works, and makes this movie different from all the \"Independent Day\" types.So don't complain about acting, be thankful.As for special effects, aliens and action - it is absolutely great.The explanation of what exactly aliens need from us, who or what they are, and how they operate is completely original and unexpected. It is not easy to come up with such and original stuff, after alien invasion and alien creatures were re-imagined countless times. Yet they pulled it off.It is also such a relief to see that for once global genocidal alien invasion is not thwarted during the course of 90 minutes by a group of heroic humans who find some overlooked flaw in the design of incredible alien war machine.So here it is: great Sci-Fi, top-notch FX, realistic acting and outcome, i want to see more !",

            "content": "I'm not going to be as harsh as a lot of people on here have been regarding the entirety of the movie. For a good part of the movie I actually enjoyed it. Did I care about the characters? No, they were all horridly vapid shells of people that neither the writers nor the actors could give any life. But I did enjoy the hopelessness of their situation and found the situation they found themselves in to be more compelling than any single character. Was the movie derivative? Sure, but I went into it expecting a popcorn movie of aliens wrecking things up and people trying to stay alive, I wasn't expecting it to be ground breaking, just entertaining. And to me, it was, until the last 10 minutes of the movie jumped the shark and decided to go into SyFy Made For TV Movie land.Had we ended the movie with the main couple being harvested and holding each other as they went to their assumed doom I feel we could have been left with an impression. Sometimes the good guys don't win, sometimes humans aren't the top of the food chain, and sometimes no matter what you do, things are just gonna end badly.Unfortunately the movie chose to emphasize the latter that yes, sometimes no matter what you do things ARE going to end badly and end on an absurd and out of left field note.I had no beef with the movie until the last 10 minutes on the alien's ship, most people in the theatre seemed to feel the same as no sooner the end came massive groans, complaints, curses and laughter filled the theatre.My advice isn't to forgo the movie entirely it's just to forgo the last 10 minutes. When you see the main characters kissing in the air, leave. Just get out. Go. Run. Since the editors of the movie seem to have no idea what should remain on the cutting room floor I advise movie goers to be their own editors and leave before things get super silly.",

            "content": "Much like Spielberg's re-hash of \"War of the Worlds\", only much better. Some people saw this, leaving with the impression that they had just seen an utterly original movie. I wish I were that naive.It seems that most horror and sci-fi films that start off with a bang, proceed to take their sweet time with getting on with it, and so is the case here. After the quick, instantly exciting opening follows almost 20 minutes of medium tedium, while the movie's writers introduce us to the \"characters\". As if I could care less what these people do, or that the female lead just found out she's pregnant with Big-nose's kid. The fact that she's rather pretty does help wile away the time, though.On the other hand, that proves to be a relevant for a major plot-point at the end. Fine, but with some capable writing we could find that out within 5 minutes, not 20.Speaking of which, that bimbo complains to the other bimbo (the blond one) about the latter's smoking. \"I'm pregnant, you see\". Meanwhile, there is an ALIEN INVASION just meters away from them. This boozy slag is concerned with what a little second-hand smoke might do to her undoubtedly brilliant fetus/baby, whereas the stress she's experiencing due to having just run away from a 100-meter tall monster doesn't play a role. Or was that smoking-complaint thing included in the script just so brain-drained teen audiences would not forget that she's pregnant (coz, you see, that's relevant to the final plot twist).It makes no sense for the aliens to spend so much time and energy chasing around a couple of remnant humans that are hiding out in buildings when they have the whole planet as their oyster. I know, I know, this is just a brain-sucking tentacled-beasties-from-outer-space sci-fi flick, so I might be nitpicking a little. It's kind of like kneeling on the floor, looking for bread-crumbs, when you have a whole roasted turkey waiting for you on the table above you. So the aliens aren't just ugly, they're also moronic.Invading L.A. isn't such a bad idea for the aliens, though perhaps a bit of a double-edged sword. The Angeleros, being the dimwitted liberal knuckleheads they are, would be a pushover to conquer. They'd probably form \"alien support groups\" straight away, advocating tolerance toward the monsters (arguing that they all had a bad uprbringing on their home planet), and asking for their fellow Earthlings to volunteer to have their brains sucked out so that \"our foreign friends don't leave our planet hungry\". Leading Hollywood figures (nearly all liberal, of course) would publicly decry any anti-alien sentiment, referring to it as \"racist\". Ironically, the aliens would still be hard-pressed not to leave L.A. hungry, what with the very tiny brains that liberals have. Worse yet (for the aliens), L.A. brains are infected with botox leakages (seeping from the lips into the brains), which might prove to lessen rather than heighten the aliens' enjoyment of their grey-mattered meals. Then again, who knows. Perhaps botox acts as catchup for the monsters, adding that extra special flavour (which might explain, after all, why they so rabidly hunt out the last remaining live L.A. humans).The ending just begs for a sequel. Will the aliens eventually get overrun by the human brains they devour? Will there be civil war between the aliens who still think with their own brains and those who think with human ones? Will aliens who now think like humans start watching porn on cable? And most importantly, does this mean that Oprah Winfrey might get her brain sucked in, only to wake up in the body of a monster? Not that this would be any kind of change for her!",

            "content": "I wanted to comment on a more recent film, that is of Hollywood descent, and that also could inform a more critical review. One that will, in fact, give me a more acerbic writing style from my previous (mostly positive) musings. So, out of sheer knowing - that is, I knew this film would be a steaming pile of s**t - I decided to watch Skyline. I was attracted to this project as an object of despise, as it was directed by \"the brothers Strause\". Now, forgive me for judging, but anyone who is given the role of directing a film from the starting point of an F/X team, is surely going to be a miss (just look at Stan Winston's Pumpkinhead - God rest his soul). Whilst they had one previous outing in the for of Alien Vs Predator: Requiem, their previous film output was for the special effects of films such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, 2012, and 300. An impressive array of films, crossing genres are to their name - in F/X. Just please, don't let them direct films!!!Skyline tells the story of a bunch of vacuous twenty-somethings who have congregated in an LA apartment block for a party to 'inaugurate' Jarrad (Eric Balfour) into a life in the music industry that he lost out on in younger youth. He has been invited to this 'party' (although, I've been to more exciting parties in a war-zone), with his girlfriend (maybe fianc\u00e9, I couldn't care less - and who is played by some pretty, unconvincing girl) to join in on 'the business'. Well, anyway, the next day, there have been some alien 'lights' landing around the apartment and generally sucking people up in alien 'spaceships', cultivating human brains - well, I'm sure they're tasty! These people are then spat out as giant gorilla-robot style aliens. What will they do with themselves once they've gobbled us all up? I don't care! Well, the light is rained on the folk and we find out that people are drawn to this before being taken by the aliens. And their eyes and the skin surrounding said eyes, turns all veiny!I think the party sequence really triggers this movie into the juvenile bulls**t that it really occupies. In a 'party' sequence, the revelers are watching as an occupant of a parallel apartment gets a blow job, in quite a disturbingly voyeuristic scene. The parties reverie is palpable, until the person giving head is suddenly revealed as being another male. the 'audience' recoils in disgust. It's just a little on the 'right' side of homophobic. But this element just prepares you for the onslaught of vile, vacant character plotting that fills the film with my utter contempt.The films 'characters' are occupied by the sort of inane people you might find on a TV 'reality' show such as Celebrity Love Island. Its the kind of person that may on the surface look pretty, but has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I would be happy to see mangled in some kind of painful Grand Guignol fashion, for my pleasure. Unfortunately, these are the people that get on in life.It does play like the beginning of a really bad sci-fi channel series, a pilot for a season that we wish would never be. It has a large amount of brickolage in the sense that, every visual and character idea is something that you have seen in countless films before this (Independence day, 2005's War of the Worlds - to name just two). I think the only thing that may possibly redeem this project is the special effects which are relatively good. Although, as I previously said, they are simply lifted ideas from other films (or am I supposed to say 'homage'?).The acting in this film is beyond reproach. OK, maybe the characters are all generic and have not been given any kind of arc, but there is no redeemable performance. I have seen better acting in the particles of bile in my vomit after a particularly heavy (and food-free) night of drinking. Each acidic bubble trying to explode first in a mission to out-act the bursting of the previous one. I can find nothing in this film, other than it wasted 2 hours of my life. I almost found myself becoming jealous of their characters lured into the light of the alien ships, as they had their eyes burnt out. An event that could not come sooner whilst watching this atrocious excuse for and over-expensive, generic piece of s**t.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

Originality is not even worth talking about since Independence Day or War of the Worlds are one of the many films this movie tried to copy. What the director did not understood is that you cannot steal ideas, concepts and give orders within the total chaos you have just created. This so-called \"science-fiction\" movie has no character development, matter of fact, it has no characters at all. The only people in this movie are a bunch of washed-up classic douches, all having annoying personalities thrown together in a total mess just to obtain the incredibly stupid and boring issues that are literally nothing but a waste of time. The subject of alien invasion has been used and re-used many times but they thought a big vacuum-cleaner would change things. Well it didn't since nobody was impressed with those \"lego-looking\" space-ships. The action is also forgotten in some lonely corner since most of the scenes happen inside a hotel where this impertinent group of people find time to agree and disagree but don't find time to stop for one god damn second and just use their heads. Sense is nonsense and logic is just a lost word in this big sea of stupidity.Despite the characters not being present in the movie, the actors did not manage to bring anything to life, not even my eyelids. But hey, that was not really a problem for the guys when you have sgt. Angel Batista (from Dexter) there to protect you, right?... And what the hell was with those Rolls Royce and Ferrari and other 15 brands commercials in the movie?... Those scenes looked so average and forced I can't believed I walked out in the first 10 minutes.Technically-wise, this is another why the suicidal idea bullet-in-the-brain was invented. I understand that this is a low-budget movie, I'm not ignorant, but then again, if you don't have a budget why do you try to be so pretentious and why would you make such a horrid visually movie?... If the story sucks at least make the movie as much beautiful visually as you could make it. I can't even describe how mad I am on Hollywood when they are promoting this crap and directorial anti-talent. This is not art, this is not even commercially good stuff this is just pure crap and another statement of Hollywood's downfall in originality and most important, in self-respect for the last couple of years.

I am a sucker for a good twist so I watch, without reading anything about it first.\"Skyline\" actually begins quite well, with some blue lights falling on the city. Staring into the blue light apparently mesmerizes people who eventually get sucked into it. However, as the octopus-shaped alien with the long tentacles made its appearance, and later a different alien monster with two legs terrorized the streets, this movie turned into a typical chase and kill off the victims one by one type of film.The alien seemed indestructible from anything the humans throw at them, from bullets to entire aircraft! However in a moment of cinematic illogicality, in the climactic fight towards the end, our hero Jarrod (Eric Balfour) dares to try killing one by hitting it with a hollow block and punching it with his bare fists! And for some strange reason, the aliens took their sweet time when it came to our heroine Elaine (Scottie Thompson), unlike the swift way they killed their other human victims.This is a movie with less than 90 minutes of running time, yet it really felt so long. The whole thing was repetitive, irrational, and maddening. The characters were all annoying, and the generally unknown actors who portrayed them were so hammy in their acting. Now as for that supposed nice \"twist\" at the end, as the scene shifts to the insides of the alien monster. I don't know. It was not much of a twist for me at all.

What are we going to do? Thats it. And, if you put yourself in their position, thats more than enough to keep your mind busy for an hour and a half.There are clangers (looking through a telescope at a nuclear blast and not going blind... aliens with telepathic beams of light but no heat sensors) but the special effects - monsters, space ships and aerial fight scenes were excellent, and more than made up for it, although the monsters did look a little like they'd been inspired by Matrix and LOTR. But so what? I've seen people complaining about the characters, but I don't understand why. We have a bunch of people thrown together in a crisis situation. They're not really even friends. They have no idea whats going on and act accordingly and differently, as would real people in the same situation, I imagine. And I think thats the point of this film. To be real. I felt for the characters. They are in a no-win situation. Like roaches in a flat about to be DDT'd. You can run around all you like, but your gonna die in the end! The hopelessness, and desperation, was apparent in their actions.There are no heroes. No one-person-that-makes-a-difference, as one would expect when the human race is being annihilated on a planetary scale. The military put on a brave show but get creamed, as always happens when a less-technologically advanced species meets and more-advanced one intent on eating everything with a brain. There is no happy ending. Everybody dies.Until, as I said at the start, the last thirty seconds on board one of the mother ships tries to put a pin point of light at the end of a very dark tunnel.",

Many opinions suggest that this may be one film which will take home numerous Oscars in the upcoming academy awards ceremony. Now, if the law-of-contrasts is at usually at work, as some people say, the film that will take home numerous RAZZIE awards has already seen the daytime too-- and that movie, friends, is: SKYLINE. I'm personally a guy who is very against the \"sue-everything-that-moves\" mentality that is prevalent is some societies... but after watching SKYLINE I feel like deserting camp and suing someone-- anyone-- for the re-funding of the cinema ticket money and the 2 hours time I lost in watching this pile of utter crap, which is this movie SKYLINE. Ooof!! I know, it's considered \"cool\" in some circles to ridicule the alien- invasion/disaster/monster flicks which come from director Roland Emmerich (\"Godzilla\", \"Independence Day\", \"2012\", etc...)-- but really, people: in comparison with SKYLINE these movies of Emmerich seem to me nothing less than MASTERPIECES!!!Granted, Roland Emmerich's \"Independence Day\" and \"Godzilla\" had childish/immature plots and character development... but then again, both \"Independence Day\" and \"Godzilla\" and \"2012\" are visually stunning to admire. You can debate the storyline-development skills of Emmerich, but even the most ardent of \"Independence Day\" haters cannot argue that Roland Emmerich's movies, have visuals which are so simply very-very impressive to watch and admire. Even the most negative and pessimistic haters of Emmerich's disaster movies, couldn't bring themselves to blink their eyes, and miss the crumbling of Earth and civilization to dust in last year's \"2012\"... Again, setting GODZILLA in a background where it's constantly raining in the \"Godzilla\" movie, was a mistake even amateur Sci-fi filmmakers wouldn't make-- but then again, the DESIGN of the Godzilla monster was near-perfect. Flying in the face of all Godzilla purists, Emmerich's monster looked majestic and wonderful to look at, from snout to tail, and is still considered among designers as an epitome in \"cool\" monster designing.Now, consider all this in comparison with this pile of crap that is SKYLINE.Once the monsters of SKYLINE, flying or otherwise, appear on-screen-- you know you've \"been had\". And if you were hoping the story, characters of the movie might be able to still save this movie, somehow, it becomes painfully clear, that this simply-- is not going to happen. Promo trailers and posters of SKYLINE were intriguing enough as effective TEASERS... but, that's the sign of good and well made teasers-- they get you aroused and interested in the movie/final product-- even when the final product is, in actuality, a utter and complete disappointment like SKYLINE eventually is. But the thing is, TEASERS, by their very definition, are intentionally \"blurry\" and incomplete-- for example, the alien ships hovering over the city skyscrapers are intentionally shown as blurry contraptions of unclear and twisted steel, hidden beneath layers of some sort of fog/smoke. But you say to yourself: in the movie they'll probably show the alien starships in better and clearer detail... NO, people, you've \"been had\". In the movie/finished product the alien starship is still a twisted, ugly and visually un-interesting contraption of steel. Then again, what's up with those ugly monsters in the movie? They are partly machine and flesh/bone? How come? Are they sort of like animals assimilated by the BORG hive from the STAR TREK series?! How can these creatures be both machine and flesh/bone? Why do they have BLUE FLASHLIGHTS as eyes? WHY are the audience viewing the film constantly DAZZLED by this too- bright lights, which deliberately conceal the creatures when these appear in the frame? The answer, IMO, is that the makers of this terrible film don't want you to see the monsters clearly, so you cannot see (at least until it's too-late) what an half-assed job they'd done with the designing of these illogical creatures. The BIGGER FAILURE of SKYLINE is not only in disappointing us with it's unhuman and character-less story... but in also failing where most (even far less budgeted) movies succeeded: In the VISUAL ELEMENT. Most Sci-Fi fans know that if a Sci-Fi movie delivers both with story and with visual extravaganza they were \"blessed\" with seeing and enjoying a good Sci-fi movie: i.e. Neill Blomcamp's magnificent and touching \"DISTRICT 9\" from 2009.The ending of SKYLINE? Don't get be started on that. It's not that I don't \"get it\"... It's a bogus and ugly ending-- that only further reveals to you that you have \"been had\" once again. 'They' managed to lure you out of your ticket money and convinced you to waste 2 hours of your life, promising (in the TEASERS, TRAILERS) a significant, interesting Sci-fi movie which you'll also enjoy to watch VISUALLY-- only to show you in the end that that brought you into that theater seat to see an episode of some cartoony-cartoon which looks like some leftover of some cancelled video-game concept-- where you have UGLY GOOD MONSTERS (who were once human) battling UGLY BAD MONSTERS (who were also once human?).Sorry for being this overtly pessimistic. I'm not a pessimistic type of person. But this movie is just so-very disappointing. I'm now going to watch anything-- I mean anything-- even if it's some foreign, snail- paced, boring movie whatever-- in an attempt to try and forget seeing this movie SKYLINE... and the images from it.Still, trying to end on one positive note: there are scenes in SKYLINE where you get to see the beautifully-structured Brittany Daniel in a swimsuit. Wow... what a sight. And for the ladies, there's actor Donald Faison showing off his muscular body structure and beautiful skin also. So, if you see that much, and then leave the theater, not seeing anything else from the movie-- believe you me, you'll not be missing anything.",

It does the start-a-bit-into-the-story-thing which didn't seem necessary here - didn't add anything. Then it tries to build the main characters but does a bad job of that, starting stuff up that doesn't go anywhere or is just thrown away later. Then it abruptly launches into the whole alien thing, ditching the character stuff cold pretty much. Where the aliens are from, what their beef is with us or why they're abducting everyone is never explained, instead time's wasted on more bad touchy feely stuff, like who's sh#gging who, and whether people should smoke around pregnant women(seriously). Priorities anyone? The usual slapstick desperate scrambles from terrifying monsters and machines, things just missing the main 2 characters, and narrowly escaping this and that while everyone else gets shafted around them. Throughout it seems that bullets and explosions, and even nuclear detonations are ineffective against this other worldly advanced tech; no wait an angry man can hit one with an axe, then punch it several times and kill it. Riiiiiiight. Then they stole the War of the Worlds idea of hiding behind things while the super advanced aliens send their clumsy people locating tech in to haphazardly find people, or not most of the time. They totally nicked the sentinels from The Matrix, the will-the-detached-helicopter-rotors-kill-them bit from some film, and probably more. Seems all the soldiers on the ground are completely scr3wed no matter what they throw at these things, yet the alien aircraft can barely keep up with our primitive fighter jets let alone blow them out of the sky. Why don't they just shine a big blue light whenever the fighters appear and hypnotise all the pilots - job done? There's this intermittent big announcement of what day it is but this is meaningless, and has no bearing on what happens. And the gas explosion about 3 minutes after the guy turned the hob on with the side of the building ripped off - that's one seriously over-powerful hob my friend! Just loads and loads of nutty inconsistencies that kill movies like this for me. They should have gone one way or the other, all daft cartoon action with no character stuff, or realism with background, explanations, and a connection with some of the characters. This falls horribly between the two. I'm too disgusted to even talk about the ending - I was just laughing by that stage as the movie transformed into something utterly bizarre. All this crazy whack-job stuff going on and b#gger all explanation for any of it. Unnecessary contradictory stuff. Abandoned character stuff, abandoned characters! B#gger all sentiment, then lashings of sentiment for no apparent reason. It offended mine eyes - if it was a dog I'd have it taken out and shot.",

I liked the idea of being hypnotized by an alien force that makes you sympathize with it and starts controlling you so it can take your brain and absorb you into itself to further its species. That's a way cool concept that does seem right out of the 50's but I don't see those good old-fashioned kinds of concepts that often in many modern sci-fi movies, just a lot of simple plots and explosions and little threat beyond death or dismemberment.It did languish on some of the hypno-scenes too long and too often though, didn't explore the interplay between characters that were escaping the mind control, the adolescence of some of the characters and their dialog and actions, and the ending seemed a little too fast even though I loved the twist that set it up for a sequel. I wish this had been more popular and I could see that sequel.",

For some reason, there has been a distinct lack of Sci Fi movies made in the recent years. One of the reasons certainly not being they fail to make money. Somehow the movie making industry has just chosen to avoid these movies.Skyline may not be the greatest Sci Fi movie of all time but it will provide relief to those seeking such a movie. It's got some clich\u00e9s, some unique parts, acting ranging from great to OK, a script ranging from great to OK and a plot that ends with a cliffhanger.Some say it's been made on a virtual shoestring budget which is laughable at $10M imo, and it has obvious alien influences from the game Crysis, but overall it is certainly not boring and very entertaining.Those reviewers bashing this movie with 5/10 or less, seem to have access to endless better Sci Fi movies that the rest of the world doesn't have. For those of us in the real world, while we wait for masterpieces like Aliens, Matrix, Dreamcatcher, Star Trek, Star Wars (4-6), to be made - this is a good movie to put a stop to the lack of Sci Fi coming out.",

But it was surreal, away from life. We could never relate to it once we stepped out of the film. But Skyline, it scores a resounding, thumping thumbs up for bringing it as close to us as it can get.Throughout the film you try and device plans to escape the alien challenge as if it were threatening your existence. I watched it on television and I had to stop keening on the laptop just minutes into the film. The movie has a dramatic ending with enough options for a sequel.

            "content": "I know a lot of people are writing negative reviews based on a flimsy script, and it's duly noted for this review.The first thing I look for in a science fiction flick is well, something scientific (with varying degrees of realism). In this movie we have an decent alien invasion which I think qualifies. The second thing about scifi I look for is to be scared or at least made to feel uneasy. This film definitely accomplishes that. I thought that these particular aliens were imagined in a way that only my worst fears could conjure. They were virtually indestructible yet could be hurt, and even killed. It just would require awesome force which was basically beyond our human capability to annihilate them completely. They were just too many and too much for us, and majorly creepy and unsympathetic.I'm glad the characters were sort of invisible. The devastation in the film was the star. The lead male character used to be Madonna's boyfriend I think (correction-he was not). I think an invasion could be just like this, and most of us (that would survive the initial onslaught) would be anguished strangers. The cast was fine. This is not an academy award type picture, so who expects that anyway. They could have had some layers to the characters, but what they did try to do was pretty lame anyway.The third and last thing I look for in a good scifi flick is being left with some level of dread. This film also does that. I can't think of a creepier group that would inherit the Earth. This film was kind of a mix between The War of the Worlds and District 9. Some of it was implausible, but just about every scifi has that element.In the end I think it's a worthwhile DVD view, and I've seen it twice. I rarely go back to a film, but I needed a closer look at these creatures. The sound and visuals were mostly fantastic. The thing that struck me most was these monsters just kept coming and coming. They wouldn't leave even one human escape, and they were merciless once they got you! I really hope we don't get invaded by aliens like this, and kudos to the creators for not giving us more of the same formula feel good stuff with no edge.",

It is about time someone got real with imagination of the \"what if\" scenario. Though I do not believe in such alien being in reality, sci fi is fun.

I walked out of the movie feeling emotionally violated and financially stolen from.The opening credits are the first giveaway. Remember how spaceballs opens by revealing the length of the command ship over 3 or 4 minutes? This film opens with \"An XYZ Film\" \"An AJB production\" \"A Studio Moron production\" \"Confusing Films in association with RipOff Cinema\" for about 8 slides. It was honestly comical.The entire film takes place in a condo building when it desperately needed more sets. The first 1/4 of the movie builds up the relationship of the two main characters based on the concept of \"Isnt money great?!\" \"Yeah money is great!\", then kills one of them for no reason. At the same time extremely minor characters are regurgitated by dead aliens back to life.The movie had maybe 1/10 the dialog of an actual film. Grunts, screams, and whimpering make up the rest. No alien can ever die but each alien can take a highly variable and nonsensical amount of damage. Predator drones are used in the film and some kind of B2 stealth drones that fly like falling flower pedals.After killing off the best character, a completely unlikable building employee somehow takes over the show and that's when I started rooting for the aliens. The action is so bad there is actually a 2 minute clip where time-lapse video is used to show, well, time elapsed. Numerous references to a large sailboat and marina \"two minutes away\" create a place the characters never reach, all the while the condo building shots get increasingly dull.One memorable scene is after the whole movie seems to prove they cannot leave the building and death by aliens is inevitable, the remaining two lead characters are trapped on the roof, injured and unable to walk, with a 200 ton alien bearing down on their position, when one says to the other \"you go on, save yourself\".About 95% of the way through the worst movie I may have ever seen, it takes a hard left turn into CGI-crazy-town. The CGI is the only well-done part of the film so I guess they figured they might as well finish with all-CGI. They go inside the alien ship. Its a gross-out fest of slime and alien limbs, with some Matrix-esquire shots of fields of humans being harvested. Though not the efficient bubble-pods of humans. Just have dozens of people covered in slime and cables lie down on the floor and squirm around a lot. Saves a lot of money that way.",

Also, the designs of the alien crafts and creatures are pretty unique. I could tell that they went through great length to come up with something new. Couple that with the fact that this movie looks like 100mil but only cost 10mil to make, and you realize that this movie will be a game changer in the industry.

This is how I felt watching this film, I'm amazed I made it to the end. The acting is atrocious, the story is laughable and the scenes are ridiculously baron for a metropolis (LA) despite the story line trying to address this. The lack of a good score or soundtrack really doesn't help this film - perhaps they felt keeping it subtle would raise the viewers tension, making the film feel more eerie? The result however is that there is little to distract from the poor acting, story and tired cinematography.One aspect this film deserves credit if for the CGI. Clearly they spent a reasonable amount of time getting the CGI to look right, perhaps they blew all the budget here hence the rest of the film is so dire.",

They don't make obvious stupid choice, they just panic, and reflect on us how far we would be willing to trust others' choice if our own life was in jeopardy.Yes the ending is a little to much Hollywood, but this movie is so hopeless about our ability to fight against an alien invasion that its almost a relief! Definitively deserve to be rented as a DVD if you missed it at the movie theater.",

            "content": "Hello guys!Skyline. The worst movie of the 2010?Having no expectations for Skyline I was increasingly shocked to find that it didn't even manage to meet the bottom of the barrel expectations I had set it! The trailer was semi interesting and there were great parts to it but it's another one of those incidents were the trailer shows every single good part.The Synopsis is that of Jarrod and his girlfriend have travelled to L.A to sample the life with his Best friend who is rich, after a night of partying and secrets being told, uh oh Bright lights appear and seem to take people through the light which has brainwashed them, Jarrod is then exposed much like in District 9 and mutates throughout the movie they are trapped within the hotel .Taking into consideration the graphics were great saves this film from being my worst of all time but then it's as if they said OK we've spent 9.5 million pounds on the graphics who can we get for a cheap rate? (filming only cost a reported 500k) Oh I know Turk from Scrubs and David Sayers from Dexter; everyone will call us geniuses for that one. If that wasn't enough add on the fact that the script felt as if it was done by an Eastenders writer or even the US show Days of Our Lives.Now this just doesn't surprise when I went to check out who the Director was it was the Strause brothers probably the best at visual effects in the biz but whose other titles director include AVP2, now that is my most hated movies ever the mere fact they killed 2 great aliens and made them look like Idiots who can be killed my teenagers with a chainsaw.The plot was that of any other Alien disaster movie more specifically the ones where people wake up and the world has gone to hell, add on the fact that people are being abducted it brings a familiarity feeling into play I could even go as far to say a rip off of War of the Worlds of sorts. This is what War of the Worlds would look like if Jason Friedman and Aaron Seltzer (Date Movie etc etc) directed it, no really. One of the best parts was even cherry picked from War of the Worlds; this is the part where the telescope alien is searching for other aliens.Towards the end of the film it feels like the filmmakers were running out of money because it just cut off when a battle sequence is underway and that made me realise that I had lost 93 minutes of my life that I will never get back, thanks Skyline. This well and truly is worst film I have seen of 2010 and it deserves a place on a lot more people's lists.For those of you who have watched Entourage will know that when I say this is a Johnny drama movie in its purest form, this is one to keep away from.All in all keep away this does not have Barlingtons seal of recommendation not at all.",

This movie does none of that and thank God for it. It is brutally realistic and credible as far is it is able, and actually does throw in a clever and satisfying twist at the end which had me laughing out loud at least.

It had America putting on a pretty good show, and making through the far superior invaders defences. It had Nukes. It had Helicopters. It had pretty blue lights. It had love - love conquering all boundaries - including being sucked up into the pretty blue lights, and including becoming a Human/Aline hybrid... apparently.Yes sir... it had everything you could possibly put into a movie. Why they didn't set it in the 1800s and make it a period piece as well is beyond me.How, you might ask, could the writers and the director fit all of this into one movie? Once you forgo any points, plots, sub-plots or decent writing of any kind it all just falls together.When you cheap out and spend 1/20th of your budget on everything else and the remaining 19/20ths on special effects you get this movie.See this movie if you enjoy poking fun at these sorts of films.DO NOT see this movie if you want to try to send a pretty strong message to Hollywood - don't feed us this crap any more.This is a bad movie.

The characters, dialogs and script are rather bland, nothing really special to say about them. There's plenty of action yes, and the effects are not bad either. But it all kinda reminds too much about other movies. It looks like it wants to be a mix between 'Independence Day' , 'The Abyss' and 'Cloverfield'.

I mean there might be films that are sort of complete enough to watch, but they usually are not written this badly, and do have some level of completeness to them. In any case if any one wonders why people stop going to the cinema, well this is a good example, such films are simply not worth the money they cost to see them at a theater.That said the effects in the film are good though-out, though they're more-or-less are rendered meaningless due to the script.. The acting is mediocre but I suppose that might be again due to the meaningless script.Basically if the film had started say, from the last 2 minutes, then showed a 5-10 minute summary as a build-up to that point, and went on from there, it would have been a hit... it has a meaningless script with no real story, and so its just plain awful.",

            "content": "There has been a raise in low budget monster films and alien invasions film, Cloverfield, District 9 and Monsters being big examples. Special Effects budgets have become more manageable and cheaper for these films to be made. After the disaster that was Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, directors/special effects wizs the Brothers Strause wanted to prove it was Fox's fault and show they are competent directors with Skyline, a sci-fi film they made with a budget estimated to be around $10 to 20 million.In Los Angeles artist Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his pregnant girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) go to Jarrod's best friend, Terry (Donald Faison) to celebrate his birthday. After a heavy night of drinking and partying some strange blue lights fall from the sky and has a hypnotic effect on anyone who stares at it. It quickly becomes clear that Earth is being invaded by aliens and are sucking up people like hover sucks dust. The group of friends have to decide whether to stay in the apartment and wait for help or try to make a break for it.Lets start with the positives, the Brothers Strause certainly show why they are some of the best special effects people in the business, having worked on X-Men: The Last Stand, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, 2012 and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The action sequences like the aerial dog fight were very well done and there are plenty of special effect sequences that could have easily have fitted in a film with 10 times it budget. It was better then say The Last Airbender which had a $150 million budget. And well, it's short. I also actually liked seeing the action and events from a distance.Now for the bad and trust me there is a lot of bad. Lets start with the acting; it was wooden throughout and often most of the characters are just typical clich\u00e9d horror characters. Even Faison, an actor I like, does not come off with much glory. It is easy to predict who is going to get killed next. The general scenario plays very much like zombie/horror film siege and there are much better films that handle that subject; The Night of the Living Dead, both versions of Dawn of the Dead and The Mist are a few films on the top of my head. The whole point of those films is not just threat outside but also within and there was not really any of that. Another clich\u00e9 examined is one character is infected and he tries to hide what happened to him. Added to that is a old chestnut of a pregnant girlfriend and she obviously wants to protect her unborn baby. Skyline is shot within the apartment complex and has a small cast, which was obviously the limitations of the low budget and it was just so forced because the audience are not idiots. It is very stupid why aliens want humans (SPOILER ALERT): they rid out their brains and people them in aliens, adding to the idea its like a zombie film (and reminded me of a line in Heroes). It was poorly executed and I even laughed when it was first revealed. It certainly did not help when they included a red shirt character just so he can die. The design of the alien tentacles and the way the aliens rounded people reminded me a lot of Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, a much better film.Some people have criticised Skyline because it only looks at people who can not do anything to stop the invasion. I personally do not have a problem of looking how ordinary people would react to a extraordinary event. But it has done better in films like Cloverfield and War of the Worlds.Skyline also tries to stretch its material, it felt like it only had about 45 minutes of material and wanted to double its running time. It was almost like a filler episode of a television series looking away from the main story for a week. It was predictable and filmmakers were looking for new ways to keep the cast in the building and not go anywhere else in the city. The Brother Strause also attempt some stylist tricks that do not work for them, the biggest example being trying to show the passage of time with an panning shot with everything at a fast rate, just trying to stretch the film by about 20 seconds and a simple cut would have done.It also does not help that the film has a number of action clich\u00e9s we have all seen before, the noble sacifre, a person willing to kill themselves to take down an enemy or someone coming from behind to save another person. It is all very predictable.Overall just watch Cloverfield, Dawn of the Dead (both versions) or War of the Worlds, there are better films.",

With this in mind, i'd recommend it to all who know the background story of those games and/or are fans themselves.It hit me that this movie is actually very much like playing/watching \"Quake Wars\" from an ordinary civilians point of view and at last i realised that this movie is so far the closest thing representing a Strogg invasion without an actual Quake movie being made (after the horrible \"Doom\" fiasco i am not even sure someone will ever attempt it - maybe it's also better this way).When i first saw the movie, i haven't thought about the similarity to one of my favourite game franchises yet, so i was - as most others here - disappointed about the mini-location setting, the lameness of the acting, the holes in the plot; but most of all i was disappointed at the abrupt end: i literally told my girlfriend that I have felt like being just before an orgasm when out of the blue the sex stopped and the partner walked out, err, the credits started rolling. Sleeping over it, i really hope it was just the premise to a \"Skyline 2\" movie being planned ahead.Anyway, to compare the game/movie stories and concepts a bit:In Quake Wars, the Strogg - a race of bio-technological cyborgs - attack Earth,since it contains the thing they need the most for their continued survival: biological matter aka humans and animals, which they then transform to Strogg with use of horrible mutilation and mutation.In Skyline, the aliens - a race of bio-technological cyborgs (at least so it seemed to me) - attack Earth, since it contains the thing they need the most for their continued survival: biological matter aka humans and animals, which they then transform to aliens with use of horrible mutilation (removing the brain and implanting it into a machine).In Quake 4, the marine Mathew Kane is fighting with his fellows on the alien home-planet Stroggos; at some point he gets caught and is transformed in to a Strogg through a few gruesome medical procedures, but gets rescued just before he would lose his own will, which enables him to fight for humanity by using his newfound Strogg skills, armor & technology.In Skyline, the producer Jarrod is trying to survive an alien invasion with his fellows on their home-planet Earth; at some point (at the end) he gets caught and is transformed in to an alien through a gruesome medical procedure, but manages to retain his own will, which enables him to fight for his wife and their child by using his newfound alien skills, armor & technology.In Quake 2 Bitterman, the only survivor of a horribly failed 1st retaliation strike on Stroggos manages to fight his way through Stroggos and kills the Strogg leader, the Makron.In the probable Skyline 2 Jarrod and his pregnant wife, who are among the very few survivors of the original attack, manage to escape the aliens and then Jarrod manages to fight his way through to the alien mothership and kills their leader or blows it up, ending the invasion and saving humanity.Anyway, this is not your typical sci-fi movie which may put off some people who are more in to Rolland Emmerich's style; but after thinking it through I'm actually inclined to find it very good. But as always it's best to decide for yourselves.",

There are moments when we believe we're about to witness some type of battle, but we soon realize that the only thing happening is \"the aliens are now really upset...\", and when we see one of the main characters being killed roughly 30 minutes into the movie, you know this one will have a tragic ending.There were some funny moments, never a sense of danger or excitement, but some of the effects were neat, and for a while, I almost felt like there were some moments that recalled a very distant sense of paranoia, like in \"The Thing\", but not much time was given to the development of a coherent script, and well, the budget might not have been enough to accommodate some decent thespians.Take the film for what it is, an apocalyptic tale of what the end of the world might be like, if those things ever make it down here.

Gattaca, Solaris, Minority Report are examples. But most movies, even the good ones, use aliens and robots just as a metaphor for something else, like District 9.

Very colourful, the alien ships where beautifully designed, the scene where the human's fight back and fire the nuclear bomb at one of the ships, AMAZING! I just adore the fact that the ships are machines but with like a jellyfish aspect to them, the way the ships \"Self-Repair\" themselves! The ending to the movie is great, it is a little bit weird, i think they should have left the end of the movie as a \"End of the World\" situation, i didn't understand why they decided to shoot the entire scene within the space ship and the alien turns on it's own kind to protect the woman... WHAT?!?! Like i said, they should have just left it how it was...Apart from that one criticism, EXCELLENT MOVIE, VISUALLY SPECTACULAR, HIGHLY Recommended!!",

The storyline goes at a high pace with some occasional slower scenes. There is the occasional plot twist, some are good, others are, well, mysterious. To sum up the movie, it can be named original at least with a different line of thinking towards the regular blockbuster. The ending is very unpredictable. I did enjoy the movie simply because some scenes were stunning, others were just cool like a big something standing on the car when it drives out of the garage. And sometimes you will nod your head with unbelief. So it compelled me enough to write this first review because I did not fully agree with previous comments. So maybe it's only a 6 or a 7 but I want to give it an 8 for originality.",

So really props to the actors for letting me feel their pain and fear.Original comes to my mind.In the beginning some people you can do without and you don't care when they are killed off but there was 1 in particular that at first i thought could go but i ended up feeling their angst and changed my mind.The FX for me were awesome i like the fact that it is mostly done in day light so you don't get that night time can't see nothing FX so you gotta guess what you are seeing.I loved the end,totally not the normal type of ending you get with us beating the enemy and happily ever after.Really does anyone really think that if the Earth were invaded by aliens we would have a chance in hell to survive.I guess all the people who shot this film down were expecting us to win and that's why they really didn't like it.Comparing this to anything else is a stretch you can't there is no film comes to my mind that can compare to this,it is probably the closest film you have ever seen to show us the possible reality that could happen if we are ever invaded.I just feel this film needs to be seen with a little more thought.Not just go in blindly and expect everything to turn out peachy.I recommend this film to all true believers that we are not alone and we are NOT prepared.",

I would like to have seen more character development especially for the leads, but the CGI components of the story are really quite impressive. The rest of the theatre audience also enjoyed the movie from what I could tell---so I'm not sure why people are slamming it so. Perhaps they missed the point about the budget & were expecting something bigger & grander? Also, the need for actors like Will Smith & others is quite unnecessary---all actors react pretty much the same in the these types of situations, so I am surprised that anyone would consider the more well known actors as necessary.",

Also the cgi was so fast in the fighting scenes, it was hard to see much, though you can recognize and f22 here, f15 there, even an A10.

It has in my opinion very little in common with Independence Day as some reviewers seem to suggest.In any case, the story itself is rather thin, but I don't mind that necessarily (but it is my main reason for giving it a 6/10). The characters are shallow. We learn next to nothing about them beyond a brief introduction before they're thrown into the main plot. The majority of the budget obviously went into the CGI and not into the cast. However the actors don't get much of a challenge from the script anyway and do an adequate job. Donald Faison is a very likable guy as always, but none of the actors stand out in this film.The story itself is about an alien invasion. We don't learn much about the aliens though, who they are and what they want other than they abduct a lot of people. The story revolves around the group of initially 6 people in an apartment witnessing the events unfolding outside and their efforts trying to avoid being taken. The end doesn't offer much of a conclusion, and left me with the feeling of having seen a pilot episode of some new Sci-Fi TV-show.All that in mind, it is still worth watching. For one for its attempt at being different in a world where overrated predictable films like Inception seems to be the norm, and also for the creative CGI and spectacular scenes.",

Not far removed from District 9(which I gave a 9) as far as time frame, but light years away in terms of quality. This was the low-brow, budget conscious \"War of The Worlds part 2\" - starring John Cena and Dennis Rodman. At least that's the best comparison I can give you.Skyline is chock full of some of the worst lines in recent memory. \"What happens when we run out of sheets\", was one in particular that made me chuckle. That moment might have been the only redeeming quality of the movie. I spent 5 bucks for the movie on Comcast - figuring that I'd pay 3bucks from my local video guy and spend 2 bucks on gas getting there and back. The better option might have been to walk next door to the neighbors house, hand him five bucks, and then have him kick me in the nuts. A queesy stomach, and 2 hours of asking, \"when will this end\".Breaking down each poorly executed moment would exceed the IMDb character limit. I'm going to give this a 3 because of the sound and some passable CGI set pieces, but watching stealth fighters flip around like falling paper airplanes and listening to the worst, most void of substance script of the last few years has me thinking that might be generous.

The film then becomes a quite enjoyable sci-fi action-adventure romp. You might even find yourself rooting for the humans, rather than the aliens if you don't let yourself get to know the humans too well beforehand .... So... rather like real life, after all!",

The movie starts with a young couple being awoken by a bright light outside (a la Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET etc.). The woman gets out of bed an throws up in the toilet, which is Hollywood shorthand for \"pregnant\". She wakes up the man who goes to see what the light is and then SPECIAL EFFECTS HAPPEN.The audience is then treated to a fifteen-hour flashback in which we learn that, not only is this young couple utterly unlikeable, they also know a bunch of unlikeable people. Most of these new characters are shoe-horned in solely for the purpose of being killed, quickly and pointlessly, later in the movie.Having established an atmosphere in which you are actively rooting for the bad guys (the aliens) to kill these jerks as quickly as possible, we are introduced to some of the most unimaginative extra terrestrials in recent history. An uneasy mix of the sentinels from The Matrix and some of the more boring Transformers. The next hour is par for the course, aliens blowing stuff up, idiot humans running back and forth from one room to the next, arguing about absolutely nothing important.When the script writers realised that they didn't start off with enough alien-fodder, they recklessly and haphazardly introduce new characters only to kill them off moments later. Not only are we specifically instructed not to care about the main characters, we aren't given any time or reason to care for anyone else who turns up. Again, pointlessly, Homeland Security turn up and blow a whole bunch of stuff up which, by this stage in the movie, is impossible to care about. With a plot twist that would made Ed Wood blush, it turns out THE HUMANS ARE THE GREATEST ALIEN INVASION FORCE OF ALL. Also, the main character turns in to Jack from Jack and Daxter 2 for no discernible reason.Anyway, to cut a long story short, and with a huge spoiler warning, the aliens wipe everyone off the face of the Earth and the movie ends. Except it doesn't. We are treated to an extra, even more boring scene onboard one of the alien spaceships, ripped straight out of War of the Worlds. Another plot point is stolen from Futurama and yet another from District 9. Only then do the movie makers mercifully let the final credits roll. This is a stupid movie full of boring characters, boring aliens and full of boring, terrible sci-fi clich\u00e9s. I advise you all to avoid it.",

In Shakespeare's Hamlet a famous line is \"to be, or not to be?\" In this movie the question is...\"To open the blinds...Or not to open the blinds?\" This is the extent of the plot, as after they open the blinds they see exactly what you thought they would see. And realize that it wasn't as big a deal as they thought it would be...but still argued about it, along with other meaningless things like; you kissed the girl, I hate you, I hope you die...and then he dies, like everyone hoped you would.

It's weird, I should like this movie, it goes for the fun action, sci-fi movie that I love like Independence Day, but it just fails.It fails for many reasons, but the main was is that it is just no fun. This movie takes itself way, way too seriously. I mean the first 20 minutes have some humor, but once the aliens attack it gets way too overly dramatic, and because of this it just becomes a bore. None of the characters are memorable and the acting isn't that good, there are a couple of people who give descent performances but that's it. The script is one big plot hole after another. And it rips off like seven other movies. We follow a group of 20 somethings (Cloverfield). The aliens shoot down blue light (Independence Day), the aliens look like the decepticons from Transformers, and the souropods from the Matrix, they have tentacles that sneak in to look for people (War of the Worlds), they apparently don't like water(Signs), although that plot line is quickly dropped, and the ending is very similar to District 9.I will give credit where credit is due, the special effects look pretty impressive for the budget this movie had. I looked them up, the directors are actually special effects supervisors. Guys, if you are reading this, stick with that, you are very good at special effects, just leave directing and writing to the professionals. There are a few moments of fun, and the last shot was cool, too bad it ended which just ticked me off.Skyline is a giant missed opportunity.

I never make any conclusion on the actors or directors before I see their work, but S bros I don't know how, manage to make such a shame titles in movie industry. I really don't know what there next project will be, but for now it is such an awful work. The movie I did so much expected of, like many other people on this planet falls down in every possible segment. Put aside the CGI effects which are fine, let's keep on plot and overall impression. This is obviously nachos plate of War of the worlds and Cloverfield with few of the other well known alien invasion movies. So here, we don't have anything new, except even worse and silly ending, that reminds me on AVP in its style. The ending is really something I can't described. Horrible graphic novel like sequences, where main character looks like those tragic gentleman from the movie Fly and American werewolf in London. The idea from the start is promising, but at the end we have only a situation hostage like, with straight non optimistic end, where optimism is confusing at the very end. In this segment (hostage like), and as a very short premise (more like a...) I see similarity with the classic Rio Bravo or Carpenters intelligent Assault on P13, but nothing more to be discussed or related in its philosophy with those masterpieces (which is a shame from me to put it here). The trailers we saw before the movie actually came in the theaters with scenes of reporters talking about invasion, missed here for I don't know what reason. It was a fake and I am really angry. So, any kind of explanation of anything is up only to us. It looks like a half of the complete movie project, and right now I see that there will be a sequel. Is that mean that it will end as a whole movie with sequel? Maybe it will be a new franchise without ending? Or starting something new? However, at the end we have something like promising for the future plot. We see hybrid hero that rise among millions of sucked people. Maybe more heroes like him we will see? How many pregnant girls they sucked? The mess like in the bar fight at the end left me with big what? Here we see our hero character as himself in different body. The only one with red brain. Red brain as an preserved himself? The future army like him that will destroy the aliens? Maybe his offspring and many other offspring will be a new humans fighting and living with hybrids? Maybe we will see hybrids in the sequel with some magical formula where they become humans again? Maybe with other type of body? Cloned body? What? Thousand questions that actually don't see much of importance. I know my review is a mess, but the movie is in mega proportion, so please excuse me.

So why bother? The film rattles along like a video game - the characters are basic, but not too noble, the direction snappy if predictable, the acting so so. Yes, it's a 2010 version of fifties 'B' movies like 'The Blob from the Black Lagoon' and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Take note the utterly pretentious derivative 'Avatar' and 'Inception,' which do pretend to be a lot more.",

They can't stage a scene, they don't know what the hell to do with actors and even though they own special effects company Hydraulx, there's nothing special about any effects here. Eric Balfour is not only a terrible lead, but a terrible actor and he leads this bargain basement production shot around the brothers Strause apartment complex. Without the brother's connections, this would surely have found a nice home as a sci-fi channel original movie. At least they actually lit the film, unlike AVP:R which is so dark you can't even tell what is happening, so they learned something from their previous disaster - you have to light a film.

            "content": "I think a lot of people don't like this film because it didn't follow the usual Hollywood formula. In writing a script, you're supposed to root for the characters because you care about them, both as characters and as analogs for people you might have recognized from the real world. It not just the characters here are cardboard cutouts, poorly drawn and unrealistic. The script doesn't even bother to go THAT far with them. They are just puppets, empty vessels to advance the story.And you know what? There is a place for that sometimes.Skyline is just a movie that wants to show you excellent CGI effects of cool gross aliens biting peoples' heads off. And do it on as low a budget as possible. The effects are quite good. And frankly, the effects are what this film is all about. We have reached the point where all CGI effects can be done (relatively) on the cheap and still look confoundedly realistic. Go back in time and show this movie to someone in 1970, 1960, 1950, they would be astonished! How did they DO ALL THAT? Did they blow up entire buildings? The budget must have been immense! But no, in 2010, you can get all that done for under 1o million dollars, which, these days, is a low budget movie as far as the big major movie studios go.I would also like to mention the music score. Another technology where the whole thing can now be done on a computer in somebody's garage. You could still tell that it was, but hey, with some excellent composing talent, you can make a pretty impressive intense science fiction/action movie score. For almost no money. And this film has it.On the basis of cool stuff to look at, gross monsters, stuff blowing up, and doing it all with music underneath that sounds like outtakes from the Fox News war update bumpers, Skyline can't be beat.As far as finesse in the art of scriptwriting, subtlety in the craft of acting, and innovation in the craft of directing, you would be advised to look elsewhere. (Actually, the directing is much less bad than the script and the acting, which are pretty awful. Or maybe I should say that the cinematography is pretty good, because the directors did not get anything stellar out of the actors here.) Kurosawa this is not. Tsuburaya, perhaps.",

Apart of course from the lead character, who somehow battled one off with an axe. Yes, an axe!! I don't expect ultra realism in these type of films, but come on!! Then the ending, made absolutely no sense, apart from probably setting up a sequel for next year!! Avoid!!! No seriously, please give this a miss.

The story is interesting with just enough lack of any detail to keep it it engaging. It reminds me a lot of Cloverdale, without all of the suck-factor that movie had.

The script comprises bits lifted bodily from a host of other movies, and not very well.But there are other things to talk about, such as the characters being, without exception, stupid and irritating. There is the little matter of Eric Balfour's facial hair - his silly little moustache and tuft of chin beard making it a bit of a puzzle why no other stubble appears on his face through the duration of the movie.There's the ending of the film, which leaves you going \"Huh?\" The reason for the orange brain, and its effect, is something right out of the blue (please excuse the pun).Much of the movie is, frankly, rubbish.

What came up in my mind was, this one reminded me of Cloverfield. In fact, it's a bit of the same story, but the aliens here are shown early in the film. I really liked the beginning, the changing of the face, you really don't know what's going to happen. Expectations dropped a bit once the aliens landed. It missed the creepiness of Alien for example. The jump scene is of course the scene were the car drives out of the underground parking. What happens next, well, that you couldn't see coming. But then it's a bit too much of the same, escape hide fight, escape hide fight,...It is never explained why Jarrod (Eric Balfour) had those extreme powers with which he could defend himself against alien attacks. And why he is the only one to use it. The plot was a big surprise. I thought, well, they kiss each other and this will be the ending shot but then the movie goes on at the mother ship of the aliens. I don't know if I had missed something, the version I saw clock in at 84 minutes, IMDb says 94. It looks a bit strange that it would be cut due the lack of blood or gore.

I remember when 'Skyline' was released it being critically panned. I waited a while to see it on DVD and, when I did, I was pleasantly surprised.It's about a load of alien spaceships that rock up over Earth one day (yes, let's skip why no radar system actually detected their approach) and starts abducting the world's population en masse. Now, this is bad news for the average man on the street and even worse news if you're residing in a Los Angeles skyscraper, for this is where our plucky group of heroes is going to make their last stand.Okay, so they can hardly fight off a seemingly infinite number of spaceships, but they can possibly survive the destruction of mankind there. It's kind of a 'siege movie' where they play cat and mouse with one alien incursion after the next. And it's not that bad \u2013 well, not unless ask anyone apart from me apparently.Most people agree that the special effects are pretty impressive and the destruction is well done. I guess most people get annoyed by the characters. They do tend to do one very silly thing after the next and there are a couple of bits in the movie (no spoilers here) that don't really make that much sense if you think too hard about them.What you have here is a movie that feels like a particularly high-budget made-for-TV movie. If you think of it like that then you may just get something out of it. Perhaps the reason I like it is because I was aware of the general hatred of if before I sat down to watch it, therefore my expectations were suitably lowered.My girlfriend described it as 'Jurassic Park with aliens' \u2013 okay, there are some scenes where I can see where she's coming from.

What the hell did you expect to see when you sat down to watch a SCI-FI Movie???. People really need to stop using the (it's not realistic) Line about this movie because it's really stupid, it is without a doubt one of the dumbest things someone can say about a SCI-FI Movie!!! If people don't like Unrealistic movies then Don't watch Sci-Fi Movies! It's that simple!.For the people that say it's ridiculous and silly I will give them the same answer it's a SCI-FI movie! And most Sci-Fi movies do have ridiculous plots that are unbelievable and if you ask me that's what makes them exciting! If every Sci-Fi movie was simple then they would lack excitement and thrills and in my opinion not work, this movie, on the other hand, worked well and was Fast paced and very Entertaining!.If I did a List of A Top 50 Favourite Sci-Fi movies this movie would be on my List Easily and I'm not ashamed to admit that either. This is one of the most entertaining Sci-Fi movies I've ever seen, it may not be as good as Alien or Aliens but its still a very good movie and I highly enjoyed watching it.The only issue I have with this film is the characters, most of them were not likeable and I did not care about what happened to them.one guy was a cheater one girl was nasty and bossy and the other girl was a Bimbo who sleeps with her friends boyfriend, and as for the other guy I didn't even know his name or care to know about him.The only characters I liked were Jarrod, Elaine and Oliver who were played by Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson and David Zayas. those three characters were likeable for the most part and I liked them okay. I thought David Zayas was cool and Badass in the movie and he was fun to watch. I liked the relationship between Jarrod and Elaine I thought it was sweet and emotional especially their moments toward the end of the movie. I thought those characters were a good couple and I thought The acting from those two was actually pretty good. Eric Balfour and Scottie Thompson should have gotten best actor and actress nominations in my opinion and I think it sucks that they didn't because they were Great in their roles, the others were okay but those two were the stand out actors.The movie also has Great emotional music and it should have won an award for best music too but it didn't which I don't understand. The music was both emotional and hopeful and it had a nice feel to it and it fit the movie like a glove especially in the emotional scenes. I also really enjoyed the sound effects of the alien invasion scenes. The sound effects and music in those scenes were epic, and the movie had a really Fun War of the Worlds Feel to it and the movie was tense and thrilling from beginning to End. The most exciting scenes are definitely the roof Top scenes when all of the Aliens are attacking at once, and the military comes flying in on their jets and start firing Rockets at the Aliens.\nI also really enjoyed the powers that the Aliens had, I thought it was cool that they could control people whenever those people looked into their Blue Ship Lights.that's a cool idea that I've never seen in any other movie before.I also have to praise the Cinematography because it was Great, The movie was shot very well and it looks good and is visually stunning and nice to look at with top-notch effects. The story may not be original but who cares about originality if a movie Is exciting from beginning to End?. I had a Real blast watching this movie and I was not bored a single time.\nI thought The movie was well directed and I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the movie.How anyone can call this movie boring is beyond me? This Movie was Exciting as Hell! And I Loved Every minute of it! The Movie truly is Great and I Highly recommend it!.",

            "content": "What we have here folks is a sleeper. I didn't hear much about this film, and barely recall seeing the trailer for it. I finally sat down and watched Skyline. The bulk of the movie is a fairly conventional sci-fi film -- as compared to similar films of its type. The visual effects are solid, the acting is good, and the photography is nicely done. It has a definite sense of high visual quality to it. However, many other movies have boasted the same yet have failed in the task of presenting science fiction that really grips both the mind and the gut. This is where Skyline comes into play. What really makes this movie is the ending. Of course, I can't tell you what the ending is, since that would ruin the film for you. What I can tell you is that Skyline dares to do what few Hollywood films are willing to do. And for that, I salute the film makers. Bravo! So, where am I coming from when I say this? Well, let's just say that I've read a ton of science fiction and seen a massive amount of sci-fi TV and cinema. I typically seek out the really inventive stuff. You know, the kind of material you'd find in Heavy Metal magazine or the old Epic Illustrated series. This includes going way back and studying the classic material (1930s, 40s, 50s, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, etc...). Because of this, I often get the feeling that I've seen it all before and it's a rare occasion when someone actually does something bold or different.I'm happy to report that Skyline was a surprise... and a good one at that. Hang in there and watch it to the end. You won't be sorry.",

None of the characters have any purpose in this film. This \"movie\" is like 60 min long, its doesn't even have an ending, and barely a middle. Its like if a whole bunch of little kids gave you an idea for a movie on the spot and you put it all together, but you didn't have enough time to get the ending to the story, or the point of it and just decided to end.

I already had an idea of what the film was about and went in with a pre-conceived notion of where the film was going to go. Needless to say, it took me somewhere I didn't expect to go. I know lots of movie goers like their movies to hand them the plot with little to no thinking required, but this film requires alittle bit of thought. Sure, if you go in expecting for everything to be handed to you, you will feel like this movie is just a bunch of special effects. But, one word summerizes the plot for me, \"Evolution\". Sounds crazy, I know. But if we recount the so called problem in mans evolution having a missing link, and the line in \"Genesis\" where god says \"let us make man in our image\", then we start to get an idea of what the film makers are trying to tell us. Either way, if you are open to the message, then I think you will understand and enjoy this movie, as I did. If not, then it's just a pretty cool special effects, popcorn flick.",

I actually liked the fact that things weren't clich\u00e9d in the middle (and only in the middle). Like the gun shooting, and the door won't open. Car gets out, and they get stepped on right away. Even for the characters, they started to have more realistic and argumentative statements that involve BASIC LOGIC to it - before, they didn't. But yeah, they started to be that way, and I was excited that this movie could now go somewhere with this non-clich\u00e9d moments. Then, when things become more real and I go \"Ok so this movie is mixing sci-fi with realistic reactions that normal people would make, in the eyes of those normal people- this would create very interesting realistic taste to it with unrealistic aliens\", they just HAD to start crushing on that thought and introduce superpower and humans turning into monsters. Now THAT was very unpredictable. What kind of movie is this? What genre? By creating those super-nature concepts, the stupidity, laughable actions that could've been understood as attempt of illustrating realism just remains in stupidity and laughable actions.The main problem here is that they change the theme and genre so much that when the audiences try to think optimistically about the things they see, the director and writers step on it themselves and go, \"no it was simply our ignorance - nothing philosophical intended\"Alright fine. Why philosophical, when for the joy, right? But hey, if you're trying to be realistic, leave it at that. If you're trying to be cartoonish and totally sci fi, leave it at THAT. If you're trying to turn the character into a strong monster going against the monsters, start with that, not rolling the credit in the middle of it.Too many changes made me dislike it. It could've been great I think. That wraps it up.",

            "content": "Watched it right through with total attention. It was altogether one of the most fascinating alien invasion films I've seen for reasons I will explain...\"Skyline\" was tapping into the same source as the BBC's 2009 five hour production, \"Torchwood: Children of Earth\". (Which it must be said, had a great deal more dynamism in the scripting than \"Skyline\", ended with the survival of mankind while being a lot scarier.) But basically, it was the same alien menace presented just slightly differently.But this was not a copy. The production dates were too close together for that to be the case. So this is another case of two creative teams coming up with the same basic idea independent of one another. If you pay attention to film, books and TV, you'll notice that this kind of duplicate story, (and often triplicate, quadrupled and more), happens all the time, and when it does it is usually because the collective human subconscious is giving our arts communities a big tap on the shoulder. It's worth taking note when you see something like this, because there is always something important to be learned.Another interesting point about this film, and I've not seen it before in an alien film, (though you certainly do see it in other films, like \"The Mothman Prophecies\" which is basically connected to the exact same material as \"Skyline\", but with a lot less metaphor in between) was that the aliens were able to warp reality as a basic function of their existence. --This is very much like real UFO and paranormal encountersThose who study this stuff have learned that humans exist in a simpler mode of reality than aliens and the extra-density beings which feed on us. (The metaphor of eating our brains is pretty thudding, but basically accurate.) The final point which jumped out at me, and which fits well into what is known is that our DNA is mostly unexpressed, (more than 90% is dormant), and that when paradigm shifts happen between reality curtains and humans cross over, that DNA is expected to begin to express. Though we don't know how fast or how much or any of that. At least I don't.In any case, this film has a lot more truth to it than \"Independence Day\". Humans don't win in this battle. It's not even a battle. Corn cannot fight the farmer. It's the same kind of question.I can understand why this is very upsetting for people who like a fairytale \"We're okay\" ending. But those are silly and not terribly useful. This isn't something to be scared of. Remember; your soul is forever and the body is like a pair of shoes you wear until it has holes. Then you get another pair.This film did have its silly technical moments, like nukes not behaving like nukes, people not taking refuge smartly, and other tidbits, but frankly, those are forgivable. I've seen much dumber X-Files episodes, and that stupid show was very well loved. So I don't honestly think that people have problems with this film for technical reasons.Also, the beginning \"Get to know you\" phase of the film I thought was far more useful than others seem to think. -It established the fundamental superficiality of human culture. I also thought the acting was just fine. It was the characters who were shallow and lost. The least believable of them was the big security guard. But all the rest were just as one-dimensional and foolish as many people I've met. Sadly, there's really not much to the human race to cry over losing.The message of this film is: \"We are food.\"This is true, and so the question is this: \"What are you going to do to improve your soul in the time remaining?\"",

What we have here is a film that only contains two Acts; the final (second) Act is given to us only some minutes until the films final moments. Until then, we have only one plot less, pointless scenario of several friends holding-up within a luxury tower block dodging aliens who have a desire, and use, for the human brain.It seems all too bizarre that we have seen what can best be described as snippets from the sci-fi back catalogue. Without reason, and straight off and running, we are forced into the alien attack and witness the exploitation of the human race for the use of their brain. This is all too familiar with the H.G. Wells novel, the taking of the human race, War Of The Worlds. The Matrix comes into place, too, where the plot in both films here are films that are strangely similar, the use of the human brain/body for their own existence/survival. This too does not included the Matrix's Sentinel's making a guest appearance, amongst others.The whole thing is under the radar where the narrative is concerned, maybe its all one big metaphor for the taking of human minds and turning them into creatures that are forced to no longer represent who they originally represented, the loss of free will in a contemporary, mechanical, media-lead society perhaps. I don't buy this for one minute.Skyline leaves us empty and void of any simulation toward is (anti)climax, the whole affair seems to be blowing in the wind and its finding it hard to root, and grow, any depth of soul or even insight to the questions; What? Why? Who? Plus, just what WAS the point?",

Unfortunately, skyline falls into the very small category of which there is no redeeming qualities. We start off with watching strange blue lights descending down upon L.A. and one of the main characters seemingly going all darkside. Then, we skip back 15 hours (for no apparent reason other than to to make it last a little longer) and watch drivel about how some of the characters know each other and a little bit of pointless back story which leads up to before the flashback. We soon find out that aliens have invaded and are abducting people for some unknown reason. Yawn! This has been done a lot in Hollywood with quite a bit of success, independence day being the best one that pops to mind. Now, this might sound like it should work quite well for the film, but thanks to a crap script and crap acting it falls drastically short of bring any where even near watchable, let alone enjoyable. Over the course of the 40 minutes we see some predictable ideas of escape, all of which fail miserably, and the typical army retaliation, which fails even worse, all leading up to the main character taking a chance and trying to escape via the roof. Why go up to where there is no cover from the flying aliens I have no idea when going down didn't work I couldn't see the logic, but hey, thats just me. Now, there was potential along the line, but the writers didn't take full advantage of it. The aliens seem to be after our brains to give life to more aliens, which on paper sounds good but it just didn't work. So, why when the main couple get took on the alien mothership along with 99% of the rest of L.A. and the male lead gets his brain removed is he the only human alive to still be himself and not another mindless, genocidal alien and protect his girlfriend I don't know, and why for being in a completely different body all together is he instantly able to fight off every other alien is beyond me. To sum up, good potential, terrible delivery. If you wanna waste an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back, by all means watch it. Personally, I think I should have just watched independence day again. The only reason I gave the film 1 star was because 0 stars wasn't an option.",

Basically Jarrod (Eric Balfour) ans his pregnant girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) have travelled to Los Angeles to meet Terry (Donald Faison) his old successful entrepreneur friend and his wife Candice (Brittany Daniel). There is a party in their apartment and Jarrod gets a new job offer, and Terry meanwhile is having a fling with his assistant stroke lover Denise (Crystal Reed), and we see his friend Oliver (David Zayas) about too. Anyway, all of the sudden everyone is awoken by strange blue beams of light coming from outside, and when Ray (Neil Hopkins) stares into it his face is turned crusty, his eyes go a very light blue and he seems to have been taken over by an unknown force. Soon enough all the characters are on the run from these lights and the space crafts creating them, they are alien invaders attacking, taking over and swallowing human beings. The United States Air Force launch an attack against the extra-terrestrial forces, but all their attempts to bring them down are failing, they seem to be indestructible. In the end it looks like only one of the main characters is left alive, but the ending is a little questionable and rather open-ended, so maybe it is to be continued. Also starring J. Paul Boehmer as Colin and Tanya Newbould as Jen. The cast are all people you wouldn't recognise and don't really mind being killed off, so not much to say about them, the film is all about the special effects of course, but it is nothing original with its blend of Cloverfield, District 9 and of course Independence Day material, but I guess you can watch this science-fiction thriller at least once.

            "content": "Don't listen to what you hear. I think what the 'critic's have taken from this and gave it four stars and two stars and such is the fact that main sci-fi movies that have hit theaters, everything is explained everything seems 'plausible.' They expect this movie to be written in a way that what happens, should happen, could happen, because it works in the world we live in and in our physical minds, leave everyday logic at home. Complaints hit about the aliens design looking like other aliens but changed or how it's like independence day...seriously? Film is all about being inspired by other films and making it your own, so you can't be mad over things like that. Stealing is what film makers do, it's about seeing the connection and then seeing the film on it's own. One of the best parts about this film is the WHY now that I think about it, I had so many questions at the end of it...it's what made it so engrossing! If you like alien films with a spin on it, this is your film. It's smart, the idea is so smart... I couldn't stop thinking about it. If you're logical and closed minded skip it you'll hate it. But I'm waiting in anticipation of the sequel.The 'odd happenings' begin, and the idea is solid! I love it. The greatness in the thousands of people rising from the earth and being sucked up into the ship! Yesss... However, some of the lines are a little poorly written. Cheesy even\u0085weightless. And they cast those darn, who are just thrown in to die and we all know it characters. The character is so weak and overly confident that we know they're either first or next to follow. I hate useless characters. Waste of my time, screen time, the actor's time,and paper time. Never waste space when you make a film and never waste a character creation, it's disrespectful\u0085insulting and takes away from a potentially great film.But what stands out is the lead man (Eric Balfour)and his female companion (Scottie Thompson)(who really could have used more stacking as a personality, as she could have been even more amazing). The two of them had this great communication and a fantastic love, that even I couldn't joke about. Usually it's easy. But these two actors just live it so well on screen, just a great pairing overall.Now to get to the main part of this critique is that the film takes about 35 minutes to get good. And about 50 to get...maybe even great! As for the first half you're following a handful of characters, and the two guys who just have some great friend relationship, but there isn't enough between the actors or characters for you to really care, but you know they have a relationship. Another highlight was David Zayas as Oliver. Solid actor, great character that truly added to the film and a great combo with Eric and Scottie. But man, once you get through those 35 minutes or so, you're flipping shocked, and sitting on the edge of your seat in amazement as the film takes a turn you did not expect. Eric Balfour's character Jarrod turns into something better than a hero and Scottie's character is suddenly stronger than we expected. I have to give it a few extra points for making the character Jarrod with the well known 'chosen' one role without us continually hearing 'he's the chosen' one, really well done story wise. Even sneaking in themes of family, staying together and the love for ones family being a force to be reckoned with. The constant danger, that actually FEELS constant, as most films you lose that feeling of danger being near because the characters having some love/motivational speech and the film 'slows,' when the base of the film is 'action' slowing down mid way sucks for us viewers. Personally for the first time, the war doesn't feel 'easy' as running, jumping over things, setting off explosions and screaming and shooting with your guns a blazing with a bullet in your shoulder, doesn't happen as they realize it doesn't work...finally, something different!! I'd say more, but I kinda just hope you watch, you can hate me for making you watch it or thank me as I truly think it's great visually for what they were working with and lead character wise, and actor performance wise for a few of them.I was going to vote 7. but then after hearing it being slammed, it deserves so much more than that. So out of respect from one filmmaker to a full crew, it's an 8.",

Who can forget Bill Pullman's inspiring presidential speech about sovereignty in 1996's Independence Day? Who didn't laugh at how the aliens comically exploded whenever they heard the song \"Indian Love Call\" in 1996's Mars Attacks!? And which guy didn't want to be uber cool agents in 1997's Men in Black? My older fellow movie lovers would mention titles like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and The War of the Worlds (1953) and The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), but those classics are of a different league altogether.Then came the invasion of technology, an era where it seemed that the only right thing to do in movie-making is to create some grotesque alien creature which oozes slime and are indefinitely invincible (how else would you guarantee a money grubbing sequel?) So here we are, in the 21st century, an age which churns out one alien movie after another.Here we have the Brothers Strause who has decided to make a science fiction movie about the human race having to face a mysterious extraterrestrial force which descends on Earth. Nothing much is explained here, except that there are occurrences of blue lights drawing people into a flame. What will happen to the human population? What will become of the planet which humans have called home for thousands of years? And most importantly, what will audiences feel once the end credits roll?Here's one word that describes what this reviewer felt: Dumb.So dumb is this movie that this reviewer wonders why any individual would want to be involved in it. So dumb is this movie that this reviewer marvels at the courage of the studio which decided to distribute it worldwide. So dumb is this movie that he begins to lose faith in the once exhilarating genre which once provoked thoughts of liberty and freedom in his mind.From the get go of this 97 minute disposable flick, there is little to care about for its characters. As if showing no empathy is not bad enough, you may end up loathing the shallowly written personalities who are so one dimensioned and predictable, you feel more satisfaction reading a cookbook. Relatively unknowns headline this unnecessary feature film: From the uncharismatic male protagonists played by Eric Balfour and Donald Faison to the unlikeable female protagonists played by Scottie Thompson and Brittany Daniel, you feel that these are people you want to avoid at parties and social gatherings.Maybe it is the filmmakers' idea to have the spotlight on the alien creatures, which may appear colossal and overpowering at first, but eventually leaving no lasting impression. Having worked as special effects artists, brothers Greg and Colin (the duo who gave you the brainless Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem) do not have anything else on their agenda except to make some quick bucks with the computer wizardry which has becoming increasingly exploited. You'd walk away numbed by the loud noises and unnecessary gimmicks as the movie ends.Yes, the movie does end.

I'm usually a firm believer in \"one man's trash is another's treasure\" so if I don't like a movie, it doesn't mean that I can't fathom how others can like it. This movie is the exception to that rule. The movie was so bad that after voicing our opinions to the manager he gave us tickets to see another movie without even questioning us! He had told us that he had been hearing complaints all night and just started giving people vouchers for free movies because he felt bad, and it wasn't even his fault! Let's look at why the movie was as bad as it was: Plot: What plot? Aliens invade, start sucking people up in huge ships, then start hunting down survivors and eating their brains. Why? Wish I knew, wish they would have explained it! It got the the point where I hoped the characters would just be caught so the movie would end so I could go home, and then, just when you think it's over, it keeps going! and just when you think \"ok, maybe there will be some kind of conclusion here\" the movie does end, and you're left wondering \"what was that and why did I just waste my money and time on it?\" Characters: I'm not one who believes that just because the actors aren't well known the movie can't be good, B rate actors can make good movies, this isn't one of them. There is no character development, one of the main characters is obviously pregnant but they hold the announcement until the middle of the movie to try and make it a surprise, and to try t o build up some kind of compassion for her, but it was too little too late. The main character for whatever odd reason is special, even though you never find out why, or how, or what the point is. He, for all intents and purposes, is a deadbeat, why is he so special? How does he incapacitate one of the indestructible aliens with his fists? Too many questions left unanswered.Aliens: There are many alien movies out there, and as bad as some of them are, they are all better than this one. The special effects where good, and the aliens themselves were intimidating, especially when the nuked spaceship comes back to life, but there's no point to what they're doing. The movie revolves heavily around the aliens trying to get the main group of characters, why are these 5 people so important to them? Another question left unanswered.Conclusion: Like stated above, just when you think the movie is over, it continues for another 5 minutes, with the main characters brain being eaten and absorbed by an alien and then he assumes control of said alien, how? Why? It doesn't make any sense.I strongly suggest that you do not watch this. If you are intent on watching it do yourself the favor and watch it online, and don't pay for it, so this way there's no money wasted on this disappointment.

            "content": "So, the best scene of this movie is when a group of Predator Drones are sent to destroy the alien mother ship. Visualize this; the drones are fighting through a volley of alien ships attacking them, trying to get close enough to launch an attack against the mother ship. Then, there is one drone left. It is wounded, one wing is shot off, and just when it seems all is lost.....it launches a nuclear missile, right after it is hit and destroyed by an alien ship. The missile soars through the air and hits the mother ship. A massive nuclear explosion ensues. It's spectacular. It looks good, even for a movie with a rather small budget. Most of all, it's convincing. The alien ship is destroyed. The celebration begins, the survivors start celebrating and then...roll the credits? No...the aliens aren't destroyed by the nuclear explosion and the movie keeps going. It becomes unrealistic and, uh, extremely non-entertaining. To put it in layman's terms....the movie turns to crap. The drone attack was one of the best scenes in recent cinematic, si-fi history. But then, it made the mistake of plodding forward after it had....pardon the expression...blown it's load. End the movie right there? It becomes an instant classic. Keep going? It ruins everything. So, how do you judge this movie? Well, it ruined itself, for lack of a more nice way to put it. So, what is my best advice to anyone reading this? Watch it up to the drone attack, then turn it off and it ends there. You'll remember this as a great movie. If you keep watching, you'll be dissappointed and remember this as a bad movie.",

We don't have a ace pilot or elitist hacker we don't have a superhero to fix it all, we be in trouble if something more advanced than us comes to play.To me this makes it an awesome film and strangely I found the rest of the people in the cinema of the same mind as soon as the film finished people I didn't know started discussing it as a bit of fresh air.If you like your films like independence day or Armageddon or any film where humankind are groomed and praised where a prayer to the gods or a speech by the president saves the day then you probably won't like this movie.I look forward to seeing skyline 2",

I do know what a lot of reviewers were harping about, that the aliens came to L.A. and there was basically just a yuppie quintet being focused on. I'm guessing the black guy who lived in the penthouse condo was a rap producer. My friend thought he was a dealer of stolen art, but who knows?I also could see a lot of reviewers complaining that the interpersonal dramas between the characters were forced. They're probably right; still, it probably would've been overkill to have to sit through 90 minutes of relentless action. Sure, it would've been nice to see what steps the government was planning - we did see our soldiers fighting back - so I guess SOME planning had to have been involved.I gave this movie a 7 because I think it's worth watching. My friend has a Logitech 5.1 sound system in his living room, and that makes a big difference, too. I did think a lot of the namby-pamby whiny whiny acting could've been shelved, but given the circumstances, it was excusable.Clearly, a lot of money was poured into the special effects and sound design. If anything, those elements alone would've been worth the price of admission. What did I root for? The ending. It was nice to see a Hollywood film end in a tragedy for a change.

Chuck out the corny plot lines and horrible acting and Independence Day would have been hard to beat as alien invasion movies go, but there wouldn't have been much left of it either. What Skyline seemed to promise was more hard-core and less hard-corn.And after a fashion, that's what it delivered. But that's ALL it delivered. It tripped through the first act, jerked through a slow-moving second act that unfolded mostly out of a dim high- rise apartment filled with people we really don't care that much about, and stopped without a third act at all.That's right, the movie doesn't end, it just stops. Just when it was getting interesting, too. It's as if they ran out of time and money and just cut it right in front of the climax and rolled credits. Of course that's not what happened. What happened was they wrote a crippled script and tried to execute a good movie out of it. That never works, by the way.I'll save you the suspense, the aliens in Skyline are NOT friendly. But they aren't original either. Yes they steal your brain, and they do so in not-so-sterile ways, which is visually appealing to the modern gore-thirsty market, but this seems like an excuse to kill people in a violent (and hopefully scary) way. (In writing, that's called \"contrived.\") I saw no real reason why they need to install human brains. I thought maybe the plot was going to twist at the end: like maybe these aliens were actually trying to \"upgrade\" the human race so that they could survive. But no. It seems the script could have used the brains the aliens were stealing.Skyline offers no explanation as to the motives of its E.T.s. It appears to be selfish. We assume it has something to do with human brain hunting, and we can guess it has something to do with controlling their vehicles (or bodies, which seem to be one and the same), but that's just a guess. Clearly it doesn't matter to the storytellers, because their purpose is to create a dreadful, ghastly situation and throw some humans into it to create conflict. All that being said, I like the aliens in Skyline, and their ships, and their walking machines, and their brain-stealing. I'm not so crazy about the people they are killing because they weren't empathetic enough. (A few lessons from Spielberg might have helped.) But if the movie had a better ending, or even a \"to be continued\" so that I understood I just saw a chapter and not the entire epic, I'd have rated it a few stars higher. But the way it ended just angered me, so 6 out of 10 is the extent of my generosity.",

What's really important here is that we have suspense, mystery, and action rolled into a package without trying to explain away too much.If you like science fiction, you will really like this movie. And I'm talking real (District 9) science fiction (not Avatar), you will enjoy this movie. It's a low budget keeper that with moderate success might just build a little franchise unto itself.

It begins in the present, flashes back and builds the characters (somewhat) then flashes back to the present. Inane dialog leads into some really interesting scenes and just as you are getting into it and starting to like it, the end! I'm truly sorry I wasted my money. Despite the rather cheesy dialog and some slight romantic conflagrations, I was really getting into it and liking it; really great CGI, scary stuff. The aliens were unstoppable despite being blown up/set on fire/exploded; they could rebuild themselves. They were feeding off the population of LA, (and later, New York; you got the idea they were all over the place) pulling people's brains out of their heads. In fact, the aliens could plop human brains into their heads and use them! So, this couple in love, expecting a baby, finally got pulled into one of the aliens and at the end found themselves on the slimed floor waiting to get their brains sucked. The guy goes first. He's such a hero that when his brain lands in the alien's head, he does battle and mentally takes over the alien. His girlfriend recognizes him when he touches her cheek in a familiar gesture with his new alien hand. You think, well, he's going to defeat them from within, like an inside job, or a spy? But then the movie just ends!!! I thought sure the earth would end up being destroyed and this couple would be left on earth, after everyone else had been eaten, existing as half alien and half human (because they looked at the light! - and got turned, not into a pillar of salt, but a white-eyed, veiny half-monster) and they'd have the baby and the earth would be re-populated with some sort of hybrid.

The ending is an insult to intelligence---aliens come to harvest \"brains\". That concept is ridiculous--if they came to harvest food then it would be more acceptable. These aliens take every single human being for their brains---they use their brains as a replacement for old brains---they seem to use the brains up fast since they harvest the next person right away---so that would make you think that human brains last a short time--so in theory they would die off in four days after using all of the world's brains.

The acting is adequate, the effects are great without going over the top, and the minimalist plot works just fine in this context for me. There are some glaring plot holes that could have been addressed, though maybe we will get further answers from a sequel (hopefully).**spoilers** One thing that many people found lacking was the ending. The last minutes of Skyline seemed like a different movie that had been spliced in by mistake. While quite jarring, the ending sets up a sequel that would be as different as the first Star Trek movie was compared to Wrath Of Khan. The question is, what actually happened in the end?What many people seem to miss is that Jarrod didn't overcome the alien creature his brain was put into because of his love for Elaine. If love were all it took, there would surely be many such rebel alien creatures running around like Jarrod. Instead, pay close attention to the clues being given throughout the movie; namely, that Jarrod has received the most exposure to the light and it's affecting him. While Elaine got a dose of the light and she has the black veins in her skin to a degree, Jarrod has them all over. What's more, as time goes on they grow more flush when he gets upset and somehow contribute to his strength when he confronts Oliver, and later when he fights the alien solider on the roof. What we're seeing is Jarrod maintaining control over his infection. He remarks at one point how he \"still feels powerful\" after his exposure to the light, and after telling Oliver he's leaving, he tells Elaine that \"it's still me.\", even though he looks infected. So in the end scene, Jarrod manages to retain control over his mind even after being embedded into the alien creature, which he then takes control of physically and goes off to protect Elaine. See?Admittedly this raises some serious questions too, but at least by paying close attention we can figure out what it is we saw happen and why. As endings go I think it was a stretch, but it did leave me thinking \"Okay, now tell me THAT story!\"",

PLEASE don't bother making one! Avoid at the cinema. Buy the DVD if you want... it'll make a nice coaster for your beer!",

            "content": "The only cons in this movie (compared to other Sci-fi) is that it's a bit short (could have been around 100 min.), the explosion scenes could have been more detailed, better done and sometimes the hand-held camera filming seemed a bit too amateurish. Considering that this is not your casual Hollywood macho movie about super humans who always find a way how to deal with matters when space monsters, alien ships and other space beings howl the Earth (indeed a heroism at certain amounts persists) as in 2012, Independence Day etc. then I could easily forgive this movie those very minor things it lacks (the cons I mentioned). Now to the good things. First of all (which I would like to see in this type of genre) the human reaction, psychology. Going along with the characters I would assess that most human beings would have very similar reaction to the occurring events as the characters had (I just tried to put myself into that condition). I assume more panicking and irrationality could be observed but otherwise it's quite close. Second - the ending. I so hoped this will not be another Adventure type of ending where the good guys (humans) outwit the superior aliens with some random and very naive methods to win the grand finale. I was too pragmatic before I saw the last ten minutes of the film and still it ended on an awesome note. Not the way one usually expects it to end when watching alien or sci-fi movies.I did not write a lot in this review (and I admit that's it quite messy in layout) as there's not that much to write. My advice - do not listen to critics and other people who told you that this movie is not worth spending your time. I am a person who likes very exceptional sci-fi movies. Even if I do I seek some realism in character reaction, behavior (the part where ''2012'' was disastrous). I was very, very skeptical before even considering to watch this film. Apparently I was completely wrong. Though I know most of you have heard such inducing texts as well but I want to remind you - at times try to act not according to your expectations. If your mind and heart says that it's not worth the while then do the contrary - watch it for a change and see proof that your intuition and mind is wrong at times.",

            "content": "Whenever I want to see a new movie, I always check the IMDb rating. In the last weeks the rating for this movie was under a 6.0 (my personal borderline beneath which I see no hope). But the name of the movie and the poster attracted and I decided to give it a try. I am happy to say that my hunch was right and the movie turned out to be more than OK. It first looks like this movie is an adaptation of some other \"Big Battle for Earth\" movies. It does fit the genre but this one has its own personal air with lots of ups and downs. For some while there seems to be hope for the protagonists, but we then swallow some bitter pills and this really makes you get into a movie, where you start thinking \"if I were in their places, I would do this or that...\" and these thoughts are signs of a good movie.Let us not forget, movies are simply entertainment and they should not always be stupefying philosophical gems where you learn some lessons for life. This movie is perhaps not a \"lessons for life\" movie. It is a great dramatic science-fiction and it has certainly done a better job than 'Independence Day' for instance where shallow patriotism is a recurrent theme. This movie has less patriotism, thus a more international appeal and a high-intelligent and dark alien invasion aspect.What really got me was the extremely harsh and cold treatment of human beings and a brilliant technique to lure humans. It had something eerie like a great death-camp where sheep are just thrown hard and cold and they are just used for their parts, which always surprises me as we human beings always tend to be define 'alien' as evil. That is why I really linked it up with 'Predator' another favorite.I enjoyed this movie, perhaps it was because I had more than some pessimism a priori and no expectations that this movie would turn to be something. The actors did a decent job but their personalities were overshadowed by the always unexpected and incredible alien invasion. The graphics were quite excellent, someone really put an effort in this. I would certainly recommend this movie if you like dramatic science-fiction, but ready some popcorn, I forgot mine because of the low rating beforehand, you will definitely enjoy it. I gave it a 10, because as a science-fiction fan I normally have to wait a year or so for a decent science-fiction film.",

Some of which was OK. But it just doesn't go anywhere.

            "content": "I think people went expecting to see Independence Day. Frankly, this is a thoughtful, creative somewhat Lovecraftian look at what ordinary people would do during an alien invasion. And as for all the \"it didn't explain anything\" complaints, it's a movie about unknowable creatures who invade the Earth. Other complaints arose because the movie gave a serious nod to realism. I'll answer a few questions and address some complaints I've read: \"What was with the veins in the light?\" The veins were some type of mutative effect caused by the light, and/or blood being drawn to the surface by the light's tractor beam effect. Made sense to me, frankly.\"He killed an alien with an axe, how lame!\" The aliens were living creatures, not invulnerable monsters. Jerad was mutated by the light and as such had increased strength and mental powers when he killed it. Oh, and he used his bare hands actually.\"They eat brains? How stupid!\" Brain tissue is very specialized; for all we know they're using nerve tissue in their reproductive or computing technology. Frankly, we don't KNOW what they do with the brains, maybe the aliens need niacin. Why do we have to know; isn't the horror of the unknown enough?\"It didn't understand what the aliens were doing! Why didn't the movie explain anything?\" Hello, they're ALIENS! They don't have to explain anything to you. Real alien invaders wouldn't and again, this is a movie about ordinary folks encountering alien life in a realistic way. As well, it was already understood going in that this was the first of 3 movies.\"I hated the characters; they were unlikable. They had no backstory.\" I don't see that. They stuck together, defended each other best they could. They even loved each other and refused to abandon their friends. I think they were good and bad, just like us. As well, we learned enough about them to establish the relationships they had with each other before all heck broke loose; that was enough.\"Why did the aliens spare the pregnant lady? So stupid!\" I don't understand your complaint. They seemed ready to dissect her out of curiosity due to her condition. Or perhaps infant brains are a delicacy or they want to start a breeding program. Maybe they have religious objections to killing pregnant people. They're ALIENS! \"They ripped off the Matrix/War of the Worlds etc.\" Frankly, other than a few tentacles, these aliens are far more interesting and inspired than the silly robots in the Matrix. And just how much can you do with an alien invasion story? This one was told in a very unique fashion and creatively.\"Why didn't they move to another apartment when the blinds fell?\" Familiarity grants courage; would you abandon your home for lack of a few blinds in a crisis? \"The acting and script was awful!\" I don't see it. The acting and the script was sparse and bleak; as intended.\"The nuke didn't behave correctly! Why didn't it blind him?\" Actually, it seems they used a 5-10 KT nuke, not a city-buster. And for all we know the bomb exploded on the other side of the ship and he didn't get a full exposure. It's a movie! I suspect you get the idea by now. Please see this movie and bring your own brain for easy removal. Appreciate that they were going for sparse, bleak, frightening themes here; not some feel good thrill-ride. Enjoy the special effects, the emotion the movie invokes, and the creative ideas. Then make an account and give it a good review; hard work deserves credit.Thank you all for reading.",

            "review_title": "Brilliant - Don't pay attention to the negative reviews",
            "content": "Apparently the producers of this movie didn't pay off the right people, hence the negative reviews. Anyone who gives this movie less than three/four stars obviously didn't see the movie. I've been wanting to rent Skyline for months now but every time I read all the negative reviews I chose to watch something else. I'm glad I finally gave in to my better judgment because it was one of those SciFi flicks that doesn't disappoint. It had everything: good acting, great script, suspense, excellent special effects, and lots of action; and was immensely entertaining. If you've seen my other reviews, you know I'm a very tough critic, so if I give a movie 10 stars then it's worth watching.Perhaps so many of the negative reviews were because the movie (for the most part) stayed scientifically accurate and real to life sometimes the hero doesn't come riding in on a white horse. Of course, like most Scifi the only movie that's 100% based on true science is 2001 a Space Odyssey. However, this movie came closer than most, which made the terror all the more real. (SPOILERS COMING) I liked that the military response was with a strategic nuke and drones, which makes sense since the blue light seems to render people harmless. Even the mother ship rebuilding itself is technically possible with advanced technology (the sum of all the parts can be reconstructed to make the whole). Where the movie strayed was the fact that if an SUV can temporarily disable one of these life forms than a strategic nuclear weapon should have completely vaporized the mother ship to the molecular level - making it virtually impossible to rebuild; and any biologically based life inside would also have been vaporized. The shock wave would have also shattered the windows and done far more damage than was shown. Also, the TV and Internet went completely out but they were still able to pull power from the grid and cell sites were still operational. If the impact of the attack took out TV and Internet then a total blackout would have ensured. Lastly, the military wouldn't use drones for a first strike and follow that up with live troops, especially if the drone strike was unsuccessful. Finally, the preview makes note of comments from Stephen Hawking, first saying he's one of the most successful physicists, which isn't true. While Hawking is one of the most famous physicists he is basically considered a failure in the world of Physics as most of his postulates have been minor or dis-proved. They also make note of a quote where he said an alien visitation may be to us like it was for native Americans when Columbus came to the new world. Keep in mind that the native Americans befriended Columbus, which was their downfall. Even without his advanced technology, they could have easily overcome his small little landing party. Also, total occupation has never been achieved through technology alone especially when the entire populous rises against the occupants (which was the case in this movie). I'm only adding these criticisms because I liked the movie so much that it got me thinking. The ending was a little disappointing as I think it would have been better if they just ended it five minutes earlier when the two main characters were being levitated into the mother ship. Overall, this is one of the best SciFi movies I've every watched.",

They spent $500k filming this and the rest of a low budget on special effects (some of which were adequate). In any case, I'll be boycotting Universal Pictures for a few months, as well as the producers/directors (Colin and Greg Strause) and writers (Joshua Cordes and Liam O'Donnell) permanently.

With the advent of CGI, it became apparent that for the majority of sci-fi movies, character building moments were being increasingly displaced by Crash-Boom-Wallop moments (eg; 2012, Terminator Salvation - movies with potential, but their characters stories were buried beneath special effects).Unfortunately Skyline IS quite weak in the character department, but the story is paced nicely to keep the viewer interested. And, perhaps most importantly, the special effects are in no way overdone to the detriment of the experience. The CGI team have done a great job with their relatively low budget, and when the movie turns up the action it does not disappoint. Skyline is directed in such a way that we feel like the folks in the apartment building; we are sitting on the edge of an epic moment in human history, but we're afraid to look out the window. Yet when the action does come, it is in proportion to the whole story. I was impressed by the director's vision of this particular alien invasion. It's not your typical \"let's nuke 'em\" action clich\u00e9, nor is it the suspenseful \"let's sneak through a ruined city\" stereotype. It's something different. Which is exactly what the genre needs. While Skyline is not perfect in some ways (mainly the script) it's a great attempt and well worth watching.

Of course, the movie does have its flaws and inadequacies, but overall it is nowhere near the \"worst sci-fi movie ever\". Firstly, I'll point out what I disliked about Skyline. - The female characters. Incredibly annoying, especially Jarrod's pregnant girlfriend Elaine, who spends the whole movie putting on a \"I have just seen a ghost/I have just pooped in my pants\" face and complaining about everything, making herself a very irritating presence. In fact, I felt a bit disappointed that she survived at the end. Moreover, the lady that the main characters meet in the underground car park during their failed escape attempt. All she does is scream and panic, and as you watch you just wish she gets brutally killed as soon as possible. It's worth noting that the reactions presented by the women in this movie could be giving an idea of what their reaction would be had the aliens invaded earth in REAL life. Either way, they're annoying. - I can understand that we live in a world full of amazing technologies and such, but the fact that Terry (played by Donald Faison) has some sort of camera that can view ANYTHING is beyond any reason. I didn't notice it in the scene where they're watching some guys in a different apartment, but in the scene where the stealth bomber is flying towards the alien spacecraft, and the characters are in the house watching all this happen. Was there some sort of cameraman that recorded anything the people wanted to watch? Please, this was just bizarre. - One last thing was at the beginning of the movie, when Terry seemed to suggest to Jarrod that he should move to New York, and upon hearing this Elaine suddenly ran off and started crying (???). Weird stuff.Anyway, putting those aside, I enjoyed the special effects and the design of the aliens (even if it was copied - I haven't actually seen Matrix). The whole Hollywood idea of \"aliens attacking earth and killing humans\" was exercised fairly well and the movie does its job. Perhaps a downside is that we are only shown the events from one apartment (and with the locations shown in the movie, I don't see why other places couldn't have been involved), so the scale is very small.This isn't a masterpiece, there are many other MUCH better science fiction movies than Skyline, but it isn't tragic either.

But sadly one can argue that its the lack of stretch of imagination that hinders it. The aliens unfortunately are pretty much ala war of the worlds - which is not to say that most aren't these days really - I guess there's only a few kinds of 'scary' aliens - little big headed 'Greenies' (abductors), big big limbed 'Greenies' (Cloverfield etc), tentacled pseudo robots (Matrix etc), humanoid(Star Trek, Avatar etc), half decent humanoid (Predator) and totally perfect (Aliens). If you're not going for children (and often if you are) the vogue is for big limbs and or tentacles these days. Which is a shame - because Predator was half decent for a fleshy bid and Alien fully decent and even the terminator (for a non alien) rocked.As you can probably guess The skyline guys went for the Matrix style - which is a damn shame really - a few uglies on hover bikes or something could have done the same job and probably been a little scarier to boot.The plot is actually pretty damn good given the limited locations - sure the script has a couple of weak/cheesy moments - the execution of most of the alien effects, despite the poor choice of Xenodigm (tm), was actually damn good and on par with the best of the block busters.I'm looking forward to the net outing by these guys - whether it's with a big blockbuster director and script writer or just a slightly more rigorous effort along these lines - it'll be good (this was really a 6 but hey I gave it a 7 because I think it deserves a better rating than we've given it)",

I've heard complaints about the dialog, but honestly, I thought it was well written, realistic, dialog. The acting was pretty good too. I also liked how the humans really never had a chance. These aliens have probably done this sort of thing thousands of times before. Everything the aliens did was streamlined and the human race was just meat for the grinder. They should of run with that theme: pure hopelessness. But what Hollywood studio would let that fly? I think the main complaint people have with this film is the plot. It was a beautifully simple plot that they muddled up in the end. Also, the film had plenty of golden opportunities to latch on to certain themes and run with it: helplessness, teamwork, chaos vs order, and the afore mentioned utter hopelessness in the face of certain doom. Instead, they let these moments go and just fed us more special effects. The mother-ship scenes showed promise, but then they introduced some ludicrous plot twist in the final seconds.Still, I've seen worse... a lot worse. (Battlefield Earth, just about anything by M. Night Shyamalan) The film was actually fun. I'd see it again if it was the Sunday morning flick and I felt like being lazy.You know, if the producers of the film had involved the indie sci-fi blogs more, this film would probably be considered B-Movie gold instead of comic-book-guy's \"worst picture ever\" label. I think the criticism of this film says more about the importance of good buzz than anything else.See it if you've got nothing else to do and you like sci-fi. Watch it alone. It will be a guilty pleasure.",

Granted, it has it's flaws and it certainly isn't award winning script and cast-wise, but i sure as hell enjoyed myself with the designs and overall storyline. Like many before me already noted this isn't your typical Hollywood movie in which we as humans will ultimately prevail over our much stronger alien attackers. This time we get completely annihilated and there isn't a damn thing we can do about it. It also seemed much more realistic to me that way. We arn't talking about a bunch of survivors turned saviors of the human race by given circumstances, we're talking about normal people here who don't have a clue on what to do when the proverbial crap suddenly hits the fan. And i know that's boring to watch but seeing them struggle to survive the ongoing alien onslaught even though there is no chance on earth they'll escape it was certainly exciting enough to watch for me.I personally liked the aliens too, especially the brain sucking part. They're like space zombies, with a huge desire for human brains. At some point the resurrection thing did become somewhat of an anti climax though because you still want to see 'us' scoring a few points too before the timer runs out and we inevitably accept defeat, but than again it was fun to get the feeling there was still hope of winning by just nuking the mother ship and seeing it crash and burn only to see it repair itself and going back up again the next moment. But i do think they could have at least beat the crap out of an alien who was down by smooshing it's brain or something. Anyhow, i like this kind of doomsday writing once in a while, it is certainly refreshing for a change. The ending wasn't necessary though, too far fetched, but no matter, it certainly was enjoyable overall.",

            "content": "What can I say is 9 for the trailer and 4 for the movie. I have to give the intriguing trailer a big round of applause. If you have seen the trailer before, I can guarantee that you will be so bloody curious to watch the movie itself (exactly what happened to \"Clash of The Titans\" earlier thiz year). They edited the trailer so well. But the fact is something so wrong is going on. Next thing I can say is A-Class Special Effects collides with C-Class Actors. The movie is directed by Special Effects experts, Colin and Greg Strause who also directed \"AVPR: Aliens VS. Predator-Requiem\" (2007). The premise is mysterious at the beginning, one night at 4:27 AM blue strange beams appear on the City of Los Angeles. It is the first initial of the extraterrestrial invasion. The storyline only follows one point of view (just like \"Cloverfield\" in 2008). The movie is focus on a group of people. They are Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, Donald Faison, David Zayas and others. There is a scene that I think it is a rip-off from \"War of the Worlds\" (2005), when Terry meets a stranger and then a group of aliens sneak around to hunt them with its long and creepy tentacles. The last thing I can say is the sky is wreck and the line is flat. Approaching the end of the movie, the story-telling becomes more and more poignantly absurd. For example (Spoiler Alert!), the octopus look-alike alien which could chase and destroy jet aircraft and even sophisticated Stealth fighter jet, can be easily defeated only by an ax! Strause brothers are really getting into on my nerves, while they underestimate our intelligence with their absurd story. Unfortunately, there are several of them. However, there is something that you may not realize. Everyone and most critics think that thiz movie is a monstrous failure, but what you might do not realize that thiz movie was only made by $10 million budget. The fact is they make some real money here. The tagline on thiz movie is \"Don't look up\", well, don't even look at the film itself. Next time if aliens invade the theaters like thiz again, I will rather go home and sleep on my bed. Don't waste 92 minutes of your life!

Not in the way the aliens might look or behave, but how superior they really might be compared to us, how inferior and hopeless we'd feel.It follows ordinary people, no heroes, who try to figure out what happens and find a way if even possible to avoid what seems to be inevitable.I'd give this one a 6.5, which it deserves.

Ending was the worst of all. Jerrod brain was the only one to resist out of all the humans on the planet. I guess the rest of us had nothing to fight for or to care about. Also The military was shown in a poor light as well, one and only one attempt to take out the invaders with a nuke. Speaking of Nukes, I realize the nuke used was a tactical one, but come on, A Hi-rise building still standing with minimal damage at that range. Not likely.

But there's so much to marvel at. First of all the fact this film was made on a \u00a310m budget is almost unbelievable. The SFX are as good as you will see in any blockbuster. How they did it, I'll never know.There's some genuinely thrilling set pieces too. There's a short into to the characters and then boom, the action starts. The feel of genuine threat is constant throughout the film and you can really immerse yourself in it, wondering what you would do.I gave this film an 8 but I could understand people going lower (or higher). But anything less that a 6.5 is just baffling.In short - Amazing SFX, short running time, great action, fast pace, cheesy script, wooden acting.",

            "content": "Skyline: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564585/This \"film\" should have been titled \"Running around in my hotel room while Aliens suck the intelligence out of LA\". It really should have been a direct to VHS release.I normally do not allow spoilers to exist in any of my reviews, however in this case, since I don't think the Strause brothers should receive any more money from this \"film\" I will spoil the hell out of it, in hopes of ruining it for you so you won't pay to see it. Opening scene, Aliens come down and start their \"sucking\". The main character \"looks into the light\" and the \"sucking\" process starts; no pun. Suddenly, a cut scene and we read a caption that says \"15 hours earlier\". For the next 20 minutes we get to meet the characters. This is where an average screenwriter / director, starts to develop their characters for their paying audience, called \"character development\". This is where you're supposed to like these characters, so when they start dying off, you sit in a theater and \"feel bad\" for them. Well, they just couldn't start dying quickly enough, as you don't like any of them. Speaking of dying quickly, surely the highest paid actor and the best talent in the film, Donald Faison http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0265668/ who played Terry, was the first to go. I'm sure it was for budget reasons. So on to the story. While these characters are hiding in their hotel room and the Aliens are outside sucking, they discover that the Aliens are never over water. So they have an idea to try to make a run for it to the dock to get on a boat and sail away. This is what I called the first plot point; film peeps (not including the makers of this film) should know what that means. So now I'm looking forward to see how they make a run for it to the dock and get da boat. Well, as they try to exit, this is where the film producers start saving money. See above paragraph. So now the rest of the less talented actors run back up to their hotel room and continue the hiding and bickering. This is where the film starts to remind me of some cheesy horror flick where students are hiding in their dorm while monsters are lurking about. Finally, many hours later (felt like real time), the US Military makes is screen presence known for the first time. They nuke the big bad sucker ship. Ship crashes into the heart of LA, after suffering a direct nuclear blast. Suddenly, this sucker starts rebuilding itself. Now I swear to you at this point, I was watching for Indiana Jones to pop out of a refrigerator. But no such luck. So let's move on. Since the characters don't want the aliens to find them, and they can't look into their beams of light, none of the characters can seem to stay away from the windows, or stay off the rooftop. Why didn't they just go hide in the basement and try to sewer their way out to the dock? Oh yes, that would present plot point 2, a goal for the characters to obtain, and challenges to overcome. Something the paying audience should care about. But nope, so they got spotted by the aliens, big surprise there. There is even a fist fight between the main character and a tentacle brain sucker on the roof. Really? I would love to spoil the end for you, however by this time; I was already at the ticket office getting my 10.00 back. Hopefully you won't have to do the same. In retrospect, I think I discovered a working title for this film while in production, it's here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095348/CheersSee the blog and comment at http://bangsonpc.com/wordpress/?p=54",

In the end it's certainly better than their latest effort, Alien vs Predator Requiem, and goes along with the mediocre quality of the first AVP. The big thing hurting it is mostly unlikeable characters that do nothing to draw the audience into caring about what is happening.

A group of average everyday Americans get together in one place on a specific weekend, the next day, an alien invasion with cool looking special effect come down from the sky, beam a bunch of people up in their spaceships, the group try to escape and think of a way of taking down these b@stards, thus saving the rest of humanity.

What I get instead are characters which are mostly made up of selfish assholes, they stay in the same place for like 3/4 of the time the aliens are here, the stupider ones are the first to get killed faster than you can puke out your popcorn out after seeing the brain piercing parts, the aliens are TOO strong to take down with the military's full arsenal of soldiers, nukes, F-22s, and bazookas, and THE GODDAMN ALIENS WIN!!! Now, let me say that I love the film \"Independence Day,\" because a group of interesting and different characters came together, quickly plan of a perfect way of taking down the aliens, AND SUCCEEDED! Humans have better things to do in this world than give up, lie down, and die. I should also state that the tag line on the poster says \"Don't look up,\" and I agree with it. No one should EVER look up to the screen playing this piece of intergalactic poodoo. This film is just a pointless waste of time. BYW, in case none of you know, this is Part 1 of 2, and after what I saw, I can honestly tell that THAT'S never gonna f**kin' happen in a lifetime.\"Skyline\" (or \"SkyLIE\" as I like to call it) gets a solid 1 star out of 10, but THAT'S giving it too much credit than it deserves.",

Black guy from scrubs is also not half bad - well I liked him there and in clueless so this might not be objective judgment. Effects at the beginning look nice enough. The bad - everything.

Instead turns out to be another Cloverfield like production with lots of action overshadowing any content of the movie as a matter of fact i couldn't find any form and substance in the whole movie. And that was a big downside of it, however the movie effervescence with fighting scenes was a big feast for a s-f maniac especially to watch matrix like Sentinels robots swimming along the buildings to find its pray or big alien ships looking almost like Romulan mining ship Narada from star trek the view was certainly joy to watch that's why only 5/10 sorry",

The scene where all those people are lifting up to this gigantic spaceship left me to believe that after all these years, FINALLY, we get an alien abduction movie again. Then the second trailer came out and suddenly it started to look like it should be GO-BOTS the movie rather than an alien abduction movie.I saw it anyway.This is my actual reaction while watching this movie: \"Okay, that's cool. Who's this guy? Tommy Wiseau's son? Well, his chick is hot. That's lame.\" Then the middle portion comes around: \"Okay this movie is getting good, okay that part's lame...\" Then the ending: \"My God, was that lame.\" Seriously, it was the worst ending I've seen on film. I always said that if you have a crappy film but have a good ending, it could make up for your film. Unfortunately that's not the case for this film. I don't know what the writers were thinking but that ending had to be the worst.Skyline isn't the worst film I've seen this year (that honor goes to My Soul To Take)but it's pretty close. I would like to say that the special effects were very good and there is an intricate detail on the spacecrafts and alien lifeforms. The female lead, Scottie Thompson who plays Elayne, is very hot and a joy to look at in every scene that she's in. It almost made me forget I was watching a bad movie. In fact, she's the only one who seemed to be acting.This film, in a nutshell, is a blatant ripoff of Transformers, ID4, War of the Worlds, and the Matrix. All of the movies I just mentioned are better than this dreck.",

But there is just NO freaking way, a ship after getting blown to pieces would magically re-assemble in that fashion. At least conform to some kind of physics, please. Give us some kind of repair look or something, not just make it look like you hit rewind on the VCR. AND All that alien tech and NO weapons? NO Offense of any kind? Other than being able to reassemble from obliteration? Then why bother invading? if you are indestructible, does not seem to require resources, what's the endgame?My wife made a good point, she said the whole movie was pointless. The movie spent 94 minutes and established nothing except aliens came, people are stupid, and they wiped us out, save one person and one \"used to be human\" alien. She asked \"Is there going to be a Sequel? Is this part of a trilogy?\" I've got no answer for that. Someone in a review said, it is realistic because humankind is 99.99% non-heroic. I completely disagree. Simply recall 9/11. Or any time of peril and tragic events. In fact humankind more likely to be 90% heroic. because no kid I have ever met does not want to be a hero. So to me the movie was unrealistic. None of them acted like they actually had a brain that the aliens were after. 3 Days, and none of them said, hey, let's cool down and made a solid plan? They just rushed and rushed and died. Why would you drive a frigging Ferrari when you know that noise attracts them? They just acted like a bunch of panic ed idiots. All in all, the special effects are cool, but the movie it self sucked, big time sucked. I don't usually bash a movie, because I welcome different views, but brainless \"no pun intended\" scripts, does not appeal to me.",

Then Star Wars came along and knocked it out of the park.Fast forward to today, and we have a lot of Sci-Fi choices, ranging from bad to good, and this movie. This movie is in no way on the bad end of the spectrum. It's very far on the good end of the spectrum, probably past 3/4, so my rating of 8.Is the acting bad? No, I've seen far worse. Is it better than any SyFy movie? Heck yeah, far, far better. The acting in this movie is believable, and unlike most SyFy movies, doesn't look like they are reading from cue cards.Is the story bad? No, nothing that just ignores basic science or parades huge plot holes in front of us. Basically, I'd enjoy it if it were one of the many Sci-Fi novels I've read over the years.Is the CGI/graphics bad? No, they're pretty awesome. Do I believe everything I saw? Well, I do have some ability to sit back and suspend disbelief and let the CGI show me the story. So, maybe that's my problem, that I let a movie tell me its story.I think we're at a high point in our culture for movies and in about 25 years we're going to be crying for movies that are half as good as this one.

But, as others have mentioned, the best parts of the film are actually all in the trailer, and it's down the toilet from there.If you've ever watched a student movie where the characters are all students because the film-makers don't have any concept of life outside of their campus, this is almost exactly the same thing but made by bunch of smug, rich directors from LA about...a bunch of smug, rich directors from LA, whose luxurious apartment complex suddenly becomes surrounded by a swarm of knock off Matrix monsters...In fact it quickly became very clear to me how much the Strauss Brothers probably owe/look up to the Wachowski brothers, and when that's the level of film-making you're aspiring to? Well, at this point I knew I was f**ked.But what really gets my goat looking at other reviews here is that people are referring to the 'modest' budget of $10 million as if it gets the film-makers off the hook somehow? Sorry, if that's how much money it takes to make such a hollow, empty piece of crap like this then something is very, very wrong with the movie industry today.Surely It doesn't cost money to get a better script together than the kind of gratuitous crap I'd write as a 12 year old after watching films like Aliens or Independence Day? Ever disaster movie clich\u00e9 was here, from \"You've got to pull yourself together if we're gonna live through this!\" to \"Who put you in charge?!\"...And as for the 'human' aspects of the story-line, well, If you thought the characters in Cloverfield were 'annoying' or hard to sympathise with then you'll be doing yourself a massive favour by avoiding this abomination.I usually wouldn't let something like this bother me, but the fact that I wasted 1.5 hours of my life sitting through some simple, narrow-minded film-school jock's vaguely perverted power-fantasy coupled with the fact that people are passively giving this up to 6 out of 10 on the basis that it's a \"good popcorn movie\" sends me over the edge into a pit of rage......I mean, what, did the film make the popcorn taste better? Did the popcorn make the film look and sound better? Are people really happy to spend money on crap movies just for the experience of balancing an extra-sized bucket of popcorn on their pot-bellies in public? Can't these people have this same experience at home watching trashy late night horror channels instead? I don't think people should be pacifying such atrocious film-making by tagging them with such a 'cute' terminology. If you love popcorn you can - and probably will - eat it anytime you want, you certainly don't need to be watching a piece of crap like this to justify it.For me this movie represents everything that's wrong with the movie industry, and I almost want to condone illegal downloading if it means studios won't be able to afford the fart out more creative holocausts like this in the future.

Nope, the special effects were--I'd have to admit--above average but the plot, Ouch.

When the flashy blue lights start to hymo-tize people you know the only thing that can save you from the baddies are some powered venetian blinds in a penthouse.I love movies where 5,000 people are sucked into the sky and the main characters' response is \"Let's go have a closer look!\" I laughed out loud on at least six different occasions with this movie. Apparently blowing up the mother ship with a nuke will only make them mad. If you really want to kill an alien, you need to hit it with an SUV, use a fire-ax to the back of the \"head\", a cinderblock, and then if you really want to hurt it-- punch it.Nukes also seem to have an effect of about one city block, but be careful, because if you look at a nuke with a telescope- you might feel some discomfort for a couple seconds. Penthouse windows also seem immune to shock waves and sound travels faster than light in this movie.The baddies have some rather \"yonic\" attributes.

This part could be cut out to make a half-way viable episode of a science-fiction anthology on TV if they added some plot and maybe explained why the aliens are so interested in this one tower block while almost totally ignoring the rest of the city after their initial attack. 3) The cringe-worthy last 30 minutes. By this point even the goldfish in the audience were bored half to sleep of watching the cast run around the same two sets, escaping the same two monsters in slow-motion. When the male lead started attacking an alien with a brick, in slow-mo, with a spinning camera and smoke machines I started to wonder if it was actually meant to be a comedy. Then the kiss.... and the least said about the last few minutes the better.Here's hoping that the other alien invasion films coming soon are a lot better than this dreck because what I saw tonight made ID4 look like Citizen Kane.Also, if you're hoping it will at least be worth seeing for the special effects then don't bother. The visuals are OK but nothing new or special by today's standards.

The bad part comes in when the purpose of the harvesting comes into play.They need our brains. Really? Is that the best concept they could come up with?The special effects are one of the few highlights to talk about. Of course, what do you expect from special effects guys-now-turned- directors? This is clearly their forte. Too bad that building effective drama is not their strength. Think Michael Bay, and not Martin Scorsese.If you're the Michael Bay fan, you may find something to like about this film, as the aliens are very Transformer-like in appearance. However, for more discriminating viewers, this film is sadly wanting. Chances are you'll forget this film not long after viewing it.

Like that movie this has a high rise building as one of the main 'characters' - its put to a lot of use, although this could have been done better maybe.For game players this might seem old hat but apart from independence day I can't think of anything quite like it in film. The characters aren't sympathetic, apart from the girl perhaps, but in many ways its really a quite original premise, which ultimately delivers something unexpected. I wish they hadn't spent quite so much time dicking around, but when finally it does kick off its rollicking good ride, and even scary sometimes.

But it's encouraging to see what can be done with relatively affordable gear.Beyond that, this is a movie made by a couple of FX guys (both writers and both directors) and it shows. It's nothing -but- FX. Sure, sure, the aliens win. That's pointless when I couldn't care less about the cast being killed in similar ways, without worthwhile suspense. The plot is so full of holes, it's not even funny. Everything about this movie shouts \"B-movie\" except for the special effects. And even when you go for a B-movie style, there's a right way to do it and a wrong way (ask Tarantino, Rodriguez or even Jackson). Skyline gets everything wrong.It's similar to watching an ugly girl with lousy character drunk and in a bad mood, but dressed in a stellar dress with wonderful hair. You can't keep your eyes off of her, but a conversation with anyone else in the room would give you a better time.Skyline shows movies like District 9 how good you can look on a budget without resorting to just shaking the camera.

Basically the film is *Transformers* meets *Matrix* meets *War of the Worlds* meets *Night of the Living Dead* meets *Predator* meets *Independence Day*, but where one would think all those classic films might make this a must see, the film is too clich\u00e9 and too convoluted to make any sense.FIRST, there is no story, not a new one (see aforementioned films), not a plausible explanation, just characters caught up in an invasion of earth by, what or where or whom, we never find out. The blue lights mesmerize humans into being sucked into cyborg like machines for their brains (I kept waiting for the clich\u00e9 line \"Brains, must...have...brains\" to be uttered).SECOND, other than one couple's pregnancy, there is nothing to attract us to any of the rest of the characters, they are boring and one-dimensional. No real story exists for any of the characters, no background, no human interest, just pawns for a mess of a script.THIRD, a nuke is used early and when that fails special forces and helicopter gunships arrive--hmmmm after the failure of the most powerful weapon known it makes sense to send in lessor capable forces to take on these cyborg ships \"things\".FINALLY, the end is not really an end, sort of a \"to be continued...\" no closure, no hope, nothing to cheer, just a ..., yes an abrupt end but welcome so one can leave the theater. So do yourself a favor and skip this film.One should always be concerned when no less than five production companies are listed at the start of a film, a blank film, in association with blank, produced by blank, a blank production and in conjunction with blank pictures. That's five backers that will not get their monies out of this stinker--it's almost as if the Mel Brooks PRODUCERS decided to make a movie, find the worst script, actors, director, and oversell by 1000%, we'll be rich--it will close in one week!!",

A truly apocalyptic situation of any kind ultimately gives rise to confusion, helplessness and desperation felt by civilians and military alike, where the only valid reaction is one of survival in whatever ways the human mind can muster. This is what \"Apocalypse\" means ... you'd be missing the point of this if the character(s) could turn on their still-working TV to find out what's going on outside, or maybe ask their next-door neighbor Jeff Goldblum for his opinion etc.It seems that today's modern movie-goers are less than satisfied (or gratified) if all plot-points are not at least partially resolved and tied up in a nice bow. I'm actually happy that the filmmakers went against the grain and portrayed Skyline as an open-ended world situation where there may well never be a solution to this crisis ... that's what I enjoyed so much about \"Cube\", because even at the last second you still have no idea how or why anything happened in the way it did. Also, \"Battle: Los Angeles\" leans more towards Skyline than its more obvious \"ID4\" cousin for its \"Aliens? What the ****?\" situation, though it inevitably caters to the fickle audience by having someone accidentally discovering a possible solution within two hours of Ground Zero (in movie-time, that is).To me, a movie (or any other media) ultimately benefits the person who gets out of it only what they wish to, good or bad. And as we all know, any work of art is ultimately just a work-in-progress snapshot of the creator's vision and intention at the time of release, otherwise everything out there would always be perfect and faultless the first time around when the public finally gets to see it ... just look at Star Wars.",

And, as it often happens in life, there is no common sense, no fairness, and no happy end in it.

And this is the main reason why I give 10 out of 10 for the movie. Because I believe I would behave similarly in such a situation. And, probably, I would end up in the big machine, too.Acting was good enough not to distract me. To be honest, I found Brad Pitt in World War Z was acting more artificially.CGI was good, well above what you might expect from a B-movie.Soundtrack - I don't know, didn't pay attention to it except in the last 5 minutes when it was great.

This movie is a load of crap! Absolute rubbish! The storyline was pathetic, predictable and un-original . The dialogue was like something out of party of five and the acting was cringe worthy. The Only redeeming factor of this movie at all is some (Not many) of the CGI sequences are rather well done (For a low budget piece of sh*t movie like this one) With a budget of only $10million you cant really have ideas this big. The special effects look Desktop produced in places and the aliens are way to shiny! And why did they add a heavy breathing audio track over some of the action sequences? It sounds like some kind of orgy! Watch it, if your curious. If your a fan of Battlestar Gallactica you might actually give it a 4.5 rating. As far as Im concerned its a load of old crap. Certainly don't buy it on DVD or BluRay! Even if it is only 99p in the Bargain bin. And believe me, its going to help fill quite a few of those Tesco's bargain bins in the near future.

The competition, Battle: Los Angeles, Super 8, etc. all cost close to or more than 100 million, and that's the cost before advertising.

However, it makes the most of what has and generally succeeds with what it does.First off, you'll notice that this movie doesn't really have any big-name actors. The only people I recognized were Donald Faison (Turk from Scrubs) and Eric Balfour (from Haven), who is the protagonist. However, all the actors involved give very believable performances as \"ordinary\" LA residents caught up in the midst of an alien invasion. While the movie lacks \"Star Power\", it makes up for it with capable, albeit relatively unknown, actors who actually succeed in making me believe in their characters.The storyline is actually pretty unique as well. Although you'll notice items borrowed from movies such as Cloverfield, District 9, and the Matrix (among others), it combines them in a unique way and makes them it's own. It has it's own style that seems both familiar and unique at the same time.My main criticism of the movie is it's ending, which stretches on a little longer than it should. However, I found the ending itself to be very unique and satisfying.Overall, I think if you're a fan Sci-Fi movies, and don't mind B-Grade budget flicks such Starship Troopers, I'm sure you'll find a lot to like in this movie.

Aliens have arrived and the light is so bright it seems to scold the skin, turn the eyes white, send people into a trance, before the the person is sucked into various spacecraft.

I mean, who knows how people would react if aliens attacked, but do you think aliens that have enormous spaceships and are capable of 'sucking' thousands of humans up through air are going to be fazed by a handgun? Even some of the characters question that idea of taking a gun. But latter it gets worse, when attacked by a large tentacled alien why not attack with an axe! Yeah that's a good idea! It was quite clever to lull the audience into a sense of closure with the crashing of the main ship, even if time wise it felt too early to end: of course it didn't and there were a few moments of tension near the end as the pair try to escape but realise there's no hope. Dragged into the spacecraft we see a mess of bodies and alien stuff tat was difficult to make sense off. And then suddenly the filmed ended. What?! I felt a little duped and let down, I mean sure, set a sequel, but the ending was so abrupt and so far from any sense of closure I sat for many moments open mouthed.I like sci-fi and this did have potential, but although some of the special effects are good, there is so little else to enjoy and the ending is just unacceptable it's a big waste of time. Like I said, thank god I didn't pay for it.ore of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",

Skyline had an obvious plot but my curiosity was peaked when looking at how the presence of the aliens effected the humans eyes. Anyways, I saw and was not impressed in the least. The script was poorly constructed and the acting was horrible. It's obvious an A or even B-list actor didn't want to star in the horrendous film so they had to bring back some lowly actors who used to act in high school movies from back in the 90s. It reminded me of a bad mix of Independence Day, War of The Worlds, and District 9. My only prayer is that I hope there isn't a sequel. The best part of the movie was when the main female character laid down and said \"I hate L.A.\" other than that....no thanks!",

Doesn't matter what you threw at them, shots fired from a gun, hitting them with a 4x4, blowing them up with gas, a nuclear bomb, removing a brain of the alien, they just wouldn't die!

            "content": "A couple (Eric Balfour & Scottie Thompson) visits some friends in Los Angeles when aliens attack the city and they hold up in a posh apartment complex. The other protagonists are played by Brittany Daniel, Donald Faison, Crystal Reed and David Zayas.\"Skyline\" (2010) combines elements of other Alien invasion flicks like \"Independence Day\" (1996), \"Battle: Los Angeles\" (2011), \"Cloverfield\" (2008) and \"War of the Worlds\" (1953/2005) with an ending reminiscent of the same in \"Night Skies\" (2007). The people-snatching aspect recalls \"The Forgotten\" (2004).The director brothers are visual effects designers who were working on the blockbuster \"Battle: Los Angeles\" while making this indie, which only cost about $10 million. Sony Pictures sued, but the case was later dropped. It must've scared the directors because they haven't returned to directing since (as of this writing) even though \"Skyline\" made $21 million domestically and $78 million worldwide, which led to the sequel \"Beyond Skyline\" (2017) by other filmmakers.Being made by effects experts, it's not surprising that the F/X in \"Skyline\" are top-of-the-line. Some of the aliens or crafts look like they were modeled after sea creatures, like octopi and jelly fish. There are also probing tentacles, as seen in \"War of the Worlds.\" Meanwhile the main vessels and some of the aliens are similar to those in \"Independence Day.\"Unfortunately, there's not enough human interest and the story is too one-dimensional to be overly gripping, for me anyway. Still, this is a grave, tense account of what a malevolent alien invasion might be like. It lacks the lighter side of \"Independence Day\" and other eye-rolling aspects (e.g. the pro-American angle), but \"ID\" had more human interest and a plot with a much larger scope. This one amounts to: Aliens attack earth and snatch victims, the end. Yet it's well done for what it is.The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles with shots of New York City, London and Hong Kong at the end.GRADE: B-",

            "content": "This is my very first review on IMDb but I feel I've been prompted to write it based on what I have experienced during my trip to see Skyline and I look forward to contributing to others in future.First and foremost, I am a very big fan of the Sci-Fi genre and see pretty much as many films in the genre as I can from Alien (thumbs up) to Scorpius Gigantus (my thumbs are in my eyes).I was deeply put off Skyline after the initial criticism both media and publicly and it seemed I should wait until its DVD release for a quick rental. Impressions weren't good, poor acting, no plot, awful dialogue and worst of all for a movie of this type, rubbish special effects. Worst still, it came straight of the back of the AVP Requiem disaster from a Brothers Strause directorial debut, a movie so boring in places it made A Walk in the Clouds look like a Michael Bay movie.Yet with nothing to do, a wee bit of curiosity, my childhood fascination for the genre, an open mind and no else to speak of with me, gave me a push on a half price night to in and \"see what I thought\" \u0085 what on earth was I letting myself in for!! Surprisingly, a darn good movie! Maybe it was the expectation of shear disappointment or AVPR dialogue that was putting me off but this is a big improvement for the Brothers Strause. Setting the scene for some youngsters straight out of a Hollywood Hills reality show, they never really intended to catch the viewer and take them to emotional heights. Their acting, although far from excellent, was very competent/solid and in a movie about the survival of a nasty alien invasion, there was never really going to be a plot in the first place.SPOILER: I liked the fact that every move that was made was continually cut off narrowing down the chances of escape and survival and during these scenes the special effects for a movie on 10 million dollar budget blew me away, its right up their with Hollywoods best.Alien design, if you are curious, is inspired rather than inspiring and consists of ID4s creatures without the body only with lights which draw in prey, again after reading negative reviews, very surprising and to go against what others have said, tense during the hunting sequences.SPOILER: When the humans (military) eventually fight back, it comes out of a moment when the films begins to slow and offers a high jolt of excitement, especially when the super stealth fighter weaves its way towards the huge battle ship against an onslaught of attacking enemy craft. It's a truly exciting scene that offers a feel good moment in a sense of what this film can achieve on a shoestring budget (in comparison to its bigger brothers).Negative points for me include a let down ending (SPOILER: its very akin to District 9 but sillier) and unexplained events, they probably hope to offer these for a sequel as it's left open along with moments of some very bad acting and 'haminess' rearing its head (SPOILER: punching the creature).All in all, a movie that came of the excellent tail of District 9's emotional overtures and shoestring budget for which it fails to match but as a Sci-Fi turkey (I've seen too many to count back my living years) this isn't one.I think the problem with the film is what mindset you go in to view it with. Catch it before leaves the cinema and approach with a bucket of popcorn and a mind with the key departed from the ignition and I think if you are to enjoy this movie, and do so with the pretence of disappointment, not hype-mania as many reviewers have, and it should exceed expectations as it did mine.Unbelievable effects on a shoestring budget delivering entertainment the way it should with expectations low and mind switched off? 8 \u2013 10 for me.",

Through the powers of CGI, directors can make elaborate creatures and scenarios to bedazzle the audience.But very few movies bring anything novel to the \"franchise\". Take this list for example:The Darkest Hour Dreamcatcher War of the Worlds The Mist The Arrival Invasion of the Body Snatchers Battlefield Los AngelesYou got 2 basic stories: 1. Hordes of bizarre spaceships and creates come down from space and the cast runs for cover while militarily desperately tries to fend off the invaders. 2. They have already been here for decades and nobody noticed. The protagonists slowly follow the clues to uncover the shocking mystery.Skyline is type #1. It had HUGE potential. I thought it was going to be great until near the end. I can see why some people like it. How does Skyline innovate? Humans are drawn to the blue light made by the aliens. Alien design looks like hybrid of Matrix and Gears of War game.The problem is you don't feel for the protagonists because they are some hot shot party goers - none are funny or memorable. Usually in this genre, the trapped people are constantly on the run. But for Skyline, they spend 90% of the time in their little condo - which is a boring setting. There is so little plot and character interaction, it wouldn't matter if you had missed the first half of the movie.In typical \"B\" movie fashion aliens are stupid, and cast even more so. But, Skyline is so bad, and so stupid, that people hide from the monsters behind bed sheets... literally.",

Here is a movie that tells a different sort of alien invasion, just showing a perspective from a small group of people and without all the unbelievable crap that bogs down the usual $200 million Hollywood version of this. This was made on $10 (ish) million, an extraordinary feat. Does it have the best actors in the whole? No. But they aren't as bad as some people make it out.Please ignore the overly negative reviews and see for yourself, this deserves some money so that we may hopefully see some more true sci-fi movies made outside studio influence in the future.

I can even handle the cardboard cut-out characters.What I'd like is a LITTLE explanation of what's going on.As other reviews have mentioned, the newsroom-(non)-scene would have been ideal for this, but apparently everyone deep inside the studio building couldn't resist the light. The same light that the four people in a sea-view apartment block managed to (more or less) avoid.So... where are the aliens from? Not answered. Why are they here? Not answered. Why are Jarrod and Elaine slightly immune to the light after seeing it the first time? Not answered. What's the mutation that's growing in Jarrod, and why hasn't it happened to Elaine? Not answered. Are the aliens looking to settle on earth or just abduct all the humans? Not answered. Why is there an initial landing and 'harvest', only for them to return to orbit, THEN come back a second time, and stay permanently? It 'could' by so they can convert their first batch into attack-dogs for the second wave, but that seems like a fairly quick process anyway at the end of the film, and they were hardly under threat at that point. Why does everyone who looks into the light go into a silent trance, yet when we see the long-shot of everyone being 'beamed up', we hear them all screaming and moaning? Not answered. What's the importance of \"Head for the water, they're not hovering over there\"? It 'could' be just because their are no people to vacuum up over the sea, but that's common sense, so why put it into the script? Especially as they don't make another stab at getting to the marina, anyway.What are their weaknesses? None apparently - you keep hitting them and they just get back up again. You see, they can withstand a military attack, and falling off buildings, but Jarrod's able to kill one with his bare hands on the rooftop at the final\u00e9.Speaking of the final\u00e9 (MAJOR SPOILERS): Why do the aliens have second thoughts about harvesting Elaine's brain once they find out she's pregnant? What's it to them? How many people in Los Angeles are pregnant at any one time, and are they all still alive too? Not answered.Why do the aliens need human brains to transplant into their 'babies'(?). This can't be necessary for their continuation as a species, or they wouldn't exist in the numbers they do in the film. They've harvested MILLIONS of brains in L.A. alone, are all of those to be used in this manner, or are some just 'food'? Not answered. Again, once they've converted the entire human race to pets or food, what are they planning to do then? Not answered.Why is Jarrod able to keep his consciousness after having his brain removed from his body, yet this doesn't \"seem\" to have happened to anyone else? Is it to do with his unexplained super-powers? Presumably answered in a sequel....and breathe.You see, I was thinking that SOME of these questions would be answered in the final 10 minutes of the film. Especially as it wasn't until then that we get the customary glances around the world to see that the whole planet's been affected by this. But no answers, no. Because by then, there's only one cast member left who can actually speak in any human language.I've given this a 2, because the CGI work is, for the most part, good, and I didn't mind the design of the aliens. But the film, characters and plot development should push this into minus-numbers. It's not even a \"brainless fun\" (no pun intended) movie, as too many questions are left hanging at the end. The biggest question being: \"Why did all of that just happen?\"",

I can't see it through the smog.Luckily, the armada of alien aircraft crowding the horizon in this sci-fi movie is not hard to miss.In L.A. visiting a friend (Donald Faison), Jarrod (Eric Balfour) wakes one morning to learn that his girlfriend (Scottie Thompson) is pregnant and that the world has been invaded.Stunned on both counts, he insures his kid's future by resisting.Noting that the aliens don't hover above water, Jarrod insists that they get to his friend's yacht.But with hypnotic blue lights sucking people into the sky and monstrous sentinels stalking humans, setting sails will be difficult.While the beginning is tepid and hokey, the ending is exhilarating and unexpected.What's more, maybe this massive influx of aliens will pay taxes and help California get out of debt.

            "content": "A few IMDb reviewers have lauded this movie's brave stance on its bleak apocalyptic outcome and a refusal to conform to a tried-and-trusted formula, but frankly they just strike me as contrary individuals who are seeing patterns that aren't there. Far more people have identified this as a bad movie devoid of originality, narrative drive or emotional content and I would agree.A lot of attention has already been brought to the seemingly endless parade of illogical and counter-intuitive events that go on in this movie (my personal favourite being the localised nuclear warhead). Other films have encouraged viewers to swallow equally preposterous events but they did so with more charisma or humour. 'Skyline' seems devoid of either.Which brings me to the question of why this movie was made. Some have commented and many more have wondered how this seemingly-impossible turn of events came to pass, but if you think about it the whole thing makes perfect business sense.A couple of special effects guys have an idea for a movie. They don't have much background in script writing, but they've seen a whole bunch of movies and have an idea how it works. They come to a producer who tells them they'll have to get it done in under $10 million and they shrug and say, 'ok'. Some actors and directors are wheeled in, the special effects guys do their thing and BANG - out pops 'Skyline'.The special effects guys no doubt had a great time, the actors and directors turned up because it was a paying job and one more notch on their resumes, and the producer got the green light because he knew it would make enough money to turn a profit. 'Skyline' made, what, $17 million on its opening weekend, from a budget of $10 million? That seems like sound economic sense to me. And does it really matter if the movie was actually any good? The special effects guys made sure there were enough eye-popping moments to put together a great trailer to reel us in and once we paid our money...who cares if we liked it or not?Hollywood runs a business. If they can make a profit from it, they'll film it.",

Please read on and find out if you should watch this.As far as movies are concerned, there are 2 kinds of sci-fi fans: There's the kind that loves sci-fi movies because of its great special effects and action scenes. If you're that kind of person, this movie's probably worth watching.Then there's the kind that loves sci-fi for its interesting stories, or the exploration of new (semi-)fictional (non-)scientific ideas. I suggest you spend your time reading a book. Well, anything will probably be less of a waste of time than watching this movie.In short, there's no character development. There's no story. There's no plot. And even with a high degree of suspension of disbelief, the movie isn't believable in the slightest. If you don't care about that, go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, just don't.",

And by disastrous I mean, shame on the producer who spewed this onto the movie industry.The 'creative' plot was nonexistent. Evil aliens come from outer space and doom humanity.. wow.. I could see where it was going to end before it even began. Any actors you didn't recognize where going to die first. Then the buddy of our handsome hero will be next, followed by the actors according to pay grade. I could just see the director now, \"Just act like you're being chased so we can give it to the editor, I have to tee off at 11 people!\" Character development was a joke too. We had the pretentious princess, the stupid best pal, the handsome but not too sure of himself hero, and the General Manager who looks like he hasn't had a day off in years, poor guy. David Zayas is supposed to be giving our hero a life learned lesson on being brave but before any great dialog could manifest, another explosion would rock the storyline or a boogie man alien would pop up through the garbage shoot to make sure you weren't fornicating.Sound and editing were substandard at best. As I watched the Marines on the top of the condo killing some baddies, I recall the last words before being simply knocked off roof were \"reload soldier\".. Marines being called soldiers.. *sigh* And why did the aliens have flood lights on there faces?Oh but the ending sealed it for me. After being tortured by 3rd grade dialog and no real plot line, after we find out the aliens are just super advanced zombies, our hero saves the day like a high school bully to shout, \"Don't mess with my girlfriend or I'll beat you up!\" This was a definite 'check your brain at the door' movie.

You know it's never a good sign when you can sum up the plot of a movie in one short and clear sentence. Skyline caught my interest because the epic trailer shot of people getting sucked up by the light beam. The film itself doesn't live up to the one single shot. It was marketed as a big tent pole blockbuster film, but in reality it's a low budget flick disguised as a blockbuster. That's why a lot of people hated it. Me on the other hand hated it because I thought it was a poorly constructed film all together. The entire movie takes place at this one building, in and around it. So immediately the claustrophobic feel sets in when it should be more grander. Second, we are stuck in this small place with a bunch of characters that you don't like. I wanted all of them to be sucked up by the alien light from the get go. Third, the film is full of stupid character mistakes that I wanted to have my brain sucked out and taken away by one of those things. The reason for the aliens attacking is never stated, but we get a pretty clear indication when we go inside one of the ships and see what they are doing to the humans. Apparently, the want our brains so they can harvest more of their species. I'm okay with that. What I'm not okay with is the lame ending they decided to throw at us. Somehow, inexplicably, if you look at the light that is suppose to suck you away, you gain superpowers. Our main character looks at the light a bunch of times, but is saved at the last minute each time so he never gets taken. He gains this powers, which make him different. Then the ending hits and we are suppose to believe that somehow this one guy is different, just because of the light? Yawn.The movie rips off every other alien flick it can think of. First of all, the aliens look like the martians from Independence Day. Second, the spaceships look like the sentinels from The Matrix. Third, the giant monster aliens look like they came right out of Starship Troopers. Does this movie do anything original? Nope. I give credit the the directors, who financed the film themselves and did the special effects. Most of the budget....okay, 95% of the budget went towards the special effects. Next time, they need to write a good script and then do a second and third draft of it before they get all excited at what their imagination can cook up on a computer. Filmmaking is about story, if you have a good story, chances are you have a good film. If you have a film with a crappy story, but great special effects, chances are your film is still going to be crappy.Skyline is crappy.I will say this though, my favourite part was when one character heroically decides to sacrifice himself to kill an alien and save the others. The camera decides to focus on a painting in the background of a Japanese Kamikaze pilot, I had a good laugh at that.",

This doesn't have any big stars under it's basket, but I found it constructive to be this way, because many times the story is over-shadowed by the attention given to performance in a science-fiction which needs to be attentive to the plot. The CGI in this movie is not as breathtaking as 'cgi-oriented' Transformers; but the scenes are quite in sync with the plot. I found some scenes to be truly original in the sense, that they depict despair and apprehension in a beautiful way. The climax is quite good despite the slower second-act. If you are a fan of \"Close encounters of the third kind\", you'll find a similar feel of scare and anxiety in this one too. A must-watch for sci-fi fans!",

The mismatch between human technology and that of aliens capable of interstellar travel is believable. We'd get our clocks cleaned in such a conflict, and our minor victories would be short-lived and heavily retaliated against, just as seen here. And the humans who didn't die instantly would panic and try stupid plans that don't work, just as seen here.That's fine, and actually kind of refreshing. I'm pretty tired of the \"human underdogs somehow defeat the invincible aliens\" genre. Sure, I'm rooting for the home team, but it's just not a realistic outcome.The problem here is that the aliens just don't make sense. I get that aliens are supposed to be, well, alien, and that their methods and goals might not make sense to us. But here we're eventually shown that they are pursuing one single goal to the exclusion of all else: the harvesting of human brains. They ignore literally everything else, and are shown to discard the corpses once they've removed the central nervous system. And what are they using the brains for? To reprogram and install them in cyborg drones so that they can more efficiently -- wait for it -- harvest human brains, not that they were having much difficulty with that to start with.The dumb circularity of all this makes me wish my brain had been harvested before I wasted its power trying to watch this tripe. It's a 50's B-movie plot with great special effects grafted on top. It makes \"Independence Day\" look like Shakespeare. Hell, it makes \"Lost in Space\" or \"Transformers\" look like Shakespeare. It's just amazingly, infuriatingly stupid and pointless.The only mildly interesting thing in this movie occurs just as it ends, when Balfour's brain (I can't be bothered to look up the character's name) is shown to somehow rebel so he turns into a rogue alien/cyborg/drone. It's as illogical and inexplicable as the rest of this mess, but if the movie had gotten to that point an hour earlier and moved forward, there might have been a chance at something resembling a plot. As it is, though, this is just a complete waste. One star gets bumped up to three for the special effects, but they're not enough to make this worth sitting through.",

I hated the fact that the movie finished\u0085 and then kept going for another interminable and totally baffling 10 minutes that only enraged me further.I hate the fact that somewhere in the world some 15 year old boy eagerly places his first 'adult' sci-fi DVD in the tray and settles back to watch this film.

I can only hope that the alien beings were filming a reality show for their home planet called 'The Dopiest Catch'.If this film represents just how advanced we are then we deserve to be taken over.",

Terry is fabulously rich, and feels a debt to Jarrod for work they did earlier in life, so he's arranged a sweet new gig for Jarrod if he wants it. Complicating this is Elaine's very recently discovered pregnancy. There's quite a party where the new realities are awkwardly announced.All this goes down the tubes during the next night. Aliens arrive in giant starships that hover over the city. The emissaries from the ships try mind control experiments on our heroes with mixed success.The next morning, many have already died from the onslaught, and more die trying to leave the highrise. Soon the story narrows down to Jarrod, Elaine, Oliver, and Candice and their attempts to survive.American armed forces fight back with limited success.Will the survivors find the key to escape? Will the US armed forces get the upper hand? ------Scores-------Cinematography: 9/10 Rather good. Some of the CGI was a tad hokey.Sound: 9/10 Occasionally hard to hear, but mostly fine.Acting: 6/10 Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, Donald Faison, and David Zayas gave reasonable performances. Many of the others were less competent.Screenplay: 6/10 Exposition of motivation is more than a bit murky for most of the film, but the end redeems this. The lack of clear intention by the humans is explained by the mind-control abilities of the aliens. The presence of the aliens on earth is also explained. I would think that most viewers would not care for the fact that one needs the last five minutes to make sense out of the rest of the film.",

However, you'll see influences from other films like \"District 9\" as well. The action revolves around a young couple and their friends' desperate hopes to survive the invasion whilst simply trying to understand what actually is going.Nothing original and it's actually very derivative, so don't expect to find anything new in this. Acting is okay enough and thankfully they keep much of the moral anguish to a minimum.Special effects are the film's only real forte but after following on from recent movies you'll find it difficult to find anything to amaze here, more that it's become standard expected fare.Fair enough movie with some good special effects, but it's not without its plot-holes, and you may simply find yourself spending a lot of time just pointing out similarities to other films in the genre.",

            "content": "This film was universally panned by the critics when it came out and, being of a curious nature, I decided to see just how bad it was. I should have been wary as it's made by the same guys who brought us the awful\u0085 IMO AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem in 2007 (my review here). I can't say this information filled me with glee, but I persevered and, taking a deep breath, pressed PLAY\u0085 I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary.Young couple Jarrod and Elaine fly into L.A. to visit Jarrod's friend, successful entrepreneur, Terry. They meet at Terry's penthouse apartment where they also meet Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant Denise. That evening Terry throws a party, it's his birthday, and one of the guests, Ray, stays in the living room with Denise. At about 4AM the following morning, they are woken by a bright blue light that, it seems, Ray cannot resist, and he walks right off the balcony towards it. It appears an alien invasion is taking place and they want humans\u0085 all of them. I won't say any more of the Spoiler Police will be chasing me with a bright blue light on their freaky looking vehicle.I'll start with performances, well, it wasn't great in this department, but I thought David Zayas as Oliver, the apartment supervisor, did the best with what he had to play with. Otherwise, everyone was just mediocre but I'll list the major players just for completeness; Eric Balfour played Jarrod, Scottie Thompson played Elaine, Brittany Daniel was Candice, Crystal Reed was Denise, and finally, Donald Faison played Terry.On the plus side, the CGI and special effects were all very well done and would have looked pretty spectacular on the big screen. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the plus side goes. They plot was preposterous to say the least and the dialogue was pretty terrible too. I do love a decent Sci-Fi Action Thriller, but this is the kind of thing that gives the genre a really bad name and I truly wish they had never made it! I'm sometimes accused of being too generous with the scores I give, but I have no problem in giving this the lowest score I've ever given (& I'm probably still being too generous, but the CGI was pretty good). Definitely NOT recommended.My Score: 2.6/10.IMDb Score: 4.5/10 (based on 35,709 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 16/100 (based on 75 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",

I avoided this one in theaters because of the reviews I read and now after seeing it on PPV I really wish I had made the trip to the big screen. Unlike your typical Hollywood hero and a positive message built in, this one is full of despair and depravity. It is destined to be a cult classic because of its low budget feel but high budget effects. Some reviewers say this movie should have been straight to DVD and \"avoid avoid avoid\" and don't waste your money. Let me say that these reviews make me wonder who is actually saying these things. Do they really want another Independence Day? This is the kind of story that I have waited so long for Hollywood to produce. One with no hero or built in preachy message explaining that we win because we are the best because we win because we are best (repeated purposefully). There are some scenes before the halfway mark of Skyline that made me think no matter what happens now the reviewers are wrong. I absolutely loved the ending as well, and felt as though they had a few alternative ending choices and went with the one that felt the most like a comic book style ending, that is very, very cool.I personally would have liked more gore than black goo and blue glow but I am not complaining about this movie at all, as that has already been done here too many for no apparent reason and hopefully a sequel won't be far away. Please follow the exact same formula again (low budget movie making with high budget eye candy). Keep DeCaprio and the flock out of it and I will be in the theater for that one.",

            "content": "The problem of this film is not that it's not great - which it definitely IS -, but that it mixes several genres which seems to put off people's expectations so much that they hate it. If you expect a classic sci-fi film, you're thrown off by the whole horror-movie-like plot which is much more akin to a zombie-film (down to the being-after-your-brain part, the un-killability of the adversaries and general hopelessness of the situation where everyone is getting killed one-by-one). What's great about this movie, though, is, that it has much more realistic dramatic devices than for example 'Alien' which is a similar sci-fi horror movie, but where most people die out of simple stupidity/carelessness instead of by this trial-and-error tour-de-force.I even liked the whole 'we're boxed up in the apartment and watch what is going on outside before deciding on our actions' part because it was used well as a descriptive device, turning the characters into spectators through whose eyes the audience of the film is watching what is going on, helping to build the suspense and feeling of claustrophobia and being trapped. The criticism that the film was constrained to only one location is totally unfounded, as there were at least 5 different locations in the general area of the apartment building (and a totally different one at the end) that I remember, all with their own action sequences. Sure, the aliens looked a lot like a mixture of things from Alien, Matrix, War of the Worlds and whatnot, but I think that is only because the fear of dark, big things with lots of eyes and tentacles is very natural (at least it works very well for me), but, I cannot see this as a rip-off of Independence Day because it lacked the whole comedic part and also the deus-ex-machina solution same as for War of the Worlds. If at all, I think it is more similar to Signs in depicting normal people dealing with such horrible scenarios, just on a grander scale.What I also liked, apart from the great action-sequences with cool CGI, were some of the sudden twists. I was so looking forward to an alien-vs-car chase when BLAM, Godzilla's alien brother stomps on the first car and shakes it like a matchbox until the people fall out - HILARIOUS! And the film is full to the brim of such scenes.Finally, I liked the realism of the ending which included at least part of a happy ending which otherwise would have even me left with a feeling of total gloom. I don't even think it's as far-fetched because the aliens in their general efficiency and thoroughness probably don't often harvest the brains of people who have been exposed to the effects of their light multiple times and maybe learn to shake them off (i.e. learn to use their own weapons against them).To sum it up, this is a fantastic horror/action movie in a sci-fi setting with romantic aspects and everyday-heroism as opposed to saving-the-world heroism. For someone like me who likes to watch lots of different kinds of films, this mixture works brilliantly.Kudos to the Strause Brothers for their daring attempt to try something different by combining lots of stuff I know and like in a way that works!",

Skyline is based on an alien race which comes to earth and wreaks havoc upon the citizens. For what? mainly for their brains. I suppose it is the only way they can survive by eating or absorbing the brains to expand their consciousness, but in the midst of this strange carnage, one earth person is slightly immune to the effects of the creatures lure. Seeing as he was almost consumed himself, the passover of the alien beings thoughts and some genetic codes gave him a bit of power. Only to defend himself on a minuscule level. But what was disappointing was that the film was based inside a penthouse. This was a bit off for me, I would love to see the fight taken to the streets, this way the fight could be for a lot more than just their simple lives cooped up in some hovel. But the effects did how ever inspire me, seeing new creatures although the creatures did have a similarity to a game called Crysis warhead. Other than that, I thought the odd way of dealing with the unknown was a bit lax, most people would sit still, yet most who do live for adventure would take the fight to them. Even though the military was involved, it would have been nice to see a separate story line other than the main characters. This way all forms of action could have melded together nicely. All in all, a good Sci-Fi, needed more story, and the effects were brilliant. And the fact that Jared became an alien himself, ready to fight off the rest of the brood. This was a good twist. Again a kind of gaming feel to it.",

The aliens in question on day release from the 'Matrix' have clearly come to earth to use their shiny blue tempting lights to steal everyone's acting ability, sadly they soon find they've come to the wrong place. Of course I'm joking, about the alien's motives, not the acting. So as if it wasn't bad enough that not a single person in this film can act for toffee you then have to factor in the awful direction. What I think is most painful is the overuse of slow motion and in a totally serious way (although its pretty laughable) using the slow motion to show people witnessing something bad and then going 'Noooooooooooooo' for several minutes, oh dear. As for the story well I would go so far as to say what story but I will just sum it up for you real quick. Aliens come to earth suck people up, some really annoying people try to escape but cant, they think its game over but wait here's the army who clearly save the day or do they? Well no they don't, annoying people still cant get away, preposterous use of a breezeblock, that didn't work, resort to fisticuffs, pointless slow motion, annoying people still cant seem to get away, god the army is useless, aliens win (I think, it all got a bit confusing at the end and I'd started to drift off a bit to be honest). Skyline is a film that has not a single ounce of originality in its shabby body, it ambles around ideas like a fat kid at a buffet table of food stuffs its not sure if it likes or not, every so often taking a nibble of something but eventually popping it back and hoping no one will notice. It jumps from one clich\u00e9 to another piecing together parts stolen from other films like a shiny blue cinema magpie making a really ugly celluloid nest and it ultimately turns out making something like 'Independence Day' look like 'Citizen Kane'.",

I suppose it's mainly because it doesn't give people what they want or expect. In any given alien invasion movie, several quirky, dedicated, and/or brilliant characters come up with a plan to beat the odds and kick alien butt.Not so in Skyline. Instead, we get a conglomeration of unlikeable characters who obviously can't cope with the situation and additionally have to experience how every last glimmer of hope is shattered. To summarize, the CG are great (I was amazed that the effects were so good for a movie with such a low budget), but that in itself doesn't make this movie different. Neither do the actors or the script. But it does show us how unheroic most of us would react in a similar situation and how little we could actually do about it.In an actual conquest by such a superior invading force, we really wouldn't stand much of a chance. And maybe that's why this film isn't getting many positive reviews. We're all so petrified by 9/11 and the current economic and political situation that we don't want to have a mirror of hopelessness held in front of us. We'd rather see some form of hope, no matter how unrealistic.That's where this film gives us a breath of fresh air. Seen from an historical perspective, what happens in Skyline is actually quite accurate. The conquered culture might be destroyed, but if the conquered culture is integrated into the invading culture in any form whatsoever, the conquering culture is also forever changed. We get a glimpse of such possibilities at the very end of the movie, which is why I'm really looking forward to the sequel.",

            "content": "Seriously, I have no other way to sum up this movie. I really didn't hate it, nor like it. It just wasn't fun and I feel indifferent towards it. The movie has been done on a shoe-string budget as its funded by the Directors and not a big Hollywood studio and so one might have expected that they may have fleshed out the story a bit, but that isn't the case. Also all of the actors are B-grade TV actors, like David Fayas from 'Dexter', Eric Balfour from 'Haven', Crystal Reed from 'Teen Wolf' and Donald Faison from 'Scrubs' and as much as I like them, they were all equally horrible. You know what, there's more story in the trailer than in the actual movie. I'm not kidding.Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend, Elaine (Scottie Thompson) have flown over to LA for his best friend, Jerry's (Donald Faison) birthday party. During the early hours of the next morning, a mysterious blue light awakens everybody. Whoever stares into this blue light are in an hypnotic state, while their skin and flesh deteriorates and are taken in by the alien monsters. The aliens seem to be intent on consuming human brains and that is the main reason for their invasion. Their group try to escape from this nightmare.How is it that there were barely any people on the streets or anywhere for that matter after the initial attack! Why was Elaine shouting like a maniac when they could have easily slipped away if they were more tactful about it! And just seconds before Jarrod announced there's no water and electricity, they were watching TV! A nuke went off so close to them and they were alright with it. So many plot holes you could fit a huge ship through it! These characters are also awfully annoying, so much so, that I was actually rooting for the aliens to kill them. Its like the writers thought, \"Hey reality TV and alien movies are popular! Lets make a movie which is a mix of both.\" And voila, we got characters who are as evolved as the morons from 'Jersey Shore' take on the aliens who are reminiscent of 'War of the Worlds'. There are some positives though, the effects are absolutely fantastic. It drives the non-existent plot line forward. The whole movie is shot in RED which makes everything look all the more beautiful. The CGI aliens looked completely realistic and cool. Also I couldn't see the ending coming. It was after the cheesy stuff, but dammit it wasn't surprising. Kinda 'District 9' stuff. Anyway, the point is, the effects are just not enough to make someone watch a movie anymore without a strong storyline and acting. However, since it has made quite a huge profit, 'Skyline 2' is already in the pipeline and we might expect it to premiere by the end of this year. I hate the way they are churning out sequels these days. There is no respect for originality and they drag the good name of the original movies - if they were any good to begin with - and just become one of the several cash-grab franchises which nobody will care about few years from now. Anyway, you've been warned. Watch it if you think this movie is for you.4/10",

Excellent effects, very good and impressive work on the alien engines and spaceships, as well as in the whole design. Performances were satisfactory and the film gave the maximum direction and acting for the specific script. The end is a bit short and implies sequel, but personally I would prefer to give half an hour more and show e.g. bit more in the alien ship, perhaps some sabotage of the protagonists that would lead to victory against the aliens even in that area. Unfortunately with this scenario, it did not come close to major films of the genre such as Independence Day, but nevertheless remains a fairly worthwhile proposal in the genre.

I skip most details, there are enough reviews. I give the film 4 stars because I love alien invasion films, actually liked the big aliens walking over roof tops, just wanted to see them more often, clearer, understand how they function, also liking the end with humanity annihilated (we suppose). It was not a real difficult film to watch.Of course some scenes in the film made me scream. I particularly didn't like Jarrod. No logic in all his actions & talk. The second worst scene was certainly the covering of the windows with bed sheets? Now that is defense!The highlight: near the end, after machine guns, bombs didn't kill the monsters. Jarrod hits the alien with a concrete brick, then bravely combats with his fists... that is the scene worth all the money you can spend on the film!!The end is not worse than, let's say what I've seen recently: The Crazies (2010). The nuclear bomb blast blows their truck off the road, but the couple walks off unharmed... right into the radiation at sunset or sundown... ah, that was terrible. Throughout Skyline victims are snatched in seconds, but the last fight on the roof top is endless and over the top. There are many films, where in a chase - for the sake of suspense - the evil party is not catching up with the victim, even though comparing to other scenes that should have been the case...I agree with one reviewer: no Uebermensch in Skyline who saves the world... that is a positive. Also agree that an alien invasion might rather turn out like this than most other films depict. The national interests of the superpowers would never lead to a coordinated action in time - nor might we have the weapons....now back to my philosophical bla bla:I think some reviews are too biased. Why complain about a few $ or an hour wasted. Check how many times you buy a beer when you had already enough, or how much time you waste at certain occasions.Sometimes there are euphoric comments for an absolutely dull commercial Hollywood film. One may tend to over/underrate films, if one watches only a certain kind of popcorn movies. Myself, I look at everything from 1890 till today. When you compare films of all genre, you start to judge differently. How does my 8* for Sunset Boulevard compare to 8* for I Stand Alone or Alien or La Soupe Aux Choux? Besides: a heretical question: is it normal to watch Star Wars IV 100+ times? And never have watched let's say some great 50ties SF flicks? How is the judgment of that viewer. Would you dare to question his holy grail? It's all biased.Today, big Hollywood films start to look all alike, same plots, jokes and over-engineered. Rare to get a new idea. Why do we need remakes of good old films we can buy on DVD? Ocean 11, Ocean 12, Ocean 13. Is THAT what you like? Because when I check the ratings, they are high. Not because the films are good, but because a lot of I'd judge younger film goers write in IMDb for such films. Quantiy has never been a prove for quality. So many 9* for an average action flick does not mean it's great by any standard. Just a view of a group of movie goers who are in the web more present. I am suspicious for the high number of 10*, looks fishy. Best is to look at the Gaussian distribution pattern of votes to spot such deviances. Certain Turkish films being at the bottom of all films here show clearly politically motivated manipulation of film rating distribution (check e.g. Keloglan kara prens'e karsi (2006). As I wrote in the title, I buy also DVDs of films with low ratings. Why? Because I want to judge myself. Of course most of these films are B-Movies from the 50/60ties (e.g. the Something Weird collection). Some are really better than their reputation. Others not: Jess Franco is totally overrated. Even though if I give some of his films only 3, or 2*, I bought the DVDs... just cannot watch them more than once. Have you never seen a film with so bad acting that it was fun to watch?For example, if you check Amazon.com 20 Movies So Bad They're Good, there is the ultimate cult film Plan 9 from outer Space. Now you can judge the film for it's making, story etc. Or you can like it even more just like me because a) I love Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson and last not least Vampira. I have many films with them, and b) the most exciting with 50ties SF is when you spot the wires which hold the UFO etc... fantastic! So It's a prove you can like bad films.Now again look at this Amazon list: there is Foxy Brown!! How come? What kind of nut-head would put that film in such a list. It's full of pep, fun, action and has a sassy Pam Grier. All what I say is you cannot logically always agree with all others on the \"quality\" of a film. Here, most writers are young and their comments are less differentiated. It's not always black or white.Be happy movie goers & collectors!Last not least: Before I decided to write here, I opened a bottle of Chardonnay and read through the comments for Skyline - it was almost as much fun as to watch the film!",

Thanks to powerful computers and software, you can make a professional looking movie with a workstation from the children's room.BUT - if you want to make a good movie - and it's possible that every director and producer wants to make a good movie - you have to invest time and knowledge and inspiration, in the first place.Reading \"Movie making for dummies\" is NOT enough to make a solid movie between all perfect CGI effects. We, the movie-goers, pay the efforts of the artists and technicians happily, if we feel, the whole artwork is carefully prepared and assembled. If not, we are rightfully pi**ed off.This production is fairly expensive compared with other independent works, but it seems that someone some morning woke up in a hotel suite and said to the LA morning glow \"let's spend 10 Millions to make an Alien Invasion movie that begins on a sunny LA morning...so we don't have it far to the set\".Visuals in this Movie are top, like in District 9, but everything other is complete forgettable - dialogs and acting near to the Christian 2012 movie. Now, D9 was nearly thrice expensive, but far better developed than Skyline, and nobody can convince me that 20 Millions are needed only to write a better script.My personal conclusions here are: Producing great fireballs with gas from the oven is possible even when the huge windows are smashed and people can breathe. When it comes to their extinction, people sit around and do nothing, and they will be extinguished then. But they don't worry. They continue to riddle about what to to. It needs only a few hypnotic lights to take out the whole world within a few hours. Only those people who are sleeping deep from alcohol misuse will survive this first attack. Additionally, they must be shielded by blinds. Watching atomic blasts through spyglasses is not as harmful as thought. It makes you \"ouch\" only. The Air force is so dumb, they attack on the brink of human extinction from only one side, so it's easy for aliens to defend. Aliens which are nearly indestructible even by an atomic blast can be seriously hurt with .50 bullets or even bricks. The aliens which are the eating brains kind (like people eat cow brain) can be simply poisoned and overtaken by some (red) brains, who a) are partially pre-hypnotized and b) father-to-be and c) deeply in love.

            "content": "I was going to give Skyline a miss due to all the negative commons floating around, but I'm big fan of Sci-fi so watched it anyway.After seeing the movie I felt impelled to sign up to IMDb to give my comments. I'm certain lot of reviewers simply follow the critics like sheep and give bad reviews just because a majority of other people have, sad really..The movies starts with the invasion which is in the form of bright lights dropped from mother ships that draws humans in by a kind of hypnosis then the movie jumps backs 15 hours where we see the main characters Jarrod (Eric Balfour 24) and Elaine landing in LA to visit Jarrod's best friend Terry ( scrubs Donald Faison ), Terry is a movie/music video director/producer ( this isn't clear and isn't really important ) Jarrod is an artist of some sort who's done some work for Terry and Terry wants Jarrod to move to LA to work full time with him... I mention this because some reviewers claim there is NO character development and they don't know what the characters do for a living or what their relationship is to each other, there is a little into the background of the characters but not a great deal because it's not important, these are just ordinary people that's what director I getting across to the audience..... Terry's also seeing his PA behind his girlfriends back, and Elaine tells Jarrod she is pregnant... Ordinary people, not hacker, fighter pilots or super soldiers The invasion happens in the early hours after a party at Terry's penthouse, we have the mother ship and a selection of different aliens, some seem to be part machine part organic and have the ability to self repair, these aliens for some reason need our brains and spinals cords to power their mechanical/organic bodies our brains/spinal cords seem to be useless after a few hours so they need lots of humans, the entire world in fact..Our group of survivors have various run in's with the alien creatures/machines and are abducted or killed one by one until only our 2 main characters are left, over the course of the movie Jarrod has been under the alien hypnosis a number of times but his abduction fails for various reasons. now as well as the hypnosis ( which makes it easier for the aliens to abduct/harvest humans ) the light seems to alter human chemistry ( which can be seen on Jarrod's body ) I'm assuming it's to minimise rejection the same way we give organ transplant patients drugs to stop rejection...The Aliens are simply too advanced and too powerful and even when the military manage to nuke one of the mother ships it simply rebuilds itself, and in the end Jarrod and Elaine are abducted.... Jarrod's Brain/Spinal cord is taken and transplanted into an alien creature, Elaine is taken elsewhere because she is pregnant, I assume they also have use for the unborn child and wish to remove it first before they remove her head and through away her body ( yes this is what they do) Now when Jarrod's brain is transplanted into an alien creature, Jarrod's own consciousness fight's back, Now remember that Jarrod has survived various abduction attempts and his chemistry/DNA altered days ago, enough time for his own defence's (antibodies etc) to mutate whatever the aliens have tried to do to him which explains why the integration hasn't worked properly, Jarrod here's Elaine's screams and goes to the rescue...This is where the movie ends, no Will Smith blowing up the aliens, no hacker planting a virus into a totally alien computer system ( as if ), no US Military saving the day...Now this is a intelligent persons sci fi, not everything is explained, you need to work things out, Plus it's not a happy ending which bothers some people.. felt like giving 10 stars just to offset the negative reviews, but I want to be honest... I give it 8",

            "content": "Many of the reviewers before have almost taken the words right out of my mouth. But, I still needed to contribute my two cents so that people don't question the validity of the negative reviews. 1. If you don't like ripoffs, you won't like this. (If you take Face/Off, Predators, Independence Day, Cloverfield, District 9, throw them in a stew, cook it too long, burn it, scorch it, and you will have created this movie.) 2. If you don't enjoy dialogue that is anything but original, campy, and quite frankly boring, you will not like this.3. If you do not like watching action movies with a scarce number of scenes that actually include action, you won't enjoy this film. (Okay, in fairness there was quite a bit of action, some of it over the top, but it paled in comparison to the amount of time you'll spend waiting for something to happen or tortured by the slow moving, uninteresting dramatic scenes.) 4. If you do not enjoy bad acting-like overacting to make up for a crappy script-not gonna like it. (Consider watching Chuck Norris, Steven Segal, and Van Damme left with no fighting and only their \"acting skills\".) 5. If you don't enjoy watching badly developed characters that you can't like if you tried drawn to be your heroes and the ones you're supposed to root for-don't do it! 6. A story wrapped around a group of people constantly set up to seem like they're going to do something exceptional, but never actually do drive you nuts? Prepare to pull hairs.The makings of a great film, tragically falls short. If this was on Vimeo, it'd be cool and commended for its brilliant camera work and effects; the poor acting and unheard of actors wouldn't even be mentioned or taken into consideration. But when convincing people to spend 8-14 dollars on such a devastatingly terrible piece of work, this movie is a down right injustice.Don't pay to see this. Seriously, if the curiosity kills you, at least wait until you can get it free on Netflix or something. I assure you, you will be unhappy you wasted your money. I've seen movies I didn't like, but was at peace with my expense. This was not the case here.This deserves 3 stars only because the effects really were quite fantastic, though in some ways blatantly stolen from ID4 and Cloverfield. Sad because it had awesome potential.",

I had no problem with the plot and didn't get bored. Hell that's more than i can say for a lot of things that have come out of Hollywood lately. The film is about a group of people who are trying to survive during an alien invasion. As with most monster films the plot is a little thin, Lets face it this film is a Disaster/Alien-Invasion flick. If you goto the movies expecting a great plot involving Aliens, Monsters, Explosions or Disasters then keep dreaming. Anyway If you enjoyed Cloverfield, Godzilla or anything of that genre then i think you'll enjoy this film. Just switch your brain off and enjoy it for what it is. Otherwise go get District 9 on DVD.

            "content": "Knowing practically nothing about this film before sitting down in the cinema, I had hope that Skyline would continue to tread the high-quality benchmark set by Moon and District 9 in consecutive years; here we have a sci-fi film made on a shoestring budget ($10 million, entirely financed by the directing duo of Colin and Greg Strause) with a promising concept that could have tapped into the human condition, a theme that made the previous two films so critically successful. What I got was nothing of the sort.Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) sleep over at Terry's (Donald 'Turk from Scrubs' Faison, the only recognisable face in the movie) lavish Los Angeles penthouse, and are woken through the night by a bizarre blue light that attracts any human towards it if direct contact with the eye is made. The world is left in turmoil, as all communication is cut off and it becomes clear that the aliens have landed. There is never any point in the movie that strays from the single plot of 'here's a group of people that survived the massacre, now they have to stay alive.' If you haven't already guessed, this film draws immense parallels with Cloverfield, in that the motives and backstory of the creature are non-existent, and the events of the story are all seen through the point of view of a small group of people. Granted, the nauseating hand-held camera effect is spared, but the downfalls remain the same.The issue here is not the mystery of the invasion, but the poor construction of each character. We are offered the most archetypal, mundane group of individuals in recent cinema to root for (including the tough guy, nice girl, mean girl, anti-hero and token gun-toter) and their utter lack of development as the film progresses means that, by the time of the climax, it makes very little difference who is still alive anyway. I'm a firm believer in the idea that the script maketh the movie. Promote what could be an intriguing concept, follow it up with some legitimate effort in the screenplay department, and chances are you'll come up with a decent film. Sadly, this was not the case with Skyline. Each character spoke in nothing but clich\u00e9s, which certainly didn't assist the utterly wooden acting already on display. Terry's opening line is so horrendously awful that I can't decide whether it will incite uproarious laughter or, in my case, holding your head in your hands. And frankly, the dialogue fails to improve drastically from that point.So much of Skyline is adapted from other sci-fi films it's ridiculous. Along with Cloverfield, it riffs on scenes from War Of The Worlds, Independence Day and attempts to mimic the ending of District 9 in a manner so blatant it's almost offensive. The only saving grace of this film was the impressive way the producers were able to squeeze every penny of such a meagre budget with exceedingly impressive effects and CGI, which all seems like a waste in the context of such a poorly-planned endeavour.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",

Those that have seen the trailer expect to see a thrilling, apocalyptic, epic alien invasion film to rival films like Independence Day and War Of The Worlds. Whilst Skyline is heavily influenced by those films, it comes across as a mediocre attempt at making an alien blockbuster. The paper thin plot revolves around a rapper who's invited a bunch of friends over to his penthouse suite for a party. They all get drunk and wake up to find the world under attack by aliens and spend the rest of the film in the penthouse screaming and looking confused. That's it. Feeble attempts are made to give all the unlikeable characters some kind of depth but all you get are annoying American stereotypes, meaning you don't care what happens to them. The script is terrible and the rent-a-cast seem to act like the guys from Neighbours. Is there anything good at all you ask? Kind of. The film is directed by Colin Strause and Greg Strause, two brothers that have worked as visual effects designers and supervisors on some very big films (Avatar, 2012, 300). So, its no surprise to see that the action and special effects mostly warrant a viewing. There are some great monster sequences and some unique creature designs that are genuinely exciting if not scrutinized. Overall, the film isn't a good one. It's a mash up of ideas and visuals that doesn't gel well with their underdeveloped script. Most people won't be left feeling satisfied, especially after the truly ridiculous final act.",

If you're expecting District 9 then think again.But contrary to a lot of the opinions it's really not *all* bad. The final act does pick up the excitement level enough to be engaging. Some of the special effects - though unoriginal - are still very pretty. The ending is refreshingly dystopian.The last few minutes unfortunately come off as kind of laughable when viewed in the context of the rest of the movie, but taken as a stand alone idea it's actually pretty interesting and almost poignant.I watched Battle: Los Angeles last week and it was a complete struggle to get through - even for a war movie fan like myself.

So here's this LA alien invasion movie (LA being popular with invading aliens) and I've given it a wide berth for a while now, hearing so many mixed reviews. And immediately I'm saying to myself 'I love what they're doing here, bringing their own concepts to a pre-loved genre,' but then where it excels, it seems to fall short in equal measures elsewhere.My gripe is that it's one part character building for characters you can't possibly care about and then two parts shallow spectacle (bringing back those cool concepts, lashings of action, really well done CGI with great texturing etc) where we ask ourselves how much of the beginning of the movie could we have done without if only to have more of a final act?! Do you get me? It teased rather than gave. After all it delivered, it was all just a tease to say \"give us more money and we'll give you more movie\" only it's not the ending I didn't like. It's that they took a whole movie to get to a point that could have been reached within the space of half a movie (if it was up to a certain Mr Blomkamp).And that reminds me that I've been watching the lovechild of Independence Day and District 9.Eric Balfour was in his element for action, David Zayas stole it and Donald Faison seemed wasted, if not out of place. In fact, the way the movie goes everybody seemed a bit of a waste.Startling, dazzling, exciting, cool, grisly, edge of your seat...For part of the duration at least.

This movie looks like an intelligent, well made, alien invasion film. It is not intelligent, and it is not well made. The film quite simply is a cheap sci-fi flick we call \"B-movies\". Complete with over the top shrieking women, and macho men who bite off more than they can chew, this film is a total disaster. The story begins nowhere, goes nowhere, and winds up in a mucky & grotesque startling turn for an ending which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The film wastes about a half an hour on senseless back story about the unlikable characters, and it does it in such a way that it has absolutely no impact on the story itself. When you take out the senseless and worthless back-story/setup, the film has approximately an hour of actual time to do everything else with the alien invasion. Even the alien invasion is a HUGE letdown, showing us nothing more than what the trailer already had. The majority of the storyline is the unlikable characters holed up in a single building. There were 3 things that kept popping into my mind during the movie: 1>This is exactly like a cheap B-movie with unknown actors, bad acting, and crappy special effects. 2>I was bored, and wanted the film to end 3>Aside from the crappy back-story that wastes the first 30 minutes of the film, the rest of it is a badly done space invaders version of Cloverfield. A giant monster savages LA, while the unlikable characters struggle to avoid its minions which get deployed into the high rise apartment building, looking for humans to eat/abduct/decapitate. I am thinking for the words to express how bad this movie is, but I just can't think of words which would express it. I LOVE Sci-Fi films having anything to do with space, aliens, futuristic battles/weaponry. This film satisfies none of those desires. It leaves you wondering how the director fooled us all with a cool trailer. This movie will officially be recognized as one of the biggest flops in modern sci-fi history. I have a feeling this film had a decent budget, but the movie comes off like a bad B-movie with no plot. Let's talk about the plot. There is none. Simply idiots who we don't care about anyway trying to avoid being taken by the Octopus creatures with 18 Kmart blue light special light bulbs for eyes. Yes, all the aliens seem to have the appearance of a giant Octopus and blue light bulbs for eyes. In short, if you see this movie, you will agree with everything I have said unless you are an idiot who is entertained by bad sci-fi flicks with bad special effects, and a total lack of anything resembling a plot, or likable characters.",

The main guy is just not likable and neither is his woman. The Spanish guy is the only one with any real character and even he's little more than a cardboard cutout.

The effects : Weak. I know their budget was limited, but that guy who made that 3 minute alien invasion movie on his computer did a great job, while these guys got enamored with bright blue lights and decided that would be the basis for everything. Weak. A couple of the alien ships looked OK, but nothing spectacular. Looked like they stole the design for the Sentinels from the Matrix and added some blue lights and called it a day. The one big sized alien (they come in 3 sizes) looked pretty cool. Other than that, not much. The \"battles\" with the us air force were pretty weak too. They nuked the city of L.A. yet the windows were intact like a mile or two away from the blast center? Even a small tactical nuke would shatter every window (especially those facing the blast) for miles. Also, they'd probably be flash blinded by the detonation. Also there would be EMP effects. Also we don't have nukes that can be fired from drones that are incredibly acrobatic. Also we don't have incredibly acrobatic drones. In the grand scheme of things those are small details, but they just add on to an already kind of messy crap movie. The end is stupid and ridiculous and just kicks you in the groin after you've already gone 12 rounds with the heavyweight champ and you're down and out. They don't really explain, but the aliens take our brains and insert them into their bodies, or something. So they take the brain of the protagonist and put it into a body and he somehow rebels and protects his woman against the other aliens and it ends with him facing off with aliens inside the mother ship.

At first you think you can relate to the characters until you realize they're all based off of the pretense that they're all horrible people. So many people wont relate and likely look away from this movie and regard it as a joke.The script very consciously tries to make a moral point throughout the film but seems to disregard all of the characters in the story except for the one doorman that blows himself up to save the country from aliens. The moral of the story is: \"Do you want to be a hero? Be an inconspicuous doorman to a hotel, not one of those sex-crazed media industry fiends from LA\".If I could get over my doubts, I'd say it's a good film. The ending is also mind***ing.",

The film is pretty much the perfect example of all glitz no glamour, it is being kind to compare the film to such prior hits like Independence Day etc, this film, unless by some strange twist, is going to suffer on the poor critic reviews, and quickly is going to end up cut price in the DVD bargain bin at your local retailers.If you're making a film on a shoestring budget, make sure you have a great, if not solid script to start with, much of the dialogue appears to have been written during a lunch break from designing the impressive CGI, however impressive the CGI was, the script was a cure for insomniacs !",

In Skyline, ALL the actors work hard with a limited screenplay - Scottie Thompson, Eric Balfour, Donald Faison and David Zayas probably the most well-known of the cast.

            "content": "So, this will be a review not often read since Skyline's been released...a fan that actually likes the movie, but with a tub or so of salt.Note: Though I checked the \"May Contain Spoilers\" alert, I don't plan on giving away the movie, in case some of you are inclined to watch this in the theater or on Blu-ray.I almost bumped this back to the weekend after Skyline's opening, but I'm actually glad I went on its second day of release...very glad. This film certainly falls short of the mark of great film making, but there ARE good points about the movie, and it's a shame that most moviegoers will not boldly take a chance and miss out on them, for this is a movie to watch on the big screen with equally \"big\" sound to go with it. Watching this on anything less than a 50\" screen with 5.1 - 7.1 sound just won't cut it. And, just to try and convince you that I'm actually experienced with sampling the good with the bad, I've watched (and remember) over 1500 films of all genres, as my Netflix account will attest to.So, the bad points? A lack of strong characters, which would've helped propel the movie another score point. The Strause Brothers try to flesh out characters we can empathize with in the first 30 minutes of Skyline, but the effort falls flat. Surely, it would've helped to actually feel bad for the characters that meet with unpleasant (but, very convincing) ends. The script itself comes across as disjointed in certain parts of the film, but that can be easily overlooked, if you decide to allow yourself to be immersed in a visually rich alien invasion film. The acting is not bad, either, and there's where I expect some arguments. I've seen enough films to recognize truly bad acting, and while a couple performances were a bit understated in certain situations, the cast's efforts makes the tale convincing enough. Fortunately for the story, there's not much range needed here for showing terror, shock, and a desperate will to survive. Considering how well the cast interacts with their terrifying counterparts, the acting is done well enough to make things work.Any good points? Definitely enough. First and foremost, this is a film about an entirely speculative (and spectacular) event, so let's throw out all of the comments that may come our way about how \"unintelligent\" the movie's premise is, or even on how the events unfold. I'll bet my year's salary that there aren't any authorities out there on living through an alien invasion. Any takers? I'll admit that Skyline felt slow to me in the first 30 minutes (really, it did), but when the first events start, the movie doesn't let you go. The film's claustrophobic atmosphere is deliberate...you are SUPPOSED to feel like there's nowhere to go, and for the way things play out, the audience realizes (or should, at least) that there's nothing gained for the characters by leaving familiar territory. While alien invasion movies are anything but fresh, Skyline ventures into territory seldom traveled by giving us invaders we can see in broad daylight and in striking detail. The vista of invaders and defenders (being our military) being seen in full daylight is a treat worthy of mention. And, a big bonus with Skyline is that there are no easy solutions to mankind's dilemma. Just as the natives of North and Central America couldn't stand in the way of European expansion hundreds of years ago, there's no basis for us to think that mankind would fare any better from otherworldly visitors. So, the fact that the film has no happy ending will leave many domestic moviegoers with enough fuel to tell others to stay away.And, I feel that it's important to note that throwing gobs of money at a movie for special effects (i.e., Star Wars, Star Trek, Avatar, all of which are good in their own right) is sometimes an utter waste of the green. Skyline was produced and out the door for around $10 million, and though I know some of you are saying, \"Yeah, it shows!\", anyone that's seen the film would have to be legally blind not to see that the visual design and effects are absolutely top notch. Also, as a film score fan, Matthew Margeson's score for the film is definitely a worthy entry into the realm of film music...none of the tinny synthesizer-style music here, Margeson's work is a fully rich experience of orchestral sound with intelligence and poise.Considering that I'm giving the movie a C grade, there's still plenty of reasons to try and catch this one as a matin\u00e9e on the big screen with the sound design that goes with it, unless you have a good home theater ready to try this out. For all of Skyline's negative reviews, I'm sure you won't have to wait long to bring it home.",

Looking back at the time it was released, thanks to movies like Cloverfield and District 9, the alien invasion genre was very popular. This film just feels like Cloverfield meets a Sharknado-esque film. The acting is hollow, none of these characters are likeable, and they get picked off so quickly you don't get to form an attachment. The filmmakers use typical movie tropes like a woman revealing she's pregnant so the audience can endear themselves to her. It's not good, believe the bad reviews. If this had been released before those other alien invasion movies then I'd say you have something here, but it doesn't tread much new ground. It may as well be an Asylum film.",

Although some may disagree that they paid full price at the cinema, rather than a discount priced ticket for a budget movie.The film is all about the effects and these are done with great skill. Whether it's the up-close \"Scout-Hunter\" types, the much larger prowlers or the HUGE mother-ships, all had great attention to detail and were pretty scary.I think what puts most folks off this movie is the lack of any answers as to \"why are we being invaded?\", \"what is the light business all about?\" and \"how can our movie hero save the world?\".It's worth saying that it takes a bit of time to get going and it's only when a couple of major decisions are made that the film starts to get into gear, but once this ball starts rolling the whole experience improves dramatically.Personally I liked this film and feel it does its thing much better than the most recent Predator movies, on a much lesser budget.Unlike a lot of recent films where most \"twists\" are advertised long in advance, every time I had a question as to how something would be resolved, the film slammed in with some great WTF moments.So long as you don't go in looking for end-of-the film \"Packaged answers\", a deep storyline and \"by the book\" solving of the world ending, you'll have fun.

All I have to say is when I watched the opening sequence of this film, seeing the blue light engulf the room of the apartment of the characters before my eyes, I was wondering what is going on just like the actors did in this film. But then we cut to the title sequence of such and such a time earlier, and I just was thinking, oh crap not one of these films again where we go back to before and explain what just happened.Ya we get that the girl is pregnant, and pathetically in the end they use this as a tool, which is pretty lame as far as I'm concerned. All I can say is the stupid CGI was good,(sorry not a fan of CGI lazy man's way of creating)also the the actors were not bad, but it's too bad they had such a script so pathetically written. Also, what's up with the guy from the Texas Chainsaw remake, I thought he was cheesy in that movie, now we have him in this one, acting all clich\u00e9, whatever! Sorry this guy sucked in Chainsaw, acting like a fool, and he is put in this movie acting like a fool, by not really truly loving his woman, just like in Chainsaw. Like I said clich\u00e9. His second big film only 7 years apart and already type casted. How sad, NOT!Now we move past the actors and get to what is suppose to be the meat of the film, \"The Ending\". Oh come on, the male brain of the unhappy couple get's ingested by a freak alien race that loves to eat holographic CGI brains and gets taken over by the brain of the boyfriend,that doesn't even want to have a child at all, then he possesses the alien that eats the brain, and then tries to protect some chick that he knocked up, and fake loves her through the whole film? Come on! This movie had bad character plot, and just bad writing written all over it!The acting wasn't bad at all, it's the writing people! THE WRITING! This is a crossover from such films as Aliens, Cloverfield, and Independence Day, and nothing more.Oh wait! Look out! There's another piece of crap out right now that Hollywood has made, and that horrible masterpiece is BATTLE: LA. What's this about? Another problem with Los Angeles getting attacked by aliens?Blah I say! Don't quit your day job Hollywood! Sorry, but this is pathetic.The only films that I seem to like any more are the ones that are Independent, or just foreign, or direct to DVD.

It's an obviously CGI-heavy affair, but 'things' are kept at a distance, at least to begin with, which emphasises the claustrophobic nature of the situation, and the Bros. have done a good job in creating tension in the characters (and the audience) by their not understanding what is going on. The lack of A-list talent minimises distraction from the action, and keeping survival as the main objective again helps to keep things plausible. Oscar was predictably untroubled by Skyline, but there are no raspberries here either. Not in the league of Gareth Edwards' excellent 'Monsters', but the two make interesting companion pieces, they could almost be the same movie in alternate universes, showing what can happen depending what one spends one's shoestring on. (Edwards' budget for 'Monsters' was considerably less than the Strauses' at $800k vs $10M est.). It feels like most of The Strauses' budget went on CGI which, ultimately, does not better then film, whereas Edwards concentrates on his characters, recognising that it is through them that the audience relates to the situation and to the aliens. In the end Skyline is a better film than much of the criticism suggests, but while it is exciting and tense, Edward's film goes so much further, marking him out as the transcendent effects man to watch.",

That's because not only am I a movie buff but a HUGE alien conspiracy theorist as seen in some of my other posts. Skyline wound up to be my definition of a great alien invasion survivor movie.Here's the plot:After a late night party, a group of friends are awoken in the dead of the night by an eerie light beaming through the window. Like moths to a flame, the light source is drawing people outside before they suddenly vanish into the air. They soon discover an otherworldly force is swallowing the entire human population off the face of the earth. Now our band of survivors must fight for their lives as the world unravels around them.The Good:The movie felt original. There are a ton of alien invasion movies out there so for this one to stand out was shocking. I'll start with the special effects. The alien are a mixture of tech and organic life forms. The best ones being huge alien rovers that are about 10 stories high and reminiscent of the Rancor monster in \"Return of the Jedi\". The combination of these parts made the aliens seem indestructible and made me have an underling feeling of hopelessness for the characters throughout the movie. The ships were massive and brilliantly composed of the technology constant with the aliens that came from the ships. The effects never left you felling like this couldn't happen or pulled you out the movie.I've heard lately that people are knocking the cast and the story, but I found the story refreshing and the acting superb. If we were going to be invaded by aliens this is most likely how we would act. I think people missed the point of this movie. The movie is a visual exercise the emotional survival of people put in a horrible situation. Most of the time when you have a group of people in survival situation studios feel the need to exaggerate the individual characteristics of the each person. \"Skyline\" took the other approach and showed what happens in a group dynamic when tragedy strikes. Even when Oliver (David Zayas) gets into an argument with the lead character Jarrod (Eric Balfour) about his plan to escape and his changing (spoiler- can't say any more with out giving away a twist) you still have the sense that they will be together as a group struggling to stay alive. The actors bring a level of desperation most alien movies don't provide.The casting was right on; especially David Zayas, Donald Faison, and Eric Balfour. These three brought the movie to life, but it was Balfour that led the pack. As the lead character he had the job of not only keeping the tone of the movie but blending in to group and letting the other character flourish. This was the first staring role for Balfour and he pulled it off wonderfully. I can think of at lest half dozen movies in preproduction he would be perfect for. I won't even talk about David Zayas. He one of the good ones and when he's in a movie you only expect great acting, and he delivered again.I still can't understand how Donald Faison isn't a bigger star in Hollywood. This movie showcases how talented the guy can be. I want to say more about him in the movie but I can't spoil the plot twists for you. Let's just say for the part Faison has in the movie you will enjoy ever second.The Bad:All the female characters. The lead female character played by Scottie Thompson as Elaine came off as weak and whiny. The other two female characters played be Brittany Daniel and Crystal Reed came off as insignificant. They were more background then anything else. They did exist with in the group, but could have had a bit more presence in the movie.The worst thing that happened to this movie was it was advertised as an \"Independence Day\" type of movie. It should have been billed as a survival movie not as an alien invasion movie. Even though it may have followed the same theme \"Skyline\" had a better plot, writing, and organic feel to it.Over all:Skyline has become my 1# alien movie. From great new aliens to having a great story I would recommend this for anyone interested in the alien genre.",

I would not say it is at all a 'zombie movie'. It's a modern day alien movie and a pretty decent one with some awesome, up to date special effects and interesting creatures. As far as the story, wow the story is taking a beating too by some, it's not that bad a story at all. It's also one of those where you really don't know where it's headed and is full of suspense, surprises, some mystery. The movie is sci-fi, action, visually stimulating, not nerdy Star Trek. It is modern, good entertainment, worth the DVD rental, just get it.",

So watched it again last year, on a better 55\" and with a skyline 1080P resource instead of the crappy DVD + CRT combination back then.Anyway, I loved it again and just because it's not a typically Hollywood, action hero movie, it's is rated so low by many. I cannot think of something else. If you have some common sense, this movie is just way better dan the too high rated movies like Battleship, Battle LA, that movie with that guy Tom Cruise (2005).. all with real action heroes, kicking aliens arses.. Aliens who are able to travel the distances, land on earth, sucking up resources and people like we stamp on ants.. But on the end are just kicked in the arse by some real time action hero with a battleship from 1942, or whatever.. No way.. Skyline should have been rated with at leat 8 stars, because it is a true SciFi how it should be. Realistic and ends up pretty bad, but open. This movie got me right away when the blue light visitors came to hunt. No talking, no communication, just destruction of humans is what they want. The world would end at that moment aliens like them would visit us. No chance, just hands down on your knees and let it come... Skyline 2 should be next, but I think the makers are afraid because Movies are mostly watched by braindead sheeple.. Give me a break and shout it out for skyline2.. But on the other hand, skyline 2 has no further meanings, humanity is gone and all we have is an Alien worker with brains of an human survivor trying to protect is wife and offspring. And should be overrun anyway.. So we all know how it will end up... Well done and hands down for the makers.. be a thinker, not a follower.. This one is one of my top 5 scifi movie all times.",

            "content": "Interesting sci-fi from directors Colin and Greg Strause (Alien vs Predator: Reqiuem) who funded the project themselves. The budget was clearly kept low on the actors but high on cgi. Unusual but I think wise. I had never heard of any of the actors but I found all the performances believable. Do you want more than that? Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his pregnant girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) have travelled to Los Angeles to meet Terry (Donald Faison) and his wife Candice (Brittany Daniel). Terry meanwhile is having a fling with lover Denise (Crystal Reed), J. Paul Boehmer also appears as Colin and Tanya Newbould as Jen. Robin Gammell makes a very short appearance as Walt. David Zayas is Oliver.After a party in Terry's flat, everyone is awoken by blue beams of light coming from outside, and when Ray (Neil Hopkins) stares into it veins start to grow all over his eyes, cheekbones and shoulders, and his eyes go mottled-opaque and he seems to have been taken over by an unknown force.Pretty soon all the characters are on the run from the alien invaders who are attacking everything that moves and swallowing human beings. The cast is picked off one by one and no plan to escape seems the slightest use. The United States Air Force launch an attack against the aliens, but only succeed in annoying them more. Defeat is inevitable.This film fails in some areas (likeability of lead characters for instance) but succeeds in others (avoiding the usual plot directions and heading for a happy ending). Overall not as bad as you might think. But it's not going to win any awards.",

The major flaw in the film is the actors, Donald (best known as Turk)was one of the stronger character, but because the script was lacking of anything Donald was restricted of his acting ability. Also I was disappointed when he was killed of so quickly in the film. The film does go down hill in the ending, leaving you asking why didn't they just end it at this part.

Then there's the inconsistencies of the film. I'm all for the suspension of disbelief and allowing yourself to be lost in the film going along for the ride but this movie is so bad that you find yourself sitting there thinking \"I'm very aware I'm watching a movie right now.\"The dialogue is stiflingly painful to listen to and yet manages to be excruciatingly dull at the same time, while the acting makes you pray for an alien abduction so you don't have to sit through anymore of the mind numbing dullness. This movie is in fact so dull that the only time your pulse will raise above \"coma\" will be when you jump out of your seat to cheer as the main characters are executed by the invading alien force and believe me when I tell you that doesn't come quick enough.On that note the so called resistance by the humans appears on screen as nothing more than a limp wristed slap with a wet fish. Then there's the ending which could possibly be the worst ending to a movie, ever.This movie would have been better served as a disaster movie parody, unfortunately it was a serious attempt at entertainment and for that reason 1 star is far to generous.

Laughable yet not funny at all, first time writer Joshua Cordes did an amazing job of trying to earn himself a Razzie award for Worst Screenplay. I can't say anything about the cast because apocalypse movies' cast is always the unknowns and are usually bad. But given all the negatives, I think the visual and CGI effects are a bit wonderful.

Instead of a sprawling epic with multiple converging story lines and a full explanation of what is transpiring, it chooses a different approach for relatively the same basic story. Here is what is apparent to me as an explanation; A bio-mechanical alien race resembling phosphorescent fish and the Matrix sentinels came to earth to harvest our human brains. Each brain harvested is inserted into an alien being which in turn goes out to harvest more brains, multiplying and conquering the planet (think Invasion of the Body Snatchers, kind of.) The premise sounds like 1950's alien B-movies, but it is done in such a way that is not campy. Sure it doesn't explain everything, but it gives the viewer enough to be entertained. The human element/drama is decent and engaging. Also, It really is worth the watch for the visuals alone. The artistic direction is beautiful and well done. It's not trying to be a blockbuster and i think that is what i find appealing.",

If you do not understand cinema and you are fans of Hollywood averaging effects and explosions, You can should go and see this movie.I must say that after all the times I kept saying to myself \"what a bad movie\" In the film, break, when i went to bathroom, while buying popcorn, in the car , when sleeping, I must admit that the movie has a potential.The problem is that the filmmakers took a risk and choose unknown actors to play in this movie with a \"non easy\" like science fiction and the don't had much luck with that, in this case - they were poorly acting, Bad actors, bad script , just a bad bad movie. i should say that the effects were not so bad but pretty cheap.The idea of the film is quite similar to the film J.J Abrams: \"CLOVERFIELD\" When focusing on a group of people trapped in the building during scary time with invading aliens that come to earth and destroy anything. But why L.A?, what about the rest of the world? (just from Curiosity :) ) the reason I gave the movie 4 points is for just thinking about the investment effects. except this, the film doesn't deserve any more points.Maybe if J.J Abrams was taking this project over, it wasn't so bad and actually was more than a 2-3 effects scenes.",

Whilst Cloverfield isn't my favourite film, it was at least original, and, had an interesting approach to 'monster movie' making. Skyline tries to emulate Cloverfield but the characters are poorly conceived, their reactions to the situations are not at all believable, and if they were as stupid as they appear to be would be the first to succumb to the aliens not some of the last as we're asked to believe.

Sure the premise was intriguing, the trailers somewhat awe inspiring, and the notion that the Strause brothers were going to take the next step after their work on AVP Requiem. This is not the case. The movie, as I said before, had an intriguing premise(coupled with seeing a mondo sized promo poster for it plastered on the side of a building in downtown San Diego while I attended this year's Comicon). People are not taken physically by the aliens, but in an imaginative, and visually dazzling way: they \"look into the light\" and are whisked away to the motherships. That's where the intrigue ran out. What follows is a slightly hum drum attempt to make the film intense. Sure the Strause brothers used VFX in ways all the other directors would look down upon,(slow mo sequences, Aeriel assault sequences,etc.) which makes those VFX scenes the only engaging parts of the rest of the movie. As more time passes watching the film, I couldn't help but laugh when I noticed the similarities to the 1950's sci-fi movies which were vehicles for the red scare (IE: the aliens want your brains=the Soviets want to control your thoughts). And, of course, this film followed the clich\u00e9 of all alien films with gory and invasive ways people die and become brain food for the aliens. This method way already used up in the first movie it was used in. No originality there. The ending is somewhat different. Not totally original mind you, but innovative for this caliber of film. Sadly, this didn't save the film. The one benefit to seeing the film in the theater is getting to feel the scope of the alien presence and the magnitude of their methods. Either way, this film would make a good weekend popcorn flick to watch when you really don't care what you are watching. If you do feel the need to see it in theaters, go to a matin\u00e9e, not a late show. Otherwise, wait for block buster and save your money.",

The story basically ran they a couple went to see a high school friend for his birthday partied one night, and BAM alien invasion. I won't ruin the movie (more than what it already is), but I cannot stand when Hollywood puts out a movie and spends 7/8 of their finances in the CG and not can't afford decent writers. I went to the theater tonight looking for a steak for dinner and got a hot dog. They left the movie open for a sequel but I cannot say that they will get any more of my money. I just wish for once we the audience wouldn't be treated as some child with ADHD looking for the bright and shiny object dangling in front of.......oh look a kitty (hahaha)",

            "content": "I decided to see the movie Skyline because some people, meaning a lot, hated it, and some loved the movie. I watched it with my brother and he said he liked it, and so did I. I can't understand all the hate around this movie. I know there were some minor plot holes in it, and some lame acting, and some other things, but those effects were absolutely out of the park. Is the only reason some people don't like this is because the aliens didn't look like they wanted them to? Because Eric Balfour's character is actually cool? I don't know. If you don't like this movie, please don't say my review wasn't helpful. It is my opinion, after all. Anyway, I will say right now that I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a super stickler about movies, and likes alien surreal disaster movies. It did make me cringe in one scene, though, when _________ dies. Oops! Hahahahahaha! Besides that point, I'm sure you will like this movie if you want to have a night out with your friends. Let me start now with the special effects. They came from the masterminds behind Avatar, Iron Man 2, and 300. That's when you know they're going to be good. One of the great things about this movie is that all of the aliens aren't exactly the same. Movies like Alien and Predator are those kinds of movies where the movie is just a bunch of different aliens, some different, a bunch that are all the same. You don't see that a lot these days. I don't know how people pull off this kind of realness, but let me tell you, in the main alien scenes, they are awesome. However, some parts, but only some, are cheesy. Not many, though. To JeremyJahns on Youtube *little copyright symbol*, your review was really against my opinion of the movie. I know that your review is your opinion, but I just thought I'd say that. To the acting. Not super awesome, but OK. Just like the acting from Dinoshark, another Eric Balfour movie. So not exemplary, like the effects, but it's tolerable, I guess. It's one of the reasons I only give this a 7. It also gets a little \"WHY THE HECK WOULD THEY DO THAT\", meaning you don't want whatever happens to happen but it still happens anyway. I do agree with some people though, who say that this movie would be a lot cooler if it as like Cloverfield, you know? Hey great party guys! Oh look aliens! Lets make a movie and value my camera over everything else! Ahhhhhh! You know? But anyway. And so what if some of the aliens look like the collectors from Mass Effect (VG 2007)? They're still really awesome! Now the plot. It was really kind of generic, and not really original. It was basically these people were having a party, aliens came, we tried to fight them off, so on and so forth. If it was something like they themselves found a way to fight them off, then it would be a lot more interesting. That's what I have to say about that. That was my review of Skyline, thanks for reading, and see ya later!",

It is no surprise that filming only cost $500,000, while digital effects cost an additional $10 million. The Brothers Strauss, who directed this movie, come from a background in visual effects, and it is clear that is where their talents lie.In the end, I didn't care about a single character in this movie, and at a mere ninety minutes, it dragged considerably.

It plays like two part miniseries for the Syfy channel, not for the big screen! Performance wise, probably David Zayas is worth a mention and does a job, but the others are either bland or annoying. Visual effects are fantastic and it's not a surprise because Colin and Greg Krause are effects masters having worked on a vast array of movies for the best part of 15 years. Same guys who directed this mess directed Alien vs Predator: Requiem. The latter I'd hail as a masterpiece compared to this! I don't know, maybe they wanted to try something different? But a lot of what I saw was just from other movies. Indepence Day, War of the Worlds, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, I could go on, but I won't. Other than what I've mentioned.....nothing! The film is, at best worthy of a rainy night pay per view. Movie goers are not easily fooled these days. And I'll consider this as a brave attempt, but Greg and Colin should stick to their day jobs.

            "content": "I'm really not sure how to review this movie. Skyline is one of those love it or hate it type of movies, and its hard to pinpoint exactly why its good or bad. I can address some of the movie's biggest flaws though.Right off the bat, the biggest flaw is the story. The story is as minimal as possible, and this doesn't allow the viewer to feel for any of the characters because it just doesn't tell us anything. As the movie begins we see strange lights coming down to LA and it looks promising enough. The acting is very hammy as is immediately evident by the introduction of our main-characters who's names I can't even remember. They visit a friend, and from there on the movie almost feels like a soap for 15 minutes. We find out that the girl is pregnant, but as a viewer you just can't care for her situation because you barely even know these people.After another few minutes of filler, the strange lights come down to the city and we see the opening again... Why? I suppose it was meant to be some sort of clever re-cap of what happened before the opening, but since the movie explains so little this just feels silly and tacked on. Then the alien spaceships begin invading earth which looks like something out of a video game-cutscene. Maybe people will say that it looks amazing in 3D, but I don't care. My policy is that a movie should do well in any format.The best thing I can compare this movie to is Cloverfield, but still Cloverfield had more of a resemblance to a story then Skyline and the actors in Cloverfield were a lot more convincing as well. There is no explanation to why the aliens came to earth out of all planets, and apart from a clue at the end (which I'm not gonna spoil) its not very clear why they are harvesting human beings as well. At some points the action gets intense, but again this feels like you are watching something out of a video game.Its not all hopeless though. The cinematography is alright, and the overall directing is okay. If the creators would've given me at least one shred of a storyline I could easily give this movie a much better rating. As it is, this is the kind of movie you rent at the videostore, you watch it with some buddies, and when you return the movie the next day you've already forgotten what it was about. Skyline is a movie for only the most die-hard of alien/monstermovie fanatics.",

Then afterwards, flashes back to tell us back story 15 hrs. before events occurred\u0085and those 15 hrs. had nothing to do with the Aliens\u0085just horrible dialog which attempts to build characters which nobody cares about nor contributes to the story behind the aliens. 7.

I bet this movie does real well in Japan because a lot of their cinema doesn't REQUIRE a happy ending like the USA people EXPECT out of a movie.

            "content": "I think this has to be the most under-appreciated movie of the year. It is not your boilerplate sci-fi action film (though that is the way it was advertised). Instead this movie has stuck with me because it perfectly captured the feeling of a lucid dream, in this case a nightmare about being chased by monsters.What is lucid dreaming? Some people are able to realize when they are dreaming and intentionally introduce changes to the dream. It's sort of like 'Inception' but you don't really have that much control. Instead, lucid dreaming is like a battle between your sub-conscious and your conscious minds. Especially when you're having a nightmare, you try to introduce 'good' elements into the plot but then your sub-consciousness undermines them.I literally could not count the number of times I have had dreams like 'Skyline'. As things get worse I try to imagine new ways to win, or at least, escape. These dreams remind me of that iconic movie shot where the hero is having a nightmare and they're trying to run for the exit but the hallway keeps getting longer and longer, the door further and further away. In the case of 'Skyline' the dream is about an alien invasion of Earth. There's just the slimmest attempt at character development, just enough to establish a group of Good Guys for you to root for. From there it's all down-hill. The action and special-effects are excellent, exactly what you would expect from a sci-fi summer blockbuster. (There's also an obvious nod towards 'Matrix'.)What turns people off, I think, is the lack of resolution. I don't want to give any spoilers here but this is not a standard Hollywood ending. As I said from the beginning this is like a lucid dream where the dreamer/hero keeps trying to introduce new story elements to turn things around, rescue the day. At the end, the story takes yet another -- but even more unexpected -- twist, and then stops. Exactly like a dream.Hopefully, if people go into the film without any preconceived notions about how it should end, they might enjoy it more. I certainly did! In fact, I would credit it with attaining Art status, in the same way that 'Blade Runner' or 'AI' managed to transcend mere Film status.",

In fact it reminds me of the awesome Judas Priest track Cathedral Spires.The negative criticism of this film by most critics is phenomenal. I can't see the flaws that have been picked out. The film is a roller coaster with many great incidents that increasingly ramp up and ramp down.The film is aware of what has gone before and nods to films such as Cloverfield and Independence Day.

It opens by throwing the viewer right into the action. The aliens arrive and people are being taken right out of the main characters apartment. This is a good movie opening, characters you don't know are thrust into crisis, great time for character development, but what happens next is a step backward. The film then stops cold to tell you what happened 15 hours earlier. This movie tactic can be successful but you have to have interesting characters to do it with. These characters were not interesting and the scripted dialog did not help one bit. Some people may be disappointed by the fact that the movie does not have a game winning touchdown at the end. Indeed the entire movie is pretty much earth getting eaten up and spit out by the aliens. However the fact that Earth doesn't win, is not the reason this film doesn't succeed. The film fails because you, as the viewer, just don't care. I have watched many French films and lots of those have sad endings, endings you may have not preferred but at least the films made you care about the characters. The one original thing in this movie is the fact that earth doesn't win. There is nothing we can do to stop the aliens from taking all our brainstems and harvesting the planet. Or is there? The ending kind of left this question open ended. The main character comes back to fight for his baby's momma even after they remove his brain and place it in what appeared to be an alien body/robot/tool/. Apparently he loved her so much that he overcame his alien controllers' plan for him. Since no one else on earth could possibly love his wife(husband, child, brother, etc.) this strongly we are all doomed. It seemed as all the other transplanted brains just went along with the new alien agenda. So now its him versus the whole alien horde. This film should be avoided.",

            "content": "If you pay money to watch this crap, you're an awful human being. Why? Because by paying to see it, you're telling the idiots that made it that they succeeded, when, in fact, they did not. Too many people were drawn in by flashy special effects in trailers and Turk from Scrubs as it is because there is a completely unnecessary and utterly unwanted sequel already in the works.First of all, this movie is rather low budget for a disaster movie. They skimped on talent both in front of and behind the camera. Their special effects are mediocre at best. I've seen video games with more believable CG in them. The entire movie making process from conceptualization to release date took less than a year and it REALLY shows.The acting is god-awful. Not a single one of the characters is remotely sympathetic, and provide little to the story except an urge to root for the aliens. Multiple rewrites are very evident in the script to anyone with half a brain, and rather than going back and fixing things that have already been shot, they just left them as is, so there are vast inconsistencies and plot holes large enough to drive a REAL alien invasion movie like Battlefield: LA through.I hated every single second of this horrible monstrosity, from the beginning to the end. The only bright point in it was that it DID end. Two things above all others stood out to me, and they really illustrate how shoddy the entire movie is, and how quickly it was slapped together.First of all is a character I like to call the \"suspicious guy\". None of the characters in this movie were memorable enough for me to even remember their names once it was over, and so I call them by their respective stereotypes. Douchebag, whiny bitch, helpless damsel in distress, token black guy, and suspicious guy. Now, the \"suspicious guy\" usually makes his appearance in a murder mystery, or a slasher movie. He's the paranoid guy that starts accusing all of the other characters of being the killer. OK, that's fine for a slasher movie, but an alien invasion movie? Seriously? WTF! Yeah, all of the other characters are CLEARLY at fault for the freakin ALIEN INVASION that you can look out the freakin' window and see that they have absolutely nothing to do with. Good job writers. Did you, perhaps, forget to send the memo to this character that you'd changed genres halfway through filming? And second is this nugget of awesomeness. This is a plot hole so incredibly huge that it would have sunk the entire film even if every other aspect of it was Oscar winning material (which is most certainly is NOT). The alien technology is powered by human brains. OK, that's a cool idea and all, but it doesn't work. How could they develop technology powered by human brains if they've never encountered humans before? Where did the burnt out brains that they are discarding for new ones come from if they've only just invaded? How did they make it from whatever planet they came from, across the vastness of space, without such a crucial component of their technology? It doesn't make any sense at all, and the writers should be utterly ashamed of themselves for even trying to incorporate this idea.Lastly, I have to address the trailer. The trailer to this movie made it seem as though the entire movie was based upon a quote by Stephen Hawking, who is likely still weeping over it. In the trailer it showed news clips with a reporter talking about it, or some such. Guess what. If you watch the actual movie there is not a SINGLE place in it where that could actually have happened. This means that they finished their awful piece of garbage, and heard about Stephen Hawking's quote and decided, hey, let's use it to sell a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it at all AFTER THE FACT.In short, this movie is awful. It is poorly written, poorly acted, poorly thought out, the special effects are laughable at best, and five minutes into it you're rooting for the aliens to horribly murder every single character in it. If you value your dignity DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, AND CERTAINLY DO NOT WATCH THE Sequel DUE OUT IN 2012!!!",

But nevertheless it still got some entertainment to offer. The story is something which has been played through a dozen times, but the same accounts for zombie films. But for some reason Zombie films are interpreted way more carefully than alien invasion movies.It is certainly better than the 4.5/10. The actors are b-grade actors, but it doesn't matter in this case, there is no real character development anyway. The movie is really static and localized, and you can see that the budget is not comparable to War of the worlds etc, I suppose they invested the major amount of the money in CGI, which is really good. At least this movie is more entertaining than \"The Invasion\" which got a budget 8times the size.I think it isn't an appropriate movie for theaters, but OK for a DVD on a Sunday afternoon. It is a watchable movie, which won't disappoint if your expectations are well set.",

I don't even want to compare this movie to any other alien movie, because it doesn't deserve it. The script was just plain sh*t. There was no substance, and the actors who executed it, looked like p*rn stars who wanted a talking role. The dialogue was extremely irritating, and I wanted to punch every character in the face. It was predictable, boring, and monotone. Every 5 min, you'd ask \"WHY?\" I can't believe how much money went into such a big pile of cr*p.

The CGI special effects are very good, the acting (by a cast largely unknown to me at least) pretty good, competent, convincing. In many respects, I preferred it to War of the Worlds or Independence Day. Why? Both of those films were spoilt for me with cloying sentimentality and corny aspects to the plot (was I the only one who couldn't wait for the Martians in War of the Worlds to blast the two kids? OK, so I'm at the grumpy old man stage of life!). Skyline by contrast is rather bleak but plausible. Maybe the absence of a happy ending put some people off but I thought this was a decent movie, it certainly held my attention for the duration. Not a masterpiece but I suggest you give it a try, particularly if you like sci-fi. Like me, I suspect you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "One must wonder why the Strause Brothers decided to create a \"small\" budget movie. Is it an answer to D9? or where they just bored and decided to make a movie just for the heck of it. In my opinion, it must be the latter.Skyline has all the makings of a horrible straight to DVD release. Poor script, poor actors and very clich\u00e9d scenes.The basic storyline of this movie is that some attractive 20 somethings wake up after a party to find out that aliens have invaded earth. Sounds familiar ? It does sound similar to Cloverfield. The Aliens blow up everything, and suck humans to take their brains to use as batteries, again sound similar? It is quite similar to War Of The Worlds.The actors, who apparently are TV actors (I haven't seen them before, except the \"guy from scrubs\") are horrible, it was almost as if they were just hired just to stand there and look good, with a budget in between 10-20 million, did the brother strause use the money well?. In comparison, another movie, Moon, with a puny budget of 5million, managed to snag a very talented Sam Rockwell. For TV actors, they were pretty poor.Visually, the movie was decent, for directors who specialise in Visual Effects, it was almost a given that the effects will look good. It was decent, but didn't dazzle, unfortunately the brothers strause continues to overload with the VFX, yet disappoint with the story and practically everything else. In turn, the characters feel as if they are made of cardboard, and I feel no sympathy for them, especially what happens at the conclusion.In regards to the conclusion of the movie, it was arguably the worst part of the film, once again heavy on the clich\u00e9s and it feels as if it was put in there just to give an excuse to make a sequel to this movie. It was during this part that I almost felt the need to leave the cinema (something I have promised myself not to do as movie prices have risen)Overall Skyline was a poor movie, heavy on clich\u00e9s as well as copy and paste feel to it.The Movie has the look as if it was made especially for a straight to DVD, and I wonder how it wasn't. This movie furthers the point the the Brothers Strause should stick with VFX",

Oh no it makes the viewer think, oh the horror(can you smell the sarcasm). Now at first glance i thought \"this looks like what Cloverfield should have been\" and on the surface visually yes i still believe that, but i could apply that same logic towards quite a few other \"sci-fi\" movies. Now as far as Balfour being the star, no complaints he did the best he could with what he had to work with, All things considered he did a fine job when you factor in that the script was very poorly thrown together(not the story or even how it progressed). The lines were very over worked rewritten forms of almost every sci-fi clich\u00e9 available. With that being said, for those viewers who actually had the ability to think on the go while they watched this film then I'm sure I'm not alone when i say that this movie did nothing but lay the ground work for the greater part of the story as still yet to come. will i watch the sequel, most definitely, am i looking forward to it...and again yes i am. When you sit down to watch this movie, forget all the hype, all the negative or for that matter positive reviews, forget everything you may have seen or heard. Just take this as the introduction of the characters there motivation's and quite simply whats going on, if you do that by the end of this movie i think you'll agree something great is coming.",

I could have accepted the script similarity to Cloverfield (young people, party, monsters appear, they try to run, ***MAJOR SPOILER*** they all die). I could accept the similarity of the creatures to the Matrix sentinels. I could accept the similarities to people being taken as in war of the worlds. The big issue with this movie is that it is in fact a continuous climax. The characters are always in danger. Some die, but not the major characters. After 30-40 minutes, this becomes obvious. They are still put in life or death situations, but instead of me being caught by the action, feeling for the characters, hoping they will survive, I KNOW they will survive. They obviously are NEEDED to deliver some weird ending. Also, it is obvious that the battle is not one that we can win. You can't win against a creature that survives anything you throw at it. There are no obvious weak points, and the hope that some weakness will be found is 100% gone after the alien ship is nuked but re-generates. But I was convinced we can't win much earlier. After the creature is hit by a SUV in the basement parking, and it comes back to \"life\", it is clear there is NO weapon you can use to actually kill one of those things. If an arm survives, than it can regenerate. I will not go into the biological impossibility of that, as there are things you need to take for granted in a SciFi movie. Revival is possible only with huge energy expense. One that could not be delivered by a human brain, as presented in the movie, fur sure. The reason of the alien attack is indeed a mystery. I know you can't apply human logic to an alien attack, but... let's assume we can. It is clear they want/need our brains. OK. Now, you see, there needs to be a reason for that. They could just kill us, BUT no.... they take us for our brains. Is it food? I doubt it, as there appears an obvious question: \"What do they eat when they can't have human brain???\". So it is safe to assume it is not food. OK. Is it for information? What possible information could an insignificant individual possess? An intelligent creature would surely hack the internet for absorbing information. It has much, much more information than what separate individuals have together. So... the only logical reason for the attack is.... fun. Yes, probably the are bored to death and are in a individual race of \"who eats more brains\". Yes. It is the only logical explanation. It is like humans hunting animals. Interesting that they don't appear to want to do this again. It's more like... let's annihilate this species.... but not by bombs, but by brain eating. Yes. That sounds like a great plan. And a bad movie.",

Watching movies is one of my major hobbies. I can appreciate all kind of genres but the sci-fi genre is my favourite. I've practically seen all sci-fi movies and deliberately avoided this film the last year because of the low score on IMDb.Normally scores on IMDb are pretty accurate but this time , for me, it is way off. It's only because a fellow sci-fi lover pointed me out that I had to watch this movie and because i ran all out of sci-fi movies made on this planet, i gave skyline a try.This movie has off course some flaws, it is not a movie like forbidden planet, alien(s), star trek first contact, solaris, a space odyssey , terminator 2 and so on, it isn't that epic but it's a pretty good movie.The special effects, action scenes are very well done, The dialogue and character development is a little shallow but honestly this film doesn't need it. The tension build up is so well done, wes craven could get some lessons from this movie and honestly i think wes cravens tension build up is a little forced, this movie does it very naturally.The film grasped my attention from the beginning and only let me go the last 5 minutes. This movie only lasted 94 minutes , so if a movie can do that for 1,5 hour in a pleasant way, i say it's a good movie no matter what metacritic, or thousands of people vote.If you want a good sci-fi actionthriller, this is your movie , forget about the score, or you will wonder all the time while watching the movie where they got those people to give this film such a low score because the movie is so good.",

Some friends and I were unfortunate enough to go and see this monstrosity a couple of days ago and the feeling amongst us was unanimous - an awful movie which offered nothing at all in terms of originality or fresh ideas. The movie concerns alien visitors to Earth that use some form of light hypnosis in order to remove human beings from the planet. Of course, there are a few survivors left to battle the aliens in which the film is centred around. To begin with the script seems to have been written in a couple of hours with virtually every line a clich\u00e9 lifted from countless other movies. The acting was also terrible, not surprising given the script they had to work from, however, this left the viewer not caring whether the heroes were wiped out by the aliens or not. On to the soundtrack which was about as memorable as a low frequency fart through a vacuum. Of course the effects were very good but all films these days have good effects so nothing special there. The ending is rushed and is a disappointment. It also does not make much sense. All in all this movie was touted as a mix between Cloverfield and War of the Worlds and like Cloverfield the lack of explanation as to why the aggressors are there in the first place leaves the viewer not engaging with the heroes despite the films poor attempts to develop some of the characters.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes unintentional laughs in a movie.",

Try to escape the building, run back inside the building to escape the aliens. Rinse and repeat for about an hour and twenty minutes, and then the last five to ten minutes is just so silly that it doesn't bear repeating here. That's it, I am dead serious. They even give a pointless flashback sequence in the beginning to add an unnecessary ten minutes to the movie.I don't know exactly what the director of this movie was going for. Obviously they were very proud of the special effects for this movie, since the DVD case boasts that it is 'from the visual masterminds of AVATAR!'. Look, I am not going to argue the pros and cons of whether or not CGI enhances a movie. In my opinion, it comes down to if you strip it of the special effects, is there still a good story? Any good sci-fi movie has a great story without the special effects, and this movie simply does not. The plot is painfully simple and in places absolutely insulting to the intelligence of not just the audience, but the human species in general. The characters are incredibly dumb, to a degree that even the most casual movie-goer would notice.The truly amazing thing about this movie is that after the first forty minutes, you are begging for this movie to end, because absolutely nothing is happening. Then, when stuff starts happening (be it extremely silly) the movie just ends. It stops right in the middle of something that was incredibly more interesting that what happened for the previous 90 minutes. The alien invasion schtick has been done tons of times, so if you want to make a successful movie you have to bring something new to the plate.

This movie sometimes made me feel like Matrix because of the squids he he anyway, the visual effects are awesome and somewhat compared to Avatar action scenes.

            "content": "If one needs evidence that writing talent has fled feature film, look no further than Skyline, a Cloverfield-esquire monster disaster told from the point of view of a handful of modern excessive yuppies in L.A. as the sprawling capital of lewd living is suddenly and inexplicably under attack by huge brain-eating insectoid aliens.Rumor has it that decent writers don't do film any more, they've all left to write for TV. Skyline might support that rumor well. The story has practically no point. The heroes (if we can even call them that) all die, and we learn zero about the icky enemy aliens from space except that they have really cool hypnotic death beams that cause humans to stare at them, walk toward them right before every vein in their faces and bodies explodes.The special effects are interesting for about 30 minutes at most and then start to get old. The four main characters debate their chances of fleeing L.A. for the nearby marina, whereupon they'll flee by water. They finally make up their minds after an interminable amount of arguing and screaming and crying and being scared and give it a try. It fails as the insectoid alien giant bugs are waiting right outside the parking garage, so they flee back inside the posh apartment building and try to survive from there.It helps that the main girlfriend is pregnant, so that the main young hero dude (her boyfriend) has a reason to fight the space bugs harder, get madder at anybody who stands in his way and ultimately, when he is sucked aboard the alien ship and consumed by them, then has pity on her and strokes her hair - AFTER his brain has been sucked out and used to convert him into one of the ugly things. Then we fade to black - the end.I'm not kidding. These doofuses KILLED almost the entire cast, the human race DOESN'T win (even after hitting the aliens with a nuke, just like in Independence Day), and even my 15 year-old son (presumably the demographic this mess was made for) simply said, \"Well, that was certainly disappointing.\" At least in Independence Day, the badly whupped human military finally figures out a way to win. Not here.Stay away from this unbelievably bad film. We threw $16 in the trash going to this nonsense. EVERY major rule of good story was discarded.

This movie is mostly about special effects and does not really require Multi million dollar movie star salaries. The actors and actresses do their parts very well. There is a confusing vignette in the very last moments involving the character who is pregnant. But I don't know where we are supposed to go with that.

This is one of those movies, and it really is THAT bad.The chief, main issue (because there are more than a few) is the complete detachment you'll experience from, pretty much, the very first scenes of the movie. You simply Do. Not. Care. Some pictures, despite a cold initial reaction, pull you - the viewer - in, make you care about characters and a story you were initially indifferent about. \"Skyline\" doesn't know how this miracle is achieved. It tries, it fails horribly.The characters are shallow, awkward and forgettable. Their motivations, beyond the obvious - survival - unconvincing. The acting... well, to be fair, I don't believe Sir Anthony Hopkins and a crew of multiple Academy Award winners could do anything with the script and dialog provided, so I'm going to leave \"acting\" out of this, since there's nothing to act. The music... you know, I don't remember if there was any. If there was, this should be a testament to its uncanny subtlety, that I recall none of it.The movie starts nowhere, is headed nowhere, and gets there. It answers none of the questions it asks, it fails to make you care about what is happening, why and to whom, so by the last scenes, which were obviously intended to be very dramatic, we found ourselves just laughing at the attempt. At the mysterious deus-ex-machina, and quite illogical, ability of the protagonist. At the failure that is this movie, and not least - at us, for watching it to the end.It could have been better. Perhaps even quite good. It could have been a sci-fi horror-esque story with a twist (the twist being that there would be no twist). It could have been. It isn't. What it is, is a shoddily thrown together 90 minutes worth of nothing, with a large budget and bright lights.And finally, before you allow a friend to convince you to go, I'm honestly asking you to consider this - some (many, horrifyingly many) will say the special effects in \"Skyline\" are professionally done, and make the \"movie\" worth seeing for their sake alone. Well, they are professionally done, very much so, yes. Still, it's nothing you haven't already seen in \"Independence Day\" or the (very first!) \"Matrix\". Actually, it feels wrong even putting \"Independence Day\" in the same sentence with this movie, and the only way it should be done is: \"Do NOT go see Skyline, rent Independence Day instead.

Not paying extreme close attention, I thought the black character was a football player (sort-of looking) and there was some team party or such before the s__ started to fly.The whole thing barely makes sense and as others point out, there are scientific and logic plot holes. The actors are not engaging nor empathetic. It all sorta signaled the situation was hopeless early on.

The Plane scenes were cool the stealths especially. The Bloke from scrubs did well, the guy from Dexter less so. I thought the ending was great, really gruesome to some extent , a little silly also, but made a nice change compared to the usual run of the mill endings that often occur , ( I also enjoyed the ending of Monsters) .

More so than any other alien invasion movie ever made - and I have seen them all.It is clear that the writers and producers have done an awful lot of thinking about what it would really be like to be invaded by a vastly superior force, millions or even billions of years ahead of us in technological terms, and the CGI, while somewhat rudimentary in certain parts, doesn't kill the disbelief, and is also extremely detailed, right down to the internal functioning of alien spaceships and monsters.Personally, I think that some years down the road this movie will be regarded as a scifi cult hit of 2000-2010s, along with movies like District 9.",

So glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters.There's a brief moment where you think the movie might change gears and do something different then it ends. If you seen this trailer and it seemed interesting defiantly go rent District 9 which is far superior.",

More like a SciFi horror story than anything else and becomes a real roller coaster ride as the reality of the New World Order slowly sinks in. A good movie and well worth watching - much better than the generic Hollywood crap so often rolled out. Would rather watch this than Independence Day, which for non-Americans is almost nauseating, any day of the week.The characters come across as just real life people doing their best, and the attempts to escape from their seemingly inevitable fate, nail biting. The military don't come off as 'all powerful' and the lack of a slick Hollywood style 'it will all be alright in the end' sort of ending is quite refreshing.",

Here is a list of good reasons:A cast of characters we hardly know or care about, a non-existent plot, mediocre CGI, a weak ending, poorly written script, stupidly unoriginal concept, boring acting, boring aliens, boring everything. The funny thing is the first 2 minutes (I mean literally) were brilliant. Eery blue lights crash into LA, attracting people towards them. It's cool and creepy. Then the aliens come and take EVERYONE, besides the main cast. And then the aliens, for no good reason at all, try and kill them. Why? How can four or five more humans make a difference in a batch of millions? Plot hole alert. Then the cast argue whether they should stay in the apartment or take a chance and leave (dispite the fact that aliens are everywhere outside). Only one member of the cast suggests the logical thing, to stay in the apartment where there is food and electricity (How is this possible?)That's pretty much it. Just a dull movie about a group of random people being pestered by weird aliens. It's interesting how someone actually thought this would make a good movie. Oh, and by the end of it you will have a headache by the stupid amount of BLUE in this film!Save your money. Save your headache tablet. Forget this ever happened.",

Though I found them harsh at first, the reviews I had read were surprisingly accurate. It was hard to distinguish one misplaced action scene from the next and the lack of detail drew more attention to the spotty acting. Scottie Thompson is great in everything i have seen her in and she seemed to be the only one that took away the B movie feel to the entire project. I saw someone said that this movie compares to Cloverfield with better filming. I would have to say Cloverfield my not be the best ScFi movie but it sure kept my attention way longer then SkyLine. Did anyone notice that 90% of this movie was lacking glass in the windows when the monsters came through? Just thought I would point that out. Sorry I doubted you Mr. Depp.",

I watched it on DirectTv and am getting ready to watch again on Netflix. I do NOT understand why people keep giving it such bad reviews. A sci-fi alien invasion flick with only a 10 million dollar budget got over 60 million worldwide. That's 50mil in profit...not very shabby.For those of you saying the actors sucked, you have to remember the budget. The film makers focused more on the visual effects, and that was the right thing to do.The movie was great all the way through. The only part I didn't get into was the short backstory right after the beginning of the movie. It depicted how an alien invasion would happen if it was real in my opinion. Let's face it if aliens exist and did visit our planet I don't think they'd travel millions of miles just to say hi, and with the technology to get here I seriously doubt we'd stand much of a chance against them. The military in the movie also used realistic means. Sending in UAV bombers(the stealth looking ones) and Predator Drones to nuke the ships first would be what our government would do. We wouldn't want to risk our soldiers. If that failed then you'd see our military give up one last ditch effort. It really showed how futile such a war would be.The best part of the movie however, was the questions left unanswered. Why was his brain glowing red instead of blue? Why did he regain control after being transplanted into an alien? Why did they spare her life? What the heck was the alien doing on top of her before he attacks it? All of the questions lead up to the fact a sequel is planned. It's those cliff hangers that make a movie like this great. Definitely a solid 8/10",

The suspense, soundtrack, surprises, snappy editing and chillingly realistic visual effects were worth the price of admission alone. For me the characters responded to the frightening situation as I'd imagine most ordinary people would. To some people survival means running or hiding from almost certain annihilation. To others, retaliating offers some chance of survival, albeit a slim one. For me, this movie had the most in common with Pearl Harbour because the US Navy was caught completely by surprise by an overwhelming force. The feeling of helplessness against superior technology pervades the movie. This was not an easy acting assignment for the cast but they didn't fail to project the emotions ordinary people would feel in this terrible situation. The movie ends without us knowing whether the aliens have a weakness which can be exploited by humans to defeat them. I think potential film-goers should expect a potential sequel and not be too disappointed by the lack of resolution. The movie does end with some hope that the fortunes of the human race will improve in the sequel. If the film producers decide to make a sequel I hope they engineer a few more plot twists. A good thriller shouldn't contain too many predictable plot elements. This is probably the biggest weakness of this first installment.",

But the idea of throwing a lot of CGI into a movie to make it something has worn thin. Makes for a great preview but often a poor movie. And it looks like they needed to wrap it up quickly for time purposes at the end because it was a bit confusing.

Light blending and scenarios with chrome key screens, staging, and performance where in sink.The performers did a good job. David Zayas did an excellent performance. The problem is that his character, in the final cut, wasn't fleshed out enough. This might have been a time constraint issue for the film. You often see television coverage of the invasion but there is no narration of news personnel providing the coverage which takes away any credibility. Movies are also a theater of the mind. Without that there simply is no movie. There was not enough character fleshing.The plot was very poor. If we as an audience don't know the why, what, where, and when we lose interest. I actually found myself yawning at times. We don't necessarily need a happy ending (although I enjoy those very much) but we need a plot. The Sci Fi horror movie Cloverfield had similarities with this movie but we empathize with the leading man trying to find his love interest trapped in a building to save her in the middle of the devastation created by a Godzilla-like creature. In this movie we don't have any empathy. Again due to not enough character fleshing. The fact that the girl friend is pregnant in Skyline isn't enough for us to feel empathy. In fact we just feel disgusted at the fact that it's a blatant, cheap, and obvious attempt in trying to get us to care.In short I don't intend to see Skyline 2 unless by some miracle a new writer is brought in to create a different story line of human interest. I offer my services of course. I regret spending the money and the time in seeing this movie. I've advice family and friends in Skype and Facebook to not spend their money.",

Although Cloverfield was kinda fun, good story and you had the feeling you we're right in the middle of things this movie has the \"same\" idea's.The Movies focus is on a group of people who see the world around them being attacked by Aliens, nice idea and i found the graphics good. Not complaining about stuff that can't happen cause i am a Sci-Fi fan without looking at to much details.The main character is irritating, it's a selfish, arrogant annoying person and i can't imagine why they made him look like that. He might be it himself. The female roles are done nicely and Sgt. Baptiste from the very good series Dexter had a nice role which he did perfectly! Especially his final one. Notice he also is irritated by the main character as well, can't be me then! All in all, it's a nice\"i got nothing else worth watching night without the misses (or other way around) \" movie!

Actually a sci-fi channel original would be more fitting. The production quality was just poor. If there is any redemption for this film; it would require film cultist of a certain mentality. The cinematography is the weakest link. All the intricate shots involving the aliens betrayed the deception we come to expect from $10 a ticket. This stunk of favors.

Eric Balfour should stick to TV. It is hard to believe that there was 10 million spent on this movie especially if it was only one year in production. Although I would venture to say that about 98% was spent on special effects. This group of producers and writers have some impressive movies behind them but all in special effects. Not even the special effect match those that they had done in the past. There are very few who can cross over from the technical end to the creative side successfully. Its sad that they took a good premise and trashed it. Thats my opinion for what its worth",

Firstly, the characters are totally lifeless and boring, offering only one dimension, with no story, depth albeit any other reason for existence.The acting is also quite poor. But the worst thing is that there is absolutely no sense of a storyline, no explanation is why the aliens are invading earth and abducting people, not even an ending. The story (however limited) is so bad with so many holes, that it just makes you think 'come on, really?' every 5 minutes. A perfect example would be the scene where a man is punching and killing the alien with his bare hands.....i mean 'come on, really?!'This film is truly on another level of crap! I would not have even given it one star, but unfortunately, that was the lowest rating option offered.In my honest opinion, the producers and writers of this film are a joke in making this movie. Surely, it does not take a genius or master film critic to recognise all its faults.Please avoid at all costs, unless you feel like watching it just to see how bad it really is.If you do decided to watch it, then I am sure that having done so you too will be compelled to write a review, because it really is that bad!Worst Sci-fi movie I've ever watched.",

I would like to describe how i felt watching this movie but its difficult to describe all the negative aspects. Generally,within first 20-25 minutes you understand that it's bad and then you wait for the end..ha ha, but here is the scary part - the movie has no end - an allusion to follow-up but i don't think one might find a lot of people who would want to see such crap again - please don't make a sequel of Skyline - spend money on something that would have a purpose and meaning. Some people say that you should give some credit to the movie makers for special effects. Maybe i'm too spoiled, but i think that if you make a movie which needs a lot of CGI, as they call it, you have to have money. Otherwise, you will have special effects, but they will look somewhat crappy..not too bad, just an inch to OK, but still not good...like in Skyline. The problem is that CGI was aimed at being very impressive, but failed because of being too ambitious considering the budget..Anyway, even the best special effects will not shift the movie from a bad one to something that is worth watching.. don't waste your time and money.",

I knew there was trouble right at first when it used the tired technique of a teaser scene, then reverted to a \"15 hours earlier\" point in time. For some reason every show on television is doing that, and it is getting quite annoying.The action centers around a group of people in an L.A. high rise who witness an alien invasion. The aliens are laying waste to the city (and presumably cities all over the world) for the express purpose of ... wait for it ... stealing brains. I think the writers of this turkey could have used some brains themselves.The aliens have huge hovering spacecraft, flying things, walking things, and climbing things of various sizes that are seemingly indestructible.The quantity of main characters is steadily whittled down until only two are left. They are sucked up into the mother ship where the man's brain is removed and inserted into a hulking alien body. The woman is spared, apparently because she's pregnant (?). The man/alien then defends her against some other creatures mucking about in the spacecraft's disgusting innards. Then the credits start to roll.This is like \"Independence Day\" where there's little back story, lousy acting, and the bad guys win. The best part about the movie is I watched it on PPV, and thus saved a lot of money.I kept waiting for some mechanism that would allow the Earth people to win, but it didn't happen. I think that would have saved the movie, but I guess the writers ran out of budget and ideas at the same time, leaving the rest of us hanging.Don't watch this unless you're prepared for a letdown.",

I really wanted to get up and leave, but I kept thinking there would be a point to it all. There's not. It is a sad, sad film.

But all of this came from a perspective of expecting a blockbuster. Looking back on it and just taking the movie for what it is, i actually enjoyed myself. I had some good laughs at people getting devoured by these big godzilla-like creatures, the dramatic slowmotion effect when David Zayas' character smashes in a glass door with his elbow and the overall uninspired acting which added a certain parody-esk dimension. For my final verdict:story: 4/10 acting: 4/10 special effects: 9/10 comedic value: 8/10For me having a laugh is really important when i watch a movie, so with the comedic value weighing in i come to an average score of: 6/10For the people that don't really think having a laugh is important to rate a movie, i would come to an average score of: 5/10",

You don't find out why the aliens came or why they're attacking (I guess in real life you wouldn't know either but it makes for a pretty poor movie) and you never find out much about the individual characters lives, other than some abstract group that a few of the guys once belonged to.There is no plot. It's just the one group of people trying to escape a seemingly impossible situation, and lots of aliens trashing the city. Again, I guess if it was real life, you don't automatically have one person in the group who comes up with an amazing plan to defeat the bad guys or help everyone escape unharmed, but if you're going to make a movie about it, you really should think of something to help the watcher stay emotionally invested.The ending is weird and stupid. I almost walked out halfway through because it seemed like there was no way they could turn it all around. I was right.The only thing that kept me moderately intrigued was trying to figure out where I had seen the actors before (Eric Balfour was Gabe in Six Feet Under, and Scottie Thompson was Jeanne in NCIS).Probably the worst sci-fi I have ever seen.",

Eric Balfour did quite well in this movie. The best scene was when he smashed an alien with a brick and then with bare hands. I found the character Oliver was unnatural.

The first 15~20mins of the movie I was pretty engaged. From there it just kept going down hill. Instead of writing out a long drawn out synopsis, I'll just give my overview in bullet points.Things that led you to think was more, but wasn't. *The part about the woman being pregnant seemed like it was going some where, but in the end, didn't matter really. *Turk (the black guy from scrubs) had some character development and seemed like there was some social conflicts to deal with... nope killed. *Background character becomes a main character(why?), the guy's paranoia and persistence to stay makes you think maybe he's working for the other side, nope just a guy. *Jared (Alien Neo!) character was persistent in getting out to the docks made you think something was going to happen, nope, nothing. *Jared's persistence makes you think that maybe he's being controlled, nope nothing. *Jared's comment about the aliens not being over water makes you think maybe there's something there, nope just what ifs. *Showing us Day ONE, and Day TWO, etc, seemed like it was leading up to something... but there was nothing. Maybe they thought the audience forgot that after night comes day again and that needed to be retold that a day passed by. Maybe if say it skipped ahead and it was like Day Four, then Day Ten, to express how desperate things are getting. ==Lack of Research==*When the nuke goes off on the alien ship, the shock waves felt weak and the portrayal of the after affects didn't makes sense, like how all the characters could easily stare at the WHITE light of the explosion. *The military forces acted like it was their first time. *Sniper teams with no spotters. *Snipers using their weapons as regular rifles and just shooting. *The use of UAV were like that of a video game and just dumping them at the enemy. *WTF DO YOU NEED A UAV TO DELIVER A NUKE WHEN YOU HAVE REAL ICBM TO DEAL WITH IT!*Where were the tanks? Humvees? Ground Troops? Attack Choppers? *Why did the fighter jets only shoot bullets and seemed like they weren't equipped with any bombs or missiles to engage targets that were the size of buildings? *Why have a background character (the apt employee) jump into the scene and take place of the second main male character(the black guy) when he wasn't developed and the other was?==Cheesy moments that weren't meant to be==*Garage gate scene was comical, people actually laughed in the audience. *Jared's nerd rage on the alien looked extremely odd with funky punches. *The \"I hate LA\" was my favorite cheesy line since it made me laugh, I also hate LA, lol.*Jared's brain glows red... really... couldn't we have guessed when the alien went AWOL? I felt like it was a weird episode of Red vs Blue.*When the employee tried to blow up the room by trying to light the gas leak and the lighter didn't work it came of comedic (maybe that's what they wanted) and I don't think it helped the scene.==Confusing moments==*After the employee hits the alien with his SUV, it seemed like it killed it, maybe by smashing its brains, but some how it was able to still revive itself and then grab a new brain, which it needs to function... seemed a bit like a chicken and the egg conundrum... *Jared for some reason wants to keep his nerd rage powers a secrete... wait why? Ending thoughts, the only cool part was the end when Jared got turned into an alien, but kept his own will. That should have happened on \"DAY ONE\" so that there was something interesting going on. Instead we are left with a Alien version of Neo from the Matrix, who also has comparable acting abilities.And if they are going to shoot the ENTIRE movie in one building I seriously think they should try to play it up more. I mean we (the audience) just kept seeing the same scene one after another, it went, apt room, pool, roof, apt room, garage, pool, garage, apt room, roof. There was no trapped in the dark in the stairwell, fights in the hall way, not even checking to see for supplies in other rooms. The character was just so bent on leaving he wanted to come up with any excuse possible./rant",

Skyline manages to fail on all of these levels. first off, i hated the characters, i didn't hate all the characters, i just didn't care for them. they were so dull and boring and the viewer does not care for the characters. the actors were just terrible, just look at the second trailer for this movie. its so bland and forgettable that i almost forgot all about this movie one i left the theater. the movie has plot holes big enough to fit all the transformers, every character from bleach, and M. Night Shymalans ever expanding ego.the movie ending does set it up for a sequel, but by it only making 11 million this week, it will likely go straight to DVD. The action is boring, so dull and the above average effects seem to be at their weakest during the fight scenes. the film also stole a lot of plot points and creature designs and traits from other films. i don't know if it was just me but the ships remind me of the ones from independence day. but skyline makes independence day look like seven samurai. i would recommend this to kids about 8 or 9 because i think they will like it but for anyone else it is a waste of money, time and talen.....never mind.

I saw that it was streaming free on Net-flix and was hesitant to watch it after looking at the score it got here on IMDb. But, I read some positive user reviews and gave it a shot. I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the movie to be honest. People complain about the ending, but to be honest, I think it is a great set up for the second film and I have to say I'm pretty excited. The acting isn't terrible and the script wasn't top notch, but its very bearable and its a different movie. It reminds me of District-9.If you're looking for good sci-fi film, I say give it a shot, its really not that bad.",

            "content": "Skyline is simply a stunningly bad movie! From the moment I sat down and the seemingly endless screen credits started to roll, I knew I was in serious trouble. I immediately wished the Mystery Science Theater 3000 bots would appear in the corner and offer comic relief. There is absolutely nothing to like about this film. The story line is literally brain-dead simple BIG, BIG, BIG, and equally fake looking CGI aliens who apparently can build even BIGGER equally fake looking CGI spaceships and travel at light speed here to the very edge of the galaxy to squish us and steal our meager brains. There is little sense that the film had a director, writers, or camera operators. It's shot terribly, some \"Blair Witch\"camera shake, when the actors try to appear scared, mysteriously sometimes the camera is glass smooth when the actors try to appear scared. Everybody ends up either squished or their brains are sucked out or both. Most of the cast only appears on screen only long enough to scream then be either squished or have their brains sucked out or both.While the acting is tragic, it's tough to be very critical of the cast. The screenplay had to have been written by a bunch of 14 year old's during a sleepover. Additionally, the film must have been made without a director. One can only hope that the director quit in a dispute over how stupidly long the credits would be and was not actually present for any of the filming. For the cast, I will offer this glimmer of hope... Susan Sarandon survived the Rocky Horror Picture Show and went on to bigger and better things. Hopefully, the cast of Skyline will have more than one life in their theatrical careers.The only thing scary about this film is that there is apparently a sequel coming to resolve the pathetic cliff dive, err I mean cliffhanger ending. In the event that they are foolish enough to actually shoot the sequel, hopefully it will be done directly to digital media. This will avert the tragedy of wasting another 90 minutes of 35MM film on this mess.I would not under any circumstances pay money to see this movie! If you feel inclined to watch a \"frightening\" monster film with a realistic plot, creative writing, believable characters, a cast and a director, rent \"Monsters Inc.\" Your time will be much, much, much better spent!",

            "review_title": "OK film; clever filmmaking",
            "content": "I gave this film a 7 because at face value that's what it deserves. However, anyone who takes it at face value is missing the best parts:1. First off, it isn't an action/adventure. Maybe those who gave it a 1 expected that. It's SciFi/Horror. A group of protagonists are trapped inside a building and are, in turn, devoured by alien monsters. \"Alien\" is its closest kin, what Ridley Scott once termed \"a haunted house in space\". Here, the haunted house is a thirty story building, and, like it or not, that IS innovative. This is like Die Hard where the terrorists are aliens and Bruce Willis loses. If you think THIS is formulaic, go see \"Battle LA\". You deserve it. Another major innovation is that this is a horror movie with no foreshadowing music, with no darkness, without extreme close-up over-the-shoulder shots (and, bless heavens, absolutely no shaky-cam.) It's a horror movie about agoraphobia, not formulaic claustrophobia. You don't see many of those.2. On another level, consider the plot. People complained there isn't any, but that's not true. It just isn't of the simple, linear, shoot-em-up variety that people who liked the trailer may be expecting. The movie is about a group of people who repeatedly concoct plans of what to do in the face of a force majeure unlike any other, only to have those plans crushed (to the sound of a wet >splat!<) before they can even make the first move. The plot progresses in that their plans increasingly try to achieve less and less. From a major victory they move to a minor win, to a symbolic win, to just having the opportunity to make a stand: a study of human desperation. The directors did well in choosing real-life-like people as protagonists: petty, unwilling to accept the reality of what is going on, non-heroic. Not a single Bruce Willis among them, and that's what makes the movie so worth watching and grounds it in reality.3. On yet another level, this movie is self-aware cinema which I quite often found out-loud funny. Here are some examples of what I mean: (a) Director credit \"The Strause Brothers\" is a clear reference to \"The Wachowski Brothers\", directors of \"The Matrix\". Some of the flying aliens in Skyline are also, I think, inspired by The Matrix's squids. (b) Not only SciFi, Horror and Haunted House themes are featured. There is also a strong sense of a zombie movie. The aliens are shot, blown up, mauled, beaten up and even axed to death, only to reassert themselves seconds later. This theme is brought to a climax in the film's ending. (Let me just say this: \"Brrrains! Fresh Brrrains!\") (c) The ridiculously straight-face in which the protagonists grasp at each false hope anew, playing directly on the Hollywood formula. Nowhere is this more prominent as in the brilliant deliberately-bad music by Matthew Margeson (whose line of credits shows he can do a lot better, thank you). The music repeats one theme in all climatic scenes, to the point that the audience can hum it with the soundtrack. It's a piece singing of hope, a heightened spirit, rescue and >splat!< (which is the part where the monsters chew the plan to bits and spit out the pieces). Margeson, you're my hero! ... and there are a lot more examples where that came from. The lighter scene alone is worth the price of admission to me. \"Yippee-ki-yay!\", only in Spanish.4. Lastly, and perhaps most in tune with the director's original intentions, this movie is at the forefront of a revolution. This revolution started when CGI replaced incredibly-costly model-building and puppeteering special effects, continued when Weta workshop and its kin replaced incredibly-costly ILM effects, and has been pushed further with upcoming Project London and its likes. CGI VFX is now a commodity. Colin and Greg Strause have shown that two people, working in garage conditions, shooting in their own homes, working with whatever actors they can get, can make a movie indistinguishable from those playing in the big league. Yes, the non-appearance of Bruce Willis is quite noticeable here, too. If you want Bruce Willis, go see The Fifth Element. If you want Matt Damon, go see The Adjustment Bureau. In both cases, you will see big-money actors wasted on a poor script propped by unconvincing VFX. This is not to say that either of those movies is a waste of your money. I just think this one, on the same scale, is better. To man the role of \"the guy with the plan\" Colin and Greg Strause cast both Donald Faison (\"Turk\" from Scrubs) and David Zayas (\"Angel\" from Dexter) (another self-aware stroke of genius: the two appear in practically every scene without having a single common scene. For all intents and purposes, they're just playing one person.) These two TV actors were cast specifically to recap their TV characters: well-meaning, pretty cool, apparently dependable, but ultimately clueless. (My only real qualm with this movie is that Faison and Zayas didn't bite the hands that feed them, and, contrary to directorial directions, decided to show that they DO have more range than that.) So, basically, the gauntlet has been thrown: Hollywood, what are you wasting all your big bucks on? Why can't you do any better than what these guys did using a fraction of what you're spending? So, I'm well aware that this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea, but to those who can (and are willing to) appreciate what was done here, I think it's really worthwhile. I sincerely hope that Colin and Greg Strause make a lot of money off of this flick, because I want to see what they come up with next. People have complained about the originality of this film. I think it's as avant garde as any Tarrantino.",

The movie has been maligned because of the apparent ridiculousness of the aliens themselves but I differ greatly in that opinion. The aliens of Skyline represent the most technologically advanced and thoroughly alien ET's I have ever seen in a movie; convincingly so because true ET's probably don't resemble Earth life at all.The problem with most hard-scifi is that typical audience members are not smart enough to understand it unless it's spelled out in easy to understand one syllable words. That's why the books of Arthur C Clarke or Poul Anderson remain beyond the reach of most readers; they simply don't have the imagination or knowledge to comprehend it. The same is true of the aliens of Skyline.What we see here in the movie are not the aliens themselves, but their biological/ cybernetic robots. The squids that fly around are clearly a type of cyborg, while the large tank-creatures are also biological or cybernetic constructs. They are harvesting human brains (not EATING them, as some particularly dim viewers think). Why? Because human brains represent the most complex structure on planet Earth. Supercomputers in a handy 3 pound package, the culmination of 3.5 billion years of evolution. To these aliens, this biological supercomputer was the most useful thing they could find on our primitive world. Just right to reprogram and run their cyber-constructs, as we saw quite clearly at the end of the movie. The aliens themselves are not seen at all, unless they are a collective intelligence.I can't vouch for the acting or characters, but the science fiction aspects were quite good and I enjoyed it a lot.",

Despite the small storyline and the filming on one location the script is alright. Entertaining enough and a lot of bright lights. Let's hope the scriptwriter has learned something.",

No pace it dragged, no reason to care cause you don't like anyone in the film. Action scenes chopped together with a mix of \"Independence Day\" and \"Clover field\" truly an industrial project with no heart or soul.

I especially wanna point out that the general concept of the movie was fascinating, and as you go through the film, you'll see how each detail perfectly fit the storyline. The air created literally takes you away and makes you feel like you're in the movie. In total, this is just a perfect movie with a great, unpredictable ending.

Then i noticed that the movie is only an hour and a half, so that kind of brought down my expectations. Usually movies that short are comedies whose plots are just awful but always give a good laugh or two, so i was preparing myself for the worst.The disappointing thing about the movie is that they didn't really build up the characters or go into detail with them. They briefly went over who they were and instantly went into talking about the alien invasion. The overall idea of the movie was actually really interesting. I liked the whole brain swap thing, not to mention the rebuilding of the ship when it got nuked. It showed that yes the human race isn't always more dominate and clearly they are much stronger then us. The action in the movie was pretty lame too since you didn't normal see anyone fight back and everyone was hiding, which i guess is realistic. Unlike other movies where people magically find weapons and fight back. However it bored the movie down a bit. If they picked up a better writer for the movie and actually took their time to develop the movie it could have been much more interesting.Even though there are ton of disappointing things in this movie, there are a few parts i actually enjoyed. The first was seeing Jarrod becoming a tank and just getting super strength somehow caused by the blue light. Another scene where the big fight happened and the air force nuked the alien ship. In the ending scene, where Jarrod becomes an alien but can control his body. That scene made me think, why is his brain the only one that can control these aliens? Why did it shine orange and not blue like the others? Also what will he do now. The ending by far was my favorite part and what made the movie average for me. Again if they made the movie longer it would have been a more intense ending scene. Clearly this movie didn't score so hot and they left the ending for perhaps a sequel. However i def wouldn't mind seeing the sequel. Overall it was watchable, it wasn't a movie as good as district 9 or independence day, but it had chance to be if they worked on it more. ***Spoilers End***If they made the movie longer it would have been a more intense ending scene. Overall it was watchable, it wasn't a movie as good as district 9 or independence day, but it had chance to be if they worked on it more. So if you have nothing else to do and enjoy SyFy movies i would recommend watching it if only for the end.",

Don't look at the light if you do you'll be sucked up into the alien spacecraft. The film then follows these friends as they do their best to survive.It is well known that this film was made on a low budget of just $10 million. Made by a couple of special effect guys and this is clearly where the budget went leaving the script and acting behind. The film is nothing new, it is pretty much Cloverfield with a touch of District 9. The effects do have their moments and there were a couple of exciting and suspenseful moments too. The script at times is awfully painful and you can't help but laugh watching the actors deliver these lines. The aliens I personally was not a fan of, their various shapes and sizes bugged me turns out I like a bit of consistency with the appearance of my aliens! Also their use of the humans they captured was unbelievable you wonder how they discovered this? Seeing there is already a 'Skyline 2' listed on IMDb I do believe that with a little help and a bigger budget next time it could be a good film.Overall if you looking simply for a 1 \u00bd hours of mindless sci-fi fun, no questions asked with some good effects this will satisfy however if you are looking for something new in the world of sci-fi you won't find it here. 5/10",

Faison plays the role of Terry a happy go lucky funny man who I was fairly thrilled to see appear on my screen from a corny interpretation of an American party. He soon dies .Lacking any kind of storyline or depth the film had very 2d character's. The ending was horrendously cheesy as they are taken by the aliens and somehow manage to fit in \"that kiss\". I can imagine Faison was happy to be killed of so soon to escape from such irritating scenes. I feel like crawling to a whole to hide from all Si fi films for a long time as this was such a bad version of a classic tale of alien invasion.

They would now nothing. There would be no CNN explaining what's happening. There would be no Internet, no nothing.

The plot is incredibly transparent, you can predict the end right from the beginning. The characters are totally one dimensional, and the movie does not take the time to develop any of them at all. There is no chemistry between the main characters, and the romances are totally contrived. There was not a single likable character in this movie, due partly to the horrible scripting topped off by weak, over-the-top acting. Some of the lines were so cheesy, it actually made me cringe. This movie used every clich\u00e9, and every shameless tactic to hide its total lack of substance - from product placement, to expensive cars, attractive women; none of which successfully mask its shortcomings. Starting in the middle of the story, and rewinding to recount events is so overly used, and is a ridiculous attempt to feign substance in this setting.I notice many reviews touting this as being 'original'...to those, I say watch War of the Worlds, because the concepts and story are almost identical. And I'm sorry, but bio-mechanical aliens have been around in film for a LONG time. There's not much more I can say without spoiling it for the unfortunate people who get pulled into watching this from the misleadingly attractive trailers, but trust me, there's nothing new here folks.The rating is currently 4.6, but that's an overstatement. This movie belongs in the bottom 100 in my opinion. If you really must see this movie, don't pay premium evening show prices, because I guarantee you will regret it.",

I personally don't know what motivated anyone to make this but it was a strange mix of really good effects, a almost close to good script and terrible execution of actual plot. If plot was ever a point.I watch movies to be entertained. I don't need a happy ending to like a movie. Take a perfect storm. All that near death, all that struggle just to die in the end. It happens - it's the journey there. The message of this movie seemed like you're screwed. No matter what you do, what you try, you're screwed.So here's an alien race that has come to earth to harvest our brains to put in their biological robots. It sounds dumb but it's not a bad plot. After all - if you're going to conquer a world without having to send billions of soldiers, you could use your targets assets. So even if the idea is corny it's not the worst part of the movie. The worst is the absolute dread every single sacrifice and fight gives you. One of the main characters get taken and never heard from a third into the movie. And is replaced by this latino guy. The latino guy sacrifices himself when this giant thing is climbing the building they're in and he does it by turning on the gas burners and he's going to blow it off the building. He does. There's a gaping hole in the creatures head from where a soldier hit it with a rocket. But of course the creature survives. A fighter airplane shoots at it several times but don't destroy it until it's shot out of the sky and crashes into it.Another smaller squid creature has its tentacle cut off but he simply places it back in its place and it heals. A nuke blows up one of the creatures ships and it crashes and smashes into pieces. But all the creatures inside survive and it 'self heals' itself.The world is over run, armies and fleets destroyed and no matter what people do the message is clear; resistance is futile because even our ships can self heal after they're completely destroyed. Not even this slight triumph against a terrible foe is allowed. Dread and despair. If the message is any clearer it's that we're screwed and we're not allowed a sacrifice or triumph to even feel somewhat okay with it.So here they are - the last two of the original cast. Pulled up into the sky and into the ship. We find the girl (who's pregnant) all slimed up. She sees her boyfriend being lifted up and his brain ripped from his head. The aliens notice that she's pregnant and take her somewhere else. Cut to where brains are being stuffed into these alien creature suits. Other brains are neon blue, his is red. So that means (as I figure out before it was put in the alien) that its good and he's going to be in control.The aliens are about to rip the fetus out of her stomach when good alien suite charges in and rescues her.So that's the message. You have to become them in order to defeat them. And he's going to protect the last female on eart inside a massive self healing alien ship.I've seen good and bad movies. This one had great effects, corny cringie dialogue and just weird plot reasons why stuff happened. You felt absolutely nothing when people died and the few times when you were suppose to feel something death meant nothing. It was taken away from you and replaced with more despair.I'd love for a second movie where someone goes alien on them and fight back, but I wouldn't want to use my money to pay for it, since I felt it was wasted.Battle for LA looks like a much better version of this coming out in March next year.

It can be said this one has a cheap budget simply because of the $500,000 shooting budget. But the $10M+ special effects budget pushes this one past the normal el-cheapo flick into new territory. Characters are good, acting is excellent (these are well-known faces, even if you can't quite remember their names), and, except for very small number of continuity problems, is quite well put together. On top of all that, the bad guys in this are REALLY interesting, and those who revel in BEMs will have their expectations fulfilled.This one begs a sequel, if only to answer the nagging question you'll have at the end.

On the surface, the script seemed solid, but then I realized that I thought the acting was terrible. Hold on. I've seen several of those actors in other projects and like them all from their previous work. Was it terrible directing, a weak story, a bad script after all? I really couldn't tell you. I remember saying to myself \"this should be a good movie, but something is missing.\" This is a movie meant to wow you with special effects, but it seems that they cut corners on story development. There was not one character that I was rooting for. I can not recall that ever happening before for a movie with a budget this big ($20 million is not a small budget film folks). I guess it was the script. This script should have been rewritten several times before they started filming. With some of the action scenes, people in the theater should have been yelling and jumping, but no one seemed to move. Bad score design? I just don't know. This movie reminded me of the following: Cloverfield (premise), Independence Day (design), Star Quest: the Odyssey (quality of the story).",

If aliens were invading from space.. In flying objects, bursting buildings to pieces and beaming people up - Then would you STAY in the top penthouse apartment of a building?? Where aliens from the ground can come up, and spaceships from the air blast your ass?The main characters sleep through the whole the first night of this invasion, only to try and escape in full daylight. First of all, no people would sleep a few hours after something like this happens, second, in daylight?? REALLY??They have a huge TV and loads of electrical equipment in the flat, but fail to listen to the radio or anything like that. They don't even try. Also only few alien spaceships can be spotted in the movie when they look out the window, but of cause ONE is looking exactly on their window several times?Also people are saying the plot is original, I fail to see how? Its screams clich\u00e9 to me. The main character fight for his girlfriend - even when he has his brain removed into an alien body, his love remains for him to save her (This brain removing happens to A lot of people, and apparently he is the only one to keep sane - for the love for his girlfriend, of cause) ... as the only one on earth!A lot of comments also contain statements like this:\"humankind is shown to be 99.999% normal petty and none heroic.\" No heroics? I just mentioned one already. Here comes a second.Another character in this movie \"wait\" for the aliens to come, so he can blast them from lighting his \"last\" cigarette, because he has filled the flat with gas. Just painful to watch.And I don't think anyone in this movie act normally under the circumstances. All of whom goes through the death of a loved one seem to get over it in a matter of minutes. Well, to be fair I never felt any chemistry between the characters anyway - Maybe that explain the lack of emotion when someone dies? I don't know.And not that all people would do so in real life, but nobody cares about how their family elsewhere is doing either.\"This film doesn't follow the Hollywood method it doesn't have a normal ending, characters are not printed on politically correct paper\" Damn straight !.. and not in a good way!!

In my opinion, it was a good movie and if you are a person who is not \" dreaming about the good result when facing problem\", i suggest you get a hand on this movie and watch it. There is no hero, no epic ending battle between human's weapon and the outsider. Even the nuke was not good enough. It is a possibility that there are many other lives other than we are - earthling- living somewhere out there in galaxies with so much more advance technologies than ours nowaday. Therefore, the result of everything listed in this movie was reasonable. I found out that this movie contained a lot of common senses about our emotional, even when we are facing annihilation (e.g arguing with boyfriend when one of the character were trying to avoid being caught by the Aliens and saw her boyfriend's picture of kissing another girl). At last we are just human with a very basic instinct, some stubborn ideas, some stupidity, some heroic one but have no effect towards the Aliens and a lot of reasonable emotion and reaction throughout the movie. The movie described a quite possibility of the other living things we are normally call Aliens. With the advantage of advance technology, well , it seems like it is understandable for those Aliens to go around and invade other planet, as we are usually assuming they are friendly and want to \" trade\" the technology, but they are not, in this movie's reality. It is good to have a quite real picture of one out of many possible outcomes when we face other planet's living things.And to someone who were complain about the idea of why there was just LA, or a bunch of people living in a block, or why at the end, they give up on the woman who is a few month pregnant, i am here to say it is the way the movie did. Why do we have to say about the whole world and not only one state to sketch a draft picture of a possible result?

But the pace is brilliant, the concept scary and the special effects are just mind-blowing. Comparisons to Cloverfield are unfair; I don't think this ripped off that many films and those it did was done in a unique and different way. Yes, some of the dialogue was poor and the characters were mostly less than likable, but since when did you have to feel empathy or sympathy for the characters to enjoy a movie? Sometimes it helps, especially when the ending is so downbeat, yet so totally different. I expected Skyline to be rubbish; so many people were condemning this film that I went into it with zero expectations and that's the way to approach it.

I recently had the pleasure of watching SKYLINE in the privacy of my own home--and I must say, WOW! The visuals are amazing! I have to admit that the dialogue was not the best, but the suspense and on-screen activities certainly engage the viewer. From the moment I saw the blue lights beaming in the sky, followed by Eric Balfour's character, Jarrod, turn into a vein-riddled, eye-popping road map from hell, I was hopelessly mesmerized. There's plenty of action, not much gore and, as in most suspense-ridden movies, people are doing and saying things that make absolutely no sense whatsoever... but isn't that realistic? I mean, there's always some lug in a crowd of people who is going to do something completely stupid, isn't there? In fact, in a situation like what is displayed in this flick, it seems that no matter what you do, it has the potential to be stupid: leave, get squashed; stay, get squashed; fight back, get squashed; hide, get tracked down... oh, and then get squashed!... and, did I mention getting sucked up into a spaceship by a huge blue-beamed vacuum cleaner hose only to have your brains ripped out and harvested like a car battery to keep these aliens 'running'?... Now anyone who says the ending is predictable is so far off it isn't even funny. There is NOTHING predictable about the ending of this (at least not until about 5 minutes before it actually does end, anyway). If people don't like it because of how it ended, I get it... I didn't particularly like how it ended either. I mean, who wants the spaced invaders to win, right?... Oh, but wait a minute! Isn't that EXACTLY what will probably happen should something as horrific as an alien invasion from beyond the stars actually occur? Looking at it from that perspective makes this ending make total sense! Besides, the ending gives me hope for a sequel, which I'd really love to see! Overall, I give this one 8/10 stars.

Im a big fan of sci-fi and i thought Independence Day was an insult to my intelligence.So, Skyline then. What makes it so good? Well, it started a little slow and had me thinking that maybe i had been tricked into another ID or maybe even another Transformers- Rise of the Fallen (No please, I'm still recovering from that horror!). However, after a bit of dull trite chat about moving to LA and having a baby etc the film took a pretty dark turn.Bright lights appear and people start to get dragged off by unseen forces and then it gets really bad. Alien ships come down and start hoovering people up for unknown, but obviously not nice, reasons. The main focus is about the people trapped in the house watching the events unfold and their thoughts as to how to deal with the events out of the window until events come to them.To me this was a refreshing film in that the actors are people i have never heard of, so no big names meaning that anyone can die and no heroic endings where the star comes out of the dust cloud with a torn shirt and a cut lip. The story did not have a typical Hollywood ending where someone with a Macbook plants a computer virus (They came for our Norton Antivirus!), or the mighty US armed forces come along and make it into a recruitment film (not a dig at the US forces, but a dig at Hollywoods portrayal of them as saviours all the time.), though the military did do a fine job in the film. The scene where the single plane is weaving about dodging the enemy to get to his target was great and had me wondering \"Will he make it? Wont he? Is that Will Smith?\" OK, so there are some technical errors, like nukes with no shock waves, and the aliens still have to look round corners to find people like they never heard of thermal imaging, but War of the Worlds did that as well so you cannot mark it down on that basis.So, if like me you thought ID4 was a sad day for Sci-Fi, you might like this. I was reminded somewhat of Cloverfield by Skyline and so what if they only spent 10 million dollars on it, Big budgets do not equal good films. All these big budget made-to-a-template films are whats wrong with Hollywood these days. Films like Revenge of the Fallen make people want to commit piracy, Skyline made me glad i went to the cinema to watch it knowing my money went to film makers, not studio lawyers and slick marketing execs.Go see it, you might actually enjoy a film that was made for the love of it, not for the revenue generation potential of the brand.",

As a matter of fact this movie doesn't even deserve to be thrown alongside bad movies. My reasons why: 1. It is quite realistic in the sense who gets the the major \"pwnage\", in a real alien invasion, humans would be swept off like insects, which is something the movie stays true to 2. Realistic enough that the main characters don't go superhero implausible often, actually...never really 3. The flow of decisions stays mostly logical 4. The aliens seem much more plausible than in some other movies...destroyable, but not quite. Something i would expect from an alien on a technological level portrayed. 5. The actions scenes also fit quite nicely in. Strong enough to excite you, but realistic in their results 6. It never really goes full blown clique. When you think it will, it doesn't really and you keep your piece of mind. 7. Great FXBad parts:1. the story is lacking (but it's not really what this movie is about) 2. characters are underdeveloped and not used enough 3. there are a few clique moments that leave a bad taste 4. the very end was...well, it could have more action 5. it was way too short for my tastesAll in all...this movie is not really about the characters or story, but a plausible depiction of a part of an alien invasion. Few movies actually match the technicalities of this movie. People that expect Avatar type climaxes and resolutions will feel disappointed yes. If you want to watch a bad movie on all fronts then go watch Terminator 4. That is what i call a \"come on guys...seriously?!?!\" movie. At least Skyline doesn't pretend to be more than it is.

Skyline was a visual treat offering some great action sequences and a stunning view of the L. A. sky line and landscape. The story was just OK though. There were definitely high points in the film as well as ponderously low points peppered generously through this film as well.I do like the break away from the conventional formula that has taken over most Hollywood films as of late. All in all I would say Skyline was not horrible, but didn't meet expectations based upon the marketing campaign that is in full swing. This is one I would wait for on Netflix or pick up from the RedBox if I could reclaim my hour and a half I spent at the theater.",

When the hero and his girlfriend are taken by the aliens, I thought, wow, they're going to kill the protagonist; it's going to be a downer ending. Great! That takes guts. Then they did kill the hero, but... they spoiled everything by having the aliens let the girlfriend live when they discover she is pregnant -- in the 50s the aliens wanted our women, now they want our babies?? -- and then the hero fights his reincarnation as an alien monster to save his girlfriend.

When did you see the human kind being destroyed completely without any hope ? 3.

Its like i said before, they are supposed to be normal people...

The alien ships, giant monsters and brain removing biological robots are all believable and looks good on screen.Where the movie falls flat, in my opinion, is the length and scale (which is why I only gave it 6/10). 90 or so mins is not enough for a Sci-Fi film of this nature, it should have been around 130 mins to get a good beginning, middle and end into the final cut. Instead, you find yourself wondering when they are finally going to leave the apartment (where most of the film takes place).Overall, despite the unoriginal story and poorly structured narrative, this film is still good enough to entertain you (though it probably won't win too many awards)",

The story is pretty simple, that of aliens coming down to Earth to abduct all the humans and make the planet their own. People see this mystical blue light and are entranced by it, and then they get sucked up by the alien spacecraft. This story is focused in LA, and a group of friends are recovering after a very late party, when the aliens first attack. After a couple of friends are abducted, the group has a choice. Either stay in the apartment, and stay sort-of safe, or make it across the road to a boat, where aliens cannot reach them (aliens can't go over water for some reason). The first impression is pretty cool, with the rad special effects and the people getting sucked up everywhere, and people yelling and stuff. But a couple of things quickly let the movie down. Number 1: Turk dying (yes, I know the actors real name is Donald Faison, but he'll always be Turk to me). Turk was by far the coolest actor and his death was both unnecessary and annoying. If the writers had bothered to put in such an awesome character, why did they have to kill him so quickly (he dies in the first 30 minutes)? Number 2: The completely wacky and stupid things that happened for the rest of the story. The end is completely stupid and so is a lot of stuff that happens. I kept waiting for this movie to get better, but it didn't. As a fan of classic films, this is only my opinion, so fans of the science-fiction genre will probably get some form of entertainment out of this.",

To make matters worse, can we really accept an alien invasion that lacks an expected (read \"proper\") denouement? What, the U.S. Air Force, Marines, Army, and special ops groups can't get the job done? And what's with the surviving indestructible characters? Don't they deserve to triumph over the forces of extra-terrestrial evil as they would were it a \"better\" movie where, one hopes, without mussing hair and smearing makeup as the radioactive dust settles? In short, how can all this combined fire-power and dogged perseverance ....fail?I'm glad it just didn't work out for the earth people this time. More entertaining this way. For me, it's enough that Skyline breaks the trendy spooling out of feel-good plot lines that expose viewers to tedious personal histories and love-lives in character development guise; don't we viewers, filmmakers and writers reason, want relief from too much fast-breaking action and related developments? And isn't it in the America-always-wins world view that the plot should hammer home the creative resourcefulness of humankind? We overcome the worst kind of adversity; we make the evil invader pay.Not in Skyline. The Streuses deserve our thanks for avoiding another Independence Day or War of the Worlds (the Tom Cruise version, not the superb 50's original!). No need to rehash, in other words, the reviews already posted here that point to the obvious weaknesses of the film. The strengths are not so obvious, masked perhaps as they are by its low budget and lack of so-called star-power. Yet, once captivated by the pace of the action and special effects, I'll bet the only reason you'll hit the pause button will be for a bladder break and maybe to fish a 3 minute bag of popcorn out of the kitchen nucleator.If you're a sci-fi addict, as I am, I think you'll like it in spite of the reasons the film-critic(al) part of your brain thinks it's not a \"good film\"!",

So I had no expectations. As a film, it passed the time successfully and I saw it through to the end.It came over as a 1950s B-feature, in that ordinary human beings with their selfish urges are confronted with squishy horrible aliens, and run around screaming until the aliens mop them up. As such, it succeeds quite well.*** SPOILER ALERT ***Unusually, there are no real heroics, and humanity doesn't win.

Over a quarter of the film is spent introducing some bland, unlikable stereotypical characters to the audience, then the aliens arrive, bringing strange, blue lights and their greatest weapons: tedium, obvious (and overdone) scenes and poor, unfinished SFX.Characters come and go (most are never named) before being dragged away; actors such as Donald Faison (Scrubs) and David Zayas (Dexter) actually look embarrassed to be there.There are action sequences though, but all follow the same routine. Characters come across problem (usually locked doors or windows), everything goes into slow motion - usually for no reason - then one or more character(s) gets dragged off to their doom.A note on the aliens: they are utterly unkillable. They (and their technology) are INSTANTLY reformed after any and all attacks, which quickly made me realise just how dull this was going to be. It felt like I was watching two children competing against each other on a video game, but one child was using all of the cheat codes.I really ought to add a note about the ending: There.

And I still don't completely understand why these light things came to earth anyway. I have an idea, but I don't know if they plan to leave soon, stay, or just take care of immediate business. And the ending was horrible. In the same fashion as it seems most movies, this movie ended with the possibility of a sequel. Not all movies have the potential for a sequel. And this movie in particular definitely doesn't have that potential. When they previewed this movie, those initial viewers should have told the director to either make the movie a little more intriguing, or end the movie in a definite manner. (You can always find some way to work a sequel if you want). Now, for the good, I thought the acting was descent, definitely above average, and the special effects were good to go. I also enjoyed the 'diggies' assistance rendered, even though to no avail. Sound good and video good. Is it worth watching?

Also the way the characters are sometimes part of the action, but at other times just powerless witnesses to everything happening around them, seemed very original and believable.The air battle scenes are second to none too and superbly executed.The ending was unexpected and unfortunately left a certain abrupt feel to it.

So when it came out i ran down to the cinema expecting a groundbreaking sci-fi blockbuster but i was bitterly let down. I struggled to stay awake half way through this movie. I even went to the toilet, took my time, came back to the movie and didn't even ask my other half if i missed anything. To be honest all the best scenes with the special effects are in the trailers. Every other part of this film is boring and not much to talk about. The acting was very dull and the characters were uninteresting. This should be voted worst movie with best trailer of all time. Not the worst film ever but it's around the bottom of the pile.",

If the producers of this movie wanted that this movie would be a sucses and different from all other independence day movies they would have to film this movie of the Alien side and sometimes view the human side to make it interesting. And then lets talk about the light that draws humans in to it, whats that all about was the one writing this story at his house in the summer watching flys get drawn into that electric blue light device that kills insects and sayd thats a good idea for the aliens and know that I think about it,let the aliens head look like a fly's head and bam he had is hole storyline! And another thing that woman that's preagnant is mad to her friend because she light's a sigaret it's the end of the world outside I think a sigaret its the last think you think about! So my conclusion I'm sad that such a good story went to waste because they didn't think enough about it and they spend money only on special effects and not in proper dialogue between characters, and even if that was the meaning of this movie why didn't they show the whole movie the alien side and not the human then they didn't need much dialoque and after the movie was finished at least most people would go home with a lot of question about it!Greetings P.s sorry for my English I'm trying to improve :)Any questions or dislikes just send me a message!",

Who cares about the story? If anything, the movie is quite entertaining. the aliens are quite awesome. unique take on their 'powers' as well. the action is spectacular AND very watchable. not the bloody shaky cam or dark crap some other movies in this genre have. I liked it. the CG is very well done. for Independence Day on a budget (Which Skyline is) its damn well done.I thought it was fun to watch. It has quite some flaws but a 4/10 is undeserved imho. there are A class titles that bore you to tears and get better ratings than this. this flick is fun to watch if you don't think about logic stuff too much. this kind of movie is made to entertain at a low intellectual level. it does just that. and quite well, I must say.",

There are just so many things that make no sense at all, you're constantly scratching your head at the strange decisions the characters are making. Why do they behave the way they do? I have no idea and neither will most other viewers.At the end of the day it's an incredibly poor attempt to meld the winning formulae of Independence Day with the Matrix but it fails to equal either movie on every possible level.

At the time, I was too young to watch it in theatres, so I had to wait two years for it to come on TV. I couldn't help but be disappointed. The first half of the movie was great. The CGI was impressive, convincing acting and I was on the edge of my seat. I got bored in the second half. The fun was ruined when the army came in to deal with things, and by the time they'd come, every interesting character was dead and it simply wasn't exciting enough for me. Plus, the directors had decided to not focus on the characters, which were the most interesting things in the movie. Don't get me started on the ending\u0085 long story short it was completely ludicrous. When it could have been a neat sci-fi ending, it turned into an ugly 'Transformers' hybrid with the aliens eating peoples brains! Seriously? It was like the writers had run out of ideas. I've watched this movie twice more since then and i've got the same reaction, which is probably a good thing.

Dire acting and script, and to add insult to injury some really poorly acted slow-mo shots towards the end that had me squirming in my seat.

In addition, I can only assume that the humans being harvested were giants seeing as they were also clearly visible as individuals compared to the size of the ship. Just sloppy filmmaking. The script is poor and the viewer has no empathy whatsoever with any of the characters,I was quite happy with the majority of them being killed.

I was expecting something totally awful, but honestly it's entertaining enough with decent special effects. Maybe my expectations were really low because I read all the negative reviews. I've seen everything from 2001: A Space Odyssey to Bladerunner to District 9. While Skyline may not be able to go toe to toe with the best of them, I still think it deserves more credit than it's being given. Yes, it borrows from a lot of other science fiction stories as other reviewers say.

It was also good that it was more rugged 'we are dead meat a.k.a. Cloverfield' and less polished 'we great Americans save the world a.k.a. ID4'.And the worst parts... the beginning before the title was totally unnecessary - you could call it even a spoiler. And a running time of only 1h35m with the unnecessary beginning and end credits! It felt that the producers run out of money and had to finish early, and after finding out that they had only 10M budget - it's probably what happened.The most amazing thing is that you can actually get a very good looking and decent sci-fi with 10M, when a typical Hollywood thriller with 0 CGI, e.g. The Tourist, has a 100M budget.

Oh look, they're so big and scary, 'oh my god!'. The interaction between the cast was flat and nondescript.

He was way over the top with his \"alpha\" portrayal of the character. He was an employee of the building and yet behaved as though he was an experienced soldier of war. He needed to tone it down and show some vulnerability. I thought Crystal Reed was just awful. She needs to work on her craft much more seriously. Tanya Newbould was probably the worst of the cast. Her hair flipping and screaming made me want to smack her silly. The effects, both visual and sound were great. I loved the script but thought there could have been more depth to the storyline. The slow-mo and panning were great additives. I think this would have done far better if the trailers had been better and more frequent. I don't know if the budget was the reason for the choice of actors, but I would rather have seen unknown actors that could actually act, than actors with somewhat of a name that were poor, in my opinion.

Now that I am a victim of this \"Disappointment\" since The Last Airbender and its been a while. The movie has the touch of District 9, Clover field, War of the World and Independence Day. Nice extraction from all of these. I had a high expectation too after seeing the trailer and so I booked the ticket for the weekend. Thankfully I read the review in IMDb before watching the movie which helped me to lower my expectations and that's the only reason I gave 6/10. When I was told about the budget of the movie, it was a little shocking thing. Because generally Alien invasion movies do take a huge budget and this one did not. So I am sure this would have done its business by now.Since the CG and all these special effects were good the movie didn't really disappoint me. I was like this close to \"disappointment\" and that's because of the characters and acting. None of the actors potential were used by the directors as these directors already are good with CG they focused much on CG and forgot the characters and their contribution to the story. As far as I believe I won't always blame an actor for his/her bad performance in a movie. A good director can make any tom or harry to act and bring out the energy in him to the audience. Each time the actors yell or show panic it really annoys you and I was like when will they show the aliens. The alien controlling the humans like a moth to the light is new and nice. The ending isn't that bad either. At least I didn't expect this ending. But if you have seen all these alien movies like District 9, Clover field, War of the World and Independence Day there is nothing new in this movie except the light stuff and budget. Wait for a DVD release or probably next year this movie will be on HBO.",

            "content": "This is probably my least favorite movie in the year. According to my research it had a $10 million dollar budget which is probably why you don't see any recognizable names. This movie was not cut out to have a run in the theaters, it honestly should have gone straight to DVD. I assume the mass majority of the $10 million budget went to advertising and visual effects because they managed to do well with those. This movie had so much potential, as a matter of fact one of my favorite movies has nearly the exact same idea, Cloverfield. The difference between these two films is Cloverfield had better production and most importantly, a better cast with better acting talent. In Skyline the viewer feels 0 emotion and feelings for the cast, as they spend most of the movie yelling in eat others faces. This movie is a good example of how NOT to act and what dialogue you SHOULDN'T include in your film. What I can get from this film is that the Aliens are not invading for food, resources, or to use us as slaves, no, they are invading in order to harvest our brains to make new aliens. I am sorry but whoever wrote that should be ashamed, it's completely ridiculous even for a sci-fi movie and that says something! On top of this terrible acting and plot, there was a huge lack on details throughout the entire story. When I see a movie I want to connect with the characters, I want to empathize with them. This was not the case in Skyline, the whole movie you are 100% aware that you are watching someone attempt to act. It's like watching audition tapes for crying out loud! The soundtrack wasn't a total loss, although the only good song in the entire movie was Kings and Queens by 30 Seconds to Mars.All in all, this was a terrible movie that had visual appeal. Watch if you want to get a good laugh.",

In fact, it's a very realistic portrayal of what would happened if a technologically superior alien race were to invade our planet. Kinda like what Hawking predicted. There's no Hollywood bullshit such as computer virus, biological virus or even water to save the day.

            "content": "Yes, that's right, it's a lie. You wanna know the truth? This is NOT a movie. It is either only a showcase for special effects or it is only the BEGINNING of a movie. In both cases you should not be tricked into paying the price of a movie ticket for this. As a standalone piece, it's the mentioned showcase. Some guys thought \"Hey, we can make it look as if aliens land in L.A., let's make a movie!\", but didn't waste any thought about some minor things like ... an interesting plot. So there is none. And if you have most of your \"action\" taking place in the same four walls, you definitely need good writing, at least some interesting dialogue. But there is none.The Situation does not move forward until the very last two minutes. Now it gets interesting (Warning: Heavy spoilers ahead). The plot actually moves! From the first try to escape we had been in a standstill for 50+ minutes, and then something new happens: The protagonists lose their fight and get sucked up. But that's not the end, no, that's the start of something new! A new situation arises, finally, but THEN it ends, right in the middle of a scene. All the boring struggle we had to watch was pointless, had they been sucked up right at the beginning of the movie, they'd been in the same situation! And with regards to the already announced sequel, I guess the following: There actually is a script. Judging by the writing of this movie, it probably is a very weak script, but it probably has some turns or twists (at least one). But instead of turning it into one mediocre movie with good effects, they decided to cash in more than once by making two or three (or even more)movies. So we actually saw the first quarter of a movie, dragged out to 90 minutes. That would explain the boring, repeating stuff. So my guess: it's a cheap trick by the producers to cash in several times with only one script/project. But, judging on this \"preview of coming attractions\", there's not much to expect. Even if the plot develops further, the characters are still unlikeable, the dialogue is still meaningless. I will definitely not pay to see any sequels, I already paid for a movie and got handed a piece of ... stuff instead. ;)Only way this could be fun would be a MST3K version. If you're able to riff like they can, go and do it in the cinema, don't be shy. The other people will thank you for it.",

            "content": "'Skyline', one of the latest films in the 'Alien invasion' genre, maintains completely all the defects of the first film directed by the Brothers Strause, sometimes emphasized, sometimes dwarfed. Dull, uninteresting and failed-at-development characters (with some admittedly good actors, David Zayas namely, that weren't really told to act), big creature action, and of course rape on pregnant women. It can't be a Strause Bros. film if there's not a disgusting and monstrous alien creature raping a pregnant woman, now can it? Of course it can't. So, while we have the Predator-Alien hybrid raping a pregnant woman in 'Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem', in 'Skyline' we have instead a multi-tentacled Alien Monster raping a pregnant woman. Ooh, sounds familiar. This film is, fundamentally, the malformed clone of the malformed clone of the malformed clone of the malformed clone of the bastard child from a threesome between 'Indepencence Day', 'War of the Worlds' and 'Cloverfield'. 'Independence Day' was, admittedly and fundamentally, 50s UFO sci-fi common things mixed with Roland Emmerich's own ideas. The formula was successful. 'Skyline''s was not. It begins, after a very short prologue (which position doesn't make much sense narratively, but oh, it's the Strause Bros.) much like 'Cloverfield' with a rather boring, as aforementioned, continuous character development, curiously going in sequences, that always start with a pop/rock song fading into the soundtrack. Then BOOM, Aliens! And the action kicks in. Soooo much Alien action. So much predictable, predictable Alien action. One could foresee the giant Alien creature stomping on the car moments before it happens. Oh, and then there comes the icing on the cake. The ending. 'Skyline''s ending was... an ending? Like, it ended the film? Really? That sequence was the ending? Ah yes. Just demonstrates how incredibly frail the structure of the film is. And the ridiculous end credits just reinforced the strong impression the film gave throughout its duration - it's a special effects showcase. Much like 'It came from beneath the Sea', but in a much, much worse manner, 'Skyline' is just a film made to showcase well made special effects. You know when haters of certain blockbuster films say 'there's no plot, it's all special effects and explosions'? Forget saying that to films such as 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' or 'Avatar', 'Skyline' is the very definition of a special effects showcase which has nothing else going for it. The CGI in this film was quite admittedly stunning. Incredibly good effects, combined with the very nice and fresh designs on the part of Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis contributed to the only real nice side of the film, that being the visual one. No, wait, there was another nice thing. The brain-eating Aliens is a nice reference to old Science-Fiction features depicting them as such, even if in Skyline it was taken to an extreme.

            "content": "Is indeed the reviews. You know what they say. Those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, criticize. In this case most of the people who chose to go see this movie might have done so because they heard from a critic it was awful. I for one went with an open mind and a pure love for Science fiction.Fact: The acting in Sci-Fi Horror movies is almost always cheesy or sub par. The reason being is that the budget does not allow for big named talent. However in this case I think that they chose the right cast to deliver the message. Normal people aren't prepared for an alien invasion and most likely will end up much like these people did.Fact: Special effects can carry a movie all the way to box office stardom regardless of terrible acting. For example, James Cameron's Terminator 2, Roland Emmerich's Independence Day, Michael Bay's anything.I enjoyed all of those movies completely but I must say that the acting was if anything terrible. Acting you'd expect from a Sy-Fy straight to video release.I actually thought that Skyline's acting was mood appropriate and executed well except for Angelo Batista's (HAHAHA) ending sequence. That was terrible and he should be ashamed of that. The Jarrod character ran the gambit of emotions. He acted well with his face, meaning wordless reaction, which is hard to find in young Hollywood.Mostly I have to point out that the pure WOW factor of visuals was definitely worth my $7.50. Matin\u00e9e of course. The Brothers Strause delivered something that excited the senses and kept me entertained. That is all I would expect from a film. If anything, entertain me at my core of impulses.If James Cameron had $10,000,000 I doubt he could have made a better film and the acting would have been much worse.So in closing people, it's not the worst movie ever made as that is reserved for John Leguizamo's: The Pest. And it certainly wasn't the worst movie this year. That was Paranormal Activity 2. Or as I like to call it all the slap, and no tickle. Seriously if they make another one of those movies I need to ask this. Why have all the build for a lame or anti-climactic ending? For your consideration",

            "content": "This review will reveal certain elements of the plot. I will not say this review contains spoilers, because if further information prevents you from seeing this movie, you should consider it not a spoiler, but a gift.Skyline is not so much a movie, as an experiment: Is it possible to create a monster movie with characters so vapid, self-involved, and shallow, that the audience will begin cheering for the monsters? Why yes, yes it is! The movie begins in medias res, showing the aftermath of a party. A strange light shines through the blinds. One of the partiers disappears, and everyone begins screaming. Then, we rewind approximately 18 hours in a directorial decision that can only have been intended to prevent any mounting tension.So. Eighteen hours earlier. Mike \"The Situation\" (or something...I didn't catch his name and it doesn't matter) is getting off a plane with his suspiciously nauseous Girlfriend. He's visiting his old friend Turk from Scrubs, who is a rich and famous...you know, I'm really not sure why he's rich and famous. It's implied that he may be a graphic designer. If that's the case, I need to rethink my life, because apparently graphic designers earn enough scratch to have Ferraris', groupies, and trophy wives.Anyhow. It's Turk's birthday! During the party, Girlfriend reveals that she is (surprise!) pregnant. The Situation is not ready to raise children. This is important, because it gives his character an opportunity to experience an arc. This opportunity will be wasted, mind you, because neither the script not the actor can handle subtlety.After the party, we're back to where we came in. Evil Robot Sorcerers from Space (ERSS) are descending. The blue light from their eyes is hypnotic, and makes you want to go toward the light. Once you get close enough, the ERSS capture you with tentacles and rip your brain out. Apparently, they need brains to reproduce. How did they manage to build space ships to come to Earth when they need human brains to make more of themselves? Shut up! That's how! The rest of the movie revolves around our group of six...no, five...no, wait, three. You know what? Let's count them by taking their collective dimensionality. The rest of the movie revolves around the 1/4 of a character trying to survive the city-wide attack.The Situation and Turk decide that the only way to survive is to get to Turk's boat in the Marina. Because the flying ERSS ships were not flying over water when our heroes observed them. Guys? You saw them descend through the clouds. What are clouds made of? You know what? Never mind. I just realized I won't be sad at all when any of you are killed. Oh, and look! There goes Turk, snuffed out in an almost-entertaining 30-second scene. The movie is all downhill from here.You know, now that I think about it, that's how I should have started this review: Opening credits. The movie is all downhill from here.The Situation is repeatedly exposed to lights from the ERSS, but is saved before he gets his brain removed. That, or the ERSS just decided that he would be a light meal, and not worth the effort. His veins start turning purple, and he suddenly decides that he will do whatever is necessary to protect his family (arc!). There's also lots more talk of trying to make it to the Marina, which they never actually do.After many boring chase scenes, and the deaths of most of the characters you've spend the last 90 minutes learning to hate, The Situation and Girlfriend are finally sucked into the giant brain harvesting ship. Did you ever see the episode of Futurama with the flying brains? Picture that and you pretty much have the inside of the ship. We get to see a montage in which it is revealed that ERSS attack is global.The Situation has his brain ripped out rather unceremoniously, right in front of Girlfriend, in the single moment of the film that made me feel joy. Girlfriend is about to have her brain ripped out as well.But wait! Another heartbeat? We must send her to the Pregnant Women section because...shut up! She's, like, four weeks pregnant, maybe. Do fetuses have heartbeats at that point? Whatever, that is probably the least unrealistic part of the entire film, and I shouldn't complain about it.But wait! The Situation's brain isn't blue, like all the others. It's orange! Must be a Jersey thing. When it is placed in a ERSS body, he retains his memories, finds Girlfriend (to protect his family, you see), and prepares to rescue her from the ship.Then, the movie ends. No, I'm serious. It just ends.As we were leaving, I commented to a friend that I felt this was a brilliant piece of social satire: If we keep watching mindless garbage like Jersey Short, aliens will rip our brains out under the (correct) assumption that we're not using them anyway. He felt differently, however. He mentioned a line of dialogue that I had missed. During Turk's party, Turk asks a friend (an utterly inconsequential character, even by the low standards of this movie) how his movie, Robot Fight (or something) is going. \"Awful, but it looks great, and the director loves it!\" He felt this was a recognition by the filmmakers that they were aware they were not making Citizen Kane. This does not exonerate them. The Brothers Strauss knew what they were unleashing, and chose to do so anyway? I'll etch their names into my memory, and studiously avoid any activity that transfers money from me to them, forever.There is one truly terrifying thing about Skyline: The Brothers Strauss, apparently, intend to self-finance a sequel.The movie did contain a Wilhelm Scream, though, so it's not like it was all bad.",

The music is fine, the actors, even though without any star, have alright performances. The characters aren't very deep, but this is the kind of flick that puts us in a situation were the story is more important than what happens to some individual character.The plot, although somewhat predictable, leaves wanting to see until the end, will they make it or not.It kept me entertained, so thats what matters.7|10",

            "content": "Aliens descend on Los Angeles out of the blue, surround the young casts condo, and prepare to finish them off, then the movie switches to \"15 hours earlier\". What more import information could we possibly need to know, what the characters exchanged for birthday presents? The switch-up kind of made me want to leave the theater. Instead of wondering, who got what as a housewarming present, I was wondering if the theater would give out a refund 10 minutes into a movie. Guess I'm OK with skipping character development. Skyline picks up quick enough after the reset, I did like the movie. In other films, such as the recent District 9, character isn't really developed - the hero's character is revealed as he's exposed to greater and greater stress.I should admit that I'm a sucker for these alien invasion movies, I even give Battlefield Earth 8 of 10 stars. Some of the dialogue in Skyline seems a bit off, but at least it's not safe, politically correct or predictable. At times the dialogue is off on purpose. When one of the characters says something like, \"we're OK now\" you just know something really bad is about to happen. It's almost a cue.For some Skyline will conjure up images of 9/11. Other's have already taken parts of the movie as a metaphor for rampant consumerism. I felt the attack was a metaphor for the 'illegal alien' invasion of the present day. More specifically, I guess, a replay of the phenomenon of black guys sleeping with a lot (I assume) of white girls. Tragedy after tragedy befall our young heroes and in the end one of the young girls sums it all up by saying, \"I hate Los Angeles\". In no way is it funny.There was some infighting among the groups of survivors, perhaps less than in some movies but I felt there was still a bit too much of it. The sympathetic adult our cast befriend has to keep telling one of the young men something like, \"Don't bury your head and hope this goes away\", \"It's real\". When the alien machines turn out to be powered by human brains the guy beside me at the theater cringed. He had a valid reaction. White people aren't That smart. The evidence isn't looking too good on that. Besides, brains don't really seem to be what they are after.At times the movie switches into the mode of fantasy. Some of the American aircraft appear to be models we've never seen before and they have odd sizes and shapes (not sure I've ever rooted for American airplanes this much before). At other times the cast remain remarkably unaffected by the action on screen. It's not even just narrow escapes. Skyline is such an intense movie, and frightening, the fantasy element may help cut down on the tension. I wonder if the disjointed beginning also keeps the movie from being too frightening. When it's revealed we're sort of fighting ourselves it adds even more creepiness and perhaps provides some afterthoughts (of hopelessness) to the experience.Do we ever actually see the aliens? Did they even bother to land on Earth, or just send army sucking probes here? Why didn't the aliens use robot brains instead of harvesting zombies. Are they tapping into some kind of unknown 'life force'. Is it a matter of invading on a budget? We'll never know unless there's a sequel. Maybe instead of Alien vs Predator, Cloverfield vs Skyline. Both movies are very similar, actually. Maybe both attacks come from the same intelligence. A sequel seems unlikely, though, this movie can be summed up with the words 'we lose'. The main thing going for Skyline (aside from the fear, action and horror) is the ending. The ending is atypical: bleak, realistic, frightening, with again just a touch of fantasy to ease it through.Thanx",

            "content": "This review could contain spoilers! I'll be honest, I'm usually the kinda guy who can overlook problems with the storyline and stuff like that. But towards the end of this movie it's just hard to be that generous. I mean, in the beginning it was great. Great special effects, nice action, and it was kinda creepy in an exciting way. I really liked it. Then the nuclear blast came and I was like \"yeah, how did they survive that?\". Of course, I don't know that much about nukes. I don't know if maybe you can make smaller bombs or something that don't wipe out such a big area, and doesn't spread as much radiation. Still, if you can't, that's still a flaw that I could live with. So, the movie goes on, and it still doesn't seem so bad. Special effects are still great. Unfortunately, when they close in on the helipad, it all kinda blows up. Everyone but the two are dead, which is kinda boring, and then they get into a really difficult situation and you think. \"Man, how are they gonna get out of this? I doubt they'll die, it's to much time left on the movie, so there's gotta be something else planned!\" And, no, they didn't die. But what happens is, they go up to the spaceship, Jared gets his head cut of, and as the for some reason red (?!) brain, probably caused by something with the light not being able to finish with it's red vain-transformation thing (I don't know, they never really explain that) is planted into a giant alien, the big snake-machine-thingy notices that the chick...Ell-something, is pregnant. For some reason it therefore takes her into a baby delivering room, probably because they need babies to power their space engines or whatever. Meanwhile Jareds red brain take over the alien it's in and he immediately knows where he is, smashes the wall to the \"nursery\" and saves the chick. And so, by sliding his claws over her face, she's all like: \"...It's you...!\" And then a bunch of other aliens jump in through the wall, and Jared's all like: \"Bring it on!\" And then the movie ends. Except for some photos of the big red brained alien punching some other aliens in the face during the credits, you don't really get to know what happens afterwards. Now, I don't wanna sound mean, but it's hard to understand how such a cool and exciting action movie could turn into such crap. I mean, did the writer just stop at 1:20:00 and say like: \"Ya know what? Let's make it easy and just beam them aboard the ship and let them become aliens or something, that sound alright, huh?\" Anyway, to sum it up, Until like 1:00:00, great movie. From that 'til 1:20:00, okay. After that, you might as well just shut of the TV, you'd enjoy it more not knowing how it ended.",

You will probably have seen the beautiful trailer, just as I have, and were really blown away by the amazing effects. After having seen the movie though, I must say the script is lagging far behind the effects.I'll start with the conclusion!!! If you really are a hard-core Sci-Fi fan, and I am(!), the story starts full of promise, but completely fails to deliver in the end; it is vastly disappointing, I'm afraid. On the other hand, if you are a fan of action-packed, dumb, hack-'n'-slash Sci-Fi with eye-candy effects, and I am as well(!!), you'll be disappointed even more! The ending will utterly ruin it for you, I fear. Science Fiction is a wonderful genre that allows writers to alter parameters of reality... This allows them to raise questions, pose dilemma's, explore moral concepts and engulf us into situations that would not be believable in a normal setting. Skyline start with many such interesting concepts, but it seems unable to follow any of them through. This really gets you going at the start of the movie, but leaves you unsatisfied at the end. I'll name some of these: * It has elements of a body-snatcher movie, but it lacks the suspense of that genre. * It has a hero that starts off weak and finds courage and power, but not in a satisfying or exciting way. The courage and power really doesn't really solve anything, nor does it really have a big impact on the story. * The characters are not particularly clever: They do not investigate, they don't find any weaknesses in the enemy, they never get the upper hand. In fact, they have very little idea, other than to keep going outside, which doesn't really get them anywhere. * There is no really surprising plot, and the plot they do have at the end is very meagre... (Bit of a spoiler: The end would be the same if he did not get the powers, as he is vastly outnumbered) * The ending reminds us of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", but misses the tension or refinement and it is not really hard to guess.In short, it feels more like a carroussel of rip-offs: An attempt to put many good ideas of others in, but none of them done right and without much creativity. It is unfocused, watering all the ideas down to a incoherent slush. In that respect, I think this is more a \"disaster\" type movie than anything else. It has the same elements, like a devastating force of nature, the shock of death and destruction, the fear of death for the characters, the actual death of a few character, a very thin storyline, 2-dimensional characters, with a completely wrong ending for that genre. Put a \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" ending on \"Vulcano\" and you get the idea. Write me what you think!",

            "content": "What makes a film a good film? The most important things in a film are for me that the film keeps my attention and that it is enjoyable to me. The best films are the ones that grip you from the start and drag you along for the ride, keeping your attention close to the screen and your thoughts and emotions connected to the storyline. Not disappointing you too much so you don't snap out of it. And preferably of course giving you the feeling you are really getting satisfied and entertained by it. Reaching the end without any real let downs. For some genres people more specifically love they can swallow sometimes more nonsense without letting it bother them, or sometimes less. A good film in a more favourite genre gives some more special kind of satisfaction and joy. Films about aliens seem to have always been quite popular, specifically the ones that contain a lot of action. Well this film falls into that category. Aliens attack the planet for no apparent reason, which is OK, because we all can come up with some reasons for it, or have no problem with not knowing. I didn't spend much time wondering 'why do they attack?'. It's not that kind of film. They just attack. At start I was glad it didn't seem to be as terrible as people seem to think. There is always someone shouting worst film ever. I don't think I have seen the worst film ever, nor will I ever know unless I have seen them all. Who knows, it might turn out to be really hard to make the worst film ever.... Anyways, I think the problem with this film was simply that it is hard to really get into. I felt at start I got into it somewhat, but it just didn't keep my attention very well. The special effects were interesting, the design of the creatures also. I think I would've liked them more if I had liked the film better. I didn't get very excited about them, but there didn't seem to be much wrong with them either. What was interesting to me was how the more little ones flew through the air like some sort of jellyfish swimming through the water. Though at a certain point it became a bit hilarious that each time there was an overall shot of the part of the city the characters were in there was one of these \"little ones\" flying by. Luckily when I started to wait for the next one, afraid it would come again (and knowing then I would probably start laughing), there came no more.... I didn't have many problems with the film, not many specific annoyances. It's just a very simple film storywise. I thought the ending was a bit silly. DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING.... It didn't really strike me as very interesting how the guy seemed to have managed to take control inside some kind of alien machine. Yay, there is hope, some people can resist it.... Or, he can resist it and some can, but they will get destroyed anyways. Or perhaps it was just him. I think without hoping for much more than nice special effects and a pretty standard story, without hoping for nothing great or very good.... This could be decent to watch. For me it just feels like it was okay to watch, but it didn't make much impact. Just another too standard film, that didn't justify the good special effects. I do not regret having watched it though, but then again I never regret anything I watched. One can always stop watching. Or when stuck in cinema and not wanting to leave, just to think about something else or close your eyes and enjoy the colours. It is not that bad, just not really good either. It is somewhat comparable to AVP (2004), though that sucked more, because it had to be worthy of using the predators and aliens. I hope the directors will learn and improve or hire someone who can help them to make use of the good special effects team. Good luck!",

I even messed around on facebook sent a few texts and wrote this review whilst watching this movie so this is what you call a live review.I found the storyline well what storyline? The special FX were good nothing to exciting. The acting was above coronation st (UK) probably Dallas the series (US).Well its just ended and all I can say is thank god cos my fingers are aching from all this typing oh and the guys wanna get off.

            "content": "This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Actually, I only gave it two stars instead of one because it had pretty good special effects.The idea of the aliens, who somehow hypnotize people, suck them into ships, and harvest their brains... that is not the problem.The problem with this movie is the presentation, the melodrama, the ridiculous scripting.If you think you are going to watch this movie, skip to the end of this review. I would suggest reading the whole thing - because once you do you will realize that you shouldn't watch the movie.The first three quarters of the movie involve a varying number of people hiding in a penthouse. At one point they make a run for it, trying to escape by car. Several of them die rather pointlessly, then they are chased by a variety of gigantic alien creatures it a big circle around the hotel. Then they run back inside and somehow end up back in the very same penthouse. Lots of slow motion is used. Actually, about a quarter of the movie was filmed in slow motion, for no apparent reason.Then the military comes in the next day. They have a giant aerial fight with the aliens, and what appears to be a stealth-bomber, but which is somehow able to maneuver so quickly it puts fighter jets to shame, nukes the big alien mothership. There was originally more motherships, but by this point they have inexplicably disappeared.When the gigantic nuclear explosion clears, leaving the occupants of the penthouse no more than a mile away miraculously unharmed, the mothership reconstructs itself in minutes, spewing out more aliens the whole time.Then in comes a helicopter, and for some tactically inexplicable reason drops off three soldiers on a skyscraper and flies away. The two main characters, a guy and his girlfriend, decide to try and get to the soldiers and escape in the helicopter when it returns.The other two people in the room protest, but the main guy, who is infected with alien energy or something, flips out and nearly kills someone. Then his girlfriend tells him that she still knows it him, not an alien, and they leave.They then spend a long time running around on the roof trying to get to the soldiers, while hundreds of aliens fly around overhead. One alien, about the size of several cars mashed together, corners them, but the main character guy jumps onto it and punches it to death with his bare hands.The helicopter returns and unsurprisingly gets destroyed by a Godzilla sized alien. Eventually,t he soldiers get killed also. The main guy is wounded and his girlfriend refuses to leave him, so they get sucked up into an alien ship together. As they fly up into it, they reach out and grab each other's hands, and share a slow motion kiss.Next scene is inside the alien mothership. it is slimy and full of alien slime and organic matter, and thousands of humans. Giant tentacles are picking people up, popping their heads bloodlessly off, and harvesting their brains. The main guy get pulled up and his brain gets eaten. His girlfriend escapes, because for some reason the alien tentacles discover she is pregnant and drop her.Then you see the main guys brain get dropped into some sort alien life-form about twice the size of a gorilla, and roughly the same shape. It seems to malfunction, falling to the floor, then stands up and looks around in confusion. For some reason the guy's brain retained its humanity and took over the alien's body.Meanwhile the girlfriend gets grabbed by another alien warrior thing which lays on top of her, to, I don't know, rape her or something. Then in comes her boyfriend-now-alien super warrior, and beats the crap out of the other, \"bad\" alien. He lovingly strokes her face. Then the movie ends, showing several still shots of action figures, in which the boyfriend-alien punches several other aliens to death, then carries off the girl.I have managed to condense the entire plot and events of the movie into one, admittedly long, review.The movie sucked. the acting was awful, the scripting was awful, the directing was poor, the actions of characters made no sense, and the ending actually made me break out into hysterical laughter because it was so sickeningly corny and unbelievable.",

Good grief.I felt after watching this like I had just seen a video work up of the first half of an alien invasion video-game. And its the type of game (kinda like the Resident Evil line) were you start off as a normal person or conventional soldier and spend the first half just trying to figure out what the crap is going on. Trying to escape and survive, only to fail half way through and be turned into something more.This movie finds the 'hero' going through 2 transformations in order to survive and ultimately protect his new budding family. However, it is at this point that the film ultimately fails; it ends. So you are left feeling like you've just spent the last 90 minutes watching an edited video of someone else play a video game that took several hours of playing to give you what you are watching just to get cut off when the core of the action is about to occur.This film would have been immensely better (or good at all) if 1 of 2 things would have happened: 1) this film would have instead been released as an apocalyptic survival game or 2) they would have cut out the first 45 to 60 minutes and instead continued with a story based upon the 'hero's' transformation.If rumor is true and they are making a second movie, then I can only hope that the first was merely a very poorly executed prologue to an actual story and plot revolving around the now transformed 'hero' or there is truly no hope at any type of redemption for this film.",

            "content": "Years ago I learned not to put to much faith in movie reviews in deciding whether or not I would enjoy a movie, particularly now when everyone with a computer and an internet connection can start a blog. I remember when The Terminator came out it was blasted by the critics and I didn't see it for that reason. When it came out on video, I saw it for the first time and was blown away. I don't get the uniformly bad reviews this film got.It was an exciting and compelling SF thriller that kept your attention and had few flaws. The pacing was dynamic, the characters well chosen and sympathetic, the cinematography and the special effects superb. Of all the SF alien contact and and invasion movies this is probably the most realistic depiction of what first contact will really be like. If aliens decide to take the trouble to come to our plant they are going to want something, either resources or us, and not only will they be more advanced, but will be operating under natures paradigm, which is murderous and brutal..My guess is that it will be a very ,very bad day for the human race, maybe the last day, and this movie seems to agree with that assessment.Unlike other SF movies that have dealt with this topic, with the theme that humanity , though embattled and badly mauled, survives, there is not blue sky in this treatment of the genre. The overall affect was disturbing. When I see a movie I ask three questions to assess whether it was a winner or loser. Did I have an emotional response, was it thought proving and will I see it again. In this case,the answer to all three was yes. This ones a keeper.",

            "content": "The reason I am bothering with a review here is that between the budget and the special effects artists involved, this flick had real potential before anyone saw it. Because the special effects artists are really good, this film does have a couple of scenes that tease you. They throw you back into the bliss that you felt the first time you watched one of the Star Wars flicks and realized just how good special effects could be (relative to other productions of the day). When you consider just how good this could have been if it had flow, continuity, and a real storyline, the disappointment overshadows everything else. The plot was composed with a child's ability. Namely, as most children tend to do, there was simply too much left unexplained or with too little information to follow effectively. Way too much time was devoted to developing several of the relationships between the characters, which, by the end of the movie, had zero relevance. That time could have been spent providing insight to aspects such as the miraculous reassembly of an alien ship that got nuked and crashed, how an alien that could flick humans around at will can suddenly be beaten down by hand, or how aliens that take explosive ordinance rounds directly to the body just get back up. These lapses get worse as the movie progresses. By the end of the flick we are watching body parts from humans (their brains and spinal cords) being inserted into the bodies of some sort of creature that amounts to an over-sized alien attack dog (and again, with not even the slightest hint as to why). Did a highly evolved and technologically advanced race really come all the way to Earth to change all of its inhabitants to overgrown hairless dogs? It's an absolute farce.I'm going to hang this one on the directors (both Strauses) and others responsible for the storyline. How on Earth did some investment group give the Strauses 20 million to compose this turd? Please do us all a favor and stick to whatever you were doing before you directed movies\u0085I want the 92 minutes of my life back that were completely wasted watching your trash. The lapses in every aspect to the movie's development make this an unbearable waste of time and money. Ironically, the acting isn't bad. Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, and Brittany Daniel did the best with what they were given...you can't blame them for the brain dead behind the plot. Don't waste your valuable time and money\u0085if you have to see this film, rent it on DVD when you have 1.5 hours to waste \u2013 reading your local phone book may be more informative and a better use of your time.Overall, I give this film the rating of EPIC FAIL.",

Tom Cruise as the \"Dysfunctional but caring Dad\" in War of the Worlds was not bad. Shalto Copley in the satire-driven inter-world apartheid saga (an ingenious re-take on Black Like Me with echoes of the historical District 6 debacle) was brilliant, and even the humour and satisfying climax of ID was very entertaining, if improbable.Enter Skyline, which boasts state of the art effects, the sound effects from War of the Worlds, the bodily transformation of District 9 along with \"scrap-heap-appearing\" spacecraft, a scene borrowed from King Kong, the growing clich\u00e9 of things wriggling under one's skin, and precious little character development to the point where the viewer does not really care what happens to any of the survivors, marooned in a high-rise building.Let us be fair: the effects are amazing, and alone merit the price of a cinema ticket. Technology now makes anything possible on screen and the heroes of the film are the computer wizards which make one believe what is happening.Not so the actors. The ones who stand out are not around long enough to upstage the others, who tend to aspire to the Fay Wray school of acting. When there is a crisis, the best thing to do is scream, or yell at each other.I yearn for a plot which will put a really interesting human dynamic first then hit the viewers with special effects which intensify the emotion of the drama. This is not it. The effects are an end in themselves, with the actors being a towel rail on which to hang them. See the film for its technical excellence. Ignore how derivative it is, and it might even generate some hand clutching from your partner. Do not, however, expect it to lead to much intelligent discussion of humanity after the closing credits.",

It reminded me a bit of the disaster movies I used to watch way back in the late 70's when I was growing up - even though the special effects were horrible back then, the realism came in the form of true human suffering.

If you are looking for a deep Sci-Fi story, it is actually here, but it's not written in as dialog. There the worst is over, now for the real deal! The effects are very strong considering the stifling budget! While a few scenes were underdeveloped graphically, enough is done in each part to prevent the viewer from phasing out of the experience, and back into the real world. What is presented is not a knock off idea for an alien species. Quite the opposite, we have a brand new (as far as I know) concept in design presented with strong effects.Despite the predictable dialog as the movie winds up, we are given a chance to feel something as the movie yanks certainty out from underneath you, just in time to give it back before it takes it again. Just as we begin to feel hopeless, something unexpected happens, and we are hopeful again. There are enough up and down moments in the second half to excite me (and to completely throw off my predictions for the end), and I am not the easiest sell.Light script, strong action. A few cheesy moments, several kick-butt new ideas. Lots of affected main characters, surprising options for second chances. Barely average running time, intriguing hanger for the (confirmed) second film!This is a strong 8 for me! Tighten the acting and I would score it a ten for finally having several new concepts at a time when it seems every genre had played itself to the point of pasty slush.

The filmmakers certainly wanted you to know, since they decided the opening scene should be a copy-pasted segment from 20 minutes later on, with shiny lights and weird stuff happening. This is obviously designed to overcome the biggest glaring flaw with the production: characters you don't care about.Skyline begins in a similar fashion to another recent monster movie, Cloverfield, with a bunch of friends having a party before all hell breaks loose. During this quarter of an hour, you'll be very tempted to abandon the film, since the primary characters are so inherently soulless and boring. Thankfully, that clip at the start lets you know that interesting stuff will happen eventually; and once it does, those characters can run and girly-scream with the best of them.This is a good ol' monster survival fest, where all you really need to worry about is who's going to die, how it'll happen, and if anybody gets out alive. It is not deep science-fiction, and you should leave any ideas about that at the door. The aliens and other visual effects are wonderfully done, with a good few surprises in store for the viewer. The tension is kept high, with your wondering if death is around each next corner. And, despite the weak characters, this ride is quite a bit of fun! It even has nice low tension moments to balance out the high tension ones, giving you rest points along the way; something other action films tend to forget >>looking at you, Transformers.All you really need to do here is turn your brain off for 90 minutes and enjoy the ride.

The entire plot seems to be derived from the 1981 Blondie song,\"Rapture\".\"You see a light, and it comes right down and lands on the ground, and out comes a man from Mars, and you try to run but he's got a gun, and he shoots you dead and he eats your head, and then you're in the man from Mars.\"Wouldn't that make an AWESOME MOVIE? Well, not as awesome as one would think. See it at a matin\u00e9e maybe, but don't pay $10-$12 to see it. Or rent it when it comes out on DVD and Bluray in a couple of months.",

The producers decided to save money in actors, screenwriters and directors to spend everything on special effects. The result is an unbelievable random and nonsense story filled up by a ham cast overacting every scene and making clear that there was an director marking their lines. The movie is a parade of stereotypes, the awful soundtrack lets everything even worst and the love story is so bad that you can't even cheer for the uncharismatic characters. Nothing in the movie has a reason or explanation and it could be written by the any inexperience kid who never watched a movie in his life. Not even the least popular disaster movie could be so ridiculous or without rhyme or reason. With the money, the studio could make at least 5 other blockbusters and spare us of two hours watching something that lead us to one of the most ridiculous endings of the history of cinema.",

This movie totally feels like a big budget TV movie. At least it must have started that way, but may be the producers halfway felt let's give it a shot at the big screen. It has all the TV cast, mostly indoor shots. Some where in the middle of this movie u might even feel that may be the actors paid the producers to be in the movie. Whoever conceptualized this movie shamelessly copied from CRYSIS video game. The whole creature concept has been ripped off from there. The color, size, shape even the no of tentacles of the creatures are exact same from CRYSIS. Then u mix it some civilian destruction and anarchy of Independence Day and War of the Worlds, what u get is SKYLINE. Some parts of this movie are enjoyable though, but u have to be constantly awake not to miss them. Another let down was the ending.. honestly u can't expect to beat gigantic technologically sophisticated aliens with just 20 million budget and that's pretty much what happened here. So, whatever u do don't watch this movie anywhere... but on your HDTV (FOR FREE).",

You aren't even that sorry when they are dispatched one by one. Plus, it has one of the most abrupt, bizarre, and mind-bogglingly stupid endings ever. When the closing credits flashed on the screen, my jaw dropped and I cried, \"Are you kidding me? That's it?\" Nothing is explained; nothing is resolved; everything is left hanging. Could they possibly be planning a sequel? This turkey doesn't even deserve to survive, much less procreate. I liked Scottie Thompson on NCIS. I hope this wretched excuse of a film doesn't derail her career. All I can say is, \"What were they thinking? Can I get my money back?\" I've seen direct-to-video movies that were far better.

His bud throws a birthday party for him at his pad, and he gets more than birthday presents. He gets an alien invasion because that is what it is, but this ain't your average alien take over movie, no. I found myself holding on to the edge of my seat left and right. Its amazing the humanity in the movie. It shows just how strong the human spirit can be. You will find yourself loving the couple and just hoping they can make it through the chaos and cheer for them all the way. It may seem like they'll never make it, but like District 9 and Independence Day, you'll see what it takes. One thing you'll learn is how strong love can be for someone, that it never dies, no matter what.I've never seen a movie quite like this before. You got a little bit of War Of The Worlds, Cloverfield, and District 9 in it. It also kind kind also reminds me of a video game called Resistance for the PS3. The creatures any way are a little bit like them.I will warn you, if you don't want to be grossed out by what these alien creatures do in the movie, don't watch it, but it didn't bother me too much, it just grabs your attention all the more! I'd says its a really grotesquely wonderfully scary ride. If you have seen some of these modern horror movies it shouldn't bother you at all, and when you thinks its the end, it ain't. Don't turn the movie off until you see the credits roll. Whats happens at the end is a must see. What was going on was pretty grotesque, but if you just watch it through, it will be worth it to see whats happens in the end in my opinion. Its just a movie after all. Its worth the watch!

This movie has a lot of fun with this idea. It's true that you don't care about the characters... but your not supposed to. That's the point. In fact the script usually gives you many petty reasons to hate the character right before they kill them. Making it a fun American style survival horror movie. Not great, but certainly good.Some reviewers here complain that the movie was uninteresting because the characters where uninteresting. However like most good science fiction the makers are making a good comment on contemporary society and the human condition... in this case that we don't value great people, we are a petty people, and we are a generation void of leadership. Also the behaviour the aliens exhibited towards us with consistent with the way we treat other life on this planet making the vegetarians happy (and again offending everyone else) This is communicated quite effectively through what happens in the movie, but I feel that most viewers when faced with this fact where too self absorbed in their own pride to recognize it (much like the response to idiocracy and it's science fiction comments). Pessimism doesn't make a bad movie. If it did 1984 still wouldn't be in the top 100 (although I'm sure people who where bored through this movie where super board during 1984).",

And it roughly managed to stay away from childish narrations, explanations and dramatic story lines between people that some people seem to long for here. Discluding the couple in question whose relationship got a few minutes of the movie.I noticed that many people were disappointed about the movie for following reasons: the plot is thin, acting poor, no explanation for what happened, ending not what they expected.That almost sums up the things i liked about it. It is a period of few days seen by the eyes of the normal people that experience it. Yeah I know people want to see Will Smith conquer the screen but I think it would have been a totally different movie made around the character. And the ending was a real kicker, I loved it! I have seen enough cartoon movies for this year and this is a very welcome change in that.The Hollywood format would be to use once again the blockbuster template: take in some romance, take in the charismatic star to focus the movie, force some \"narrating\" in one form or another to explain what happens and why. Even more childish would be to show some alien leader skeaming his plots. I know that is what certain people expect but I salute this movie for thinking otherwise.",

I did get the whole brain harvest thing as a tacked on explanation (to the viewer)for the invasion tho it was a little suspect that the \"good\" brain was orange.

OK so the good guys don't win in the true sense of the word and the visitors reason for being here seems far fetched, but is that any more ridiculous than Jeff Goldbloom giving an alien spaceship a virus that incapacitates the entire fleet in Independence Day? In some ways this is a great film because the Americans don't once more save the world.

The intro sets the scene, then the alien invasion begins -the special effects are fantastic, the Blue light drawing the humans in etc brilliant. Everything was going fine until the group attempt to leave the building and the (up until then) main supporting character dies and the group return the building. This is the point when the writers went AWOL! So instead of the film turning into a guerrilla war against aliens, which is where it was looking to naturally progress to it becomes a weak clover field rip off with an ever decreasing group of humans deciding that the best way to escape alien destruction and death is to hide in an penthouse apartment with the blinds closed. To tell the truth this film even with B actors etc could have been so much better - but they needed to expand the film so that we saw other people in LA in the trenches also fighting against the aliens - even if they all lost it would have been much better than watching another 50 minutes of futile looking at blue light and trying to hang a black sheet over the windows when the blinds broke! In fact at that point I almost choked on my popcorn and as for the ending for it really was an incredible anti climax, I found myself watching the film to the end credits waiting for some kind of real finality but alas it didn't happen.In short promising film, not the best, not the worst but still worth a watch - don't think its worth a cinema with trip nachos and popcorn but a watch on DVD yes.",

This seemed to have that cool Sci-Fi potential I like to see in my movies. I thought it just might have one of those rare good plots you don't see coming. I was wrong...It's not just that the base plot was bad, it's that they never went anywhere WITH the base plot. The story begins with some mystery light, and alien ships snatching bodies old-time alien abduction style; with some sort of giant vacuum. The main characters die one by one trying to get away or form some new plan to escape. Eventually the only two left are a couple, including a pregnant woman. One of the machines light things messed up the guy and he apparently established some kind of connection with the aliens control system and the body his brain was put into. (i know, lame right? They use our brains for their soldiers..) The last scene shows the guy taking control of the monster he is in to save his pregnant girlfriend. The end. Thats really all there is. It's a false hope plot with some twist at the end and nobody really knows what any of it means. The aliens come and obliterate us, the end. Oh, and there was a pretty cool Nuke scene. Wasn't too fond of the incorrect military tactics or the bad plane models..I have to mention that this movie has most every clich\u00e9 in the Sci-Fi book. Big bad alien invasion... Military resistance... Military fail... Hope of some miracle... Except in this movie we have no idea what the 'miracle' does to help the situation. Also, if you've played the video game Crysis, you'd recognize that it seems the ships and smaller vessels of the invaders are remarkably similar (cough* War of the Worlds Cough*)... picture all that and mix in an annoying bunch of people in a room for half the movie arguing about what to do, add some SFX and forget any resolute ending... And you got yourself Skyline. Another Sci- Fi WTF movie that could have been really cool..",

It is really a pity, because the graphics are really nice and with an descent scenario, they could make a more-than-noticeable movie. Instead the result was a bad balance between sci-fi and cult (in a scene near the end the main character beats a robot-like alien with his bear hands).

Skyline is awful, it's absolute garbage and I'll tell you why: It has awful acting from mostly no-name, B-rate actors. Not only did i not care about what happened to them, at some points i found myself wanting them to get killed so i didn't have to put up with their crappy acting anymore.Although computer graphics aren't a huge deal for me, those used in Skyline are by no means perfect. Don't get me wrong, they're not really terrible, but for 'alien invasion' movies (particularly new ones) you kind of expect top quality stuff.What i hated most of all was the fact that the story went nowhere, it started off vaguely interesting and went downhill from there. I wouldn't have cared that much if it followed the same old formula because at least there would have been an, albeit overused, structure (and point) to the film. It got to the point where i was completely bored and desperately wanted it to end (by any means, even if it meant starting a fire and causing an evacuation) and if i wasn't with friends i would have more seriously contemplated leaving (something i'm happy to say i've never done...yet).I can't think of anything good about Skyline to recommend to my friends/family/you guys nor can i think of any reason why i, or anyone one else, would want to watch it again. If you're still not convinced (not surprising, when you see some of the other reviews) then please take this advice; don't buy it, rent it.",

It visualize the cold heart harvest of millions of species in an efficient automated way. With no mercy or Pity, not even acknowledgment of intelligent or the right to life. Just resources, Plain and simple. Thats how we do it, thats how its shown done to us.The Movie shows also also very realistic our Place. Were not that super species staying above every know and unknown enemy. No against a species traveling space we are very weak. Like Fish are to us. Not even worth a Word to us.--- The real interesting Part is the Invasion itself. Till now we never got a real Reason why an Alien Race should Invade Earth (i could write a book why almost all invasions movie reasons till now are BS). So why they are coming - well skyline has a nice Idea. AS said before to Farm US.So if we look closer the alien species look like a mix of nanotechnology and Biotechnology. Which makes sense and is far more realistic than ballistic energy shields and stuff like that. They are more like insects or a hive of nanobots.Also they don't use destructive Weapons, they are optimized for their task farming other living things - you don't go hunting yourself a rabbit with a 50cal leaving nothing than liquids. So why our brains - well not only - 1 we see they dump our body's into a liquid the same they use to grow their troops - so they farm living things and use their Biological material to create their own troops - very self contained, effective, cruel and in theory its even possible.Also the Way the War was thought was very realistic. We didn't have a Warning or Reaction time. Our Response was there but of course not coordinated - it would be with 1 Day Response time and zero knowledge about the Enemy and the time of fight and success rate was approbate to the technology difference.Also the cruelty we got harvested wasn't easy to swallow. we got used like we do with fish. get paralyzed, then harvested, still alive on the ship until we get processed. then automated super efficient break our skulls get our our brains. not even leave our body's to waste.There only 2 real things to criticize. 1. The Actors should have acted smart, on a top level and still standing no chance. 2. The Last Scene was unnecessary and made no sense. it turned the hole movie into a comic. a plot twist yea why not but another one :) Of course hard to find a real twist given the superiority of our enemy.",

Otherwise the song largely sums up this film. Incidentally, nuclear weapons don't have much impact on Los Angeles or the inhabitants either. This film though is better than B movie material it does have some good ideas and sometimes it shows how much better it could have been. The main idea is rather good, the use of the telescope is a great idea and I wish they'd used it more to see outside the apartment rather than the irritating fussing with the curtains. Equally and perhaps less contrived would have been to use a security camera. The increased feeling of claustrophobia and the necessary interaction that it would force between the characters would have been better than the pointless trips outside \u2013 cheaper too. It would have needed a better script, more character development. I guess they thought its easier just to be killed off rather than engaging with the audience. The lack of character development and pointless back story meant you didn't care. And what were the women for? A love triangle, an unplanned pregnancy, hardly adding to the drama when the world's being destroyed. Then there were the clich\u00e9s; rap music every time the black guy was in shot, the dog that runs off and someone has to chase it, hiding from the monster behind things, putting the whimpering girls to bed while the men stand guard. Is it really 2015? I assume the film is aimed at younger audiences and tries hard not to offend anyone, no drugs at the party except alcohol (not even tobacco) two weak bitchy comments between the women, but no swearing and certainly no interracial kissing. It says a bit about modern culture that it's OK to wander around the block of flats with a gun, but breathing in second hand smoke isn't. The two staples of American movies; the shoot out and the car chase, were present, but thankfully kept me watching by trying some nice twists. I especially liked the futility of shooting at the door handle and the aborted car chase. But the aliens are no better a shot than most movie bad guys and despite their ability to make self-repairing machines, levitate people and travel across the universe, haven't developed thermal imaging. A shame given that they arrived at night when everyone is in doors. The film is ultimately unsatisfying because conflicts aren't resolved, you don't care, or particularly like the characters. And while the aliens are doing nasty things to us, there's no feeling that they are bad themselves. Actually, leaving the planet without humans may be doing the world a favour.",

It would have been a sad, tragic tale if the humans had lost this round and the movie ended with the couple being pulled up into the ship. We cry and wait to see if they make a post-invasion sequel or just leave it as a lesson that even in the movies, humans don't always win like we hope.Unfortunately, they decided this wasn't the ending they wanted.

The story is non-existent to the point where at the end the audience was left wondering if there is a twist to the movie, but the whole movie being so bad, nobody really gave a thought other than getting the hell out of the cinema, inception it is NOT!

All I thought through the whole thing was this is such a crappy War of the Worlds movie and when is something going to happen. I would only rate W of the W average but it would be a 12 compared to this movie. The dialog was horrendous!!! And would not go out of my way to see any actors after watching them in this movie (except David Zayas who actually looked like he tried to do the best he could with what he had) There is nothing redeemable about this movie...I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! DO NOT WAIST YOUR BUCKS IN SUPPORT OF SUCH A LOUSY FILM!!!! I agree with michele3115 the cast and crew must have been told to go rate this movie with high ratings as I cannot see why anyone would rate this more then 1.",

Eric Balfour (whom i do love as an actor) had no-where to go with the script...the story line was 'lame' to say the least.... An upside to this movie is there are quite a few laughs to be had.. although I am absolutely positive that was NOT the intention of the film. Am impressed how one building is still standing with all the huge Aliens climbing up and down it and all the bombs, gunfire and planes crashing....wow...that was what impressed me most about this film really (and yes that was sarcasm) I only wish I hadn't wasted an hour or two of my life watching it :(",

They invade, they kill, army retaliate and a poor ppl just run away as hell - that's the hole script and this is what needs. Same with acting, what did u expect from characters, that run and hide the whole movie? Imagine urself, in this situation, what would u do?Also the ending was sick, and not expected.This movie has problems, but it's really worth to watch.

If you put any movie under a microscope you'll see at least one goof.The characters in this movie don't have fleshed out backgrounds. But that's okay because they're NORMAL PEOPLE. None of them have any hidden mysteries in their past like one of them was a Russian spy or someone else was really a serial killer. They're a group of normal people that are flawed, and are trying to deal with certain issues that arise that even normal people find complicated when BAM! Alien invasion. Like normal people they have absolutely no clue what to do except to hide and fight amongst themselves about what to do.A lot of people have been bad mouthing the actors calling them \"B-List TV actors\". Eric Balfour (known to some as Duke Crocker on the TV show Haven) is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated actors out there. He DESERVED to be in a movie and he does a terrific job as the lead.Also, people don't get \"burnt up\" when they're attracted to the light. Any review you read that says such nonsense is written by someone that watched the trailer and wrote a review.Others have said there's no acts of heroism in this movie. To them I have to say \"Maybe don't turn it off before the last 20-30 minutes of the movie and claim you've watched the whole thing.\" I'd have to say the acts of heroism that happen are pretty big considering these are normal people with absolutely no combat training or aptitude.Sure the movie doesn't resolve in a lovey dovey happy ending where Bruce Willis or Will Smith save the Earth and the President gives a heartfelt speech but it's an ending with a promise of a continued story. One that I hope is continued (especially since there was a plot point that never really got explained and I can't figure out).",

There were no daring inhuman rescues, the central characters were all realistic, there was no, turning the tide moment when some dumb guy realizes he can kill the aliens with music or found their ship hidden underground and take it on, it showed effort, intense fighting between the air force and aliens, shows courage and how people would actually react in a situation when they are under attack by an unknown force, I think this a great movie thats totally underrated.",

Generally, this was an average story told really bad. What was up with that strange flash forward start of the movie? It did not add a thing! The relationship with the building security guy and the main actor was weird. Nothing happened between them to cause them to be in each others face. I have never walked out of a film before, but I was the most tempted here. The only thing that kept me was the $9.50, and the commitment of time already spent. I am OK with the parallels to other films. Great films are original, but good stories can be told with recycled elements. Actually, the only reason I gave it a 2 was because we saw the roof of the building that got destroyed by aliens in \"Independence Day\", and the fact that the aliens won. I laughed out loud when the alien became the guy when his brain was inserted, setting the stage for a sequel! Who in their right mind......

So I rented this hoping for a good sci-fi movie and that's what I got. So for all the Ebert/Roeper wannabe critics who basically looked like they cut and pasted the same thing over and over again, such as it was too much like War of the Worlds, Independence, Day, the Matrix, the aliens were this, the ships were that, poorly acted, the storyline thin, it lacked substance and form, give me a break. Was it an academy award winning film, no but it never set out to be. What we have here is a roller coaster ride of a sci-fi film, putting everyday normal people in a stressful situation and watching them react. Did they put-up sheets to hide from the aliens, yes, what would you have done when your trapped like a rat and trying to hide from an enemy far superior than yourself, everyday normal people panic and do stupid things. No one in the group of survivors had any special abilities and the dialogue was what one might expect from everyday normal people, the one exception being the lighter scene which was over the top, but hey given our movie pop culture and the adrenaline that could be coursing through ones veins, it is not an implausible one to recite. Was there a hero, no in reality what could anyone do in that position given the odds the movie set up for them. Bottom line, any race that comes to our planet is gonna be far more advanced than our own, so set the macho ego aside and face the facts, if aliens were to show up, it's basically game over for mankind being the superior life form. Our weapons would be primitive compared to anything an intelligent race able to travel here would possess, aliens aren't coming here as ET promoting a new toy line, and if you don't think we wouldn't nuke an alien invasion force in a last ditch effort to avoid extinction than your just plain ignorant. Man colonized the new world and destroyed the indigenous population for their own gains, what do you think aliens traveling the galaxies would be doing, thats right looking for worlds to conquer, natural resources to harvest, a food source, etc. This is the concept of the film and in that respect it delivers the goods, from using light to lure, attract, and catch us like a fisherman would a fish, or hunting us down like an exterminator would a pest, to finally taking whatever we have to throw against them and brushing it off while destroying our military and it's weapons in the process. So, if your looking for a feel good, we overcame the odds ending, than go see a Disney movie. Want a hero to cheer, pick a different film to watch, looking for Academy Award winning acting, than why would you see this movie in the 1st place. However, if your looking for a sci-fi film, full of action, retelling an alien invasion storyline that takes a different path and presents a more realistic outcome, than you'll probably enjoy this film, I know I did. I took it for what it was, enjoyed the ride, and I'm glad that I did !!",

            "content": "The alien invasion movie. A genre much visited throughout the history of cinema and one filled with the potential to both entertain, and to frighten audiences. Sadly for the Brothers Strauss, this film does neither.Being an avid sci-fi fan since very early childhood, I find it hard not to get excited about the prospect of any upcoming sci-fi movie, and decided to ignore the directors previous shocking failed attempt at the genre (Alien Vs Predator: Requiem), and view this one with an open mind. Everyone deserves a second chance after all. The trailer I saw didn't give away too much and left me genuinely looking forward to seeing this movie.Within the first half an hour of the film, I was already regretting my decision and felt thoroughly bored. The characters are painfully one- dimensional and instantly dislike-able (much like in AVP:R), and throughout the movie there is very little, if any, character development. Nothing about the characters lures you in enough to make you care about their fate, so the film falls at the first hurdle. The script plods and stumbles on acting as nothing more but filler between action sequences.As for the action, the CG is rather a let down, particularly as no money or effort appears to have gone into plot/script etc. Most of the action scenes are clich\u00e9d and thanks to not caring about the characters, and some truly poor cinematography, there is no tension, not once was I on the edge of my seat. The movie ambles along, never taking the viewer anywhere new or even interesting, and by the time it reaches it's abrupt and absolutely ridiculous conclusion, offering no explanation, or closure, I'm mindlessly bored and just thankful that it's over. This film feels lazy. It doesn't require thought, concentration or effort from the viewer, and doesn't appear to have been given any by it's creators. It left me wondering, at a time of global recession, how on earth such wasteful spending can be justified in the name of entertainment, when it offers none.To summarise, one of the worst films ever made.",

This may be totally an unplanned side effect of the movie, but I'll give credit for it anyway. And who says the ending is gloom and doom. Clearly the principle male character has transcended his experience maintaining a semblance of his humanity. (Doesn't this count for something) Hopefully not some mundane 'love conquers all', but only a sequel will answer this and hopefully while answering some questions, raise more.I got the sense that this movie was like a serial from the 50's with a cliff hanger at the end, enticing you to watch again next week to see what happens next.Bring on the sequel",

So I couldn't resist logging in and typing something against that. So this is also my first review.There are many movies which consist of aliens and non human stuff. But we need to remember that we can not go into space, and that we don't know of any life outside our galaxy. And if aliens do exist and they invade earth, they really need to be powerful, so what can a human being do? It can even be that a nuclear bomb ain't that strong to destroy them. As they have a completely other biological structure.The invasion happened so fast, other movies often take their time when an invasion occurs, also there is no concept of a hero, people who are stronger. Only the military who tries to resist them, but they are also failing. They did a little bit of damage, but as they are extraterrestrial anything can happen. And offcourse to the end the guy who turns up into that monster .. it's not a superhuman or so, but exceptions are needed to add something special to a movie. Otherwise we would just have slaughter, and an up-coming movie won't be that easy or even good at all.The actors in the movie aren't well known, well I don't know them at all, but I do find that some movies especially this kind of movie needs it, otherwise all the attention goes to that famous actor and you just know he will never die.I also read that someone blamed the movie that the end was open, and that the movie wasn't that great because they did want to see an end to a movie. This isn't the first movie I saw with a 'sad'/open ending. I think the movie has a really great ending for a follower.Lets hope skyline 2 will be upcoming, really fast, as I can't wait to see the follow-up of this movie! :)",

Ando for the very reason i like them, i liked this. It was quite simple and did not contain any major a-list stars, (although seeing Donald Faison in a semi-serious role was cool) so more time and money could be spent on the effects, which were amazing. the idea behind the story was great, an army of alien ships come to earth, capturing civilians and killing people in an attempt to take over the plant and grow larger. however, the portrayal of this was less than great. it was chaotic, rushed, too short and forgot some key elements like , i don't know, a plot, a proper beginning, and an ending. in fact, just an ending would be nice. If the credits didn't come on, i would have had no idea the film was about to end. I mean normally, a 'go on without me' scene in all it's drama would normally take two paths. either the person or group go on without them, or they struggle on with them. either way, a new sense of courage is normally inspired into the aforementioned group and they fight on until the end of the film, whether they win or lose yada yada. In this case though, there is the 'Go On Without Me Scene', then they are captured, and then the dude turns into an alien. all logic says there has to be a sequel but my bets are that they don't. If they do, they really need to think hard about how they are going to make the film. less about the blonde bithcing about her boyfriend cheating, (whilst about to be devoured by an army of aliens bent on world domination... normal)and more of an actual plot.",

Main points; -At times the dialogue is corny and unrealistic, which takes away from authenticity.-The general plot and concept of the movie is genius, but it was poorly written and executed. For example - The very beginning of the movie was nothing but filler. All the time that was spent on building up characters... was an utter waste. Halfway into the movie you realize that the first 45 minutes were irrelevant to the entire plot.The key to a good sci-fi is making the fictional parts believable. Didn't happen here. For example...As super-natural as these aliens are, it should be impossible to successfully hide yourself behind a kitchen counter without being found. No heat sensors? no super sonic hearing? no x ray vision? Not feasible.I enjoyed the ending. Not what i was expecting! Great set up for a new movie. It left me wondering, but i still wasn't disappointed.The visual effects and CGI are top shelf for a low budget sci-fi/horror! It was visually appealing and shot very well overall.In all, Not bad. I liked the general concept, but it doesn't feel like the script was thought out well. I feel as though production was rushed. It wouldn't have taken much to tweak a few things to make the movie more believable. Aside from that, i was entertained and it kept my attention. Rent it, but don't buy it.",

Maybe the only reason why they appeared bad, was because of the horrible dialogue. OK, not HORRIBLE, but still really bad.

            "content": "Warning : There are a couple of spoilers in below, but not in the first 4 paragraphs.I'll start this review by saying : \"I love sci-fi movies\". So after briefly looking at what this movie got on IMDb (the rating and not any of the reviews) I thought : \"Well its not going to be great but it's the first truly sci-fi movie in a while so I'm sure I'll at least enjoy some part of it\".HOW WRONG I WAS! From the terrible beginning where we're introduced to the cardboard cutout characters and their even more cardboard acting spouting lines of clich\u00e9'd cardboard dialogue, there's just no engagement or caring about any of them as they just don't seem real and you instantly disconnect... but at this point I suspended my feeling of impending disappointment as I thought 'Soon there'll be alien stuff which should at least liven things up and distract from those bad things' (Independence day style) but as events start to unfold you realise that one of the central ideas of the movie is that you're supposed to care about the characters as the movie is very much 'events from the little persons point of view'.And here's the movies greatest failure : It tries to create the tension, panic, uncertainty and claustrophobia of a 'What if you or I were in that situation?' (a la Cloverfield) but IT FAILS ABYSMALLY. The central tenet of such a film is that you HAVE to identify and feel a connection with the characters so you actually care what happens to them, thus they NEED to feel REAL. As I said in the first paragraph, any chance of this disappears 5 minutes into the film. The script is dreadful, the things the characters say in response to the situation don't even make sense sometimes and every other line is a clich\u00e9. The actions and ideas the characters have are also totally unreal/non-logical and further add to the disconnect between the film and its audience.The story is pretty much just as bad and doesn't really have any idea what it's doing or where it's trying to go. Examples : The so-called love story which suddenly emerges 15 minutes from the end as being of central importance to the movie comes from nowhere, previous scenes between the couple don't even allude to the kind of love between the 2 characters that we're led to believe suddenly exist and are central to the films conclusion! It's just laughably bad! And the scene where a central character beats up an alien is one of the worst scenes in a film EVER! It's not even done tongue in cheek!!The film also has problems working out what it wants to be : As I said earlier, it wants to be Cloverfield, trying to emphasize the helplessness and confusion that the characters feel about not knowing what the hell is going on. But other parts it feels like it wants to be Independence day, with its bigger picture of events portrayed to the audience, but it has to try and do this through the characters and their view so you end up with them saying things that are even more unrealistic/illogical. Other parts (especially the dumb ending), you get the feeling it's trying to set itself up as another Matrix type saga (ie. 1 of the main characters after experiencing the alien influence becomes special for some completely unexplained reason).I'm not going to go into effects (they're good), or the music (it's bad), or the bits where there's actually some alien action on the screen (not too bad), I'll leave that to someone else, especially because I feel these get totally overshadowed by how lacking and confused the film is in other directions.To sum up : If you want to see a film that portrays the 'alien invasion from the little persons point of view', my most recent recommendation would be : 'cloverfield' (it's not fantastic but does this aspect pretty well). If you want to see all out action alien invasion movie : see 'Independence Day' or a host of others in a similar vein. DON'T SEE THIS! Please Hollywood, spend the money for the sequel on a Simpsons style land of chocolate for L.A. that will melt within a half hour. That would be a more worthy use of the money than more of this drivel!",

            "content": "I'm not qualified to rate this as THE worst film of 2010 (nor is anyone else who hasn't seen most of them, which is almost no one). But I can say that this is the worst film I'VE SEEN from 2010.I'm been an ultra sci-fi fan for over 55 years, so I know and love the genre to the max. As sci-fi, this plot is worse than what I could have written in 5th grade!!! I'm not that much of a horror fan, so someone who is into that genre would be better qualified to rate it. But I think this is more horror than sci-fi, actually you could class it as \"horrible sci-fi\" LOL! Not only is the premise on which the plot is built terrible, but the film doesn't even stay true to what I could surmise is the weak core theme of the film (I won't give it away since I know there are many people who loved this film - fine with me, whatever turns you on!). Not only is the plot bad but I found myself disliking every character in the film, not necessarily because of the acting, which wasn't great but it was better than the plot and script. They were just plain obnoxious, so I wasn't unhappy to watch them grabbed by the aliens one-by-one. I started cheering for the aliens half-way through, because this was so bad that I wanted them to end my misery by taking me too. :) I hung in there hoping it would get better, after reading about how many people loved it.Sci-fi is, by definition, supposed to be based on science (thus the term, right?). The alien \"science\" portrayed is not only simplistic, it's not consistent. Sci-fi is supposed to establish some type of baseline science on which it's based, where it's extraterrestrial, paranormal, bacteriological, etc. The aliens' science in this film is almost incomprehensible - it just doesn't hold together technologically or biologically. For example: At one point, the characters talk about escaping by boat because there are no alien craft over the water. I expected they would follow thru on that to give us some clue of alien strengths and weaknesses. But we never hear about it again. The list of such inconsistencies goes on and on and on...I would not recommend this film to any serious sci-fi fan. But to those who love schlocky horror films, talk to your friends and it's likely that if they liked it, so will you. That's not a judgment on my part since I like certain kinds of schlocky films, but not in my #1 fav genre. That's sacred to me :)",

            "content": "This was a great jumping of point for what I think could be a great Trilogy. I know the sequel for 'Skyline II' is in the script drafting process as we speak. The Strause brothers really just wet the audiences beak for a great possible series of movies. As a Foot-note: I am a huge Sci-Fi First Person Shooter Gamer. It's a niche that a lot of people find them selves drawn do to the story and intrigue along with grueling violence in some games. Like with this movie you can't wait to see what the sequel has in store for us. The preview for this one is just pure mayhem and I have a feeling that Skyline II will have more of a story-line slash suspense feeling to it since they laid the ground work for the characters and ended the movie at a point where they could go in a number of directions.The movie was basically the first half of 'Independent Day' meshed with 'Cloverfield', but you could see the different \"monster's\" the entire time, and there was quite a variety of 'monsters'. Pretty much total destruction and slight us versus them, and the \"Oh my god! What are we going to do?!\" feel through the film. Though it did keep me glued to the screen I personally thought there was a lull with the actual story. They could have easily added another half-hour as the movie progressed from the aliens point of view as far as the invasion went. Like: \"Hey! Director, what our motivation for coming to earth\"?Anyways if you have not seen it, it's one of the better movies out right now.",

In the closing scenes showing New York I believe, it appeared boats and ships were attacked. I just don't understand where they were going with this. It just didn't seem like there was enough depth to the characters but then again maybe it's because most everyone dies. The film was too short.

            "content": "This movie does many things well, particularly in it's non-cliche plot elements. For example, while in most \"zombie apocalypse / alien invasion\" movies, the lead characters are compelled to leave their safe boundaries/shelters by some plot macguffin, (like a left behind character, or some other sentimental item) whilst in Skyline, the characters have a constant danger looming over them, a danger that actually seems reasonable and doesn't feel like a plot element the writers forced in to advance the plot.The characters are the first characters in a disaster movie where they act like real people. At first, they have no idea what is going on, and their understanding of the events in the movie progress realistically as they learn more. Furthermore, the characters are very relatable, as they are not like in most generic disaster movies (e.g, the lead actor plays a character with some special ability or training) because they are completely normal people thrown into a dangerous environment.Special Effects is where this movie really shines. The cinematography is great in most scenes and really adds to the tension. In one scene, a handheld camera is used as they go down an elevator into danger. Gives a really claustrophobic feeling to the whole scene and creates a lot of tension. The CGI is impossible to overstate. The Brothers Strause have already shown themselves as capable Special Effect creators, and this movie is no exception.The script has some weak points, such as the ending, but I never found myself questioning \"Why would the characters do that?\", or even found myself being bored for the entire duration of the movie.TL;DR, Solid disaster movie, relatable characters, amazing CGI. Definitely worth a watch on Netflix.",

So the movie starts off with some guy and his girl in bed and a blue light waking them. They awake to this girls screams where some dude disappeared. there's a flashback to 15 hours or so earlier and you meet tons of characters you don't care about and never see again in the movie. The main characters party it up for a night and everyone seems like major dicks. When the party ends people go to sleep and thats where it reaches the part from the beginning of the movie. from there its death after death of people you don't know and don't care about. and to make things \"better\" the foremost character obtains super powers from staring into alien light. The ending is about as dumb as the rest of the movie because the super human main character beats an alien to death just to get abducted anyway. they kiss and you think the movie is over. NOPE! you see the main girl being forced to have a baby she didn't want and then the main guy turning into an alien and beating the crud outta the other aliens. end of movie, audience claps cuz its over and i sleep with 100 less brain cells.

I actually enjoyed it. Graphics are good and the movie in general is more realistic about an alien invasion. If aliens with all those weapons and super advanced technology invade the earth, lets face it there is no way all countries combined could survive it, let alone one hero saving the whole planet. I actually feel this is the part that is pissing people, that movie heroes are not actually heroes, they are just normal people trying to survive.The technology aliens use in this movie is very believable for someone who has knowledge of science trends and future of biotechnology.

            "content": "(note: you can read safely, I don't think I'm spoiling anything)It's nice to see a movie that depicts what would *really* happen if aliens invaded our good old earth. In a sense this flick is more brutal than most, and way more realistic in the depiction of how retarded human technologies would fare against beings superior enough just to find us before we do, but also badly kick our butts in the process.Granted, Skyline is somewhat of a B+ movie and it won't ever make IMDb's top 100 list, however it did entertain me way more than many other blockbusters such as the horrendous \"Elysium\" to name just one.As for ranters and haters, you just have to read why they actually do not like this movie to understand just how spot-on it is. So here is my response to the featured review of 'changmoh' titled \"Great Effects, Godawful Script\" : \"Skyline is an alien invasion flick that has a touted US$10 million budget!\" => to me, that makes it even better, the CGIs puts those of many a blockbuster to shame, the alien war crafts have fantastic designs and the aliens themselves are just awesome. The air-fighting scenes are just as good, so blaming a good CGI movie for its low budget is just utter non sense!!! \"lame script\" => I think just about to the opposite, characters just crap their pants, quite rightfully, so I don't see why they should come up with Shakespearian dialogs or funny jokes. This is a bone-dry script that actually enhances the harsh violence of the situation.\"B-grade TV stars\" => again, so what?? Everyone plays its part, the successful guy is vain and self-important, as he should be, the two supporting females are rather shallow (hello, this is LA!) and the building manager is pretty convincing. As for the starring couple, I felt they did a good job too and please, don't tell me this would've been better with Tom C or Keanu R ! The fact that they are unknown make the plot all the more believable, and it's nice to see new, decently acting faces.\"No attempt is made to show the scope of the 'body snatching' and its effects on the millions of other city-dwellers.\" => Again, thats the whole point !!! It is happening fast, it is brutal, and to -not- show the specifics keeps the suspense hanging for the end. It is shown way enough, just from afar, maybe someone just wasn't paying attention? \"the main characters are being portrayed as such selfish and unsavoury people\" => If you also feel that way, I humbly suggest you return to Bambi or LOTR and yeah, don't watch Skyline cause ya know, the characters are \"selfish\"! \"The writers must have had the notion that audience interest can be sustained if they have the characters yell at one another.\" => Waaaat? OK, hey, aliens are just ab/sub/ducting millions of people, lets just make shush jokes and play low-key kumbaya...Alright I'm done ranting but although I can admit that Skyline has some way to go compared to the best Sci-Fi production, I just can't stand by and let true Sci-Fi fans get discouraged by this nonsense note of 4.4! It's ways better than Cloverfield (7.1 note!), trust me, and you will hate haters that made you wait so long before watching it IMHO.To summarize: take it from a true Sci-Fi lover, Skyline is a very, very decent and gripping sci-fi flick! As for the ending, that apparently so many didn't like, it made me like the movie even more, like \"Empire Strikes Back\" did. Not all stories must have a happy end, and guess what, a bunch of vastly superior aliens invading Earth may not end so well, contrary to what Hollywood brainless producers always want us to believe...Watch it, and hopefully we'll know the rest of the story sometimes soon, as it was \"planned for 2012\"...

I can look out my window. I see it all day long.People watch movies to fantasize that things will eventually go right when the crap hits the fan and the worst seems to be happening. Overcoming adversity in the face of terrible odds, survival of the human spirit when being crushed. . . that sort of thing. People WANT to see push back against the enemy. People NEED to see the revenge scenario play out when things have been so terrible.When it comes to an alien invasion action movie, that has that human race on the verge of extinction, people running around being slaughtered, and yelling stupid things to each other for an hour and a half. . . this is PARTICULARLY true.

Why was Jarrod affected differently than every other person on Earth? I couldn't help but laugh when they took his brain, and it took over the alien's body. I hardly spend anytime working on homework, and i'm a college student. However, I felt like i needed to create an account and put up a review on this movie.

That certainly didn't help my personal attraction to the movie. The actors in the movie or OK but nothing great and some of the acting is a bit faky in my opinion. If there isn't a second movie than there was really no reason for making the first as there was nothing that tells you why or who is invading and there was no \"answer\" to anything although I kept saying to myself I bet \"this\" will happen or they will try \"that\".

Heck I am sure more than half of you( including me) would be unable to tell me what the main characters friend did for a living. (actor, director, producer?) 2)The story. Along the same line as the characters. Aliens come in, start eating our brains..... Rebuilding ships? People surviving so close to a nuclear blast. Giant aliens, small aliens? A guy killing an alien with his fists, even though missiles, and bullets could not harm it earlier. People kissing while floating up to the spaceship to have their brains eaten? Come on, you had to laugh at that one. And don't forget an alien species who are wiping out all of humanity, yet spare a woman who is just a few weeks pregnant. They also had to insult our intelligence and make all the brains blue except for Jarrods, which was red. Really a different color GLOWING BRAIN.The only reason I did not give this movie a 1 or a 0 was because the special effects were done really well.

To that end I though that for the most part the acting was OK, I didn't find myself thinking this is rubbish, and it gives a sense of ordinary people completely out of their depth in a life or death scenario.As for wanting the characters to come acropper .... nowhere near as much as I wanted to see the whole of the cast of War of the Worlds done in.Made for \u00a310mil and made over \u00a370mil, who's laughing?

My husband said it looks like a cheesy version of independence day. I thought OK, I'm a sci-fi alien loving kinda gal, it's a night out while the kids are at grandma's house, let's go! I want my time back. I would have enjoyed cleaning my stove out more. I would have had more satisfaction scrubbing a toilet with a toothbrush. You didn't care about a single character. 10 minutes of back story on ANY character would have helped. And I mean seriously who names the two main characters Terry and Jerry??? To me the aliens looked like giant apes with lady parts for heads. When nothing worked to kill them I actually said out loud, well you're screwed, just give up. And the props used at the end! You could EASILY tell it was garbage bags inside the alien ship! I mean come on, garbage bags???Since we had the night out we met us with some friends after, and we warned them all, do NOT go see this movie. It's not worth it. Save your brain cells. All I walked away from this movie with was a bunch of questions that they could have easily taken 10 minutes in the movie to answer. How did the guys know each other? Grade school, high school, college? Why didn't they already work together? What was his profession exactly??? Why didn't they go to a different apartment, one that didn't have 200 giant open windows? Surely the stairwell would have been safer than that apartment! What was the deal with the veins popping out? What was the aliens purpose? to steal all the brains and just massive reproduce?

Most of these types of movies leave you with some ray of hope. A lead character or characters who despite the slim odds, offer some chance of hope for the survival of humanity and a happy ending. This movie went the complete opposite direction. It showed, from the perspective of average people, how ill-equipped humankind would be at defending itself from not just a more advanced species, but one that is truly alien to any notion of what you might imagine an alien species would look like or would want from us lower life forms. And unlike aliens in other movies that want our water or other natural resources, these are in search of something a little more sparse in our universe... well evolved organic material. The aliens seem to be a hybrid race that is just as much mechanical as they are organic. I'm not talking like Borg or something. The mesh between organic and mechanical had me wondering if this was some type of race of machines that had incorporated organics into it's makeup, or the other way around.I have to admit that the ending did leave me a little unsatisfied. Not that it was bad, but it leaves you hanging after providing the first glimmer of hope that the human race might endure after all. This might be the main aspect that turned off so many to this movie. Without closure, the rest of the story just seems without purpose to some. But hey, it's an end of the world movie. No matter how the world ends I don't think it will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. This might not make the top of anyone's favorites lists, but if you're a real sci fi fan it's a must see.",

Now i think there was only a budget of about 10million for this flick which is very small so you have to say the special effects were very good but you will never get away with spending 9.99 million on special effects and paying z-list actors whatever you have left over. Now the ending is a nice break from your usual alien endings and it wrapped up the diabolical script nicely as its clear iron man and the predators love-child is going to save the day.

Too often what they show us is a guy in a suit or decked out in make-up, or a ship akin to a typical flying saucer. No, the aliens and ships in this movie are truly ALIEN, albeit with a large loan from the Matrix movies. But nevertheless they keep you interested.I also love that the movie ending. The seeming unstoppable nature of the aliens keeps you guessing at what humanity's next move will be.No, this wasn't a bad movie, and I'm sure that the sequel will be at least as good. I just hope they invest a little more cash to get more A-list quality actors.

The premise is very interesting, aliens come down to Earth in the middle of the night(only is that part of the world of course) and start sucking everyone into their ships using a very sci-fi appropriate light. Up to here everything works pretty well and the effects really sell the movie.Then all of the sudden, they run out of budget (and good screenwriters) and basically spend the rest of the movie sitting around in the same apartment they started in, occasionally going to the roof (which is always the safest place to go when being chased...) and returning to the same living room. The movie misses the opportunity to actually show that all the humans had been taken. No panning of empty streets or buildings, no cars left around, no feeling that people had been taken in the middle of whatever they were doing all over the world.I agree with some reviewers with the fact that the characters (although very shallow...) end up acting quite realistically. Average people that don't get what is happening and simply don't know what to do. But, if they know that the aliens are out there, looking for them with the \"blue light\", why stay in a very windowed penthouse covering the windows with black sheets instead of going to where there are no windows! The aliens are also a bit dimwitted since they end up sending too many resources just to pick up two measly humans! I mean, aren't the billions they took enough? Do they really need to send a couple more small aliens then big aliens then the huge alien to pick up 2 humans? Besides, I would think that a such an evolved species would have found a way to scan the city and see where the remaining people are, instead of sending little probes that occasionally remind us of the Matrix! Especially considering how well they know human anatomy to the point where they adjusted the own technology to use the human central nervous system... somehow... only so that in the end, the main character's brain (that is lite red for some reason... the aliens must be colorblind considering that a RED brain in the middle of all the BLUE ones didn't raise, a probably colorless, flag!) is capable of taking over an \"alien body\" or whatever you may call it and save the damsel in distress (another clich\u00e9) who is also PREGNANT (cliche) and is therefore worthy of being spared (cliche).This film had promise, but lost it in the script. I don't criticize the aliens \"winning\" in the end or the fact that they spend a lot (ALOT) of time in the same living room. The characters aren't well developed and that makes you dislike them. You don't care if they are caught, in fact, you hope they are, because then you get closer to seeing what the aliens really want!

            "content": "OK, so this movie has a lot of things that are wrong with it, but given its shoe-string budget, that isn't too surprising. The main problem it has is the quality of the acting, the directing of the actors and the dialogue. The actors are B grade at best due to the budget constraints and the money looks like it was almost all spent on the effects, which are quite decent on the whole.The characters are very two-dimensional and the alien invasion probably made most of the viewers of this film think \"Please kill the annoying Guess jeans models and groupies as fast as possible\" more than once! Luckily this wish is almost fulfilled by the end. Some of the characters keep bitching and moaning to each other about their relationships in the face of imminent alien brain rape, which doesn't seem particularly realistic...I thought the design of the aliens and the mechanics of the invasion itself were well done in general, although the CGI did let some of the scenes down.I liked the fact that they went for a doom and gloom ending, instead of the usual clich\u00e9s, but was not really sold on the whole \"oh look we just plugged Mr Big Chin's brain and spinal cord into a brand new alien and somehow, Mr Big Chin was a bit special, so his consciousness was also transplanted into said alien, even when it didn't happen to anyone else when they had their brain ripped out...\" This all seemed far too convenient to me, although I can understand the film makers wanting to add a spark of hope - mankind somehow merging and overcoming the aliens from within. All the same the film suddenly ends and that angle is just left there, either as a way of working in a sequel, or as a last minute surprise ending that seemed tacked on and a bit pointless.I would have far preferred the film to end with mankind totally crushed, like a bug splattered on the windshield of the alien mother-ship. The bleak ending was a good idea and was a logical ending, but it was let down by Mr Big Chin and his magical brain!",

Why is that dude so different to everyone else... are we expected to believe just because he was dragged away from the light in the window at the start it made his brain so powerful he could over come an alien's genetic code.... just to protect his unborn baby... one that wasn't going to be born for at least 6 months... damn... he's got a long time of beating up other aliens if he has to wait till it's born... and then what? I can't imagine they have great day care facilities in that spaceship.so the movie should have just finished with the shot of the aliens looking for more humans and winning. To be honest it's a lot more believable and probably what would happen anyway, i don't know why we've got this belief we could definitely beat any alien invaders. well unless the plants do it for us... or jeff goldblum.oh yeah and FYI nukes don't hurt humans. So.. it's ALL GOOD BABY!",

            "content": "the CGI is amazing and put together very well and this is why i have given it 3 out of 10! however everything else is awful. the start of the movie was plausible as a standard alien invasion on Earth, and thought the idea of being attracted to the light a good idea at first. however the entire movie was based in one apartment, with entire external walls made from glass, surely these people would be the first to go and have very little chance of survival. i am still trying to understand why there is no development in the storyline of why his brain is so 'special' and when it comes to the time of explaining the movie seems to have run out of money and reverts to sketches to finish the movie with him still stuck in an alien body, i believe this would be a much better story to follow. take the start and end of the movie and cut out the middle part this could have been good...",

            "content": "Wow! Where do I begin? I was told before hand that the movie wasn't that great, but after watching it I realized they were absolutely wrong about it not being that great. They should have said the movie was HORRIBLE!! One of the worst pieces of crap I have ever seen! And just when you think the movie is about to end, it gets even worse! I decided to give it a 3 out of 10 because I will say that the special effects were pretty amazing. The plot and characters were absolutely horrid. Oh and if you're the only black guy stuck in a condo with a bunch of white people, chances are you're going to be killed off pretty quick! Whoever wrote this movie should never be allowed to pick up a pen again!",

A lot of reviews have compared this film to Cloverfield, there is no comparison as they are completely different films!! Cloverfield had no real storyline and was more character driven and putting you in the moment, where as this was all about the plot and the idea. So yes, the characters weren't great and things could have been thought through much better, but it was very enjoyable to watch.With so many excellent Sci-Fi films these days it is easy to knock one down that isn't quite as good, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's bad.If you want a mind blowing film with next to perfect acting and a plot with barely any holes, leave this alone, but if you want a good film with an interesting take on alien invasion....watch this!",
