            "content": "Knowing the real-life story behind it, Hachiko: A Dog's Story (2009) has been made in a sort of staged documentary style, similar to the kind of movies often seen on documentary channels (e.g. NatGeo), however without a narrator so common in documentaries, and including well-known actors (Richard Gere, Sarah Roemer and Joan Allen), making it more suitable for theatrical distribution.Before my last year's visit to Tokyo I've been unaware of the true-life story this movie is based upon. In time an occasion came up to meet a friend in Shibuya city, contemporary center of Tokyo's youth culture (shopping, fashion, nightlife...), and that's how I've learned about the popular local meeting point for all Tokyoites, the Hachik\u014d Akita dog statue just outside of Shibuya Train Station, but the real story behind it has been still eluding me ever since. After seeing this movie, and some additional research on the web, all pieces have fallen into place.In retelling the story of common bonding between the dog and its owner, so usual that it comes so natural, film is moving at slow pace, following events of an ordinary life, though not without occasional comedic and dramatic overtones. Even past the dramatic highpoint, when common acts of affection and loyalty evolve towards such an unheard-of faithfulness and ultimate devotion, pace of the storytelling does not change, relying primarily on fine details and emotional build-up. Of course, this might not attract everybody, providing that majority of movie audience today is highly dependent on fast paced, action packed scenes, getting thrills from 3D CG stylized ambiance and suspense, high volume amplitudes and aggressive, often rude highlights of any other nature. However, for those who can do without it, and keep alive their interest even in a simple story, who won't shy away from emotional involvement (as if this can be controlled), they shall easily find themselves consumed by its mere beauty and warmth. Usual man's-best-friend story, spiced with an intriguing yet inspiring detail, shall leave you a bit sad, inevitably pensive, but ultimately delighted. Even more so after the reading of the real-life epilogue.",

            "review_title": "Enough to make a grown man cry!",
            "content": "Hachi is a movie based on the true story about a dog in Japan, Hachiko, who would wait at the train station every day for his owner to arrive even after the owner passed away.I have never seen the original Japanese version of the movie but know the story well as I have been told by many people here in Japan. There is a statue of Hachiko that stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. Now the statue is the most popular place for Tokyoites to meet their friends before going out shopping or dining in Shibuya.Unlike other Japanese remakes, this movie actually gives credit to the original story so that you don't get the sense that Hollywood wants to call it its own. All actors/actresses in the movie do a superb job in making you feel as if you were a part of the community embracing the dog. Compared to the original story, people were more accepting of Hachi rather than considering him a nuisance. Of course this is going to be released in the U.S. as a holiday movie so the goal is to make it uplifting.Just a warning, do take many tissues. I am a grown man and can honestly say that I have never really cried during a movie. I think the score of the movie plus the dog being so adorable made me lose myself. When I looked around the theater though, every single person was crying and I saw a lot of red eyes as I left the Men's restroom. Any movie that can make me do that deserves a 10/10.",

I'm really objective when it comes about movies,and honestly no one till now,have cut me as deep. It's surprising...but true,that everything in this world,is ruled by love,and if you thought that only humans are aware of this,you did wrong.

            "content": "Oh my, hold everything. You want to be prepared to watch this movie with plenty of Kleenex on hand. It really does resonate for viewers who have a special bond with their pets, but I think it probably moves a few hearts of those who don't share hearth and home with a favorite canine. It's a bit ironic actually, to think about the picture's impact on a person, when a dog's reaction to it's missing owner invites more sympathy than one feels for the owner himself, who died of a heart attack.Well, not to get too morbid, this was a sensitively told tale that one finds astonishingly hard to believe when it's revealed that Hachi celebrated his master for ten years after the man's death by showing up daily at a train station at the end of the work day to greet him. Based on an actual event that occurred in Japan in the 1920's, the film has been Westernized for an American audience with Richard Gere in the lead role as a university professor who adopts a wayward Akita puppy found wandering around a train station. But the real star is the pup who matures into the adult Hachi and takes full possession of the viewer's emotions on the way to a heart tugging finish. It's a family friendly film that you're not likely to forget for a long time once you've seen it.",

If the words \"love\" and \"loyalty\" mean anything to you, this is a nice story see unfold.The only major mistake made in this movie is that it should have been done as a 1920s period piece. I say that because throughout the story, the dog runs free around the town/city, which is impossible today with leash laws everywhere.Whatever, the story is still very good, very memorable and very touching in spots near the end. The only spoiler I'll use is a good one: if you fear watching an animal film with a bad/sad ending, you're safe: the dog survives....that's all I'll say on that.Kudos to Richard Gere for a nice performance. This is definitely not he kind of film he usually does but he explains in a bonus feature, \"I read the script, cried, and couldn't say no.\" The story was too good for him to pass up. That's my recommendation to you: go rent the DVD, sit back and enjoy a nice memorable tale of man's best friend.",

One of the things that sets this movie apart from the other movies that involve animals is how they stuck to reality instead of throwing in some a-little-hard-to-believe elements here and there just to make it more entertaining.Sometimes they show things through Hachi's eyes as opposed to human eyes, which helps you relate to him and understand how he felt and what he thought then, as well as emphasizes that Hachi is the main character of the movie.This is not just a kids' movie. In the end everyone including myself was crying because we were so moved. It is a must-see.",

The closest word which comes to my mind in this case is 'stupendous'.Hachiko is a true story about a dog in Japan and the special bond he shared with a professor whom he met when it was a little puppy. The story has been put forward exceptionally well by the cast and the director.The movie has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes, yet remarkably you are kept spellbound after a couple of minutes into the movie. And as the other reviews suggest, making the whole theater grab onto their tissues explains how good it really is.Lastly, coming for someone who also rates 'Eight below' as one of his favorite's, a high rating of Hachiko would seem a little biased to many. But in my honest opinion I don't think that anybody who has watched this movie can rate it below 10.",

I've never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.I read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can't remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn't only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is 'God' in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it's true.It's a must watch movie.",

I highly recommend this to people of all ages.

It's really powerful and touching. I loved how they showed the dog's vision in black & white.The only thing that I didn't like at all was that the characters seems to \"never take flight\". I know Parker (Richard Gere) and the dog Hachiko are the main characters, but I think that the other characters could have been explored a bit more.

I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never \"take flight\" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.",

            "content": "I have watched some touching and moving movies in my lifetime and about 2 movies have made me cry, However i was crying my eyes out when i was watching this Hachiko movie. I was crying for a good 10 -15 minutes even after this movie ended. I have browsed through the comments and reviews on this IMDb board and on other online forums and have noticed that so many other people who watched this movie have also cried. I really think NO OTHER MOVIE has made so many people cry. Whenever i saw Hachiko go to the station and sit there waiting oblivious to the fact his owner died, my heart died a little each time.Knowing that this movie was actually based on a real life story set in the 1920s-1930s in Tokyo whereby an Akita-breed dog waited in front of the Shibuya train station day by day around the same time at the same spot for NINE WHOLE YEARS for his beloved university professor Professor Ueno to come back from work, really breaks my heart.No animal or human would ever sit in front of the station to wait for someone they love for THIS LONG (9 FREAKING YEARS). This dog Hachiko must have had such ENORMOUS love for his owner that he would throw his life away (9 years is like 7 decades in dog years) waiting in front of the station at the RIGHT TIME each day.How clever are dogs? Real-life Hachiko somehow knew how to read the time in order to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years. Waiting for 9 years- wow! I never knew that the extent of an animal's LOVE and DEDICATION and PERSISTENCE could reach those heights.In real life, Hachiko's was given away after his master's death, but he routinely escaped, showing up again and again at his old home. This showed that Hachiko loved his original owners (Ueno and his wife and kids) too much to let go of his master Ueno or his memory of him and wanted to return to his remaining living owners.Eventually, Hachiko's apparently realized that his Professor Ueno no longer lived at the house. So he went to look for his master at the train station where he had accompanied him so many times before. How smart and clever is that of a dog? The other original owners of Hachiko had moved to a different location and Hachiko could not find his other living original owners since he is a dog and so he decided to wait in front of the railway station like he always used to do for his master to turn up and be reunited with him,This real life story of Hachiko clearly demonstrated UNDYING, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE FOR ANOTHER since both the PHYSICAL ABSENCE of his owner Professor Ueno and the PASSING OF TIME would not diminish Hachiko's love and UNFLINCHING LOYALTY for his original master Ueno. This real life story also reminds us about HOW LOVE CAN MAKE ANYONE (INCLUDING ANIMALS AND DOGS) do CRAZY THINGS for someone they love.Somehow I just wished that in real-life, the wife and family of Professor Ueno should have just placed lifeless body of Professor Ueno on the floor for a while for Hachiko to sniff and inspect the body. This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead.I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years.You can read up on the real life story of Hachiko in this Wikipedia page which also lists all the Japanese films made about Hachiko. Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachiko Or you can just Yahoo! Or Google Hachiko's real life story for more information.",

After watching 2000+ films or may be even much more than that, after watching more than 100 tearjerkers, after watching more than 500 emotional sagas this Hachi A Dog's Tale recieved the Longest sobbing of my life. I remember so many films just because they made me cry like kid, i can name many just like that, just now but you know most of those films had that emotional roll down moments somewhere in the last scenes. It is mostly the climax where i had to use tissues but Hachi A Dog's Tale was like raining tears. I cried for approx 25 Minutes continuesly setting a new record for myself and may be for all movie buffs. I mean how emotional film it was despite the fact i tried to hold it acknowledging the fact that yes i am a movie buff and i had to look for Cinematic proportions before breaking down and fortunately there were no cinematic blunders, no mistakes in writing, no loopholes, no non-sense theories and I was all free to cry like a small kid as if i am locked in an empty room and no one's watching me, just cry out loud. And yes i did it. It is inspired from a true story of a college professor who finds an abandoned dog and he takes into his home and how the Dog sets an example to the world about loyalty. Believe me, the dog put us all humans at shame. His loyalty and emotions were far far greater and immortal than humans and this is what makes this film truly Epic. You will see many scenes proving this statement in the film. Lasse Halstrom wherever you are just take my salute and please recieve my thank you, it means a lot to me. The way you crafted this film has left me stunned and heart broken. I promise you here that sooner or later i will have a Pet and i hope it would love me just the way Hachi loved his owner.

For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen.

            "content": "This is my first ever review. I have been a reader of user reviews on IMDb for a few years and this is the first time I felt I had to write something about a film. I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours.",

Oh boy, what a movie and what a story! there are few of us in this life who don't love dogs or had a dog as a pet at some point in our lives. We know the Lassie stories of course.but this is based on a true story and the dog who plays in this movie deserves an Oscar for himself, if ever they give Oscars to canines! Richard Gere, as he was in Amelia, was peripheral but perfect in the companion role for the lost dog he finds at the railway station.You have been warned by others and I am warning you now, call it a spoiler if you like but don't you dare watch this without some back up[ - tissues or hankies at the ready. I am a grown up and I never stopped crying through this movie, its a sad but happy poignant movie at the same time.No blockbusters but it is unmatchable and unmissable entertainment for a movie, top drawer! OK, as with Veronika Decides to Die, they have transferred the story from its original location and having never visited Japan, though living in south east Asia, the film works perfectly. Hachiko is definitely a legend and one day I hope one day I will also visit his statue (I think there is more than one?) thank you for the production for such a delightful film!",

            "review_title": "It's hard to hate a cute doggy film...",
            "content": "\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a remake of a Japanese film, \"Hachi-Ko\" (1987). Oddly, however, this American version keeps SOME of the original Japanese story (such as the breed of dog, the dog's name and SOME of the events in the dog's life) and completely changes so much--especially since \"Hachi-Ko\" is based on a real life Japanese occurrence, not in America. Back in the 1920s and 30s, the real Hachi was a dog owned by a Japanese professor. One thing that set him apart from most dogs was that Hachi would meet the professor at the train station after work each day! But, even more unusual is that after the professor's death, Hachi CONTINUED this routine--waiting patiently for his master every day! In many ways, the story is like that of the very famous Scottish dog, Greyfriars Bobby--who is memorialized in Edinburgh outside the pub and church where the do would do its daily ritual (lying at his master's grave and then visiting the pub). In fact, I did some reading and found several other similar accounts throughout the world. This leads me to wonder WHY the film did a semi-remake. Why not just make a fictionalized story? Why keep a few details and change others--especially when this Japanese dog inexplicably shows up in Rhode Island!So does this lack of attention to detail mean I hate the film? Even as a retired history teacher, I cannot, as I must confess that I've owned dogs for years and currently have two massive hairy beasts who adore me (in addition to my two cats who alternate between adoration and ambivalence). I am a sucker for a film about a cute dog--and the Hachi in the movie is one of the cutest Akita's ever (much cuter, by the way, than the original Hachi). You cannot help but like the dog and enjoy seeing him interact with his owner (Richard Gere). But, there needs to be more than a cute dog to make a really good film--and currently this fame has an astonishingly high score of 8.2! Is this number, at least in part, less about the quality of the production and more a vote to signify that most everyone loves cute dogs? Well, yes. Objectively speaking, the film is a remake--and that's one strike against it at the onset. And, I just cannot imagine a pleasant doggy film making it to the IMDb's Top 250 List--but it did and it's currently #190--giving it a slightly higher rating than films like \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (one of the greatest films of the 1940s), \"Rocky\" (the first one was very nice), \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"The Celebration\"--as well as the original Japanese film!! Overall, it's a nice doggy film that is VERY family-friendly at that and with a lovely and evocative piano soundtrack. By all means watch it-- but don't be surprised if you like it but don't love it.A few final notes: First, I noticed that AFTER the master died in this American adaptation, it ALWAYS seemed to be snowing in this town--for years and years after the death! Second, what's with the professor's wife?! Her husband dies and she finds Hachi at the end years later at the train station and is surprised to see him?! Where was she at the time...off-world or taking a very long nap?! Didn't someone bother to tell her about HER dog or didn't she ask about how old Hachi was doing?! This seems to be a missing plot thread. Third, if you are curious, Hachi's actual remains were stuffed after his death and he is on display at National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo. And, there is a statue to him as well as annual celebrations in this country. How these people view an American film company 'appropriating' their story is something I would love to know.",

            "content": "This movie, set in New England, is a modern version of the true story of a Japanese man and his dog back in the 1920s and 1930s.It begins and ends with an 11-year-old boy in front of his school class telling about his \"hero\", and the movie that unfolds is about his grandfather's loyal dog, Hachi. His name comes from the Japanese characters on his tag, but no other information about where he came from.The small puppy is being transported by train, in a small bamboo cage, which falls off the gurney. No one notices in the crowd, and the puppy gets out. He then is discovered by traveler Richard Gere as Parker Wilson, who is a professor of music. He commutes daily by train.Parker doesn't want the puppy, we soon find out that they apparently recently had one die, and had agreed not to get another. But with no place else to put the puppy overnight, Hachi was brought home.Always good Joan Allen is Parker's wife, Cate Wilson. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is his good friend and fellow professor, Ken. And Jason Alexander is the train station supervisor, Carl.This is a fine story about the relationship between a man and his dog. Richard Gere is superb as he usually is in this sort of role.SPOILERS: Parker and Hachi develop a very close relationship, which turns into Hachi following Parker to the train station every morning as he left, then returning at 5PM in the evening as the train arrived, to greet his master, for several years. But one day Parker has a massive heart attack during one of his classes, dies, and is buried. Hachi is taken by Parker's daughter and son-in-law, but soon Hachi escapes and treks down the tracks to the train station. He makes himself a make-shift place to sleep under a rail car that apparently didn't move much. Every day he went to the train station, for 10 years, to wait for his master. He only quit when he died. The story is about loyalty.",

His star-making turn was in AMERICAN GIGOLO, where the montage in which he makes himself beautiful using name brands began the 1980s.Yet, he takes his craft seriously, flew to Japan to work with Kurosawa, and has excelled in a wide variety of roles. So when I realized that he was working with Lasse Hallstrom in this one, I steeled myself to watch it. I love most of Hallstrom's films, but every once in a while, his weird losers just repel me. He's the Babe Ruth of the movies: the Home Run King, who is struck out more often than anyone else.Well, they don't strike out in this one. I smiled and leaked tears when the film maker thought I should. The three dogs who play Hachi at various ages are handsome creatures With Joan Allen and Jason Alexander.This movie is based on the story of Hachiko, a dog owned by a Japanese professor, who waited for him every day when his train brought him home from the university. Even after the professor had collapsed and died, the dog waited every day until his own death nine years later. Hachiko became a symbol of loyalty and inspired the revival of his breed, the Akita -- there were only thirty of them left. I don't know how many there are now, but more.",

Its a beautiful movie from beginning to end, and Halstrom has made such a sad story, into one of unconditional love, a dog giving up a family home in order to wait for his master.It's based on a true story of 1923, and its a remake, but its classy and the additions of Gere and Allen make this movie all the more worthwhile.In anybody else's hand, it could have easily been a TV movie cropping up on some mundane station that nobody would see, so its lovely to see that this story shall be seen by more.A great film to watch with the whole family, and when you are feeling down.Beautiful.",

            "content": "You choose to watch a movie such as this knowing darn well that it's going to turn out to be a tearjerker. You set yourself and steel yourself against it. There will be no tears, you insist to yourself. It's just a movie - even if it is based on a true story in Japan almost 80 years ago. But it's still just a movie. No tears. But in the end you have to succumb. This is literally an emotional roller coaster, with ups and downs from beginning to end. I've not always been really impressed with director Lasse Hallstrom's work, but he truly managed one of the finest and best told tearjerkers I've ever come across with \"Hachi.\"The movie features a good performance from Richard Gere as Parker, the man who adopts (somewhat unwillingly and definitely against his wife's wishes) an Akita puppy who found him (for the point of the story is definitely that Hachi found him) and we follow the development of a bond of loyalty and even friendship between the two that transcends even death. Gere was good, but it wasn't an incredibly demanding performance, because the dog is the star. He waits anxiously day after day at the train station for Parker to come home from work, and Parker looks forward to the greeting. Then, unexpectedly, Parker dies, but Hachi never gives up, going back day after day to the station for the next ten years, waiting without hope for Parker to come off the train, all leading up, of course, to the ultimate tearjerker moment - both sad and happy - as Hachi finally dies lying outside the station one night, but in death sees Parker come out of the terminal and runs to him as they're joyfully reunited. A man and his dog reunited. If you're not shedding tears by the end of this - seriously, what's wrong with you?This is basically a much more serious version of the \"Marley & Me\" type of storyline. Where that movie focused on the clumsy lovability of the dog, this one focuses on the undying bond of loyalty the dog shares with its master. This is truly one of the most emotionally wrenching movies (both happy and sad) you will ever come across. (9/10)",

But from the moment you see this cute little puppy being boxed up and sent overseas to the United States and found by Richard Gere when he breaks his way out of the box, you are hooked. This is no ordinary little puppy. He ain't \"Marley\", \"Lassie\", \"Hooch\", or \"Beethoven\". He doesn't easily learn how to fetch and he destroys one of Gere's wife's (Joan Allen) art pieces as well. But he doesn't slobber, pee, poop or chase the cat. He's a well behaved gentleman, the most adorable movie dog since the pug in \"The Adventures of Milo and Otis\".Gere, who plays a choreographer for a ballet company (and straight to boot!), has to travel into New York every day for work, and Hachi can't bear to be without his master. So he heads to the train station to bid him goodbye and comes back every evening like clock work. Yes, that is really the plot of this movie. No kidnapping, no nasty neighbor reporting him to the pound or any cruelty whatsoever. Just the story of a beautiful friendship that even destiny can't take away.Some people may say this a total manipulation of the emotions and they may be right. But for a movie to come out in the extremely cynical 21st century and be so sweet and express values that never disappear (especially the importance of loyalty) is a rarity today that can't be dismissed.",

My guess is that there are a lot of dog lovers out there. Not that it is a bad film, but it starts off very much like an ABC Family film, and the production value never really increases.Luckily, the plot tends to improve as it goes along, and it is clearly an emotional film. Those who are more prone to crying during movies may do a bit of crying here, because it is a great encapsulation of how loyal a dog can be to his master. As summed up by Kim Newman, \"Not a dry eye in the house - but not irritating schmaltz either.\"",

            "content": "In a 'talk-about-your-hero' session, a young boy writes down the name Hachiko on the board, it's a dog's name and everyone's laughing. Wait till the story ends and the laughs will give way to long and mourning faces.Ever since Walt Disney's \"Old Yeller\", dogs have been indissociable elements of the \"unofficial quadrifecta for manly tears\", along with sports, fathers and death. Ask any man about the movie that made him cry the most, chances are that it featured at least one or two of these elements, in \"Hatchi: A Dog's Tale\"'s case two, just like another lachrymose classic \"Field of Dreams\".And it figures: dog is man's best friend, a millennia-old friendship and who can forget that quote from \"Lady and the Tramp\": \"In the whole history of the world there is but one thing that money can not buy... to wit the wag of a dog's tail\". Dogs' undivided feeling toward their master and their undying loyalty make great material for tearjerking stories, whether real or fictional. \"Hatchi\" is adapted by Stephen P. Lindsey from a 1987 Japanese film directed by Seijiro Koyama, itself deriving from the real tale of an Akita dog who kept 'waiting' for his master, 9 years after his death. Basically, the real-life \"Jurassic Bark\".The novelty is interesting indeed: while it's the natural progression within the great scheme of life that the canine companion dies first, like losing a parent, \"Hatchi\" goes the other way round as we're invited to look into the grieving process from the perspective of a dog, only to realize that dogs don't know such thing as 'five stages of grief'. The story in itself, beyond the treatment is heartbreaking, but Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's execution does justice to it, and if you think a live-action film can't make the sadness of a dog as poignant as in animation, you've got another thing coming.Indeed, \"Hatchi\" isn't a movie you easily recover from. When my little brother, ten years ago, told me that he had just seen \"one of the saddest films ever\", a quick glimpse on the poster and the synopsis on IMDb made me figure out the kind of emotional trajectories it would take, and I didn't want to be \"Jurassic Barked\" again. In fact, I was wrong, the reactions to the climax of the Futurama episode covered a wide range of emotions: from sadness to anger. \"Hatchi\"'s sadness had a curiously soothing side-effect. Indeed, it's one of these instances where you find brights spots in the darkest lows, sure the man died, but happiness was brought to him in the form of a little puppy coming out of nowhere.The man, an Arts professor, named Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) was the only human being to kneel over him, ignoring that at that very moment, Hatchi had already chosen him. Somehow the feeling looks mutual because the way Parker negotiates Hatchi's staying in the house with his reluctant wife Cate (Joan Allen) feels more like stalling. And just when her patience is at end, she sees her husband, a respectable man in his fifties so enthusiastic while teaching his dog how to catch a tennis ball that he grabs it himself by the mouth. She knows she's lost the game.And so the whole first act is about a bond that deepens with the passing of seasons, and gets enriched with new rituals that find precious witnesses in the regular presences of the train station, from the master played by Jason Alexander to the bookstore owner (Davennia McFaydden) and the Indian hotdog cart vendor (Erick Avari), obviously even some passengers recognize the dog after a while. We also get the inevitable facts of family life: meeting the boyfriend, marriage, pregnancy and the approach is simple, but effective, Hallstr\u00f6m only indulges to some POV shot in black-and-white representing the dog's perspective and thankfully doesn't overdo the 'mystical' value of the name Hatchi (the eight symbolizes good fortune in Japanese tradition). In fact, the insights about the Akita breed provided by Parker's Japanese friend (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) feel like obligatory nods to the original story.Now, I read some critics on Rotten Tomatoes and some complained about the lack of drama. I was wondering what these persons expected for the sake of drama: a divorce? Cancer? That the dog would be attacked by a rabid wolf... no, wait that's \"Old Yeller\"... drama means 'action' in Greek, and there are films where the drama triggers the emotions and others where even action shouldn't come in the way of emotions. Eventually, Parker dies, and as expected the dog goes back to the train station everyday, Parker's daughter (Sarah Roemer) can't fight against the animal's instinct and lets him go. Ten years later, Cate comes to the train and is shocked to see an old Hatchi still there, \"waiting\".At that point, introducing the emotional climax, she truly measures the degree of loyalty of a dog as we wonder whether we should cry for her realization or for Hatchi having turned so old. As tempting as it may be to accuse the film of extreme sentimentalism (which it's not devoid of) I guess I'd rather remember that that sad dog's face wasn't CGI, and that the story was real. The final picture of the statue erected in homage to the real Hachiko is a tribute to how powerful the dog's tale is and maybe overthinking is weakening it.Take this piano score by Jan A. P. Kacsmazrek, I was almost tempted to think it was too safe a choice but then again, a little music doesn't hurt when the central character is a dog who can only express emotion, through his eyes. And God, what eyes! Through his very presence, Hatchi made me feel his master's absence ... and the biggest mystery of all isn't his origin but if he understands the meaning of death?Whether he knew or not, the dog deserves to be the grandson's hero.",

            "content": "There are some films that deserve a five star review for reasons other that artistic success on every level; HACHI; A DOG'S TALE is one of those, for despite some minor technical problems with the film (the sound editing seems absent as the music - a fine score by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek - too frequently covers the conversation, the slipping in color between black and white and color seems accidental rather than intentional, etc), this little film is a heart warmer, a film that makes us glow with a story about the love between dog and man that transcends so many naturally occurring barriers. Originally released as HACHIKO MONOGATARI in Japan where the true story took place in the 1920s, the screenplay and story were written by both Kaneto Shind\u00f4 and Stephen P. Lindsey and the well-chosen director is the sensitive Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m. The story really belongs to Hachi, a Japanese Akita who is befriended by a professor (Richard Gere) when left stranded at a train station (the film is transferred to an eastern American locale). The stationmaster (Jason Alexander) encourages the professor to take the dog home, much to the surprised annoyance of the professor's wife (Joan Allen). But the professor and Hachi bond, encouraged by the couple's daughter (Sarah Roemer), and Hachi follows the professor to the train each morning and waits for his return each night. Though a tragedy occurs, the strength of this dog/man bond is so strong that nothing can break it- not even prolonged separation. Hachi becomes part of the train station family and grows in respect when the ultimate test of his endurance occurs. And that is quite simply the story. There are some very beautiful little cameos by Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Erik Avari, Davenia McFadden, and Robbie Sublet, but the true feeling of this film is that of an ensemble effort lead so very competently by Richard Gere's portrayal. It is a little film to treasure. Grady Harp",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Hachiko: A Dog's Story",
            "content": "I came to know of the Hachiko story from one of the film screenings during the Japanese Film Festival more than two years ago, and having visited Tokyo, who would not have heard and noticed that one of the exits of the busy Shibuya station had one exit named after the famous dog? Why an American version of the story would be made baffles me, if not only to tell of yet another dog story following the likes of the Lassies and the Marleys that because dog is Man's best friend there will always be a ready market for it?Directed by Swede Lasse Hallstrom, at least there's the sensibility to still ensure that Hachiko remains Japanese, only for it to be accidentally transported from a Japanese monastery, and thanks to a botch up in cargo handling, Hachiko the puppy's destination ended up to be an American town with the Bedridge train station, where his first night wandering around the station's platform brought him to encounter Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere. Taking pity on the puppy whom he thought was abandoned, Parker brought it home to the opposition of his wife (Joan Allen), but who can deny a homeless dog especially one that looks as cute as a button?The gist of the story you would already know from the trailer which decided to tell all. The film curiously didn't spend too much time with Hachiko as a puppy, and decided to fast forward to when it became an adult dog, starting to walk with Parker to the station, and at 5pm every work day, promptly made its way back to the station to wait for its master, and then walking back. The Japanese version did this very well with people interaction along the way, which this version decided to erroneously gloss over. It's not about just the Professor and his dog, but the community around in which the dog's loyalty, faithfulness and street- smartness touched. Sure there was some attempts at that in this version, but there was too little and probably wanted to approach the story in a different direction.Unfortunately it got a little carried away, and after the pivotal turning point, it somehow went downhill with the narrative being dragged out because here's exactly when the relationship between community and the dog would have taken over to move this to another emotional plane, and didn't because the foundations were not established, granted though there were enough moments and scenes to tug at your heartstrings.One cannot deny that the Akita breeds are cute, and many would have missed the disclaimer toward the end of the credits that the dogs are for experienced dog owners, so don't you be heading toward the pet store to get one puppy on a whim, as the worst thing that shouldn't happen, is an abandonment because fancy has worn off, and would have been very contradictory to the message preached in the film.Between the American update and the original Japanese film, no prizes for guessing that I much prefer the latter for the simple reason that it had more genuine emotions with a better focus on Hachiko, and the locale which the American \"Hallmark\" version just tries so hard to replicate. Good news is the Japanese film made in 1987 is now re-released locally on DVD and is available in the shops now, and hopefully, the homage paid to the original story and the dog at the end of the film would pique interest in more picking up that version to watch.",

            "review_title": "Surprisingly better than the original",
            "content": "Having now seen and reviewed) the original 1987 Hachiko Monogatari I have come back to this remake with fresh eyes and an upwardly revised opinion. While I still believe this movie in no way reaches the true potential of the \"story\" I think it at least matches and may even exceed the quality of the original.Perhaps of greatest surprise to me are the choices the director made in what he took from and what he rejected from the original story. He has moved the story from 1920's Tokyo to 2000's small town America, and this is not an unreasonable choice. However once the link with the original Japanese story has been so fundamentally severed the world is your oyster as far as story details go so having made that choice it does seem a little perverse to make the dog not just Japanese but an Akita, as in the original. The essence of Hachiko is essentially a love story between a dog and his master, and it matters not one whit if they are in Japan or America, if the master is a Professor of agricultural engineering or of music, or a street cleaner for that matter. It does not matter if the dog is an Akita, a Pekinese or a Great Dane. What is pivotal is the portrayal of a credible relationship between the dog and his master, and to achieve this the casting of both man and dog is absolutely paramount. The Akita is a magnificent animal but if these two movies are any indication it has a stoic personality that presents a challenge to a filmmaker who has only 90 minutes to bring the character to emotional life. Presumably the Japanese market for whom the original was intended knows this personality and compensated for it. In this American version the director cunningly introduces a Japanese character who is able to inform the viewer of the Akita's character, which somewhat mitigates and explains the dog's relatively passive behaviour, but nevertheless it still would have been nice to see a greater level of visible connection between the dog and his master.As I indicated in my other review the conundrum of this story is how to present it without inferring at least some hint of abandonment on the part of the master's family. I think this version does a better job of this than the original, and certainly the character of the Master's daughter and her partner are far more sympathetic than the original, although there is still some lingering unease as to how a dog can remain essentially a stray within the community for a decade or so. In both movies the subplot of neither wife not really wanting the dog is totally unnecessary and simply wastes precious time that should have been devoted to developing the personalities and relationships of the dog his master.Richard Gere is not called upon to do much before he pops off but never the less does a great job. He presents a far more consistently sympathetic character than his counterpart in the original, although to be fair his Japanese counterpart is saddled with having to exist in the less relaxed context and culture of 1920's Japan. It has to be said the director's conception of a music professor as someone who plays music with all the sophistication of three blind mice for beginner piano, and who supervises very strange dances is more than a little naive. We also have to suspend credibility in the first 10 minutes in which Hachiko makes his way from Japan to a small American town \u2013 like people always send puppies randomly half way across the world in a rickety kennel with no documentation, no quarantine, no nothing, right? And they are routinely dumped on top of carts of luggage and accidentally dropped by people who seem to be deaf and blind...why did they even bother with this part of the story? This a waste of time that could have been better used to develop the man/dog relationship. In summary a solid if not magnificent re-telling of the Hachiko story and probably as good as can be achieved while sticking to the Japanese framework.",

I am lucky enough that in my job I get to take people who I work with to the cinema. After planning on seeing a gangster flick, we ended up going into the wrong screen and ended up watching Hachi: A dogs story. We did not move to the right screen as by my watch the film had started 10 minutes before. The point is, from the start of the film when the 'U' classification came up (Suitable for 4 years +) I was a bit disappointed. Now as an actor I like Richard Gere but for the first few minutes I found his character a bit 'wooden'. At first I put this down to him having a bad film, but the more I think about it I think it was somehow done to emphasise his relationship with Hachi. Anyway, half an hour into the film disillusionment had gone and I was really enjoying the film. What was excellent for me, was that because I had never heard of the film, I had no idea what was to come. The film does an excellent job of surrounding itself around Hachi the dog. The only fancy gimmick is the occasional sight through Hachi's eyes which is done in black and white but this is only occasional. There are no doggy voices or doggy thoughts, but you still get involved with Hachi's emotions and how he is feeling. Towards the end of the film I was that into Hachi's character that I found myself bursting into tears, something that had not happened to me since I was 8years old watching ET.

            "content": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale may be 'syrupy' to some, that word that is a euphemism for 'sappy', 'sentimental', 'feel-good'. It's all that, but I think that what sets apart this film from what this could have been (maybe Marley & Me comes to mind) is that it sticks to being as simple as possible - it's a no-frills kind of light-hearted drama, if that makes sense. As soon as Richard Gere sees this dog at the station - basically as cute a puppy as one will see in a movie that's meant to be taken seriously - that's how the movie will go. It doesn't pump up much artificial drama at all, and the only real conflict is a major one that comes about halfway or maybe 2/3rd a way into the movie, and it's one that is meant to bring on the water-works for the rest of the audience in the remaining run-time.Who is Hachi (or Hachiko as his full name was in the original film and in real life, which this is based on an actual story in Japan)? A dog that is what is sort of written in the unofficial guide-book for good dogs: faithful, loyal and true. It also helps that Hachi is a happy dog, for the most part (maybe a few times he barks, but never really much at all except to be like 'hey!' to a human). It also plays on the universal truth for dogs that when their master goes away it's like the human is going away forever, and when he or she comes back it's like its the first time all over again that they're connecting. Dogs are great in that way, that their love and compassion is basically undying; in other words, the point of the movie is to show a kind of lesson for human beings as well - be more like Hachi, if you can.I think it also helps that Richard Gere and Joan Allen and (yes) Jason Alexander are very good in their parts, and keep things at the (in a good, clear way) simple level that director Lasse Hallstrom is keeping it at. While the score is the one part that could arguably be the sentimental part of the picture, with its soft and fluffy and sad piano and strings, it's perhaps necessary at times too for the story to work. If this were too quiet it might not have the proper resonance; it's one of those times with a heart-felt drama that I'm glad there's a score like this, even if it goes too far in certain moments. What works though is that the actors above, and even actors in smaller roles (the hot-dog vendor, the bookstore worker) have presence and have a good rapore with the dog.Is it a kid's movie? Sure. But it doesn't come with the Hollywood BS that so many movies get; the most wacky 'comedy' part is that Gere and his lovable dog get skunked at one point. Because it keeps it so... basic (is there another word for simple I can use), it can resonate with people since its not trying to pull a fast one or pull SO hard on the manipulation that its Hallmark channel. It's not quite great since there isn't necessary too much in the way of human character past Gere and Allen (there's also their kid and her family, but that's kind of weak), but it is all about the dog, as the title says. And hey, it's not Old Yeller.",

I walked into the video store this evening and grabbed it at random because of the dog on the cover and Richard Gere. I just had a feeling.What can I say, no other film has touched me as much as this and I don't think one ever will. Its off the scale. Its starts off slow but it quickly turns into such an endearing film, it makes you think about things you take for granted and a dog does this better than any actor.I'm a grown man, never cry, this film had me fighting back tears because I didn't want people to see me, I went to the bathroom and balled my eyes out after it. I even joined this site to encourage more people to watch it.If you have to see one film in your life time, see this.It breaks all barriers. I was going to make a backup of it, but I want to reward the amazing people who made this film by buying it.I don't think I can ever sit through this film again, but I want it on my shelf as a wonderful reminder.Honestly, this is a film that I will never forget and one I will encourage people to watch at any given opportunity.This film will make any human being cry.",

If you do decide to watch this film for whatever reason, try and notice the dialogue and his reaction to falling and how badly acted it is and how immensely unnatural it seems.

            "content": "I'm not a fan of dogs... in fact, I'm one of those people who never had dogs, and that's why I didn't develop a great admiration for these animals, despite recognizing that they are excellent companions and can make a difference for many people, in different situations (for example, as part of police units or as guides for the blind). But the truth is that I feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. Yes, the education of dog owners in Portugal is non-existent in most cases. The fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. The fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner.However, even the human being with less affinity for dogs will recognize the value and the moving beauty of this film, loosely based on a true story that took place in Japan, before the Second World War, and which has already given rise to at least one Japanese film, in 1987. What this film does is to take this Japanese story and transport it to the United States, telling it as if it had taken place on US soil, but keeping a lot of elements, implicit and discreet, that link us to Japanese culture (the dog breed, the dog's name, even the martial arts). I have nothing against remakes and I have to admit that Hachiko's true story deserved a movie... but the truth is that there are a number of similar reports around the world attesting to the loyalty and unparalleled attachment of various animals to their owners. So, if the idea was just to take Hachiko to the US, maybe it would have been better if the script had created a new and entirely fictional story, albeit inspired by the real Hachiko (and other dogs).Having made all these considerations, I believe that we owe a tribute to Richard Geere for another exceptionally well done and very palatable work, in which the actor manages to monopolize our attention in a friendly character, that touches our emotional side. However, and if we exclude the three dogs that participated in this film and played the role of the protagonist, there is virtually nothing more to say about the cast! The remaining actors only say what they are told to say, without adding anything truly positive, nor receiving interesting and developed material for their respective characters. This includes Joan Allen, who appears to have dropped in this movie by parachute.On a technical level, there are several positive aspects to be highlighted, such as the pleasant cinematography, the good choice of filming locations and the intelligent use of the sets and some visual and sound effects. It's not a flashy movie, but it does everything it can to touch our hearts and can even feel corny and sentimental, especially towards the end. I handled it very well, but of course not all people will like it. The choice of animals for this movie was really good, and they are just cute and adorable in the extreme. And we can't forget about that incredible soundtrack, based on sweet piano melodies. It all helps this movie to be exceptionally sweet and suitable for family evenings. However, I leave a note for parents: if you don't want your children to ask you, in an insistent way, to adopt a puppy, don't let them see this movie.",

But when the man unexpectedly dies, Hachiko continues his daily routine of waiting for his master at the train station for the next nine years, becoming a fixture in the community. The story is based on real life events and the film is a remake of the 1987 Japanese film Hachik\u014d Monogata. Hachiko is a simple story of animal attachment and loyalty. But as simple as it is, it's also a very powerful story. The film doesn't waste much time showing Hachiko as a puppy, instead it fast-forwards to a grown up Hachiko, showing the relationship between the dog and its owner Parker (played by Richard Gere), and how they spent their time together and the bond that they had. There's even a weird camera angle suppose to emulate dog's vision to shows us the animal perception. This only makes the film sweeter. And then, the \"twist\" happens. Parker dies and Hachiko, unable to move on, keeps following his daily routine waiting for Parker after work, every single day. This goes on for years and goes to show you what an amazing animal dogs are, and how loyal they can be. The third act is the most powerful act of the film but at the same time, it's where the film looses sense and direction because there's not much more story to be told. It's a sad and tragic on-going event(the dog waiting for its owner) that lasts for years. As I said, Hachiko is not a great film but the story is beautiful. However, it's so tragic and heart-wrenching that it almost hurts to watch. Hachiko is not a feel-good movie. In fact, viewers will probably feel quite lousy after watching it but I guess the film is a good homage to this dog and a good reminder of how marvelous animals are.7.5/10",

I do not want them to be waiting forever for my return that will never happen.I was crying throughout the last part of the movie, not that Parker Wilson (Richard Gere) had died, but that the poor dog did not know that and was now forever waiting for him to return. I had heard of a similar situation when a guy that had a dog with him in a hospital and had to have surgery, died in surgery and he too, waited for the rest of his life for his friend to return. I even make sure that any of my \"babies\" that are still alive see any of my \"babies\" that die, so that they are not waiting for them to return.I had seen a few reviews that had stated that you needed tissues, but I did not realize why.

            "content": "Sometimes it doesn't take much to make a good movie. Everyday characters in situations that excel in the ordinary, with a light dose of the extraordinary, are sometimes enough to charm and move an audience. This is the case of \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\", which, if not going to revolutionize the way we see the seventh art, causes more impact with the public than many blockbusters out there. Breaking a certain paradigm that remakes don't make good movies, this feature film is a remake of a Japanese film from 1987 entitled \"Hachiko Monogatari\" and which was based on a true story, which took place in Japan in the 1920s. Western version takes place in the United States during the 1990s.Hachiko is the name of an Akita dog that became famous across the country after it appeared in newspaper reports that told its story of loyalty to its owner, a professor at the University of Tokyo. Every day Hachiko accompanied his friend to the train station and was there when he returned home. The story of this dog became a legend in Japan and was used in schools and homes to teach children the importance of loyalty among friends. It also served to awaken in the country a wave of Akita creations, a pure Japanese breed that was becoming less and less popular. There is now a statue of Hachiko at Shibuya Station, where he used to wait for his owner to return.In the American version of the story, the dog is also of the Akita breed and came directly from Japan. Due to failures during transport, the little pup ended up at the Bedridge train station in Boston. There he ends up found by music teacher Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), who immediately welcomes him. As no one claims ownership of the dog, Parker adopts him, despite initial resistance from his wife, Cate (Joan Allen). As time goes by and Hachi grows up, he begins to accompany Parker, of his own free will, towards the train station, returning home after his companion's departure and being at the station door again when his return train arrives. Parker's family now has the dog as a member of the family, who sees his owner's daughter get married and make her own home. However, a tragic incident will change the course of Hachi's existence, which will show everyone the value of friendship and true loyalty.Always by Your Side is a remake that takes this story so important to Japanese culture to the West. But more than symbolizing typical elements of that culture, the story addresses values that are universal to any culture, such as fidelity. Even if through an animal. Inevitable to say that \"Always by Your Side\" is a drama. But it is a worthy drama, which, although it has in its story all the elements capable of causing emotion in the viewer, it does not do so in an appealing way. Hallstr\u00f6m's elegant direction helps the film achieve this result, but the highlight is the excellent training conducted on the dogs that act as Hachiko. It's impossible not to be moved by the animal's such fidelity and, in this case, training is essential. It is possible to understand the strong connection between him and his owner and, therefore, the story works.In its first half, the tape entertains by the interaction between Hachi and Parker, never appealing to cheap humor or more extravagant situations, always keeping everything very simple and commonplace, precisely to hook the viewer. The focus of the second part of the production becomes emotion, with Hachi stealing the scene from his human screen companions. Incidentally, if it weren't for the skill of the dogs that live the canine protagonist of the film, this would not be so successful.Richard Gere delivers as Parker, using his natural charisma and classic good-guy charm to make his connection with the audience. Joan Allen is another highlight of the cast, having great chemistry with Gere and even Hachi, getting along very well with the animal in two absolutely touching scenes. Other well-known names in the cast are Jason Alexander, the eternal George of the TV series \"Seinfeld\" as the ticket clerk at the train station where Parker and Hachi meet, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, playing Parker's Japanese friend, Ken, who bridges the gap between the two versions by explaining some of the Japanese mentality and beliefs is also a university professor Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). He explains to his friend that maybe he wasn't the one who found Hachiko, but that the dog chose him as its owner. He is also the one who explains that \"hachi\" is the Japanese numeral for eight, a special number, which symbolizes the link between the earthly and spiritual planes.The great asset of the film is the ease with which the public can identify with the characters shown there. The screenplay for this adaptation was written by Stephen P. Lindsey and focuses on everyday life, on the common, on life itself and on the coexistence between Parker and Hachi, as well as with the professor's family and friends, which gain greater prominence from the second half onwards. Of the movie. The screenwriter begins his narrative in the voice of Ronnie (Kevin DeCoste), grandson of the music teacher, who at school gives a presentation to his colleagues, talking about his personal hero and his inseparable Hachi. That's it, we're emotionally hooked! Another merit of the screenwriter lies in his maneuver to achieve credibility, incorporating oriental elements into the plot. He added the character of Professor Ken, responsible for explaining to the viewer the cultural elements that tie the story together.With that in mind, Swedish director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m - his first international film, made in 1985 was \"My Life as a Dog\" and in 2017, he repeated the theme with \"Four Lives of a Dog!\" - Bets on a more classic narrative and a familiar look. The director conducts the drama with sensitivity, in a delicate and precise rhythm, highlighting the emotional moments through an efficient and beautiful soundtrack and incorporating typically western elements that were certainly not in the Japanese version of the film, Hachiko Monogatari, success of 1987. The case of the game of catching the ball, which Ken explains is something completely meaningless to Hachi. \"Japanese dogs don't catch the ball just to please their owner or get a cookie,\" explains Ken in a foreshadowing to one of the film's most emotional scenes. Another point to be highlighted here is the soundtrack, composed by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek, who bets more on piano sounds, an instrument played by Parker, something that ends up helping the viewer to enter the world of the character and Hachi, being an emotional component of incredible value in the aforementioned second part of the film.Unfortunately, there are some clich\u00e9s throughout the film, but nothing that the audience has to worry about or something bad for the cadence of the script. A nice point of the narrative is to bring the perspective of the dog's loneliness in the face of loss, causing a similar effect on the viewer and on the team's opinion, the high point of the feature. The dog's silence represents more emotions in us than some communications in films when the animal barks or simply \"impersonates\" itself through speech.There is currently a statue of Hachiko (the dog) in Japan, in his honor, in the same spot he stood guard over for nearly a decade. And this unusual episode, which competently illustrates the strength of a friendship and the power of fidelity that can only be established between man and animal, without demands, judgments or disappointments, leaving room only for surrender, affection and pure love, must have been decisive in the involvement of the star Gere, a notorious admirer of oriental culture. \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" shows that investing in everyday stories is not something that can be forgotten by cinema. In times of big productions that portray other planets or past and future times, it's great to be surprised by a simple tale of friendship and loyalty.",

Nothing special...oh how wrong was I.As many others have already stated, \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and devotion. A man who finds a small adorable puppy by accident enters a heartwarming friendship with the animal, who shows the loyalty a dog can have for its owner. Hachi (or Hachiko) is such a devoted and loving dog, following Gere's character to the train station every day and returning one the train whistled for the return of his master. It's truly one of the reasons why I love dogs so much. As time and tragedy occurs, nothing stands in Hachi's way to meet his owner at the train station every day until the end.The film's cast was superb (especially Gere, who also served as a producer) and beautifully shots. A great touch was seeing the world from the dog's POV in an almost sepia filmed shots (as dogs are colorblind). It is such a heartwarming yet heartbreaking story all at the same time! I've seen stories of owners who've passed on and their dogs staying faithfully by their sides (the US soldier whose dog didn't leave his side or the dog who stayed by his Japanese owner's grave). This is just but another example in a film format of the love that animals can bring in a person's life and vice versa.It reminds me of my dog Jett, a jet-black dachshund/rat terrier mix I picked out in elementary school. He was so tiny and I remember petting him thinking \"he's the dog for us.\" Years later, I can remember having to take him outside, clean up after him every time he got into the trash or chewed my mom's shoes up, and playing with him at odd hours of the day. But it was my mom whom he bonded with the strongest, following her everywhere she went and waiting for her to play with him or take him outside. He was her constant companion while I was away at college and my sister worked all day and later moved out. Ten years or so later, it was the hardest time when the decision came to put him down to end his pain from an attack. Away from home and as my sister was at work, it was my mom who stood by his side as he passed. I imagine just like Hachi, Jett has images of happier times and of my mother's face as he passed on. I can only hope that when it is my turn, he will be there waiting for me.",

            "content": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale was a film for every pet and animal lover full compassion , heart warming true story which was unbelievable but yet so close to my heart. Hachi ( means the lucky number 8 in Japanese language) was an abandoned dog who ultimately is adopted by Professor Parker Wilson in Bedridge Town Railway Station. Parker , following his wife's constant complaining to keep the dog, tries to give it to someone else but destiny plays different role and no matter how much he tries to shove Hachi away , it keeps on coming back to him with nobody willing to take the lost puppy. Eventually , a deep bond builds in between the two and Parker finally decides to take him home. Hachi becomes so close to his master that everyday he waits for him to return home at 5 PM in the nearby railway station and this becomes his regular habit. Now , a dog's story has always moved me right from Marley& Me to Red Dog and this film goes a one step ahead with such a delightful and touching story of a canine who becomes a legend in the small town after he waits for his master at the gateway of Bedridge railway station for nine years following his master's death. Lasse Hallstorm ( Chocolate , Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) has chosen a very heart-felt story which will make you laugh , cry , love and feel for dogs who I believe are the most faithful animals in the world. The direction is simply superb and script is tight that will keep you on your toes right from the beginning till the end. The cinematography is eye-catching , the art direction is wonderful with an awesome background score. The performances are stupendous. Richard Gere excels in the role of Professor who feel compassionate for the animal. The dog essaying the role of Hachi was gorgeous and full of expressions. Other starcast did a fine job as well.So , overall , a superb story to be told , to be heard , to be seen. \" Dogs are the most beautiful animal on earth who needs only one thing from you - Love. IF you give them love , they will be your best and loyal friend\"",

            "content": "\"Hachiko\" is based on the real story that actually happened in 1925 at Shibuya, Tokyo. There's a dog named Hachiko, devotedly waiting the return of his master every day at the train station. Unfortunately, one day his master died and never showed up again. But afterward Hachiko kept waiting on the same spot every single day. The story is widely spread and very well-known in Japan. The Director of thiz movie is Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m. Hallstr\u00f6m made many modest and effective dramas. His famous works are \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\" (1993), \"The Cider House Rules\" (1999) and \"Chocolat\" (2000). The movie tries to capture how the event occurs, while the setting and characters are adjusted to United States background. Richard Gere played as Prof. Wilson. Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer played as his wife and daughter. Gere performs his character properly. He looks so compassionate and lovable. The storyline is also filled with simplicity. The plots try to build the sympathy from the beginning and mount up in the end of the movie. The movie simply tells you the story about what happens after his master death. I think thiz movie will easily affect on you, especially if you are a dog lover or a person who ever raise a dog. Thiz is totally just a powerful story behind the real event. The movie is luckily enough to have some good materials to make you cry.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

            "content": "I still can't stop thinking about it, so that says something. However, I'm really troubled by the behavior of the characters in this movie. Ultimately, the storyline doesn't work in the 21st century.I was troubled that Parker let his dog roam the streets and follow him without even a collar on. And the wife, whose name I can't even remember, doesn't seem to ever attach to the dog for no valid reason as the dog is adorable and loving. The fact that the poor animal is forced to sleep in the tool shed when these people have a huge house with a wonderful sun porch for just the two of them is more than annoying. In fact, the dog is NEVER shown in the house as a grown animal. Makes me think his loyalty is misplaced and nowhere near deserved by these people. Even after her husband dies, she never even says goodbye as her daughter loads the dog up. There is no explanation given as to why she doesn't keep the dog as any creature loved so much by a beloved husband should be cherished and taken care of. The daughter makes a half-hearted attempt to keep the dog, but gives up quickly and never goes to see how the dog is doing. Oh, and how do they explain to the son that they just left grandpa's dog to fend for himself? Makes no sense.The one with the most concern is the Japanese professor who at least attempts to give money to the local vendors for the dog's care. They refuse as they're willing to take care of him, but there's no true care going on. Couldn't the station master give him a broom-closet to sleep in? A dish with some real dog food in it? A blanket or two? And the hot dog vendor only offers some stray scraps of leftover hot dogs. That's not nutrition. And in the true story, apparently the station master did allow the dog to live in the station and made a home for him (which would have worked MUCH better here) rather than allowing him to live under an old train in all kinds of weather. The ending does work well in its uplifting vision of dog meeting master upon his death.The filming is well done, and the black and white images of life through a dog's eyes are creative and just enough to make the point. The setting couldn't be more beautiful and adds to the haunting tone of the story.The screenplay is ultimately really flat to match the characters. The daughter makes an impassioned plea for the dog to stay, telling him how much they love him and want him, and in the next breath says goodbye and opens the gate. Okay, so the premise is the dog needs to do what the dog needs to do, but that's like saying a ten-year-old should be allowed to do what he or she feels like doing. It doesn't make sense. No one goes out of his or her way to help the dog in any meaningful way, not even in a superficial way. And when the wife shows up at the train station ten years later to visit her husband's grave, her interaction with the dog is trite.Maybe the film would have worked if set in the original time period (1920s) if not the original country. And after writing this I know why I can't stop thinking about it. I'm haunted by the loyalty of an animal who is ultimately so neglected and ignored.This film is a sad commentary on human behavior and the emotional, physical waste of this beautiful animal is, even to anyone who isn't a major animal lover, a horrible tragedy. There is no redemption in this film. Just sadness.",

Instead of the dog dying on the owner, the owner dies on the dog. This is actually based on a true story except it happened in the 1940s instead of in the present day. Richard Gere, well, it's Richard Gere, what more can be said? Richard Gere doesn't need to do too much to light up the screen. But the real star is (are) the dog(s) that portray(s) Hichiko. You don't expect so much emotion and facial expression to come from a canine and that is why the last twenty minutes or so of this movie is so gut wrenching. We feel for the dog as if it is human, perhaps feel even stronger for it because it is not human and doesn't know that its master isn't going to someday reappear. This is a very fun, lighthearted movie that at the last moment turns into a true tear jerker. It becomes so sad that it is quite disturbing. Keep that in mind if you are planning to show it to the kids.",

There is an overlooked scene in which the Richard Gere's character is chided by his Japanese colleague for not fully appreciating Hachi's noble pedigree when he (Gere) can't understand why Hachi refuses to fetch a ball for his master's amusement. It's because Hachi is not a pet. He's a companion.

Over time, you see the special attachment shared between Hachi and Parker and find warmth knowing he has finally found a good home. It's incredible how warm a dog can make a home that was once desolate. If you have ever had the fortune of owning a pet, you understand the strong attachment you have with one. You protect them, provide for them, and love them despite being unable to converse. You can see a dog's emotions just from its body language, and the dog comforts you when he/she realizes you're distressed. It's an amazing feeling to have such a unique bond to an animal that is so pure (like all creations), and views you as immaculate despite your imperfections. Unfortunately, you have probably had to endure difficult times of struggling health, senescence and inevitable death. It's this period of such great love followed by emptiness that is so hard to bear. Like any relationship, it is when there is a strain that you discover the true colours of those involved and discover everyone's true emotions. I once heard a story of a young boy saying that humans need more time in this world because they need to learn how to love and then reciprocate. Dogs on the other hand are born into the world already knowing how to love and that is why they don't need to live as long. Although I agree with the little child, I would also add that the pain that a pet would endure if its owner passed away would be unbearable. I wished there was a way to offer Hachi solace and tell him everything would be okay. I wish for a lot of things. Hachi was a loving dog who was saved by Parker.

Hachiko, the dog is an amazing one and the story is fascinating too.It was hard to believe that such a dog existed, till I got to read the real story.

Death is a certainty that no mortal being can escape but the way we die makes what we are. This is the take away from the film.

            "content": "This one really will make you cry, even those who think they can't. Hachi, full name Hachiko, is an Akito dog from Japan. In this film he is sent to America, where his story unfolds. But there was a real Hachi, who lived in Japan, and this story is true, although it really all took place in Japan. So famous is the real dog Hachi that a life-size bronze statue of him was erected in his home town in his memory! By transferring the story of Hachi to America, it meant that Richard Gere could be 'Hachi's mother', the university professor who finds Hachi lost on a railway platform and with whom the little puppy bonds for life, with fanatical devotion. I was going to say with superhuman devotion, but I guess supercanine devotion is a better way to put it. I noticed that this film was distributed by a subsidiary of Sony, so perhaps that is how a Japanese tale ended up being transposed to Rhode Island, where Gere is presumably meant to be teaching at Brown University. (His educational and professional life is only roughly sketched.) The one false note in this film is Joan Allen, who plays Gere's wife. Although she was brilliant in OFF THE MAP (see my review), she gets the tone wrong here, which may be the fault of the otherwise brilliant Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, who has directed this film otherwise nearly to perfection. Allen falls into the trap in the early part of the story of acting the part of the censorious, sour and unsympathetic wife, who has become just as much a stock character in modern American movies as the embittered and vicious ex-wife or the 'angry young woman' who takes her revenge on men. Although Allen softens up as things go on, she is never convincingly warm either towards her husband or his dog, whom she initially fanatically opposes (for reasons which are entirely unclear other than the presumption that Gere's wife, not any potential girl dog whom Hachi might ever meet, is a bitch). I found that aspect of the film disappointing, disturbing, and incomprehensible. Hachi starts out as a puppy, becomes an adult, and then becomes an old dog, so there must have been at least three Hachis acting in the film. Hallstr\u00f6m is known as a dog lover, and he aptly subtitles this film: 'A Dog's Love Story', as the attention is all on Hachi. Richard Gere is absolutely superb as the man who learns to love his dog more than anyone or anything. He and Hachi become inseparable, and every day at 5 PM, Hachi trots over to the railway station to meet his master's train and accompany him on the walk home. But Richard Gere has a heart attack and dies whilst teaching, and when Hachi goes to meet the train that day, his master does not appear as normal at the station door. Various events ensue, but Hachi cannot settle with any other member of the family, as they have all left the original house near the station, so Hachi returns to his post every day and waits for his master. He does this every day for ten years. (The real Hachi in Japan did it for nine years.) He faithfully waits and scans the station door every day at 5 PM, never giving up hope or losing his loyalty to the man he adores. He does this come rain or shine, he sits in the snow, he lives on scraps, but nothing can deter him or shake his loyalty. There are some really good performances by minor characters associated with the station, a hot-dog seller (sensitively portrayed by the Indian actor Erick Avari), some station employees, and other locals such as a friendly butcher and his wife, and even a real Japanese professor (excellently played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who had been a friend of Gere, who comes and speaks to Hachi in Japanese, which Hachi from his facial expression clearly recognises. Hachi's point-of-view shots are all shot in black and white, from ground level, presumably on the theory that dogs do not see in colour. They are very effective indeed, which is not an easy thing to pull off. I don't know why poor Hachi was left outside at night in a doghouse. Any half sensible person would have wanted Hachi in the house at night, rather than in the cold during the winter, however thick his fur might be. But then people are weird, and only dogs are sensible and loving, as this film proves. If ever a dog could teach us all something it is Hachi. He can instruct us in the true meaning of the word 'loyalty', both the dictionary meaning of which and the daily application of which have become so unfashionable in our current narcissistic society, where no even looks at another person anymore, as everyone's eyes are now out of focus, staring into space vacantly while listening to someone talk nonsense on a cellphone, oblivious of all surroundings. This film is so sad and such a desperate weepie that even the most hardened narcissist might turn his Blackberry off for a few moments of reflection, that is, if he has sufficient attention span to watch two or three continuous minutes of anything other than a combat computer game. I had great fun watching this DVD with Dutch subtitles. I now know that 'Good Boy!' in Dutch is 'Brave Hond!', 'Really?' is 'Echt waar?', and if I ever want to call anyone 'Sweetie' when I am next in the Netherlands, all I have to do is say 'lieverd' and smile. So you see how much else Hachi has taught me? I really recommend turning on the foreign subtitles when you watch movies, as you can learn a foreign language at the same time as seeing the film.

These are tears of gratitude towards the director of the movie for what is easily the most sensitive and touching portrayal of the bond between a man and a dog. Richard Gere is the music professor at a college who finds an abandoned dog at the train station. He takes it to his home. His wife (Joan Allen) is initially against keeping the dog with them because of a reason. But slowly she understands that her husband had become totally crazy for it and he ends up becoming a part of their family which also includes a daughter. Gere finds out that its name is Hachiko. The film tracks the relation between Gere and Hachiko over their life time. The incidents are funny and poignant and you would be laughing as well as suppressing sniffles. Gere is in the acting form of his life and you can clearly see that he loves Hachiko. Their chemistry burns up the screen and lifts this from a very good movie to a truly extraordinary one. Allen is better than average as his wife. There are a bunch of characters that fall in love with Hachiko and they are sketched very vividly. But the film belongs to the titular Hachiko. The director uses black and white to show his point of view. Watching many scenes I thought I could understand that the director was trying to show that we may be thinking that our pet is really fine and cozy in its place but what it actually wants at that time is to be with us, in our arms. Hachiko wins your heart and bowls you over and devastates you by the end of the run time. I have never owned an animal in my life time. I guess it is time to set this right. As one of my friend wrote and it has stayed with me ever since, when you go and select a dog perhaps that may be the only occasion you get to select your relative. Unbelievable achievement. 4.5 out of 5.",

            "content": "This is one of the best dog films ever, surpassing Marley and Me.I had know idea this film came out in 2009, it is one of those sleeper hits. I lost my dog in July 2014, and was debating on renting this movie. I saw it on Redbox, and thought why not. The movie is about an Akita pup who makes it's way from Japan to the United States. It arrives at a train station,it gets loose from it's cage. Parker Wilson(Richard Gere) comes along and finds him. He figures the dog belongs to somebody and tells Carl( Jason Alexander), the train station manager. He asks Carl if he could keep him until the owner comes. When Carl says I can come in, in the morning; and drop him off at the pound. Parker has second thoughts, and decides to take him home. He finds a box to put him in, until he can find the owner. Parker has him in the den, and decides he his safe until morning. The dog wants to be with Parker, he gets loose climbs up the stairs to Parker's and Cate's room. The dog licks Cate's feet, and scares her. She tells Parker about their agreement, no more dogs. Parker get's up, and put's the dog out in the shed for the night. everyone in the house wants the dog to stay except Cate. A bond begins to form with Parker, and Hachi. Cate sees this with Parker, Andy( their daughter); and decides to give in. The Parker's have a new family member. As Hachi begins to grow the bond becomes stronger. Every work day, Hachi would go to the train station with Parke,r and meet him when he returns. Hachi is a very loyal dog, who is a one master dog literally. When Parker doesn't come home from work one day, Hachi sits there until the family picks him up. Parker had a heart attack teaching class, and died. Hachi seems lost after this, but he would do the same routine every work day like Parker was going to return. Hachi is a regular at the station, and is beloved by all there. They would feed him, look after him, and let him stay there. He was sent to live with Andy, and her husband, but he didn't want to live anywhere so lived close by under a train on the tracks . I guess he did this to be close to the station; he just wanted his master to return. As the years go by, you still see the strong devotion of this dog. He doesn't give up, the same routine every day, you feel for the dog. In a way he seems lost; but he is strong willed. This movie is very heartwarming, it has it's sad moments; but the humor it has will put a smile on your face. At the end of the film it shows a picture of the real Hachi. It also has the factual information with it, which is very interesting. In Japan there is a huge statue of Hachi at the train station, where Hachi would wait. This is a great film the whole family will enjoy. Even though it is sad the ending is touching. It is a tear jerker so have those tissues nearby. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",

            "content": "Just saw this film on Hallmark channel and it is sad and wonderful. Anyone who loves a dog, must see this. It is based on a true story, and isn't just the Disney fiction story we are used to.Richard Gere portrays a music professor in New York suburbs who commutes to the city for work every day. One day he comes across a stray, a beautiful Akita puppy who has lost his way.He brings the pup home, hoping at first to keep him, but his wife, Joan Allen, is not really a dog lover. She wants the dog in the shed, or to find a new home.After back and forth of trying to get the dog adopted, Gere finally decides he cannot just give the dog to a shelter, where they put dogs to sleep after two weeks, there are too many which aren't adopted.He eventually names the dog \"Hachi\" after his Japanese colleague tells him the story behind the breed of Akita. They are very loyal and devoted, but do not expect them to play catch at the whim of a human.Over time we see Gere and his family, he becomes a grandfather, he takes the dog for trips (Hachi refuses to sit home while his master is at work, he will wait for him at the train station, even in freezing weather). The story is told in a natural progression, we also see in the dogs perspective, in black and white, with gray.While this film came out after \"Marley and Me\" it is not just another dog story. It will truly touch your heart. Indeed, I have not cried over any film in over fifteen years. Highly recommended and read the true story as well. 10/10.",

            "content": "The moment you start watching the puppy Hachi in the first scene of the movie being shifted from one country to another, you just cannot stop adoring the little fella. He is the highlight of the movie and thats quite intentional as it is centered around him.As many would have read in the synopsis, Hachi is brought home by Parker(Richard Gere) when he comes home from his daily work routine and finds Hachi abandoned at the train station. As many people would try to find its owner, Parker sets to find the true owner(but fails) and starts advertising for adoption. The story that unfolds later may be slow and drab but it is well told and the chemistry between Parker and Hachi is truly commendable and engaging. Small yet cute details such as showing Hachi's vision in the form of black and white are worth a mention. The characters in this movie are few but manage to deliver decent performances such as the hot dog guy, Parker's wife and friend. Without revealing much about the movie, let me point out that its Richard Gere and Hachi who steal the show. Throughout the movie you feel that two are meant to be together forever to the point you doubt sometimes that whether Parker has a daughter and a wife living in his house. Nonetheless, he loves them too.One of the most important talked about point about the movie is its ability to touch everybody's heart and make the audience and viewers shed a few tears for the second half of the movie. This is something I totally agree and this movie is one such rare gem that made me cry the most. Its just so sad in some scenes. I bet all pet lovers would love this movie and appreciate it as a highly engaging and emotional movie. This is certainly one of my favorite movies and since I am not a pet owner yet, am planning to buy an Akita dog and name it 'Hachi' for he is the hero just as the kid mentions.",

Hallstr\u00f6m's unfussy, effective film uses several visual techniques \u2013 dog's eye-view black-and-white footage, sped-up time frames \u2013 to tell the often moving tale of Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), a music professor and family man who surrenders to the charms of dog ownership. When Parker dies and his family sells up and moves away, Hachi legs it back to the railway station where his owner used to arrive home from work and keeps vigil there for almost a decade. Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers. Yet the film is as much about the emotional fallout of death as about a mutt's loyalty and devotion. As a dog owner, I must confess to having had a large lump in the throat throughout.

The movie features an excellent BGM that did very well gel to the sentiment, I feel. The Censor board has approved this movie for General exhibition so it can be watched with your family. One small issue with the movie that apart from these two main characters the others weren't explored at all. The bottom line is that Hachiko's loyalty made me fear no dogs, instead love 'em.",

How on earth does someone decides to put this as a short shelf life and not consider this movie to come out during the Xmas holiday. You have two superb actors, Richard Gere and Joan Allen. Can you get better than that. Shame on the film industry. I couldn't get my own brothers to watch this film for a second time. They were so heart wrenched in watching it the first time around. The music, the dog and the acting made this film possible. I saw it six times and every time I saw it, I cried. It's based on a true story and everyone I know that has seen it, can't have enough tissues handy. You chose Marley & Me to come out during the holidays and while I liked it and read the book, there is no comparison. This was a beautiful movie in every which way.This is an amazing story about loyalty and unconditional love. I saw the Japanese version of it and while it was very good, I stilled loved the US version of it. I don't know what possessed the film industry to ignore putting this film on the silver screen because it was so beautifully well written and the music was amazing. I believe this movie came out when Marley and Me did, and while I enjoyed Marley and Me, there were more lessons to be learned by this movie and not by a precocious dog, but one who was truly loyal. I guess because it was based on a true story, it makes it all the more heart wrenching that something like this actually happened. If you're a dog lover, you will love this film, because you could associate yourself with the character that Richard Gere played. He was actually very good, but the accolades go to the dog that played Hachi. I was so mesmerized by this movie, the cast. the music and the dog, that I ordered it from Amazon.com in Blue Ray.Modify review below:",

            "review_title": "A testament to inhumanity",
            "content": "Despite it's designation as a children's film it's anything but and should be avoided at all costs. The story begins well enough but careens into utter heartlessness once the professor dies and the dog is left to fend for itself, dependent on the charity of strangers. There's nothing to celebrate here. Yes, Hachi was a loyal companion who faithfully waited for his master to return. But once he died why didn't his widow or daughter adopt him? How could they have been so insensitive? I repeat, there's nothing to celebrate here. The story does nothing but testify to his family's insensitivity. At the very least they could have provided for him with a doghouse, regular care and food instead of letting him sleep in a train yard, exposed year round to the elements for ten years. TEN YEARS! And then the widow runs into him after all those years and all she could do was hug him as if that makes up for her disgraceful behavior. How anyone could find this story inspiring is beyond me. Be forewarned! Like me you might end up crying but not out of admiration for Hachi's perseverance. Instead it might be because you can't believe people can be so cruel. Don't be fooled by the high scores or the uplifting score, or the brilliant cinematography, or the performances. Whether you share your life with animals and perhaps especially if you do you'll come to rue your investment in this story.After sleeping on it I have come to question several assertions of the story. I don't know the original Japanese version hence my comments address this, the American version and some bear on the behavior of the local authorities. Without a doubt Hachi would have been considered abandoned within days of his vigil at the station. Let's just consider the station master, or the vendor or the shopkeeper. They were all aware of the professor's death, Hachi's adoption by his daughter, the sale of his house and the relocation of his wife. It's inconceivable that in the US they would have shown no more concern than what is depicted in the film. And if not them then what of the commuters? We are even shown some greeting and caressing Hachi. He was clearly not an aggressive or defensive dog as Akitas are reputed to be. Any one of these individuals could have adopted Hachi or at the very least alerted the authorities of his condition. We know of a local animal control officer. We meet him early in the film. Once alerted, he would have been duty bound to capture Hachi and proceed with the dictates of local ordinances regarding stray animals.Now let's consider the professor's family. Their behavior is likewise inconceivable. Did they all somehow stop loving Hachi? We're supposed to believe that the daughter's response to a grieving dog, one she is responsible for and is charged with its care, is to open the gate and essentially abandon it? Really? Doesn't that strike anyone as ludicrous? Even if they thought Hachi was lost or dead were they not alerted by any of the aforementioned individuals or the authorities that he was at the station? We are expected to believe that Hachi, contrary to all evidence, couldn't or wouldn't transfer his loyalty to another human. Dogs and in fact all pets can and do just that. As such the family's portrayal is unbelievable, even slanderous.In the final analysis this film strikes too many false notes to merit its stellar score. I actually feel cheated. I was elevated by the love between a human and a dog only to be angered and disgusted by the events in the film's resolution. Crises do occur, some lead to unforeseen disaster and tragedy. None of that was present here. There wasn't even a point. I'm actually surprised, even disappointed, that actors of the stature of Joan Allen and Richard Gere were involved in this project. It was beneath them.To be fair, had I scored the film on its technical merits and performances I would have given it a higher score. It's the story that destroys it, plain and simple. If you look at some of my other reviews I love duds, turkeys, just plain bad movies. \"Hachi\" is not that. It's a fraud, a deception. It's pretentious. It masquerades as a story of loyalty when it's really about cruelty and desertion under a veneer of devotion, honor and fidelity.",

If there's a movie that can make grown men cry, this movie is it. I don't know how this film wouldn't make any pet owner cry. I was aware of the legendary story of Hachi and the statue in Shibuya, Japan (I've been there), but I didn't think Hollywood could make an emotional film inspired by it. I've also seen the Japanese 1987 version; both versions have their moments and similarities. Of course, the Hollywood Hachi is modernized for today. Richard Gere was the perfect choice for this film. It's so tragic. I'm getting teary just thinking about it again and I watched it over a month ago. I must eventually check out \"A Dog's Purpose\" (a shame it got negative press because people are soo quick to react), which is by the same director.If you're looking for a movie to make use of a full box of Kleenex, this is it.",

I found it not very nourishing myself, and am surprised that it is in the top 200 on IMDb. But it is well made and one element struck me as interesting.The challenge in telling the story is that the basic elements are not cinematic: a dog is loyal after death, standing by the railway station waiting for his master. There are some incidental family and professional qualities that slightly bear on the story. To bring the story to a cinematic vocabulary, you need to introduce a host of on screen watchers. We have all manner of watchers here: the railway station has three: the stationmaster, a street food vendor and a nearby bookseller. This forms the first tier. We have a Japanese professor friend who is more informed and wise, who watches from afar.But then we have all sorts of novel embellishments on the watching theme. Our main guy is a professor of art, someone who pre-watches performances and whose death is watched by students. His wife is engaged in the restoration of a watching venue, with the further embellishment of revealing lost watchers of the watchers (murals in a theater). And then we have the rather odd POV segments from the dog, designating him as a watcher.The narrative drive here is weak, I think. But the narrative construction is amazingly well considered.",

            "content": "An Akita Inu puppy, transplanted from a Japanese monastery to a picturesque town in Rhode Island, becomes lost at the train station but is soon adopted into the home of a music professor and his wife. Low-keyed American remake of a 1987 Japanese film, \"The Tale of Hachiko\", itself based upon a true story, has sweet and lovely passages, though overall content is lacking. Family-friendly movies about the bond between humans and animals nearly always work if the casting is right; here, the canine who portrays the older Hachi is a gorgeous, expressive creature--so how could the filmmakers miss? Co-produced by its star, Richard Gere, and directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, the film touches on universal emotions when it comes to our beloved pets, but the human interaction (disconcertingly subdued throughout) is under-nourished. Playing Gere's wife, Joan Allen is unable to find a character in the writing; and when the dog is moved around in the film's latter stages, Allen's actions (and her subsequent disappearance) are puzzling. Gere doesn't really have a character to portray either, but he's appealing and unhurried in his scenes with the dog, projecting a warmly lackadaisical presence. Hallstr\u00f6m, minus his barbed sense of human dynamics, must have helmed this project as a lark. He indeed guides the narrative with an assured, steady hand, but \"Hachi\" is far too subdued overall to make a big impact. **1/2 from ****",

Those scenes alone were enough to get me emotionally in pieces, and then came the final 15 minutes when the film comes to a close and I found out that it was based on a true story.

I've not been a big fan of Gere's over the years, since seeing American Gigolo when it was first released. But he is so natural in this film and so clearly having real fun with Hachi, that it is a totally winning performance. Two small points in the Plot Summary: Carl did not teach Hachi to fetch. Rather, as Ken said, Hachi would fetch when it meant something, so the only time he fetched the ball was when he was trying to keep Parker from going to work, mysteriously knowing what was going to happen. Secondly, describing Joan Allen as a bossy, jealous wife kind of misses the point. Many couples decide against having a dog because one of them objects, and in fact she is won over when she sees how happy Hachi makes her husband.",

However, when it comes to character development and dialogue, it has all the depth of an after-school special. Between the small talk and unrealistically perfect lives of the characters, there's hardly a genuine moment.And despite the built-in emotionally charged subject matter, it manages to have very little drama or tension, even where there ought to be. Even the most dramatic moment in the film is telegraphed by a Richard Gere soliloquy that gives away what's about to happen.The worst aspect, I found, was the lack of any reality when it comes to animal care. It's as if no one involved in the film has ever owned or cared for a dog, and picked up all their knowledge from watching Chaplin movies or something.It's not a terrible film, but I'd recommend it to parents who want to share a film with their young kids that has a heart and can teach them some empathy.

What did i get?? besides my unstoppable sobbing throughout the film and the fact that my red eyes hurt a lot later, i loved this film. This is the definition of an EMOTIONAL film. Richard Gere does it great here (better than in pretty woman, in my OP) with bonding Hachi, who was beautiful as a puppy, as the regular hachi, and even as the old one. He was extremely beautiful and i love beautiful and tender dogs. So even in the happy parts i started to shed a happy tear, but from the moment... (well, you know what moment) i couldn't stop crying throughout the film. I actually consider myself a sensitive guy, but i never cry OUT LOUD in the cinema. I tried to hold it, but just couldn't. This has to be one of the two films in which i have cried the most in my whole life, and that's a good thing. I actually love the emotional moments in every film. The story is greatly portrayed, and the relationship couldn't be better. God, when hachi dreams of him i just couldn't stop sobbing. Poor hachi, really. And of course what got me is the friendship and loyalty scent that this movie doesn't lack at all. I definitely will buy it, cause i love dogs and i love emotional films.

It's about a relation between a man and a dog like no other, and gives a new meaning to the phrase \"Man's best friend.\".Based on a story of a real dog Hachi that waited for his deceased master for 9 years in Tokyo's Shibuya station, Hachi is a moving story about dog's loyalty that transcends animal - human barrier. Nowhere in the world has a story of this likes has been reported, and in his native Japan, Hachi is still the symbol of how families should be faithful to one another. This is no ordinary animal's movie as the animal not only gets the top billing, but gets it above a Hollywood A list actor Richard Gere. Although the movie's setting is transplanted to a town in Rhode Island, the story is essentially the same as that of the original Hachi. Richard Gere makes his second appearance on a Japan themed movie, first being \"Shall we Dance ?\", as the University professor.For the real dog Hachi, a bronze statue of him was erected in 1948 at Shibuya station in front of an exit that now bears his name \"Shibuya eki Hachi ko guchi\" (Shibuya Station Hachi Ko Exit), and is a popular landmark for people to use as a meeting place.This certainly is one of the best movie Richard Gere starred in, and also one of the best animal movie of all times.

Then something very touching and sad happens, which tells us the fact that true friendship and loyalty will never be broken.And so, why was I touched by this film? While a dog can always wait for his master no matter what happens, we people don't always have that much loyalty. Many of us can be a bit \"cold\", or in another word, forgetful at times. We can be forgetful about the happy times and bitter stuff that we've been through with our friends, our loved ones when we argue or fight for just some little occasional conflict for instance. We can be forgetful about those good moments when we pretend that we can't forgive our friends for certain small mistake just because we like to pretend to be serious sometimes. However, this story reminds us of the value of cherishing something that's more worthwhile than some trifles which could possibly break our friendship and loyalty to somebody.The movie is a small-budget one, and perhaps that's the reason why so many still haven't watched it.

It is nice the way Gere's character became friends with the little animal, and it was beautiful to see their activities together-- specially when Mr. Wilson tries to teach him how to catch a ball or any object.

I must say I am not a big fan of his work, I thought some kind of indie, amateur or semi professional cinematographer filmed this. Hachi was released in 2009, why does it looks 15 years older? The film must have been on low budget? The camera equipment seams poor and everything including the soundtrack feels cheap. Containing the same monotonic piano strumming throughout the whole movie. Sometimes Hachi would have been better without, especially towards the end. you hear more or less the same tune in every scene, and it gets repetitive.The story is based on a true and mildly interesting story, unfortunately the storytelling has some major flaws. You don't get to know much about the characters, they are only sketches. But let's start with the beginning: a Japanese monk decides to send a dog puppet to the United States of America. Obviously lots of Japanese monks to that. The movie explanation is rather stupid: it must have been fate. Hachi and Gere meet each other at the train station. The story: Gere's grandson is telling the story of Hachi in his school as his \"personal hero\". Later on we find out, that his own family didn't care about Hachi at all. After Gere's character dies and things don't work out well with the family dog Hachi, they put him outside the house and the dog runs away, out of frustration. The family should perfectly know where he is. After all he went to the train station everyday to meet with his owner. Everyone in town knows where Hachi is, and it was even in the news. Still they never look after him. Couldn't they at least bring him some food. They don't seem to care. Remember the first scene? Hachi is supposedly some kind of \"hero\" for the family. Another point is, Hachi decides to abandon his supposedly caring and loving family and he is suffering. No dog would do that, not to a certain degree. Not under that weather conditions, not when it is freezing cold and there is no food, not if he still has a home place and people that would provide for him. Why didn't he return to sleep or eat, rather be miserabe? After several years Hachi is found at the train station by Gere's widow. Didn't she knew from her daughter or the news or friends? Is she surprised that the dog is still alive? In the next scene the family is sitting all together inside of their cozy house again. But not with Hachi. They look at family albums with pictures of Hachi, but the the dog is still outside. How cynical is that? The dog is still out there, dieing in the cold, alone, why don't you take him home you heartless bastards, you monsters. Last scene Hachi dies. Like another reviewer wrote: Hachi is nothing more than a 90 minute soppy TV commercial with doggy in the rain and family albums, Christmas, couples, happiness and heaven, and not much else. It is not a bad movie though compared to other \"dog movies\", it shows the loyalty of a dog and that he always waits for you when you come home, to be fair, from all the dog movies I have seen so far, Hachi is still the best. 6/10",

From the moment you start watching you are pulled into the amazingly GOOD plot! It is based on the true story of a Japanese dog's unrelenting and beautiful loyalty to his owner.The only movie I've ever cried and still cried before I watched this film was Lilo & Stitch. But this one... left me crying for the last 30 minutes! The script is that good!! It builds up perfectly.Props must also be given to the people in charge of picking the music or composing it. The score is about 50% the reason the film is so sad. The beautiful music is there for every heartwarming moment and it never disappoints.The acting also very good. Heck, even the one who sells hot dogs is good and Richard Gere is ASTOUNDING as the dog owner.Perfect direction, heartbreaking story and also beautiful acting and music all combine to make this movie one of the best, saddest (and most importantly, entertaining) movies I've seen in a long time.10/10 Amazing!! Must see if you own a dog or would like one :)",

I do not accept the notion that Hachi was too dumb to figure out that Parker was gone. After NINE YEARS, he could surely figure it out. This is not an intellect problem. Look at this from the perspective of a grief model (e.g. denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). Hachi was stuck in denial with possible depression. Where others see loyalty, I also see an intensely emotionally wounded creature. Also, I wonder about the symbolism of Hachi taking up fetching a ball on the day Parker dies. It surely has to have some significance: Parker has the ball visibly on the piano and is clutching it as he dies. From Hachi's perspective, he has made some shift in the relationship, doing something \"unnatural\" to please Parker. The expectation in fetch is that the person having the ball returns it to the the other. Parker has the ball. The onus is on him to return it to Hachi so play can continue. Maybe the symbolism is that when Parker leaves that morning, not only will Parker return home to family and wife but that Parker will return specifically to complete a connection to Hachi.",

Another strength is that Gere is supported by many great supporting actors and actress, Jason Alexander of Seinfeld being one of them, who all together played their roles great and making this tale a masterful film. Hachi the dog is one overly cute Akita, portrayed by 3 different dogs (different time lines of the film) all trained well. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is truly the best representation of loyalty, love and happiness. No matter how sad you feel, a dog like Hachi will make you feel more happy than a billionaire.

This was a true story of a dog that had lived and died in 1934 with the last ten years of its life spent at a train station waiting for his deceased owner to return who never can in this life, but only in the next. And that reunion will leave you in tears, not only for the happy and deserved reunion between Hachi and his owner, but anyone we have loved and lost and imagined and hoped awaited them. But if the reunion in our next life only exists between humans, I for one would be sorely disappointed not to have my own pets I have loved and lost and awaiting me at a place some have called the rainbow bridge. But this reunion between Hachi and his owner takes place where he has loyally and patiently awaited for ten years through cold and warmth, rain and snow. At the end of the movie we learn the true Hachi was a dog named Hachiko that lived in Japan. A statue of the dog has been placed there in a pose sitting and waiting as he had been seen for the last ten long years of his life, living for no other purpose than to reunite with the person he loved. I am often sent letters from animal rights groups asking me to help stop the dog meat trade in East Asia, Korea especially. I have been to Korea and and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I could only stay away from the markets I knew where it was going on to shield my eyes from something I knew I couldn't change. The practice I've heard seems to be dying out as a new generation shows a greater affection for dogs and an inclination for fast food, though the practice still exists with an estimated three million dogs each year being killed and eaten. It is in such places this movie needs to be shown. It would be a wonderful legacy for Hachiko if his loyalty and devotion could be rewarded by helping to change how dogs are treated not only in East Asia but everywhere in the world.",

The basic premise being the same in all three. A professor, an akita dog and a story about loyalty.That being said, I think I would have rather watched the Japanese film. Because quite honestly, while I can see why some people might really love this film, it feels so patronizingly Hollywood to me. All the usual tricks are here. The attempts to mystify the Far East, the touching montages, the sappy music, the candles and tears in the corner of the eye, the idyllic small town charm. They even slap a GoPro on the dog, just to make sure we understand that it is its story. Quite honestly I expected the dog to start talking at some point.Plus there's an absolutely pointless framing story featuring the professor's grandson. Absolutely pointless, pure waste of time and film reel.Still, the film is professionally made, looks very nice and if there was ever only one man who could pull off this kind of story, it would have to be Richard Gere. Quite honestly I had more problems with the characterization of the dog than I had with him.Not really a good movie in my opinion, but it has its numerous fans, and I can see why.

An americanized - Scandinavian version of the original, that even though portrays ideal behavior of the community in an idyllic setting, invades the inconscient with soft images, a subtle but slowly penetrating soundtrack and Richard Gere in maybe the best and more human role of his long career. I saw him at first as the sex idol in 'American Gigolo' and 'Breathless' and he marked my adolescence, but his mature self is far more enchanting.When God realized Man was far from perfect, he created dogs to counter - balance.The dog sight that dominates the movie which rolls in a very slow pace - as dogs' lives usually do - let us penetrate in Hachi's soul, and that ends up to be both devastating and deliberating. I feel at the same time sorry and so relieved seeing how love triumphs over death. I'm sure that if the movie had the adequate promotion and was on the cinemas for a while, it would have gained a far more higher position in the list.",

Only a dog owner can understand the vibes/connection/mutual understanding between him and his dog 3. I gave it 9 points as the movie is different from the true story. The true story is more touching. 4.Richard Gere is outstanding in this movie. Never felt like he was acting. Actually i was surprised to see him working in this movie.By his acting ,he added that extra touch to the movie along with the DOG. 5. You may find it weird, but the acting of the dog was remarkable... i mean ... if i had to give points in acting ..then the DOG will earn more points than Richard Gere. Yes ,the DOG acted in this movie rather than jump from one wall, kicking football or doing those crazy Home Alone tricks. 6.This movie is completely powered with acting performance by the DOG and Mr.Richards. They are the soul of this movie.7. Good work done by the Station Master and the Hot Dog Man. 8.

A college professor (Richard Gere) takes in an abandoned dog, Hachi, and they form an unbreakable bond. After the professor dies while away from home, the dog keeps vigil waiting for his master hoping that one day, he will return.Hachiko: A Dog's Story is one of the best movies I have seen so far in 2010. The plot and story is so moving and heart-warming and sends a positive, strong message about loyalty and friendship. There is no faults where the acting is concerned and Richard Gere gives out a terrific performance as Hachiko's master. Hachiko is directed superbly and the timing for the movie is marvellous, the movie didn't feel long or short and the ending was brilliant. The music added so much emotion to the scenes filmed even though the movie was emotional enough without it. The only fault I have with the movie is the characters. While the characters are lovable, you didn't know enough about them which made them a little underused. However, that could have been intentional to show the audience the loyalty and love between Hachiko and his master.I would recommend this to everybody as this one will tug your heartstrings and make you cry. This is one movie no-one should miss, this isn't your normal dog story, this is one story you won't forget in a hurry.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",

It followed by showing the dog's continued loyalty which meant the community who knew it committed to looking after as best they could, without resorting to trying to find a new home or take him to the pound.The film does not overly play for laughs. It doesn't overly play on sentiment. It doesn't give the dog a human voice so you can only assume what the dog is feeling by watching it's manner and actions. It makes you think about what must be going through it's mind and that is why it was so emotional for me.I had watched the film in tears from the moment the dog didn't want his master to go that day and having stopped at the end of the film, I started again whilst writing this review.Watch it with an open, compassionate mind rather one of cynicism, which many seem to have done.",

            "content": "That moves me emotionally like few other movies can. Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the Americanized version of the original 1987 Japanese original \"Hachiko Monogatari,\" both based on the true life story of the famous Japanese Akita named Hachiko who lived from 1923 to 1935. Hachi: A dog's Tale is set in Rhode Island and follows the life of Hachi from his haphazard arrival at the train station where the film is set and subsequent discovery there by Richard Gere, the music professor who takes him in and bonds with him. Joan Allen is Gere's wife and, while not particularly enthralled with Hachi at first, ultimately sees the special bond forming between her husband and the Akita and thus comes to accept Hachi.Hachi begins a routine of escorting Gere to the train station each morning and waiting for him to return in the evening where they both go home together. There are a few smaller characters in the film, the hot dog vendor, the train station attendant and Ken, a Japanese professor friend of Gere who serves as the wise man who knows instinctively there is something majestic about the Akita breed -- \"not a dog to play fetch with\" -- he sees this dog as the regal creature that it is. We are reminded of this majesty later in the film, when Ken talks to Hachi alone, in Japanese, one spiritual Japanese talking to another.The are two distinct tragedies in the film, the first being the sudden and untimely death of the main human character (Gere), but the film focuses in its last acts on the second and far deeper tragedy -- Hachi's belief that one day his master will return on the train, thus careening the rest of his life into a never-ending cycle of returning to the train station and waiting in vain for his return. The film uses sparse but effective special effects to show the relentless passage of time and how the poor dog continues, unabated to return to the station. These final sequences place the film squarely in the genre of horror as nothing can dissuade Hachi from waiting and nothing can bring his master back. The animal is doomed to a life of endless waiting.Along with the marvelous dog makeup and training used to present an aged and slowing dog, the soundtrack by Jan Kaczmarek deserves special mention as it is simply beautiful with several memorable themes of mostly piano and strings, used to both playful and melancholy effect. Indeed by the end of the film, it is almost impossible not to weep profoundly for poor Hachi, walking ever so slowly to the train station, in his lifelong demonstration of love, loyalty and hope. It is not an exaggeration to say that few films have such an emotional impact.",

Fast forward 9 years later, while a senior in college Dad received a letter from his parents that Dick had died. By accident rummaging through our family heirlooms after Dad died several years ago, I came across a diary book of his and in it was an handwritten eulogy he wrote upon learning about Dick's death. He wrote this in 1934 (excerpts) : ....\" No truer friend did I ever have than this dog. She had much to with shaping my character that is the virtue I possess for I learned from Dick much of the valuable principles of good living....\" This movie is for those who had a strong and stirring attachment with their dog and it does bring tears to our eyes because of it.

Being Japanese American I had heard about the original story from my Mom. I thought the movie was very well done, not going for cheap sentimentality but showing very well the bond between Hachi and the Professor. I have read some other posts where the readers took the family to task for seemingly \"abandoning\" Hachi after the professor died. For one, it's a MOVIE. Also, we don't know where the professor's wife was going, maybe dogs weren't allowed. Also, the daughter had more of a bond, so that is why Hachi went with her. I also don't think she \"abandoned\" him either. She was wise enough to know that she and her family would never replace the professor in Hachi's heart and would be miserable if he stayed.I really liked the way the \"reunion\" was handled. They say your life flashes before you before you pass on. In Hachi's case, he remembered the happy times with the the professor. When the professor \"steps\" through the door and they are reunited, it's like Hachi's 10 year wait has paid off. They are back together and now he can move on as well.The coda with the grandson telling the story to his class and getting a puppy of his own (which he called Hachi) was a nice touch, but not really necessary. The last scene of Hachi in his final \"sleep\" after seeing his master again would have been more powerful.My wife and I had tears in our eyes. My son liked the movie, but made me laugh when he said, \"It's just like Marley and Me only the owner died\" 10 year old kids are sometimes sharper than grown ups!",

This is a great true story. And I would hate to think that the real owners of Hachiko treated him with such disregard. But what shines through even in this shallow version,, is that a house, and all of our possessions are nothing compared to love, loyalty, and friendship of a beautiful dog like Hachiko.

The book is very compelling and sets out to separate fact from fiction using evidence but also give the reader background on professor, journalist and other people associated with Hachi as well as some background on the times and culture in Japan at the time. The book is very detailed and you realise this film is a simplified version and is more of a summary.I must admit that if you are easily upset or have sensitive children you will find this film difficult to watch and it will definitely leave you in tears.",

It's a dog waiting for his dead owner to come back while sitting in the same spot for years, how do you make that visually interesting? Director Lasse Halstrom partially solves this problem by having Richard Gere die very late into this movie, a bit too late perhaps. The whole family is just so bland, what do we get to know about these people throughout the movie? They're happy. That's pretty much the character development. There are only so many scenes about Richard Gere playing with a dog you can stomach without wondering when something's going to happen. The last half hour of this movie manages to save a lot though. Seeing Hachi interact with all of his owner's old friends who can't convince him he will never be back, watching him badly age while everyone around him knows he's wasting his time, it's all very strong because the build-up does work to some extent. It's kinda boring, but we do feel like we get to know Hachi well and that makes it all the more sad when we see him suffer. Everything that concerned Hachi I loved, the rest I can sorta do without.",

Another shaggy dog story, no thanks.Radio Times online has a photo of a young boy with a puppy to go with it. Doubly no thankyou! So, I resisted even longer. Then I noticed the director was none other than Lasse Hallstrom, who not everybody knows, made as one of his earliest films in his native Sweden, 'My Life as a Dog', back in 1985.That being quite a favourite of mine, I then recorded Hachi. But, My Life is a Dog it isn't and is very different and much more 'normal' and grown up and sober. For much of it though I still found myself sceptical; instead of my worst fears of having a small boy playing with his puppy, we have a fifty-odd year old man playing with his dog. All very cute and life-assuring but hardly high drama.Of course, this is a family drama and one that is obviously loved and so I adjusted my perceptions and then, enjoyed it. It benefits from a good cast - Richard Gere and Joan Allen as his wife and being filmed in the old school tradition - simply, slowly, beautifully. The simple piano-led music is evocative, emotive and fitting - and universal.Hachi is a touching tale that certainly brought a lump to my Tarantino- hardened throat and certainly made me think and ponder.

I cried my heart out for long after the film had finished. it so much more than a \"mans best friend film\" its a film about a really bond that outlasts humans. Its such a beautiful moving, and wonderful film.the best I've seen in such a long time. love it! I've told many people about this film already and they all want to see it, and I've warned them all.... you may think your tough when it comes to films, but be warned you'll need tissues. any one thats had a dog/has a dog or any pet really will feel this film get slowly stuck in their throat. Richard gear plays the part so well and its just an all round winner. I can only wish my Akita is as loyal and as loving as Hachi. I think we may even see a wave of little puppies names after him now!",

The great thing about this movie is that Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m resisted the temptation to make it \"more exciting\" by adding hard-to-believe scenes. The whole film thus comes across as very believable, and one gets the feeling that the bond between Hachi and his master is absolutely real. Richard Gere does a fine job there indeed.For me, he is in fact one of those actors that are like expensive wine: They're getting better with age. I was never very fond of him in the 90s, but his performances in \"Hachi\" or \"Shall We Dance\", for instance, I find outstanding and extremely believable.But anyone watching this film is advised to keep a box of tissues handy, as I cannot think of anyone who would not need them!",

            "content": "This film left me in a difficult place to review: it's a beautifully told and acted film that I wish I'd never seen. After three days, I'm still melancholy and teary. I would NOT recommend this film if you are very sensitive, nor is it a film for children. I'm a dog owner who is passionate about all dogs-- and the underlying themes of abandonment, confusion and sorrow Hachi endured completely tore me apart.The film is an exquisitely moving story about the \"real\" Hachi (Tokyo, 1923-34.) I avoid cute tear-jerker films, but this is different. You'll see remarkable scenes of Hachi's face and the joyous bond he felt for his master. But be prepared for tough scenes of a collarless Hachi sleeping under trains in the snow and wandering alone in old age. Only searching out details of the \"real\" Hachi helped me move past the film: though Hachi faced difficulties on the street, he did have shelter and was cared for. After running away from several new homes, a train station manager gave him a storeroom to sleep, and Hachi had access to homes of shop owners nearby. Hachi still kept his schedule of waiting daily for his master to return on the train, but his basic needs were cared for as best as people did in the 1930's. He lived to be embraced by many who came to feed him and pat his head for good luck, even attended the ceremony for his own statue being installed. Some accounts even say Hachi saw his master's body at the wake, and sat faithfully near him all night. Stories are exaggerated after 80 years, but I hope it's true, as I've heard this helps dogs understand and ease their grief.If you can handle it, watch this film for an memorable interpretation of Hachi's story. If you have a hard time shaking things off, you'll be better off reading about Hachi's noble soul-- and the enduring devotion he felt for his master, far beyond death.",

            "content": "Although it suffers from being overly sentimental & comes off as emotionally manipulative on few occasions, Hachi: A Dog's Tale still qualifies as an affectionately crafted tearjerker that has a lot of warmth, cuteness & heart but purely from a story perspective, all it tries to do is to force its viewers to fall in love with its premise by using their sensitivity when it comes to a cute dog as its strength & eventually succeeds.Based on a true story of the now legendary Japanese dog named Hachik\u014d & his well-known loyalty to his master, Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the Americanised version of the same story & concerns an abandoned dog who is found at a train station by a local professor; who takes him home & eventually adopts him. The story covers their budding relationship and Hachi's faithfulness & endless wait for his master when an unexpected tragedy strikes.Nicely directed, finely photographed & evocatively scored, the film doesn't have much to offer other than the adventures of our titular character which probably is enough to make most of its viewers go \"aww\" at every moment & forget about every other shortcoming the film has. There are moments when you genuinely feel for what's portrayed in the film but then there are also moments when it feels like the film is trying too hard to make us react in a certain manner.The dog in itself is given a special treatment as if it's some extraordinarily-gifted pet possessing an ideal personality & is shown as a mystifying character who never really does what other members of its species generally do. I'm not denying that Hachik\u014d never happened but I'm not really sold by its portrayal in this film at least. Also chipping useful contribution to the film is Richard Gere as the professor who found Hachi and his bonding with the dog is the core element that drives this film.To be honest, I'm not really surprised by the positive reception this movie has received ever since its release. After all, who doesn't love dogs? Well, I don't... not since the one that bit me when I was a kid although that crazy son of a bitch died a few days later so that cheered me up back then. Anyway, on an overall scale, Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a heartwarming & heartbreaking story of faith, devotion & undying love that guarantees a lot of tears to its sensitive audience & successfully delivers it.",

In the end of life and beyond, all the remains for all of us is love and the memories of love we have shared with others, be they human or animals. Hachi's devotion to his master, timeless, ageless and unrelenting, makes me weep, no film has ever moved me so much and so strongly. I first saw it in the cinema and was surrounded by grown men and women, some who had taken children to it thinking it was a touching tale that could be enjoyed by families, only possibly to find that it was gut wrenchingly sad and heart-breaking in ways that I can't fully describe. To see Hachi at the end, old, aging, weary but still, still, going to that train station every day at 5pm to wait for his master...I am crying now as I type this.God bless directors who can make films like this that touch people far and beyond the original intention.",

Reading about it though didn't have the same effect on me as actually watching it for the first time on the Hallmark Channel yesterday. The acting was excellent, the storyline was excellent, and the three dogs that portray Hachiko (Chico, Layla, and Forrest) were absolutely precious. I'm a twenty-one year old man who's always been rather emotional (it doesn't make any man less of one), and not surprisingly, I was bawling like a newborn baby by the end. Hachiko's death and ascension into Heaven with Parker was truly the saddest part of this film for me. I literally can't stop crying and even as I type this, I'm sobbing. Hachiko's undying loyalty and devotion show us what love truly is. I think if I'd known him, I would've stayed right there with him. I'm quite sure that Parker's grandson and his own Hachiko will share the very same bond their predecessors did. No film has ever moved me so much like this one did, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I believe as the human soul lives on after death, so does the animal. I'm sure I'll see my own pets in Heaven with me after I die, and I'm sure Hachiko is there, too.",

            "review_title": "By far the best dog movie I've ever seen.",
            "content": "The movie starts off with Parker (Gere) finding Hachi at a train station and not wanting to leave the dog alone. He takes him home for the night until the owner comes back to the station to claim him. His wife (Allen) clearly is not to fond of dogs and tells her husband that there is no way that they will be keeping the dog. Of course no one claims the dog and the wife realizes how much the husband and the daughter (Roemer) love the dog so she caves and lets them keep it. You clearly see the bond between Hachi and Parker with all the time they spend together and Hachi actually starts walking Parker to the train station and waiting for him when he gets back. One day Parker goes to work and has a heart attack and dies, but Hachi continues to wait for him at the station. Even after years of his passing Hachi continues to go back every day to wait for him.I'm going to start by arguing a couple of reviews I have read. First negative review was from UK critic who said he wasn't at all touched by this movie and the only real thought he had about it was how stupid a dog could be for waiting around for 10 years for his dead master to return. This clearly makes me angry, let's be real this is a dog not a human and I'm not saying dogs are dumb on the contrary I think there very intelligent, but I don't believe they no what happens to there master when they die and this movie is a perfect example of that. The last time Hachi saw Parker he was going to work so for all we know the dog just thought he had to eventually be coming back.Second review was how uninspired he was by this story and would have been more inspired if the community would have tried to help the dog understand that his master was not coming back. Parker's daughter, who probably loved him almost as much as parker himself, tried to take Hachi home with her, but Hachi didn't want too he wanted to wait for the one he loved most at the station. Let's be honest, when someone is stubborn and thinks what they are doing is right you can't convince them otherwise. Well that's how I felt about Hachi he was stubborn and no one was going to be able to get him to stop waiting.My thoughts on this movie are clear it was easily the most heartfelt movie in years. When I read all these reviews about how everyone sobbed I was thinking \"Ok, I might tear up a bit, but there is no way I'm going to sob\" Well I would just like to say that my wife and I have joined the sobbing club. I have shed a tear for very few movies and I see a lot, but there was something special about this movie. For me what made Hachi so special is most dogs I know love attention regardless who there getting it from, but of course they love there master just because they spend most there time with them. If a dog were to lose there master and someone else takes the dog and gives it just as much love and attention the dog will love there new owner just as much as the old owner. This wasn't the case for Hachi. He had an opportunity at Parker's daughters, but he didn't want to stay with her he loved his master so much that he was willing to not get the full affection that a dog deserves from another person for the rest of his life for just that one chance that Parker would return to play with him one more time.Hachi is a dog that could teach a lot of people a lesson or two on how to love one another and to not give up on love as fast as many people do now a days. Please rent this movie whether your a dog lover or not. This is not about how much a pet loved its master, its about how wonderful of a connection two friends had with each other.",

Constant stream of tears halfway through and towards the end it was a full on boohoo session.Such a touching and beautiful story that made me reflect on the loved ones I've lost in my life and how dearly I miss them, and also reminding me that my dog is nearing her last days and we've been inseparable for the past 10 years, you know it's coming and you think you're prepared for the sadness but we never are.The music was absolutely perfect.

A college professor's (Richard Gere) bond with the abandoned dog he takes at home along with his wife (Joan Allen) and daughter (Sarah Roemer) . At the beginning the spouse isn't happy about it , but after failing to find the owner , she lets the reliable dog stay . Later on , a Japanese friend (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) reads the dog's tag - \"Hachiko\" (from the mountainous northern regions of Japan) . Parker attempts to teach the dog to fetch , but the loving animal doesn't want to learn . This very beloved friend would accompany his master to the train station every day and return each afternoon to greet him after work.It is based on Hachiko, the Japanese dog that waited for his dead master to return for nine years , this \"Hachiko: A Dog's Story\" results to be a charming take off to \u00a8Hachiko\u00a8 film (1987) by Kaneto Shind\u00f4 starred by the great actor Tatsuya Nakadai. Enjoyable and provoking film that captures qualities that make this picture a classic dealing with the true story about a dog's loyalty to its master , as tragedy tests that loyalty even after his death and no animals were harmed . This is a new classic for a new generation , a thrilling saga of courage and loyalty . The animals in this film were in no way harmed or mistreated , being portrayed by three dogs which they appeared were under strict supervision with expert trainers for their handling . Paced quite energetically , as the story is efficiently told and through its profound and wizened eyes . The evocative scenery , photography and music enhance the story of \u00a8Hachi\u00a8 and its adventures , sufferings and adversities . The tale is treated in good sense and high sensibility , environment , animals , landscapes combine to enhance the glories of faithfulness . On May 19 , 2012, a bronze statue of the dog Hachi was unveiled at the train depot at Woonsocket Depot Square where the film was shot ; it is an exact replica of the bronze statue of Hachiko which resides in front of Shibuya Station in Japan.Good cast full of fine American actors such as : Richard Gere , Joan Allen , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , Sarah Roemer , Erick Avari and Jason Alexander . Glowing and glamorous cinematography by Ron Fortunato . Sensitive as well as emotive musical score by piano composed and played by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek . The music all plays with the soul , it is so delicately composed , performed, and chosen for the movie that it is worth seeing just to enjoy the soundtrack . The motion picture was marvelously directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m . Lasse is a prestigious director and writer, especially known for What's eating Gilbert Grape? (1993), The cider house rule (1999) , Chocolat (2000) , Casanova (2005) , Salmon fishing in the Yemen (2011) and this Hachiko (2009) ; and he has been married to Lena Olin .",

In my compound, my Brazilian neighbors gave me 5 days ago a copy of a movie: \"Achiko\" with Richard Gere. I got so moved that I am now browsing Internet for learning more about some other faithful dogs such as Greyfriars Bobby (Edinburgh - Scotland), Shep (Fort Benton - USA), Fido (Borgo - Italia),... and so many...My neighbors do not like dogs. They like cats! They were so moved by the movie that they knocked at my door a night, and gave me a DVD, saying, \"JP, you HAVE to watch this...\"I did. And days later I just think to myself: \"This word is walking on his head. Here, where I am, I see people dying of hunger, malaria, aids... I should think: there are more important matters than just a story between a dog and his 2-legs companion... But, no. It does not matter if it is a dog or not. It matters if you are, again and again, shown that being loved is a true gem, wherever it comes from.\"Cinema is not always about technology, pre-conceived ideas about timing, 600 pages stories and things that should happen.Simon & Garfunkel once sung \"the Sound of Silence\" This movie is the Sound of Silence. The silence of love.I am amazed to see the reviews in IMDb. I sorted by \"Hated it\", and discovered than only 8 comments were below the current average of 8.1 ... and the lowest reviewer gave a 7, which is very very fair! I have seen so many reviews about other films in IMDb where at least some reviewers were saying \"it is the worst movie ... ever\". Here no such thing. It is possible to be unsatisfied with some aspect of the movie, but, as it is based on a true story, and the film has not added \"Hollywoodian\" effects, it stays rather simple, somehow difficult to classify, but it lets a print in your soul.TO ANY ONE READING THIS REVIEW: GO, RUN, FLY, go see this movie. It will stay in you like a good little companion",

            "content": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story about Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, and the bond he forms with a Japanese Akita puppy, which is later found to be named Hachiko, he finds at the train station. Following is the chance relationship that develops between the 2 and how the soon become inseparable. Soon, Hachiko is noted by the inhabitants of the small Rhode Island town for showing up each day to meet Parker as he comes home from work. The Akita breed is most known for the loyalty they forge with their companions, whose loyalty is tested for nearly a decade after tragedy befalls Parker.At times, the point of view is taken so that we feel we are Hachiko, which allows us to see the curiosity, intrigue, and sometimes inquisitive thoughts he feels. One such event is when Parker attempts to get Hachi to play fetch, as he looks back at Parker curious of what is wrong with him. In other instances, when it comes to the onlookers, the angle is set such that we are looking up to Hachi. This leads into the end result of the bond formed between the 2, and that such love and loyalty is an admirable trait. After many viewings of the movie, it still manages to pull out the same feelings. The relationship between Parker and Hachi is believable, memorable and shows us what a true bond is really about. Some of you may have seen Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, or are at least familiar with movies relating to the bond between man and his companions, of the four-legged kind. These types of films show the viewers that whether from the view of the man or the animal, a deep bond means just as much to both.The story reached so deep, that I dreamt of seeing the statue dedicated Hachiko, whose loyalty to his master lasted until his last breath. Luckily, I had the privilege when I passed through Shibuya. Hachiko truly made impression on those around him, as this film will do when you watch it.",

This is a simple movie about a dog. Unlike Marley and Me, the movie is not about the OWNERS of the dog. The owners are obviously in Hachi - but the movie is about the dog, its life and its devotion. Given that the movie is also based somewhat closely on a true story, it makes it that much more powerful. It is too bad that this movie was not released theatrically or more well known.

I watch the movie just so that I can feel true love and cry it out.This movie is just brilliant. Dissecting it in to 2 parts - the story and the movie. The story - part of the prose in my primary school days (early 1990s) - is a must-know for every human being. Salute Hachiko!!!About the movie - it does all justice to the story. Performances, screenplay, music, direction have all been just perfect with no nonsense / artificiality to them. Spoiler - just that about half the movie is about Hachiko waiting for his master is probably the most impactful element and the highest tribute the movie makers could have paid to Hachiko!!Story very clearly teaches what is love and loyalty. But there is a very subtle message that the movie brings out which probably is hard to figure out reading the story. Spoiler - Hachiko's master dies. His wife moves on in life, children move on, students, friends, acquaintances, everyone moves on in life but for Hachiko. He waits all his life for his master (literally all his life) as if being with his master was the purpose of his life. I'd be proud of myself if I can do even 1/10th that i.e. wait for 1 year for any one person in my life. This subtlety brings out the contrasting attitude of human beings and some of the other lovable creatures - something that Japanese films have time and again portrayed and taught us in subtle as well as calling-a-spade-a-spade ways.This movie lingers in one's mind for a long long time and has a lasting impact - even if that is for just a day, I would think the movie has met success. Just watch this - can't think of another movie / any experience that creates such an impact in 1.5 hrs.Lastly little curious if not disappointed. The movie's overall rating is 8.1 despite almost every review talking about 10 and secondly this movie not making it to the top charts in IMDb (possibly due to fewer ratings).

Because that is why this film is scoring so high on IMDb. Director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m was probably eager take make a film where he could jerk the tears out of people. I just couldn't help feeling constantly manipulated and pushed around by the slimy piano music and the forced script and acting. I was thinking before I saw this film: how can they make people care so much for a dog it would make them cry and there really is only one way, the easy way which they took here (No spoilers but futurama episode 1 has a 1 min dog-sequence which this film ripped off which works so much better then Hachi). I have to say the dog is cute -although I'm more a cat person- and he does look sooo very sad at times in this film you can't help but feel sorry for the poor animal, but this is the manipulative effect this film has on people and Lasse knows and uses it so well. The dog trainers did a good job, kudos there but you do sometimes notice the dog is looking at something (the dog trainer) out of frame who is directing the dog to do certain things. The cinematographer also scores some bad points: this film was filmed digitally on a Genesis camera, but the picture has a very video/TV-like look which reinforces the feeling this is simply a low budget TV movie and not the cinematic masterpiece a lot of people seem to think it is. I know people who loved this movie won't understand and think me unempathetic for saying all this, but I love films and sometimes you need to dare point out the bad as well. It's like when a bad actor dies. Nobody dare say he sucked coz emotions have the upper hand but he was a bad actor all the same.",

Hachi, A Dogs Tale was a beautiful movie about the real Hachiko and the loyalty and love he had for his master. Richard Gere is a great actor and his character is believable and likable, and Hachi (a Japanese style Akita) is absolutely adorable! I seriously wanted to hug him throughout the movie. The setting was a little different (Rhode Island instead of Japan) but it didn't really matter. The story is heartbreaking and lovely as you watch Hachi wait for his master until they are finally reunited. As a warning though: Bring tissues, this movie is super sad!!!",

If you have ever loved anyone,human or animal,you have to love this movie.In an era when one can like and even recommend craps like \"American Pie\" and \"Euro trip\" then i find it hard,almost impossible, to comprehend how one can even dislike this movie.Richard Gere has effortlessly produced a gem of a movie for humanity and has brought us closer to the universal truth of love and peace.If a dog can teach us what love is,we can definitely spread the message.To rate this movie is merely a futile exercise as i truly believe that masterpieces like this are beyond any judgement or analysis.It's simply the most touching movie i ever saw.",

            "content": "I'm glad to see there are reviews here that don't just eat this story up with a spoon. It has the potential to be an amazing, inspiring film, but it falls way short on all fronts. As one blogger said, \"it tries to impart an Asian sensibility of 'animal as individual' that doesn't work in a contemporary American setting.\"If the filmmaker/screenwriter is going to take the fact-based story (and who really knows how much of that is true) as the bones of a contemporary film set in a completely different country, then he needs to elevate all aspects of the story to match. There are plenty of reviews here that illustrate the major flaws in screen writing, characterization, and the like. But how could the movie have reached the level of that inspirational, life-changing synopsis it claims to be? First of all, there is no rule that the wife can't attach to the dog and love it, and still have the animal's primary loyalty be toward the husband. Many animals bond much more with one family member. Creating a character who comes across as not caring for the animal her husband so loves, leaves the viewer wondering what he saw in her in the first place. It's contradictory to love.If the animal really \"inspires a whole town\" as the synopsis claims, why doesn't a whole town come together and take care of him instead of patting him on the head, saying a brief hello, and throwing a scrap of food? When the dog refuses to stay at the daughter's house and travels miles back to the train station, it's reprehensible that she opens the gate and lets him again find his way back over dangerous (and being an animal on the streets is always dangerous) territory. Why not have her take him back and work out something with the people there (train master, vendors, local store owners) that allows him to live at the station as he so desperately needs to do. She never checks on him again, which leaves the viewer cold and wondering how she sleeps at night.Her son (who starts and ends the story about Hachi his hero) is growing up the whole time the dog is waiting at the station, yet she never takes the child to meet the dog. What a lesson and inspiration it would have been to visit him and bring food and bedding on a regular basis in order to ensure the dog's comfort and safety. Teaching the child that sacrificing for those we love, including our four-legged family members, is part of the experience of life would have enriched this film in so many ways. Instead, the boy, at the end of the movie, says this all happened \"a long time ago,\" as if it were decades before his birth. No one in the family ever seems to check in or make sure Hachi is okay, and the wife only stumbles across the dog, and is surprised to see him, when visiting her husband's grave on the ten year anniversary of his death. The dog sleeps under an old train in freezing conditions, and no one seems to care. The scene where the family is looking at old pictures of Parker with Hachi is heart wrenching and dumbfounding. What did they tell the child: \"Oh, yeah, the dog wanted to wait for Grandpa so we let him run free and fend for himself on the streets. Not sure if he's still alive or not.\"Had the town come together to watch over this loved animal and offer him solace and physical and emotional comfort in his grief as a tribute to the man they all have so much respect for, it would have made this the inspirational, uplifting film it has the potential (and right) to be. It never does that.This is not a film any child should see and one most adults (and animal lovers) should avoid. It breaks the viewer's heart--for all the wrong reasons.",

As a result there are some things in the plot that just don't work and it's no coincidence that it's the same plot lines that didn't actually happen. For instance, how is it that the Joan Allen character does not know that Hachi is no longer living with her daughter, that he is living under a train and being fed by local business owners, and that every day he waits at his special spot for Daddy to come back? This scene, where she finds out that Hachi is doing this, is supposed to be very touching but it was ruined b/c I couldn't believe that the daughter has not told her any of this. After all, 10 years has passed and the daughter lives nearby. Why the mother had to move away is not explained and seems odd. In spite of the movies flaws I would still say it is worth a watch.

A deeply touching story that will make you agonize with the situation of the movie as you watch it !",

            "content": "This moving tale is based on the real-life story of Hachiko (aka Hachi), one of the Akita Inu breed. It really shows how much dogs are our friends... they are loyal even well after our death! Loyal forever and ever. This loyalty captures your attention and melts your heart.To find a good movie nowadays is not an easy duty, including animal movies. Well, this is a good doggy movie and one which brings back some of the formula that stopped being used long ago but was once so common, even though it's not in the same league as the greats from the past.Richard Gere leaves his leading gentleman roles and image behind and goes ahead with a far more serious and dramatic role as a professor who finds an abandoned dog and, after finding no one who wants to keep it, keeps it for himself. The two become best friends in no time. One day the professor unexpectedly passes away and that's when the pivotal part of the dog's loyalty comes up. It touches those who appreciate dogs and this genre of film.",

Secondly, the dog is just plain stupid. So he never fetched a ball and supposedly, as it was said, he waited for a special moment to fetch. He, of course, chose the moment before his master's death, which means he clearly knew his master was going to die that day. That means that he waited for him later on even though he knew he was never coming back. If it was about loyalty, the dog would have waited for him if he did not knew his master was dead, so he would have waited for him, no matter what, hoping he would come one day, because he has no reason to doubt his master - that is loyalty. Here, he knows his master is dead, yet he keeps going there waiting for him which is just plain stupidity. It's like running into the wall and then being surprised that the wall was in your path... Anyway the movie ends with hallucination or imagination of his master finally coming, which is truly predictable, lame and forced. This film is one of the worst and most unreal tearjerkers I've ever seen, even the cheap sad piano music feels very forced and bad taste. This movie teaches terrible morals, there's nothing inspiring or admirable about the dog.",

Family loyalty and fidelity are highlighted in a clear and succinct manner by Hachi's behavior, while contrasting the denial of any bond by the grieving?? wife(she came back first to see her lasting Theater legacy before other family remembrances). I agree the modern day setting makes the story implausible, but we will forgive the national narcissism. Gere is splendid in matching the dog's facial expression. The camera work surrenders to the view by Hachi only partially. Great cure for eye dryness!!!",

The dog's co-stars are Richard Gere and Joan Allen, who are both fine, but neither really has much to do other than lean into their usual on-screen personas (him: sexy, charismatic but a little bland; her: smart, sexy & prickly).

This might sound crazy to all you people reading this but i believe that dogs know about life and death and would be able to tell if a fellow dog or a human is dead.I am quite sure that Hachiko, being clever enough to wait at the station at the same time everyday for 9 years, would be able to figure out that Ueno was dead. Then this would have given Hachiko at least CLOSURE, then he would not have to wait for 9 years\"I feel Hachi was neglected after his masters death, just left alone to fend for himself. Surely it would have been his masters wish that he was cared for after his death.It saddens me that this happened.But the loyalty and unconditional love shown by Hachi will live on forever and it was right to honour such loyalty with a statue at the very station that Hachi waited for his master to return for the entirety of his life.Hachis story will live on forever and rightly so.",

            "content": "Warning: This review is a spoiler fest, so please do not read it if you're yet to watch the film.This is a very emotional movie, it WILL break your heart. Based on a true Japanese story. Hachi is an Akita dog who is brought up by a caring music teacher. After forming a very close bond with his dog, the owner dies and we are made to endure the most depressing 30 minutes in the history of cinema. For the next 9 years, Hachi waits outside the train station for his master to return. Until he passes too.The reason I need to include spoilers is because I must express my frustration with this film. I cannot understand how the owner's family didn't make an effort to let the dog realize his master was dead. He should have been allowed to interact with the dead body. Dogs understand death by experience, they need to smell and see the body and experience it to mourn and find closure.What we had in this movie is animal torture and not for one moment do I believe this was inevitable and normal.I understand that this is what happened in the real story that the film is based on. In that case the story doesn't deserve a movie.Unfortunately in today's world we are made to be tough, objective, a bit heartless and detach ourselves from our personal memories and feelings. This movie educates us to be loyal to our feelings and memories. In that respect, I applaud the film. Of course it's no secret that this particular breed has been domesticated for their companionship and loyalty. Come a long way from wolves.But about how so much of this dog's life was needlessly and painfully wasted on an illusion, I am very upset, and it does not make for great viewing.

I will try and not spoil the film for you. The film is based on a real story which took place in Japan from 1923-1935 about a dog named Hachiko who used to wait for his master's return at the train station everyday for 9 years even after his master passed away. That's the basic plot, the rest you just have to see to actually feel the story.Just finished watching this movie yesterday and still can't get it out of my head. A feeling of sadness has engulfed me after watching this. I am at a loss for words to describe this movie as no other movie has ever touched me so deeply. I was pretty much crying and sobbing the entire second half of the film and by the time it was over, it brought me down to my knees.Richard Gere was at his usual best but the real highlight of the film was the acting of the dogs. They were incredible in how they were able to portray the range of emotions through their facial expression and body language. The music throughout the film was brilliant too and that helped in driving home the felling of sadness and loneliness that Hachi went through.I had a dog too and it brings back memories of how sad and depressed I felt for a month after he passed away. I have experienced such undying, unconditional love and loyalty from my dog too and it made this movie extra special for me. If there was ever a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life, this has to be it. This is a must see for any person with a heart and soul. I know I am a better person today after watching this and I am confident it might also have the same effect on some of you. Thanks for reading and do take care whoever you are. Love your dogs and always remember that he will always be there for you even in your darkest, loneliest hours.",

            "review_title": "Disposable Pet Takes Center Stage In Mushy, Pointless Melodrama",
            "content": "This is purportedly a movie about love and loyalty between a man an his dog, but in it they manage to show you everything you absolutely shouldn't do as a responsible pet owner. I wanted to like this movie but I was too busy cringing at the danger the dog Hachi was constantly placed in due to the neglect of his absentee owners. If you really love your pet you should watch this movie and do the exact opposite of everyone in it.Here are some thoughts I had while watching it (*spoilers ahead*):Magic puppy that just sits there being cute and doesn't pee / poop / tear up everything. In reality, raising a puppy is a lot of hard work, and it doesn't get a lot easier once they grow up. This movie will probably encourage more people who shouldn't be pet owners in the first place to go get a pure bred puppy as they make it look way too easy, meanwhile tens of thousands of dogs die unwanted and unloved in shelters. This dog runs all over town but has no collar - what, no leash laws, no mandatory rabies tag? The town I live in would never tolerate this, and for good reason as it is a very real danger to both the dog and the townsfolk. Dog runs all over streets and around active train tracks and \"loving\" owner is unalarmed. If that was my dog I'd be having a cow. Complete absence of cars, even parked ones, till near the end when son-in-law comes to pick up dog. I think this was to keep you from thinking about the dog getting hit by a car while it's roaming the streets unleashed and unattended. I couldn't stop thinking about it though. The dog is anthropomorphized to an unbelievable degree. Look, dogs don't understand complex English sentences, but that doesn't stop every character in this movie from behaving like they can. The two most grating scenes in the movie revolve around this: 1) The first time Hachi follows Gere to the train station, Gere tells the dog to go home and somehow expects the dog to know what he's saying - Gere doesn't seem to care if the dog goes home or not, as long as it leaves the train station long enough for him to get to his job on time, and 2) the sentimental speech delivered by the \"loving\" daughter to the dog right before she opens the gate and allows the dog to run away and roam the streets homeless. The zoned-out wife didn't even realize the dog escaped from the backyard, even though she just got a soft spot for it and fed it treats. Wife quits job and leaves town right after husband dies - with a daughter & grandchild living in town? What, hubby didn't have any life insurance to go with that cushy job at the university? I kind of don't believe it. Perhaps some critical setup / background scenes were cut as it makes no sense? Then again, nothing in this movie makes much sense. Magic Asian meets wife at the graveyard, completely out of the blue, like he's been standing there for ten years, flowers in hand, waiting for her to appear. Entire town seems to be aware of dog story, but entire family that owned dog is completely clueless? Relentlessly syrupy movie music telegraphing every emotion we're supposed to feel - it made me hate the sound of strings & piano (and I really like strings and piano). True story taken so far out of context and time, and given the complete Hollywood treatment to the point where it makes zero sense. Dull, uninspired plot, script, characters, acting - except for depraved indifference to Hachi, nothing really happens. Jason Alexander can't do anything but be George Costanza, why was he in this movie (or any movie for that matter)? Puppy leash removal on train tracks at end, so the whole absentee owner thing starts over again - wasn't once enough?I never thought I would say this, but even Free Willy is a better animal-centric movie than this one.",

Here the story is fictionalized by having Richard Gere play a college music professor living in the town of Bedridge, circa 1995. Arriving home at the train station one evening he meets a stray Akita puppy and, unable to get anyone to care for him, takes him home. His wife, effectively played by Joan Allen, is initially reluctant to take in a pet, but after seeing how much joy he brings to her husband, gives in, and the love story between man and dog begins to unfold.Make every effort to see this wonderful, heartfelt film on cable or by renting a DVD, if available.",

I don't know the details of the true story, but I'm pretty sure not many people do - as it happened in the 1920s in Japan. This just seems to be another example of American filmmakers trying to cash in on someone else's story.While the acting wasn't abysmal, it was pretty damn Hallmark-y. The dog- vision was a bad decision, as it didn't add anything meaningful to the already sentiment-laden mood. This mood pervaded the entire film - which had no real emotional ups or downs. Not helping matters was the monotonous, unremarkable piano theme that never paused while dog or owner was on screen.Supporting cast were typecast and dull. Several big plot holes as well.All in all very disappointing.",

Basically schoolboy Ronnie (Kevin DeCoste) has to give an oral presentation about a personal hero, his subject is his grandfather's dog, Hachik\u014d, his classmates laugh at first when he begins, but he continues and tells the story. The story flashbacks to several years earlier, in Bedridge, in suburban New York City, Ronnie's grandfather was college music/performing arts Professor Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), he catches the train to and from work every day. One day, an Akita puppy sent from Japan has escaped its cage and is lost at the train station, on a routine day Parker finds the puppy, he takes him home intending to return it to the station and find its owner the following day. Parker learns the next day that the puppy was being shipped to an unknown location, the shipping tag was lost, but he is wearing a collar with a symbol, his Japanese professor friend Ken (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) translates the symbol as saying Hachik\u014d, which means good fortune. They do not find the owner, and Parker's wife Cate (Joan Allen) does not think they should keep the puppy, now given the name Hachi, but they do keep him, and a year later the dog and Parker have become very close. Hachi refuses to do dog-like activities, like catch and fetch, one day Hachi follows Parker to the train station for work, he refuses to leave until Parker walks him home, so the dog waits patiently for Parker to return, Parker is surprised to see him there, but this becomes a daily routine. One day, Hachi waits patiently for Parker as the train arrives, he is unaware that Parker has died of a cerebral haemorrhage during a lecture in class, Hachi continues to wait in the snow for hours, until Parker's son-in-law Michael (Robbie Collier Sublett) comes to get him. Although everyone tries to tell Hachi that Parker has died, Hachi doesn't understand, so he returns to the train station, there he waits every day, hoping for the return of Parker. As time passes, Cate sells the house and Hachi is taken to live with her daughter Andy (Sarah Roemer), Michael and their baby Ronnie, however Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station, to sit in his usual spot. Andy takes Hachi back home, but sees how depressed the dog is, she lets him out to return to the station, there he waits every day, and sleeps in the rail yard every night, he is fed daily by the train station workers that knew Parker. Hachi becomes notable for waiting outside the station everyday, a journalist makes a newspaper article, Ken visits Hachi after reading the newspaper. Cate returns to town to visit Parker's grave on the tenth anniversary of his death, she meets Ken, she is stunned to find a now elderly Hachi still waiting outside the train station, overcome with grief she sits by Hachi's side, she returns home and tells now ten-year-old Ronnie all about Hachi. Meanwhile Hachi the dog continues to wait at the station, through all seasons, until his body can wait no longer, he is last seen lying in the snow, alone and still, his last vision is of Parker finally appearing and picking him up, leading him into the afterlife. Ronnie concludes on why Hachi is his hero, his class is moved by the story, with many who laughed at first holding back tears, after school he is met by his father and his own puppy, also named Hachi, Ronnie and Hachi walk down the same route where Parker and Hachi spent much of their time together. Also starring Seinfeld's Jason Alexander as Carl, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Jasjeet, Davenia McFadden as Mary Anne and Tora Hallstr\u00f6m (Lasse's daughter) as Heather. Gere is perhaps unusual casting, but is actually perfect with his time on screen as the dog's owner, Allen does well also, the other supporting stars are fine being nice people as well, but you cannot deny it is the adorable Akita dog that is the star of the show, the real dog had a statue that stands outside a train station. When you know that the story is true, about a loving relationship between a man and his dog, and then the dog showing great dedication for his owner, even after death, it makes this story so sweet, it is not too sentimental or slushy, it is tragic, but it is a wonderfully touching and heartwarming family drama based on a true story. Good!",

Richard Gere is in it and it's about a dog and I love dogs so let's watch it!\" So I watched it and by the first 10 minutes I was absolutely immersed in it. The cute moments Hachi and his master had with each other, <3 <3 <3But then Richard Gere died and my heart broke. Still I kept watching it. My mom and my older sister were with me and my mom, being utterly emotional, began to sob. My sister and I were stronger than that so we kept watching. Joan Allen moved out of her old house and we felt sad seeing Hachi upset. The dogs who played Hachi did a marvelous job. Anyway, Hachi left his master's daughter's house and began to live homeless, just to get the opportunity to visit the station and wait for his master. Alas! He never came!Now my heart began to melt. The heartbreaking moments began now. Hachi lived by himself, and despite sufferings like cold weather and hunger and thirst, he kept waiting. Who does that?Only dogs! Soon nine years passed by and Hachi grew weak and old. He was slow and suffering yet he walked almost miles just to wait for his master at the station. Who does that? Dogs!One day, Joan Allen returned to visit her husband's grave and found Hachi at the station. Now she could fathom how deeply and truly Hachi loved her husband. \"You don't have to wait for him anymore, Hachi. He's never coming back.\"This triggers a tear in me.\"Grandma, how did Grandpa find Hachi?\" \"Actually, it was Hachi who found your grandpa.\"More tears!\"I never met my grandfather, he died when I was just a little baby. But when I hear about him and Hachi, I feel like I know him. They taught me the meaning of loyalty. That you should never forget anyone that you loved. And that's why Hachi will forever be my hero.\"I hide my face to hide the tears.Then came the ending. Hachi dying and reuniting with his master. The background music perfectly matched the melancholic yet happy moment.That did it!I sobbed and sobbed and so did my sister. Never in my wildest dream did I think that a movie would make me cry. :'( :'( :'( :'(If you want to see true love in movies, don't waste your time in watching fictional craps like Fifty Shades or Remember Me. Watch this movie. I guarantee you you will definitely cry.Unless you have no heart!",

The actors/actresses did a great job, and just knowing it was based on a true story made it even more profound in my opinion.

For the next ten years, the faithful four-legged friend returns to the place of their first encounter - the local train station. The reason why and to what consequences is subject of this simple but moving story, straightforwardly told by director Hallstr\u00f6m without frills or audience manipulation. Based upon the Japanese film \"Hachiko monogatari\" about true events that took place in the early 1920s. A bronze statue of the dog can be found at Shibuya Station in Tokyo.

            "content": "I had better state first of all that I'm not particularly a dog lover, I'm more of a cat person, but I appreciate the bond that can exist between an owner and his pet. I should also say that if it wasn't for the fact the Richard Gere appears in this film I very much doubt I would have watched it. Having said that, what I saw was a very heart-warming story that will most definitely not be for everyone, but for those that can appreciate it, it's well worth a viewing. Here's a very brief summary first before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please wait outside the railway station while I write the next paragraph).Parker Wilson is a music professor at a university and he commutes by train every day. One day he finds a puppy wandering about on the platform. Unable to find anyone to claim the dog he takes it home. His wife, Cate, is not best pleased and tells him he must find the real owner soon. He puts up flyers and asks around but nobody claims the dog. He even asks Ken, a Japanese colleague about the dog. Ken tells him that he has a symbol on his collar that says 'Hachiko', which means 'eight' in Japanese. As you can guess, Hachi (for short) becomes the dog's name. As the days pass the bond grows stronger between Parker and Hachi and Cate eventually relents and allows the dog to stay. Once fully grown, every day Hachi would follow Parker to the station and then go home until the evening when he would return to wait for his master. This goes on for quite a while and Hachi becomes a bit of a celebrity amongst those that work in and around the station. But something is about to go badly wrong and this will test Hachi's devotion to his master. Of course I'm not going to tell you what that is as I really don't want to give away too much.You may be surprised to know that this film is based on a 1987 Japanese film called \"Hachiko monogatari\" by Kaneto Shind\u00f4, which is, in turn, based on a true story. There is a very nice musical score that complements the visuals perfectly and I love the occasional shots we get from the dog's point of view. Nobody does a long stare quite like Richard Gere, and he was excellent in his part as Parker Wilson here. Also worth a mention are; Joan Allen as Cate Wilson, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Ken, Sarah Roemer as Andy (their daughter), Jason Alexander, as Carl and Erick Avari as Jasjeet.Although this has the feel of a TV movie of the week, it is a very well done TV movie of the week. If anything the ninety minutes running time is a little long for the story and you begin to feel there is a little too much padding in there. But having said that I still found it a decent watch. Over all, although it is not for everyone, it did bring out some emotions in me that I rarely show and so I deem it\u0085 Recommended.My score: 7.3/10",

From the beginning to the end, you are invested in Hachi and his story.

The wife finds the dog at the end of the film, aged and still mourning his owner, she hugs him and weeps and then she too leaves(abandons ) him. Does any dog lover think that these are appropriate actions? To see this poor animal, every winter sleeping under a train in the cold/ frost and ice is very upsetting. Yes, for the emotional tug of the story it works, but totally inappropriate to treat an animal like this. If a spouse was so upset at the loss of their partner, and they wanted to haunt the railway station for the rest of their life to be linked to their lost spouse would you let them do it? To put it in human terms the animal was traumatized and needed love, care and attention. They should have taken him to the train station at the time of the professor's daily arrival and then taken him home, loved him, and made him comfortable. But these people just abandoned him.

            "content": "I was surprised at how poorly written Hachi: A Dog's tale was. This film felt like a made-for-TV Hallmark movie that was written by a 50-year-old. The dialog and many of the scenes were very cliche and stale (ex: the skunk scene), making it hard not to roll your eyes while watching. The writing was also very emotionally manipulative, using a puppy's cuteness and other overly dramatic elements to play the audience. Another one of the major issues I have with this film is the pacing. There were many story elements that I felt should have been cut, and others seemed to happen too quickly. It also did not help that the film was missing a climax. The one moment that could have been the climax of the film took place a little over halfway through and felt abrupt, which I thought was an odd choice. Really, this film should have been much shorter; maybe like a 30 minute short. That would have helped with the pacing and left more of an emotional impact.If you look past the stale writing, the technical aspects of the film are good. I really enjoyed some of the cinematography and visual choices that were made. I particularly enjoyed that all of the Hachi point of view shots were in black and white. This helped distinguish the dog's perspective, allowing the audience to understand Hachi's emotions better. Another aspect of the film I thought was done exceptionally well was the score. The composer's usage Japanese influences and the piano made for a very beautiful and captivating score.Overall, I have mixed feelings about the film. On one hand, the dog is very cute and fun to watch at times, but on the other hand, the film is rather depressing poorly written. For these reasons, I don't think I would recommend this film.The Good\nNice ScoreCute DogSome nice cinematographyThe Bad\nThe writingthe pacingEmotionally manipulativeCliche dialog and scenes",

Dogs, unlike humans, do not misconstrue love for the need for gifts, flowers and chocolates but recognise it as what it truly is; complete appreciation between two people, or of course any two animals. As the story is real it shows the unbreakable bond that love is. When Cate saw Hachi still waiting I exploded into uncontrollable tears, which continued until well after the movie ended. It demonstrated that although Hachi waited every day that Cate was also devoted as she still also felt that longing for her lost husband and made me empathise with the fact that, although Cate had moved on in her life, it was merely because of the different depth of understanding and responsibility between herself and the dog. Nevertheless, this is very much about the bond between Hachi and Parker, and the undying hope of a dog for him to return. Heartbreaking. 10 stars",

            "content": "This is a wonderful film. Yes, it is rated G, but it is a G with a lot of substance. If you have ever had a dog before, and know what it is to have love for a dog, it will certainly bring back memories, and thoughts, as it did for me. It is a bit of a tear jerker, I almost had tears, and my girl friend certainly did. Other people elsewhere have written how they were very moved. I could not understand how someone seeing this film would not be moved.The film I believe did not have much of a release in the US, and appears to me now to be discovered on DVD in the US, appearing to have had more of a release in England and Japan, am I wrong? Had the film been widely seen, I believe that lot of people would probably want to be visiting the locations of the film in Road Island. The photography of the film is really first rate. Their are wonderful performances, Richard Gere is very believable as a dance and music teacher, and it is real nice to see Cary Togawa in a film (a very much underused talent I think, I remember seeing him in a film with Ali McGraw that took place in Thailand, and how his performance really made what would have been a dismal film more interesting). A must see film.My second review is not about the film, but about some of the critical paid reviewers who have slammed this movie. They appear to be primarily from Great Britain, and I don't mean to insult the British, as many of the readers of these reviews in Britain have slammed the Critics who just have to hate this movie. I thought I was cynical, but at least I have some heart, what do some of these reviewers have. They just can't believe that Richard Gere could do this film, but for goodness sakes, he is an actor. See the film first, and then go read the reviews that you can find from some of these \"so called movie experts\", either hear at IMDb, or at Mrqe.com, simpily amazing.Finally I do have a quibble with the film. The film for me somewhat gets hurt when you realize that this film is really not the true story. The real story, as the film in the end lets us know, took place in Japan from 1923 to 1934, not in the recent years in the US. Kaneto Shindo, the screenwriter and director of that version made in 1987 is credited in this film. We in the US, have not had access to that film. Perhaps the Gere produced film will be shown to be the superior film, perhaps not. I have never known a film to be made, which is based on something that did happen, but has been moved to a different locale. Some who have seen the original Japanese film have had some criticism, preferring the Japanese version. I believe it was the trailer for the film, that said it was based on a true story, but never have I known to have a film based on a true story to have its locale changed. Gere's produced film somewhat become disingenuous. While I have been moved by the film I have just seen, I am also bothered because of what I know. I wonder what they have thought in Japan.Perhaps Gere's produced will spark interest in people to see the Shindo 87 film, and get a wider release outside of Japan. Had the film made in 87 been released in the US earlier, would the Gere's film have been made? I would suggest that it would not have been. I wonder how well this film, so much loved by people now, will be viewed in the future. I have difficulties in expressing my disappointment in what the producers of Gere's film did, perhaps anyone who reads my thoughts here will understand my feelings, and have some similar disappointment. I guess one could say, I have seen a wonderful film with Richard Gere, yet feel somewhat like I have been had.",

I loved how when they showed scenes through the dog's point of view that they made it black and white...if you don't already know dogs are color blind. It made the movie more realistic which is another reason why I loved the movie, they didn't add any out of this world plots and made it more down to earth and real. This movie made me cry, more than once too. I would have to say that my favorite part in the movie was when the dog and Richard Gear where watching baseball and eating popcorn together I thought that was really cute! I also loved the scene when the mom was coming through the train station and saw Hachi waiting at the train station and asked if she could wait with him...ya that made me cry lolThis is must see movie for everyone not just kids!",

But the visualization is simply wonderful.You don't get to see much of \"my dog does the same\" acts like in Marley and Me , but its about one very special dog, well portrayed and beautifully scripted.Movie is extremely emotional and if you are weak you will most likely need lots of tissues.I could not see the the real star of the movie 's name roll in the credits except for the BOONE's animals for Hollywood. Background score is pretty repetitive although it just manages to do justice to the movie.Richard Gere's performance is neat, the rest of the cast put up a just above mediocre act.Hachiko is brilliant although his part of the script does not involve too much tricks other than waiting in the station.Overall .. Great movie... must watch for all dog lovers and even if not this movie can convert you into being one..",

With the station closing for the night, he has no option than to take the dog home for the night. However, Hachiko - a beautiful Akita dog - turns out to be incredibly loyal to Parker, and he ends up keeping the dog.'Hachiko' is a film that is bound to steal your heart. It is a beautiful story of love, friendship, companionship, and undying loyalty - proving once again dogs are indeed Man's best friend. The Akita dog is just the most precious, adorable dog you'll ever see!I enjoyed the way they moved the story along really quick. Gere is great as Parker, with a special bond between him and the Akita. 'Hachiko' gets me teary eyed every single time, no matter how many times I've already seen it. Maybe its the loyalty aspect. Maybe its because I love dogs. Maybe its because the dog is so darn cute! Or maybe director Lasse Hallstrom just managed to create a stunningly beautiful cinematic masterpiece.

We all know he's going to keep the dog, I don't feel remotely related with him and/or his family. I want to see Hachi's life (without the creepy shots of him looking at the bedroom). I also think there's maybe too much music, although it's a good one. The bottom line is I think it should have been shorter and keep the humans for specific moments. The reunion of Joan Allen's character with Hachi is one of the greatest moment of the movies. And what about the ending? It's TOO Disney for me. I want to embrace the sadness of the real life story. I want to keep that with me, not thinking there's another hachi there. There was just one and that made him special. I really would like to see the original movie, I bet the famous faces are less distracting and they focus on the story and in producing emotions, not putting them all out there for the ones who have a hard time understanding the subtlety.",

I agree with all other reviewers that you will need Kleenex nearby, especially towards the end. Although I knew ahead what the storyline was all about, I didn't quite expect it to be that emotional. I'm not a dog movie fan; actually I can't even say I'm a dog lover either. Yes I like them, and when friends visit with their dogs, I have no problems, but not enough to own one myself.

            "content": "Hachiko, a Japanese Akita dog, is the hero of the film Hachi: A Dog's Tale directed by Lasse Hallstrom, yet he has no super powers, cannot talk and act like a human being, and doesn't even care to \"fetch.\" He is just being a dog but he is a special breed, strong, independent, and wary of strangers, one that is noted for gentleness and affectionate loyalty with family members. The film, based on a true incident, was the subject of the 1987 Japanese film, Hachiko Monogatari in which Hachiko, born in 1923, was owned by Professor Hidesabur\u014d Ueno who lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a Tokyo suburb and commuted to work every day on the train.Hachik\u014d accompanied his master to and from the station each day and waited every evening at the station for him to return from work. Today a bronze statue of the Akita can be seen at the same station. The American version, which went straight to DVD after a showing at the Seattle Film Festival, stars Richard Gere as Parker Wilson and Joan Allen as his wife Cate, the caregivers who develop a long term loving relationship with the Akita they name Hachi after a Japanese symbol left on his collar. Parker, a music professor who commutes each day by train to the university, finds the pup (or he finds Parker) at a train station in a small town in Rhode Island after the dog breaks out of the shipping crate that was bringing him to the U.S. from a monastery in Japan.Parker is drawn to the adorable little pup but, knowing that his wife is opposed to having a pet, plans to give him away. He puts posters around the town and talks to the local pound but when the dog is not claimed, he convinces Cate to keep him. Parker's day consists of rehearsing his students in a ballet and giving lectures on different composers but he looks forward to stepping off the train each day at two minutes after five to be greeted by the friendly train conductor (Jason Alexander) and by Hachi who waits lovingly for his master.Wilson attempts to teach Hachi to retrieve a tennis ball in the yard but Hachi is not into it even though the professor sticks the ball in his own mouth and runs around the yard as he is observed by his wife and daughter, Andy (Sarah Roemer). As the years pass and Hachi becomes a fully grown Akita, he develops a friendship with the hot dog vendor Shabir (Erick Avari) at the train station and the librarian Mary Anne (Davenia McFadden), while he continues to wait day after day for his master to come off the train at the appointed hour.Hachi: A Dog's Tale can undoubtedly be classified as a tear-jerker but no classification is really needed. Though many will be in tears at the end, it is not through audience manipulation but through the ups and downs of a genuine relationship that sadly cannot go on forever. It is admittedly a rather slight story and perhaps one that is stretched to its limit to fill its hour and a half, but it is a sweet and touching story of loyalty that you may want to see many times. You might even give your dog a big hug or think about owning one if you don't already.",

Richard Gere might not be the first actor you'd cast in a slushy animal saga but he's actually just right for the role, as director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m is determined not to milk the story for cheap sentiment. After a slightly wobbly prologue illustrating Hachi's unlikely journey from rural Japan to commuter-belt America, the film takes its time in showing how this four-legged akita puppy becomes an essential part of the household of Gere and his sceptical spouse Joan Allen.The following part of the film describes some very lovely,naughty and some sad moments which involve the dog soming to station every day waiting for his deceased owner to arrive and go to their home while playing with him.But the film certainly is affecting, especially when we learn of its inspiration in Tokyo and the exploits of the real Hachiko.",

This is a story of companionship and identity...or at least, it wants to be.Unfortunately, the movie never takes flight. No character is explored at any level deeper than that which a young child would understand. While a tremendous amount of talent was assembled to encircle the gorgeous Akita (the dog is very much the star of the movie,) with such flimsy roles, no great characters are born. And in the case of Joan Allen, a somewhat forced performance gives way to a rather unbelievable character.But it is the pacing which most cripples the film. At least a dozen slow fade blackouts exaggerate the emotional side of the film, thus, lessening the impact. The passage of time is portrayed very poorly, with nearly 15 years passing and few physical alterations made in any human character.Still, the story is profound enough to carry it as a quality holiday flick. And if you are a sucker for animals, this one will play right into your wheelhouse.Neither a particularly skillfully made or daring movie, Hatchiko's got its dog going for it and not too much else.5 out of 10",

I'm so glad Richard Gere brought a normal caring man/dog personality to the screen. As most of us act like this around our pets as they're definitely one of the family.I could tell this was going to be a sad film after the first 10 minutes. Literally I felt like every 10 minutes I kept saying \"aah bless him\" with how he was. The dogs facial expressions were so real also. Anyway I loved the close knit community vibe and the early bonding of Gere & Hachi.Going into the second half, omg this really isn't a film you can watch outside of your home. It's devastatingly sad. I was crying as I was eating and as soon as you see Parker's wife see the dog after 10 years I was sobbing hard. Why did they never consider a dog has feelings too? Why not let Hachi visit Parker's grave? They could see he was deeply grieving. The daughter gave Hachi a choice, but still check on him once in a while poor thing. My heart was just dying. Someone please just care for this dog...could Mrs Wilson literally not wait a few more years to move (at least until after Hachi died). I could go on. After seeing him after all those years, don't just leave him and go home!When you saw the food vendor guy start weeping set me off again. This movie is painful to watch. You could never watch it twice but it's nice to keep it in my collection.When you see Hachi and his sad face before he dies too. On his own with no one caring for him. Just writing this I'm getting upset. Someone else pointed out that 9/10 years is so freaking long omg. He came out in all weathers. Why couldn't someone ANYONE just take him to his master's grave so he got closure?Anyway it's a great movie. And it does sum up a dog's love for his owner BEFORE anything else like relationship love, family love etc etc. This film was about how much Hachi loved his master and was willing to sacrifice his whole life for.

Slow but sure, every scenes in the film just step by step wins everybody's hearts and make them feel genuinely warm (even when they watch it during the middle of a winter) and peaceful.It's a must-see and I'm sure that you will probably register for an account (if you don't have an account yet) then immediately write a reviews for this film.",

For the first two acts its led by Gere and then for obvious reasons the dog takes over. No one will remember it as such but for the most part it's a light hearted amusing movie. Almost every scene has the same intention-to show Hachi's devotion and bond to his master. This does leave it a bit repetitive and going in circles but Lasse Hallstrom handles it with enough charm and style to allow the film to progress. This same fault starts to apear again once Hachi begins his wait, but at least this time the film has the other task of building the emotion of it. And without doubt this movie should have ended at the last scene in the station and that tag on with the kid puts this in the mix of most squandered endings.Can the story of Hachi be a compelling movie? Despite its weaknesses, this film will show you how it can.",

The way their relationship builds up is full of emotion and happiness, the dog's cuteness and overall attitude playing a very important role here. The human actors also do a very good job in impersonating their characters which manage to generate plenty of emotion and love with every chance they get.The movie manages to create such an unique atmosphere that it simply transports the viewer into its world, making him feel what the characters are feeling, making him empathize with the characters. Although maintaining a slow pace all the way, it doesn't let the viewer get bored at any single moment. It has this gift of keeping one's attention, making him care about the situations and the characters. But, as we get past the first half of the movie, drama starts building up, replacing the happiness with sorrow and grief. The amount of it is simply impossible to explain using mere words. It was so tragic that I was hardly able to control my tears as they seemed more and more inevitable.It very hard to explain how this movie made me feel, how it was able to put a smile on my face but also generate so much sadness to make me cry. Everything seems so well thought, so well put into picture that it simply is an unique experience which you have to live it in order to fully understand its depth.

It's a matter of a dog and its owner loving one another, lovely, but not engaging. Then there is the change in pace, and really it's not a very nice watch. The film is just horribly sad, the sentiment pulls at everyone's heartstrings. My girlfriend was in floods of tears for the majority of the film, because you feel so much for the dog, but something so enduringly sad can't be a perfect film can it?Evoking so much emotion means you cannot give it a terrible score, but without a story to truly follow it cannot be a brilliant film either.

I don't know why Richard Gere has lost his appeal but he's not a believable lead here. Joan Allen is fine as always.

            "review_title": "An immortal example of loyalty or One of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema",
            "content": "Drama. American \"rethinking\" of the Japanese painting \"The Story of Hachiko\" of 1987, which in turn is based on real events. And again, the Russian distributors decided to turn on unnecessary fantasy, and called the picture \"Hachiko: The Most Loyal Friend\", although the original name is translated as \"Hati: The Story of a Dog\", but oh well. The first time I saw this picture in the thirteenth year, when I was at university, gnawed at the granite of science, so to speak, and came to work (I studied in absentia), but there was no one there, it was on Sunday, there was nothing to do, and I decided to see this film - and cried out a bucket of tears, and I could not forget it. Even then, I gave this picture the highest mark. Oh yes, I did not see the original Japanese painting, so I will judge it as an independent work. After the first viewing, I avoided reviewing this picture for a long time, because I knew that it would not do without emotions, and only recently decided to review it - and again my handkerchief was wet, and again a bucket of tears. And here's my brief opinion - one of the most tear-squeezing films in the history of cinema. This time I tried to look at the picture carefully, trying not to miss a single detail, but to my regret, I did not find any flaws in this picture, but the dignity still creeps out, and I turn to them immediately.\nSo, here they are:\n1.Dramatic and touching story - the picture tells the story of Hachiko (whom everyone calls Hachi in the picture), an Akita Inu dog who got lost at the train station until he was picked up by an American professor, which became the reason for an incredible and strong friendship between them. Every day, Hachiko accompanied his master to the station and met him. This was until the owner died, but Hachiko continued to go to the station for many years and meet his master. The most famous example of selfless loyalty, they even erected a monument to him in Japan, and lovers make dates near him. The script is measured, simple and straightforward. Although I am a cat lover, dogs have one thing that makes them very different from my purring favorites - loyalty. The ending of the picture turned out to be very powerful, on the one hand, the most terrible and most breaking heart was not shown to us, on the other hand, they honored the memory of the real Hachiko, who deserved his place in the pantheon of heroes. He has a lot to learn.\n2. Emotions - well, where can we go without it. Not a single viewing of this picture is complete without ammonia and several dozen scarves, because you will roar in any case, even if you think the opposite. I myself thought I would hold back, but I was wrong. Live and learn, as they say. There is a lot of drama here, and there are even more touching moments.\n3. Humor - even in such a serious and dramatic story, the writers added a little humor that fits perfectly here. Here he is unobtrusive, filled with everyday affairs and causes both a slight smile and a short laugh, which dilutes the colossal drama on which the script is based.\n4. The tone of the picture is measured, unhurried, with a touch of light melancholy against which the story unfolds. The tone does not drive you into melancholy, because sometimes it can seem stringy.\n5. Music - composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek did a good job, giving the lion's share of piano or piano music, which I love very much, because without such music, Hachiko's story would have looked less dramatic. Indeed, in the most touching and heartbreaking moments, it is music that contributes to active tears. I do not recommend listening to these musical compositions separately, because otherwise the very moments will pop up before your eyes that will make you literally cry, even if you are an adult man who has gone through the war.\nA little about the main characters:\n1.Parker Wilson performed by Richard Gere is a professor who has become an unwitting master of Hachiko, a kind and strong-willed person, as well as a loving husband and caring father. In short - an example to follow, the role of which was played by the famous Richard Gere. With the selection of the actor, they obviously did not lose, because Richard just perfectly got into the character. Bravo!\n2. Kate Wilson performed by Joanne Allen - the wife of the professor, who was downloaded against Hachiko, but gradually, seeing her husband's affection for the dog, gives way. She manifests herself as a loving wife and caring mother who was able to love Hachiko, with his selfless devotion to her husband. Joanne quite successfully coped with the role, here without pretensions.\n3. Chiko, Laila and Forrest performed by Hachiko - you are not crazy, three dogs played the famous Hachiko, and I can't even imagine how much effort it took to train them, because dogs of this breed are special, they are very attached to their owners, and my humble opinion - the dogs did it.\nOf course, the habit of Americans to shoot \"rethinks\" of successful foreign films infuriates a little. They just do not like to watch foreign films, and the producers create \"rethinks\" with the obligatory transfer of the main action to America. To me this approach seems strange and even absurd, but we will regret the \"beacons of democracy\".\nAt the moment, I consider this masterpiece the most tear-squeezing in history, but I have not watched the original Japanese picture and have not even had time to check out White Bim Black Ear by the excellent Soviet director Stanislav Rostotsky, where the main role was played by the wonderful old school actor Vyacheslav Vasilyevich Tikhonov, therefore and put the mark \"one of the best\".\nAs a result, we have an excellent drama about Hachiko's selfless feat, with an excellent script, great music, a strong emotional component and great acting.",

I miss my dog, my Shawny, so much even 15 years after she passed away. This movie is for dog lovers everywhere and movie lovers.

Now I just watched it for the second time...The film delivers on its story, but it feels like emotional blackmail from the start with a string-based soundtrack and a melancholic piano that never stops playing, leaving little room for surprise. Actually, the film could have had more cheerful tones, especially in the best sequences between Hachi and Parker, but unfortunately the piano did not cease its tireless purpose of provoking a forced feeling of tenderness, making everything already seem like a memory.Apart from this great detail, the film develops in a normal way, at a decent and average level in all its aspects. The central figure is a dog that demonstrates a strong bond with its master, whose life continues with relatively normal events, almost monotonous for a large part of the footage, until the big event occurs. Until this point, I see a lot of austerity in terms of the quantity and quality of the director's work. There are the right and precise scenes to develop the story, but there is zero attempt to make a more complete and innovative cinematic experience.The film continues down the stretch showing Hachi's famous feat, in a very limited way. The movie is decently made, but it settles for very little. It lacks ambition, a better emotional construction and a better sense of good cinema.",

I enjoyed the film.However I feel that the story was flawed by the fact it was clearly written by someone who has never owned a dog or even liked dogs.This is shown at several points in the movie where those who supposedly have en emotional bond with 'Hachi' do things that no genuine dog lover could ever bring themselves to do. (spoilers follow) If a dog is truly a part of someone's family they won't keep it locked up in a shed at the bottom of the garden; They won't open the garden gate and tell the dog it can run away from home if it wants to; If they encounter the dog in the street once it has strayed they won't simply pat it on the head then leave it there.I don't mind the fact that the story was switched from Japan to America. But I think it would have been better to stick much closer to the true story. This would have made the movie even more heartbreaking and poignant. It would also have inspired those who saw it to be kinder to dogs rather than condoning bad behaviour towards them.",

If you've ever had a dog, wanted a dog or just like dogs in general, this is a must watch.Without giving the story away...the premise behind the movie is about the loyalty that exists between a man and his dog even beyond life in the physical world. It's proof that love never dies and that animals...dogs in particular...have the uncanny ability to just feel and love without boundaries, logic or reason. They just do and once they're loyal to you, they'll love you forever.Interestingly enough, this movie was based on a true story...which makes it even more amazing. Richard Gere was wonderful in his role and Jason Alexander played a great supporting role and the dog deserves an Oscar. Who knew dogs could act so convincingly? You can actually see the thoughts and emotions in the dog's expressions, and what a gorgeous dog it was. I had never given much thought to Akitas before, but I'm deeply impressed!

A professor in Japan in the 1920s discovered a Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopted him. One day, the man had a heart attack at work and died. The dog, named Hachiko never figured this out, and waited for his master to return every day for 10 years.Replace Japan with northern Maine, the 1920s with the 1990s, and add Richard Gere, and you have Hachi.Prof. Parker Wilson (Gere) discovers an Akita puppy at his local train station, and adopts him. His wife Cate, is not exactly keen to the idea of having a dog, but Parker's daughter falls madly in love with this sweet puppy. Through learning more about Akitas through his Japanese friend (Akitas are a Japanese dog breed), Parker and Hachi form a wonderful bond. Then, unexpectedly, Parker, a music professor, has a heart attack while he's teaching, and dies. Hachi never figures this out, and, so every day for 10 years, Hachi makes the trek to the local train station to wait for his master, who he believes will one day return.

Fact that this is a true story based movie, only made my experience far more deeper than I originally thought it would be. Yes, family of the professor could take this dog, keep him warm, give him home, or at least let him go every day on station to wait for his master and return him back home.

I didn't heartily weep what I had or slipped or not even for favors. Nothing can break this locked door but I guess now it is unlocked a little for peek may be. Today I cried like baby, tried hours to hide from my room-partner but at last he came & told me, \"It's OK to watch hachi with wet eyes!\" Cry \u0085not because of another fight or break up\u0085any human effort but because of sense and gravity of loyalty.\"Loyalty does not need any compulsion but devotion\". We are human, we are best breed or creation of God\u0085But this word 'loyalty' usually we didn't get from humans. I got it from \"Hachi A Dog's Story\" is really heart touching, ice-breaking and in real means of loyalty. I really salute Hachi because of Hachi now I also want a dog like Hachi but it's great if didn't get but if I get that's means it's a miracle. I don't know that much loyalty came from his heredity or what. Nine years' of waiting what kind of love is that? Even a smart dog can tell that no one will come after waiting 24-48hr. Don't you think that he was dumb\u0085? No, he is more than that.I also tried long distance relationship so I kind of knew that keep waiting and waiting without any response in real. It looks like dumb specially when you are not there to feel or ever felt it before\u0085but this waiting part is became hard, harder and hardest with long due process of time. Some left broke but unique one died not because they were miserable but one of strongest one who can stop killing himself and make it own allies to remember its love for one who they really loved or still loving or catch a sense of love with dark-bright faces.The golden question of life is-\" where is the Challenge?\"If I apply Golden question of mine here \u0085Where is the challenge?To leave and go to next owner even she's a daughter of his real owner or to wait him after his death even if I knew that my owner will not even he wants to.

Late in 2007 she was asked to take her litter of four puppies to RI to be used in making the movie. She scheduled a week's vacation but heard nothing more. Eventually she learned that the initial director had quit and filming was delayed. I think it turned out to be fortuitous because they got Hallstrom to replace the initial director. But by the time they resumed filming my wife's puppies were no longer puppies so she didn't get to go to RI. Still it's great seeing the puppies they did use in the film. My wife only watched our DVD until the professor died but no further. She's a nurse and can handle it when a person dies but loses it when a dog dies.In filming scenes from the dog's point-of-view they shot mostly in black & white just as a dog would see it. Nice touch but not mentioned anywhere that I found. I also had Amazon send a Hachi DVD to my son Frank in Colorado Springs. Not only does he have an Akita but he visited Hachiko's statue in Japan and rubbed its nose. He says it's worn smooth.",

It was death and withering! Also, I don't know if it was just a bad script or the influence of Hachi, but every time someone got close to him, they got really really frantic, started to call his name again and again and again, saying random phrases like, lets go, good dog, come on! etc...

            "content": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a 2009 English drama film. Based on the true story of a faithful Akita Inu, the titular Hachiko, it is directed by Lasse Hallstrom, written by Stephen P. Lindsey and Kaneto Shindo, and stars Richard Gere, Joan Allen and Sarah Roemer. The film is a remake of the 1987 Japanese film Hachiko Monogatari.\n\"A Dog's Tale\" is based on a true story of the love and devotion between a man and a dog.The story is told by Ronnie who is the man's grandson. When Ronnie has to give a presentation at school about a personal hero, he chooses to tell the story of his grandfather's dog Shasta unnu (\"Hachi\" for short). Despite his classmates laughing, Ronnie describes how his grandfather, Professor Parker Wilson, finds a lost puppy which had been freighted to the United States from Japan but was accidentally left at the train station of the professor's small hometown. The professor ends up taking the puppy home, planning to search out its intended destination and send it on to its rightful owner. However the puppy's owner cannot be found and Parker and the puppy begin to form a close bond. Although Parker's wife, Cate, is opposed to keeping the puppy she eventually relents after realising the bond between Parker and Hachi.Over the next year or so Parker and Hachi become even closer. Parker tries to train Hachi, a Japanese breed of dog called an Akita, but the dog refuses to do normal dog things like chasing and fetching. One morning Parker leaves for work and Hachi follows him to the train station and refuses to leave without his master causing Parker to abandon the train to take the dog home. The next day Hachi follows Parker again who this time gets on the train. When Parker returns to the train station after work he is surprised to find Hachi waiting for him. Hachi learns what time that Parker will be due home every day and constantly goes to the station to wait for him at 5:00pm, quickly becoming their new daily routine.One winter's day, Parker suffers a fatal and unexpected brain hemorrhage while at work and thus never returns home on the train as usual. Hachi, waiting in his usual place for Parker as the train pulls up, doesn't see his master disembark, and instead patiently waits and waits for hours even as it starts snowing. Eventually Parker's son-in-law, Michael, comes to get him. Although everyone tries to make Hachi understand that Parker has gone, Hachi is apparently unable to accept that his master won't be coming home. Instead he returns to the train station each day and continues to wait.As time passes, Cate sells the house and moves away. Hachi is sent to live with Parker and Cate's daughter Andy, her husband Michael, and their baby Ronnie. However Hachi escapes and finds his way back to the station. There he sits at his usual spot. Andy arrives and takes him home but soon realises how sad the dog is, especially as he even refuses to eat. It breaks her heart but she slowly opens the gate knowing Hachi will return to the station. Each and every day Hachi waits for his best friend. As night falls, he sleeps in the rail yard. The hot dog seller, Jasjeet who knew the professor well, becomes fond of Hachi and provides him with food and water on a daily basis.On the tenth anniversary of Parker's death, Cate returns to the small township to visit her late husband's grave. She is stunned to see a now very elderly Hachi still waiting at the station. Overcome with grief Cate sits and waits for the next train with him. At home, Cate tells the now ten-year-old Ronnie about Hachi. Meanwhile the ever-faithful dog continues waiting until one day he is seen laying very still in the snow, comforted by a vision of Parker who appears and lovingly beckoning the dog to come to him.Ronnie concludes his story of why Hachi will always be his hero. Some of the students are close to tears - even those who had laughed at the beginning. After school Ronnie is met by his dad and a new puppy which they've also named Hachi. The film ends with Ronnie and the puppy walking down the same tracks where Parker and the original Hachi had met so long ago.The film ends with the true story of Hachiko. He was the pet of Professor Ueno. After Ueno's death in 1925, Hachiko waited for his master for nine years at the Shibuya station. A bronze statue was erected in his honour at the Shibuya station.(Plot from Wikipedia, because I did not watch this movie:)\nAbout the plot of Hachiko I know only from the lips of my friends and also social sites. So I was very interested in this film firstly and started to watch with my friend, after 20 min we became very bored, so just cannot watch it till the end.\nSo to sum up, It all depends on the person and his interest in something, but for me it was very drearily.Madina(11 B)\nBased on the true story of a loyal dog who stole the hearts of an entire nation, Hachiko: A Dog's Story is the Americanized version of an endearing Japanese legend. The film is directed by a Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, who is known for such small but significant films as Chocolat, The Cider House Rules, and The Shipping News. Richard Gere stars as Professor Parker Wilson, an American counterpart to Professor Ueno, with Joan Allen in the role of his wife Cate.Set in the past century ,the action takes place in northeastern U.S,production design by Chad Detwiller, art direction by Jordan Jacobs, and set decoration by Gretchen Schlottman have masterfully created the sense and feel of old Japan with western-style architecture. The plot revolves around Chu-ken Hachiko, which means \"loyal little dog Hachi,\" who had arrived in Tokyo in 1924 with his master, Professor Eisaburo Ueno, who had taken a position at the Imperial University. Still just a pup, Hachiko accompanied his master to Shibuya Station each morning, where the professor boarded the train that would take him to the university. Each afternoon at three p.m., Professor Ueno would find Hachiko in the same spot at Shibuya Station, anxiously awaiting his return.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the story of great love and respect between a college professor and the puppy he rescues on a snowy night. It's a very gentle film that quickly engages the audience as it introduces a heroic dog, a man with a loving heart, and an idyllic setting. That engagement intensifies emotions, which later carry the story through the years to its bittersweet conclusion. A bonus is the superb soundtrack \"Goodbye\" that accomplishes the film and makes the viewer to burst into tears.This film is a masterpiece that encompasses pure friendship between human and animal, love and heart-touching stories. The film is suitable for all ages.",

The young boy seems so proud to tell the story, when in my opinion he and family should be ashamed. Hachi is rewarded for his loyalty to his master by being abandoned. I understand that Hachi was stubbornly loyal, this does not mean he deserved to die alone, after spending the last 8-9 years alone each night under a train.

The legend itself is so famed there is a much frequented statue at Shibuya station of Hachiko, which has becomes the famed meeting spot for Tokyoites out on the town. I've been to this spot many times in the center of Tokyo and such is the popularity of the exit that exit 8 is now named Hachiko exit (exit 8). It's a great story and when hearing it it does encapsulate the bond between man and animal.Now to Hachi: A dogs tale, the Richard Gere movie set ina small town in America which follows the same story. The first question is, why America? It's a quintessential Japanese tale which has its own movie, tv show and statue dedicated to it, so to repackage it as an American tale seems a little unnecessary, but, so it goes. Then to my next point, not much is dedicated to actually telling the story of Hachiko and his master, we don't see much beyond the daily walks, sure we can infer that the two have a bond, but the story unfolds very literally, with time just passing and dog and man in hot step with one another, I'm sure dog owners will tell me that is all you need to form a bond with an animal, but it makes for god awful story telling. Finally, there is the overall glibness of it all. No one can argue that the story itself is not teething with melancholy, but this seems to wallow in the sadossphere before events have even begun, with a score that constantly screams foreboding and lost, single of keys on a piano and a violin constantly trying to make you feel invested in a story, about a real story.Sometimes I despair at IMDB for its wild variations in rankings, with those in one camp going 10 and those on the other giving a 1. Well for once I sympathize with those on the other scale. This movie makes me want to give the 1 score just to balance out the meter, because it is ranked so high on IMDb that it found its way on the 250 list...But I digress, I give the scores it deserves, somewhere between a 5-6 and if I had a dog it may go to a 7, but in truth, 1 is not totally inappropriate.",

At this point in the movie, the gentle playful music, coupled with Gere's performance was well done, and I though that the movie would go on from there. Realistically however, there wasn't much plot to go on from this point.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is definitely worth a watch, I'm sure that many people would enjoy this movie, however I found the pace a little slow. The plot is good - however as a film, its quite limited. This movie does however have a very good ending (magnificently done) and it does have its moments in which the audience was captured.I would actually like to see a Japanese, Asian produced movie of this, as in the original, it worked well. The background, Tokyo, would also add a nice touch to this film. The highlights of this film include the interaction between Hachi and his owner, Parker. Overall, this film wasn't bad, but it wasn't excellent either, 7/10.",

No one notices in the crowd, and the puppy gets out. He then is discovered by traveler Richard Gere as Parker Wilson, who is a professor of music. He commutes daily by train.Parker doesn't want the puppy, we soon find out that they apparently recently had one die, and had agreed not to get another. But with no place else to put the puppy overnight, Hachi was brought home.Always good Joan Allen is Parker's wife, Cate Wilson. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is his good friend and fellow professor, Ken. And Jason Alexander is the train station supervisor, Carl. This is a fine story about the relationship between a man and his dog. Richard Gere is superb as he usually is in this sort of role.",

Be sure to carry a towel, for your tears aren't going to stop even after the movie ends. It will leave you with a sense of detachment from pets, friends, and family members, you have lost in your life, and with a strong feeling to get a new pet dog.Based on a true story, the movie makes you wanna walk into the screen, pet Hachiko on the head, hug and caress him, and sit with him everyday at the station.And, please make sure you do not watch the movie alone, because that would be the most devastating experience ever.",

            "content": "I am struck deeply by the tale of Hachiko. Yes... My ID here on IMDb is based upon the story of Hachiko -- But let me be clear -- it is NOT based upon this film. I have reviewed many films prior to reviewing this one, here on IMDb, using my \"Hachi Ko\" ID. I feel that I can review this film objectively.First of all, after reading all of the accounts of the Real story of Hachiko, I can confidently say that this film is a decent story in its own right, but it is a Very Loose interpretation of the tale of the real Hachiko. It is, for all practical purposes, a Work of Fiction.\"Hachi\", the film, barely works as a 1.5-hour film. I did enjoy watching it, but it's not worth a second look. The film is essentially a 1.5-hour melodrama that appears to have the sole purpose of making dog-lovers cry. There is very little in the way of a real plot in this film. The same instrumental music playing over and over and over again throughout the entire film doesn't help.With that said, I'm not going to pretend that I know how the film could have been better. Most likely, it probably just wasn't a good film story to begin with, and should have just been left alone.Basically, an empty-nest guy stumbles upon a dog, and falls in love with the dog, which also falls in love with him. The guy's wife gets jealous of the dog, but before that jealousy can become a serious plot issue, the guy suddenly dies of a freak aneurysm. Then, the dog waits for him at the train station for several years, until the dog finally dies. I'm not trying to make fun of the story. My point is that there is only so much that you can do with that information. Just getting this film to 90 minutes was a stretch. This story was better left on paper.A few points that were brought up regarding flaws in the plot, by some of those who commented earlier:1) 'The dog only went back to the station for the food that the station vendors were giving him.' Actually, in the true story, in Japan, the vendors initially hated the dog and shooed him away for awhile. Eventually, however, they began to respect the dog's loyalty, and began feeding him.2) 'In the film, no one in the family seemed to realize that when the dog disappeared, he was waiting at the train station.' Well, the guy's wife was the only one in the family who would have known that, and she supposedly hated the dog. She certainly didn't want to go retrieve the dog, and she didn't talk about the dog with her daughter.3) As for the dog... Is it loyalty or obedience? Akita Inu are known for their \"loyalty\" and strict \"pack mentality.\" If the guy was the \"Alpha\", then the dog would have waited out of Fealty as much as out of Loyalty. Since none of us is a dog, we can't know for sure exactly which emotion drives a dog to be loyal. I have my opinions, but they are just that... Opinions.",

Puppy turns into a mature hound, every day giving his farewell to and welcoming his owner back the only way he knows how: mainly following Gere to the train station and then waiting for him to return in the evening. Richard Gere gets a heart attack and dies. The dog does not and I emphasize - does NOT get invited to his master's funeral. Dog naturally assumes that Gere will come back one day, since he had seen nothing to prove otherwise. Dog keeps waiting for Richard at the train station. Dog dies of old age. The end.The moral of this story: always invite everyone close to the deceased to the funeral, that includes pet animals. One more thing: this movie is apparently based on the real events that happened in Japan almost a hundred years ago, which goes to show that reality can be a lot dumber than fiction.",

The Japanese dog depicted in this true story has an actual monument in his honor for the impenetrable loyalty he bestowed to his master. Hachi and owner shared a mutual bond beyond description. We should all be so lucky to have unconditional love from someone, or in this case, a dog. Richard Gere was key to making sure this movie was even made as one of the producers.

Nothing ever comes so close in the simplicity of the theme. Two companions , a dog and a man, bonded beyond description. Undiluted Unadultrated Sacred Pure love and loyalty.I always had a soft corner for dogs and I tried to console myself when we gave our pet Diana away saying that this needs to be done.

Both dog and Jason Alexander (Stuckey in 'Pretty Woman') follow him around with dogged loyalty, much to the delight and surprise of their fans!Prof. Wilson (Gere) rescued a puppy at the train station as it escaped from its carrier box. Based on the true story of a dog called Hachi in Japan, who waited every day for its master return at the train station. Bang on 5.05 pm. That's where they met and that's where it would end - ten years later.Hachi had grown up to be a strong, independent dog and only learned to obey and fetch on the last day it saw its master off to work. Such is life, as fate seems to snatch away from us those we love, just when we love them most. The look on the dog's face ... like it sensed a farewell the way people do sometimes but only realise that with hindsight. That's when no amount of tears can bring them back, and ten years of sleeping by the train station only broke the dog's heart - and the town's hearts - till the day his master finally came to fetch him Home.(Great acting from the dogs and also from Erick Avari, as the Hot Dog Man who looked after Hachi. Lovely piano music played by Gere who is a gifted musician and composer, \"some things in life, you could never capture, the music, the special moments' - like when he said goodbye to his loyal dog).",

First of all did you people notice how actors in most today's movies act like wooden puppets just going around and talking random words which they do not feel AT ALL, I noticed it, and I noticed how unnatural Hollywood characters are, shallow and impossible to like... I will stick to UnAmerican movies from now on( it seems that Hollywood makes everything through very old recipes, they will make something well known to audience, they will not experiment, they just want money, they don't make films anymore)... Most people here said that this story in unbelievable , but it is very common, it is just that Japanese people appreciate every hero, even the dog... In my country there are many stories of dogs who spend their lives near the master's grave, or died the same day, and for that thing for following their masters to work and back....WELL EVEN MY CAT DOES THAT... if you are connected to your pet you could expect that... But what was really annoying was that plot hole which I noticed when Richard Gere practiced katana, and I noticed it was fishy , and then at the ending, when they said that man who owned the dog was Japanese, and everything happened in JAPAN, I got depressed, very depressed. Here there was again CHEAP Hollywood, they had to move the dog to America and Americanize everything, but that story would be impossible in America, you know why, because the law says so, no dog should be on the streets, without muzzle and so on, you people are full of laws which are taking your money away( well in my country they do the same)...anyway if we would hope your state was not full of those laws back then In 1924 ( professor used internet in the film), lets say story is possible to happen in America at that time... I get this is JUST BASED on a true story, not that it is true story, but why did they butcher so much the true story? People who made this film know nothing about dogs, and they just put one stupid scene after another to make film last longer, it was agony,farce, they made JOKE out of everything! The only one who knew how to act in a whole movie was a dog so give him Oscar, and apologize to him because you put him in one manipulative LIE/JOKE of a movie... Read about true story and see what really happened...One more thing, it is impossible to make movie out of this story, because it is too simple, and it is too beautiful, it should be passed on , but through different media... and at the end I will give this movie 4 out of 10, because I give dog 10, and to the rest I give -2...",

While it appeared to be some sort of TV MOVIE and A picture of Richard Gere on the cover suggests a family fun movie.

After all my years of watching movies I could clearly say that I had been a veteran of watching other Dog-Master type of movie/TV series that were guaranteed heart warmers like Old yeller, Littlest Hobo, Homeward Bound , Lassie (the movie) and Marley and Me which in it's own right a comedy turned tearjerker at the end that leaves one with a more endearing want and need to hug your pet Immediately. Hachiko was way beyond all that had come before. IT had me bawling my heart out like this was no movie but an actual reality unfolding before my very eyes and that I had to see for my eyes the heart wrenching scene of seeing A dog's noble dedication of waiting for his master every single day fueled by PURE love. The ending was what teared my soul into seven pieces.. An unforgettable film, and if you are not touched by this movie. you are not human.",

I'm a very animal loving person, especially the dog, my favorite little animal. Since I was a kid, I've been keeping the pet that I can't let go of. It's the lovely butterfly dog \"Meimei\".

Its not a typical Hollywood movie.

It's a wonderful sad story that leaves you heartbroken and tearful, and one cannot help but to feel the pain and sadness that Hachi felt. It leaves you wondering how a dog can have so much love and devotion when there are people out there who cant even show half the loyalty and love for each other as much as Hachi did for his master. Knowing Hachi's story I cannot help to feel wanting to be a better person and human, this movie leaves it prints in your heart/soul and is a story you will not forget. I have to say that Lasse Hallstrom did a terrific job with this movie, if not one of the best movies he has made.I give Hachi's story a ten because his story touched me deeply in a way nothing ever has. Living me wondering how unique this dog was and how loved he was and still is by us people who knows his story and devotion, and yes sometimes a dog really is a mans best friend, like Hachi. Undying love and bond for a master who did not return until the day they met again, a day Hachi waited for for ten years. Definitely a movie worth watching. Wonderful and amazing.",

I also appreciated the scenes that were shot through Hachi's eyes - watching Parker share his love with his wife and daughter, spotting Parker out of a busy crowd...so sweet. The scenes towards the end, when Hachi is old and still comes to the station every day had me bawling like a baby. Especially when Parker's wife returns and sits with him for a while. The dog that they chose to portray \"old Hachi\" with had the slow gait and sad eyes really stole my heart away. And when Hachi reunites with Parker in his dying dream - - that just got me thinking about every pet I have lost and hope to meet again someday too!! This movie is truly a beautiful representation of undying love and faithfulness and even though it made me very sad, it absolutely captures every emotion of the human spirit and that's what makes this movie so wonderful.",

It is a story about pure love, friendship and loyalty that touches you in more than a scene. Really, there is no need for a movie to be complicated to enjoy it. \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\" narrates the story of the statue of Hachiko which stands outside of Shibuya Station in Tokyo. I've always heard this story as an example for loyality, but never believed it, dunno why. Back to the movie, it is a bit slow paced, despite its short running time. Actually, I found this slow pace as an advantage, make you feel how deep the relation between the dog and its owner(friend). What deepens this feel is the soundtrack which fits the scenes perfectly-in my view. Cinematography is good too. I have nothing to add as it is so simple as I mentioned before, but one last thing; a special recognition to the dog. I wonder how he acts to be like crying(not kidding). Now, am planning to watch the original(Japanese)version, but this one is worth seeing.",

Fast-forwarding a few years, and Hachi follows Parker everywhere, one day, as Parker returns from work via train, as he does everyday, Hachi is waiting for him, and Hachi walks home with him, this continues everyday for the next few months, until one day, as Parker is working, he has a heart attack and dies...

The moment that broke me most of all is to see old Hachi walk very slowly and reach his permanent position under the abandoned train where he died.\nThis movie is the only movie that made me cry, even the toughest they have a dog will cry, an amazing film that made me experience an amazing of emotionality and real crying.\nI give him 9.5 out of 10.",

Gere, who plays a married college music professor, falls in love with the beautiful Akita and raises it from a pup. The 2 form an extremely close bond and as Hachi turns about a year old, he begins following Gere to the train station everyday to see his owner off to work and returns everyday around 6pm to greet him back home. When the dog is about 3 years old, Gere suffers a fatal heart attack at work and never returns home. Hachi stays at the train station for THE NEXT NINE YEARS, thru summer heat, winter snow and rain, eating handouts from the train station employees (one of whom is played by Jason Alexander aka George Costanza from Seinfeld) with Gere's widow, played greatly by Joan Allen, trying her best to bring the dog home over the years, but Hachi relentlessly, yes DOGGEDLY returns each day to see his master come home, each day growing sadder and sadder to not see Gere get off the train...it's heartbreaking.I won't tell you how it ends, but it is a tear-jerker all the way, even as the credits roll. It's been on Lifetime-TV at least twice a year over the last 10 years and is on Netflix and DVD. Catch it sometime with your favorite dog in your lap and be prepared to bawl your eyes out, and hug your dog a little tighter while you watch it together.",

The story is about a puppy that gets lost, only to be found by Parker Wilson played by Richard Gere and they develop a very close bond with another. Let's just say that's the happy bit of the film and watch the trailer for the sad bit. If you can watch the trailer with out sadness hitting you I suggest you get in touch with your inner emotions or just aren't human. I loves this film but watching it once is enough for me because it is just to sad to watch this one again. Definitely not a film I would buy on DVD for this reason but I don't think it really matters to Gere and he did it because it is a very emotional tale based on a true story and is a must watch, even if it is just once.",

This movie uses that real life story which makes the film entertaining enough and you'll probably get emotional at some point. But just as a movie this movie has TONS of problems. Richard Gere is good and so is the dog and as I said the true story is great but almost everything that is needed to make a great movie fall short in this movie and that's why it's hard to rate because when I judge this as a movie I can't help but give it a low rating. The cinematography is horrible. It looks like a hallmark film and the score is overbearing and saccharine. The whole tone is quite saccharine and this story in the hands of better writers and a better director didn't need to be so saccharine. I've never seen the original film but I'm interested in checking it out because it's Japanese and the original story took place in Japan and I see now reason why this version didn't. Honestly there probably is no point in this movie even existing if the original is as good as I hear but they were going to make it anyway but I see no reason why this version didn't also take place in Japan and had all Japanese actors. If you want the characters to speak English for North American audiences fine whatever, the people in Schindlers list spoke English not German that does t matter, but when you are telling a true story be as faithful as possible. The guy who played Richard Gere's friend should have played Richard Gere instead of being a forced Japanese connection. Shoot it in the real station where the true event took place. Lots of missed opportunity's and weird desicons. Also the movie drags a lot and repeats scenes over and over and has scenes that serve no purpose. This story is more designed for a 45 min short film rather than a feature. Anyway that's my take. One of these days I'll check out the original",

I loved this movie. I highly recommend this movie. Anyone that has ever been convicted of harming a dog should be made to watch this movie to show just how loyal a dog is. Dogs should not be used in fighting or abused. This is a prime story of Loyalty and Love of mans best friend. The cast that was picked was perfect for this movie. I had a Shih-tzu for 15 years, and he was my baby. he tolerated my husband and other people. He would morn for me when I went into the hospital, he would wait for me, he had to go where ever I did. He would even get in the tub with me. I miss him so much. Now I have a lab mix, she just turned one, and she is spoiled rotten. Dogs should not be under-estimated.",

In 1924 he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Eisaburo Ueno, a professor in the agriculture department at the University of Tokyo. During his owner's life, Hachiko saw him off from the front door and greeted him at the end of the day at the nearby Shibuya Station.Even after Ueno's death in May, 1925, Hachiko returned every day to the station to wait for him, and did so for the next 9 years, till his death.",

I believe that this movie moves most of the people's feeling and emotions and for me it was definitely a catharsis-like experience. These people who are not moved by this movie...I must admit that I believe they are not been concentrated when watching it or they are the most cold-hearted beings. Movie itself is based on real life story and it's about the strongest connections and feelings between animal and human. And it is so beautifully made - structure, dialogues, acting, music, camera-work...everything is just perfect. It should be watched with your closest ones - with those in front you can naturally cry without holding yourself back because then the catharsis is stronger and you can fully express you feelings and after you get over this movie you can turn to life as a better person.",

Finally a film from the USA (albeit based on a true story in the 1920s Japan) that is without guns, explosions and free of violence and not based at all on romantic elements!\"Love and Loyalty\" succinctly sums up the film. The love so simple, so pure and the loyalty so unfailing, so steadfast that it would melt any steel heart. I was so embarrassed that as soon as the film came to the end I dashed straight into the loo only to see my eyes sore red (!!)The main characters never \"take flight\" but that matters not at all. It's the simple story of the love between a man and his best friend that more than sufficiently works all the wonders. Not a sad one, but profoundly touching, So touching that even a tough guy like me couldn't possibly hold his tears.Hachiko, the Akita dog, has set the Yardstick of loyalty under which all loyalty among us human beings are to be measured. Loyalty that is truly monumental. Loyalty that is to be surpassed only by God Himself.A must-watch film, especially for all dog lovers. Highly recommended for all families and people of all ages.",

I almost jumped out of my seat during the scene in the garage! People need to see this movie, movies like this just don't come around often. In some ways, it even changed my own life for the better. When thinking about Hachi, I always strive to be better than I am, to never give up, and to always believe that anything is possible. This might be the most important movie you will ever watch! It really has everything, an exiting, thrilling and heartbreaking story, lovealbe and relatable characters that are incredibly portrayed by Richard Gere and Joan Allen. This is without a doubt Richard Gere at his absolute best. The fact that he never won the Oscar for this is an outrage. It should be studied (and probably is) in acting schools everywhere because what they have managed to achieve here is nothing short of magical! Every scene, every cut is brilliantly concieved, there are nothing in this movie that is filler or unnecessary. You sit on your toes and are constantly floored by just how magnificent this movie really is. It will entertain you while at the same time cause you stop and think about what's really important in life. I will cause you to question your very own existence, to think about what is possible, what a dog is capable of and what really makes us all human. WOW! This film is history. It stands alone. It raises the bar for how movies as a medium should be viewed in our society. See this movie now, and then see it again a thousand times. Then watch it again.",

How precious something or someone can be. Well, make sure you bring tissues with you on this movie. Please enjoy this beautiful film.",

I've watched plenty of sad movies about dogs, and I always cry, but this one impacted me the most. And I believe the only reason for it, is that this story is not made-up and not made from an existing book (that was also made-up). It actually happened in real life, long time ago. THAT is what kills me. I'm not exaggerating when I say I was depressed for literally 2 months after watching it. No movie has ever done that to me, and no movie ever will. You know that feeling when you experience something specific, and you just KNOW that nothing like that will ever happen again? Well, that's how I feel about this movie. This one is THE ONE. The one that no other movie can ever replace in shed tears and emotions I went through watching it.\nGirls, guys - no matter how tough you think you are - you WILL cry watching this movie. If you don't...well...just means you have no emotions whatsoever.\nAnyway, 10/10 from me, even though it killed me a little.",

            "content": "Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a heartwarming story about a man and his best friend. Based on a true story from the year 1925 in Tokyo, Japan, this film won't leave one eye dry. In this tear jerking film, Professor Parker Wilson, played by Richard Gere, finds an Akita puppy lost in the train station. With no other option, Professor Wilson takes the puppy, Hachi, home with him. Throughout the movie an unsuspected friendship forms between the two, and they find themselves tangled in an unforgettable relationship that will change both of their lives forever. For such a strong movie, the script is rather simple and a little boring at times, being mostly monologue when Professor Wilson talks to Hachi, you can see the simple responses from Hachi in his longing looks and his deep caring eyes. The rest of the script includes side conversations between the professor's wife, played by Joan Allen, and their daughter, played by Sarah Roemer, just to name a few. Every side conversation throughout the movie connects to either Professor Wilson's past or to his relationship with Hachi. Even though the script is weak at times, I believe it was executed with great taste and worked well with the overall look and feel of the movie. To complement the script, the cinematography in Hachi was simple, but artfully done. The music playing in the background is always the same song - a song to which the professor is choreographing a dance to for one of his classes. The tempo of this song is slowed down and sped up depending on the mood of the scene, creating a more dramatic effect. Along with the music, the color of the scenes throughout the movie change very little. Much of the movie is bland with a gray overtone, causing Hachi's red fur coat to stand out. In some scenes the viewer gets to see through Hachi's eyes. In these scenes, the camera is angled from below, and the film is in black and white, just as Hachi would see it. This was a neat component that brings the viewer closer and more connected to Hachi. Along with the cinematography, the acting was outstanding. Richard Gere does a great job portraying Professor Wilson. Acting with a dog is a difficult task, but Gere did it effortlessly. Watching Hachi and Gere interact was as natural as a bee finding a flower. It seemed as if Gere and Hachi had been together for ages, even though they had only met to film the movie. The bond between them seems as real as the bond between two best friends - it's unbreakable.I don't see how anyone could stay dry-eyed during this movie. This unforgettable film is a great example of loyalty and friendship, and provides a perfect story to show the age old connection between a man and a dog. Hachi: A Dog's Tail is great for the whole family, which is rare to find in this day and age. It's a must see movie, not only for dog lovers, but for everyone.",

Well, 'Love' too.Based on a true story which took place in Japan in the 1920's, where today a monument has been erected to remind people that such loyalty matters, this is the story of the Akita dog named 'Hachiko', and his master, a professor who were inseparable since the day they met.Richard Gere plays the main role as Hachiko's master, and his character never takes over the viewer's attention from the lovable pet. In fact, one might think that the main character is played by the dog itself, which is quite true.I do not want to elaborate on the plot, but would only advise the readers of this review, that it is a must watch for people of all ages. It sure will remind us of how important the little time we have with our loved ones are, and to not take it for granted.Highly recommended!PS: You might want to watch this alone, if you do not want the folks around you to see that after all, you're not that tough as you pretend to be.",

The beautiful thing about that tidbit is it is proof that the human soul can be touched by gentility and decency no matter what land or people you are talking about.\nMy wife and I cried while watching the movie.

We are the only species in the Universe that we know of that rejects our biological programming. Meaning, humans are cruel and possess few redeeming qualities. But in some weird twist of science and fate, we recognize we are the most defective species on Earth and strive not to be what/who we really are. Animals (Dogs, etc) are logical by comparison. They derive no pleasure from sadism or self-destruction the way people do. Are they better than us? Yes. Do we have more to learn from them, than they do from us? Yes.\nAll you have to do is be open to the learning, and the realization that wisdom comes from being the hero of your own life.

The script is a polished, clean work of high-level craftsmanship, and the acting by all the humans is high caliber as well. It is the dog (s), in the character of Hachi, who brings it all home, of course. I'm sure it helps to be a dog lover -- a lover of BIG dogs that demand time and attention (not the \"toy\" breeds, although they can be cute). It probably didn't hurt (my rating of this film) that my own dog (not an Akita -- a tall, muscle bound American staffordshire mix) is similar to the character Hachi, in smarts and personality (my dog is a bit more fun, 'cause he likes to be play like a rugby player, and be goofy).The plot is truly simple: abandoned dog finds man, Parker Wilson, at train station, wins over man with it's charm and cuteness. Man's wife, Cate, tries to interfere with the friendship/bonding process (don't all wives?), by demanding he not adopt another dog. Man's love for dog wins out, and wife relents. The rest of the movie focuses mostly on the bonding of Parker and Hachi, with small scenes of interaction between Parker's family (wife Cate, daughter Andy, and soon-to-be son-in-law, Michael), moving through life, interacting with each other and Hachi. And Hachi's penchant for leaving the backyard, on his own, and walking to the train station (everyday at the same time) to wait for Parker and walk home with him. Then a poignant story development takes place, setting the stage for theme of the movie. The event itself won't necessarily put a lump in your throat: but the things that happen immediately after...and for the remaining 24 minutes of film definitely will. Unless 1)you've been disconnected from the life-support system, or 2) You're one of those insufferable guys who feel they are too manly to admit they have emotions or too high-brow and sophisticated to be taken in by popular entertainment and \"cheap sentiment.\" (Funsuckers). If those don't apply, be prepared to tell any women in the room that, you, um...got some dust in your eyes, or something.The script/screen story is based on a real-life story, only it has been Americanized. That's okay. The story still hits home. And the dogs which were used for this movie are brilliant actors! The cutesy angle (often used in films that feature dogds) is largely avoided; and the idea, when showing things from Hachi's perspective, to use some faded colors, instead of black & white, was spot-on. I have to admit, I generally enjoy the majority of Lasse Halstrom's work \"The Cider House Rules,\" \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape,\" etc). This is no exception. Two paws up!",

And so he waited for 9 years after until his death.I do watch a fairly amount of movies with dogs or cats as the main actor. However Hachiko was truly different. This dog is smart, love his owner and doesn't really care about anything else. His whole world was about his owner and died with it.Richard Gere and Hachi relationship in the movie was truly remarkable. Both gave a sincere acting that makes you love the dog and love the owner. I ached and sobbed non-stop at the ending which shows Hachi that has aged, looked dirty, homeless and yet HOPEFUL and waited for his master to come home. I also felt relief when he died peacefully.It relates back to our own lives when we searched and looked and \"gave-up\" -- yet this dog never did give up.This is a wakeup call movie that inspires you to do more with your loved ones and love them with unconditional love.

I, who do not easily let go of tears at the sight of a film, I have confessed that there, I took a huge slap in the face, and I especially cried until 15 minutes after the end of the film. .. he is one of those films that mark you for life, and that you were watching one, two, thousand times, it will always make you the same effect: it will make you melt. A beautiful lesson in cinema too, as what we do not need to write wacky scenarios, special effects or place every 30 seconds to perform wonders ...",

This is one of the most heartwarming (and yes SAD) movies I have seen. However, I was looking for a heartfelt and meaningful movie and I found it with this one.It shows, magnificently, the amazing bond that an animal can have with a human in such a sweet and locing way. Yes, I cried throughout the entire movie but that is what I wanted to see.The reviewers who left bitter and nasty low reviews? Their hearts just might be made of stone or... they cannot admit that something moved them to thr brink of tears.. or actual tears.If you love animals, and are in the mood for emotional and moving media.. watch this.",

            "review_title": "An unforgettable touching story about a legendary Akita dog who sorely misses his deceased master.",
            "content": "No one could ever forget the touching true story of Japan's Hachiko, an Akita dog who awaited patiently the return of his master at the train station. This went on even after the old man died, catching the attention of the train commuters, who would hail Hachiko as an embodiment of loyalty. While dogs are indeed notable for their intelligence and loyalty to their masters, Hachiko was unlike any other dogs: the bond he developed with his master was so special that he knew his master's about to arrive home by the time his train honks its loud horn from afar. These events are incorporated in Lasse Hallstrom's \"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\", which is just as equally touching that I couldn't help but weep to this unforgettable story about love, friendship, and loyalty.The movie begins with a puppy Hachi being flown from Japan to the United States, and then transported to the train station where he gets in the way of Parker, a middle-aged music professor who is married with children (a deceased son and a grown daughter). Parker tries to have him adopted but is surprised that no one was interested, not even his Japanese colleague, Ken, who reveals that Hachi's name means \"8\" in Japanese (the number of which is considered a good fortune in Japanese tradition), and that Akitas' loyalty can't be bought. His wife Cate also wants Hachi adopted by a loving family, but seeing how her husband has come to love the dog, she believes that Hachi has already found a family in them.We then see a grown Hachi that has developed a strong bond with his master. At one point, Hachi escaped from home and chased Parker down to the station, eager to join him aboard the train to work; but the professor is kind and patient and it never crossed his mind to admonish him for being a naughty dog. Hachi would then accompany his old man for a walk to the station every day, and then await his arrival there at 5 in the afternoon. After Parker died of a heart attack, Hachi continued waiting for his master's return in his usual spot for the next 10 years until his own demise. Concerned citizens fed Hachi all kinds of food as he waited, but to my surprise no one bothered to bathe him.The direction by Lasse Hallstrom, coupled with Jan Kaczmarek's beautiful piano-oriented score, really packs an emotional punch. The movie's a pleasure to look at because it's inhabited by characters who are good people. Whether you may have a preference for any animal but a dog, it's hard to hold back tears during its emotional moments. Believe it or not there's a dog-shaped hole in all our hearts, so I urge you to allow the memory of Hachiko fill it.",

            "content": "(I checked off that there are ***spoilers*** in this, but if you have watched the trailer, you saw more spoilers than anything you will see in any of these reviews. That said, if you want to know nothing about the film, don't read this, just understand that if you *truly* love animals and know how to take care of them, you will be disturbed by this film.)We watched this based on the 8.1 rating, and the numerous 10 and 9 star ratings I saw on the mobile app. Little did I know that the mobile app puts all the best ratings first without giving you a way of re-organizing them into love/hate like the regular site does.The idea that so many people liked this film is ... beyond words. Why? Because it means *that* many people think it's acceptable to neglect and abandon a dog without even an *attempt* to assist the dog in it's grief over it's lost guardian. There are so many disturbing abuses in this film it's hard to recount them all but the ones that come to mind are: -- Making a family dog sleep outside in a shed or doghouse as if that's care-taking -- Letting a dog run the streets alone. -- Letting a dog run around without a collar, no matter how small the town -- The abandonment of a loyal and heartfelt friend of the spouse who crossed by the remaining spouse -- The willing allowance of a dog to become homeless (as one person stated here, would you let a 10 year old do anything s/he wanted to do just because s/he wanted to do it?) -- Lack of any obvious nutritional or medical care -- The callous disregard of the dog's grief without an ounce of compassion for the dog or trying to help the dog understand that his human friend isn't coming home. Not only do they do all these things, but the film tries to make it look magnanimous on the part of the characters. Anyone who believes it is acceptable to treat any animal this way shouldn't have an animal under their care. Anyone who thinks this film is 'heartwarming' clearly doesn't have a concept of animals as family members. If they think they do, they are delusional. I work with animals every day and everyday I have to deal with animals who are in grief and emotionally lost because their people treated them like *property*. If you wouldn't do it to your child, don't do it to your dog, or your cat, or any other animal you consider your 'pet.' I just am so angry that a film like this would even be made. I don't know how animals in 1923 Japan were routinely treated, and perhaps this film could have worked setting it in that place and time, and showing other animals being routinely treated badly so that this treatment might look kind in contrast. BUT the film was set in modern day U.S. and as far as I'm concerned, it is *NEVER* okay in *ANY* time or place to treat a dog like they did in this film. I'm just sorry I looked this film up on the IMDb mobile app first. If I had seen some of the more negative reviews with regard to the treatment of Hachi, I would have never watched this film. If you *truly* love dogs, and are a capable pet parent, this film is not for you. It is upsetting and disturbing.",

Irresponsible of Hollywood embellishing a story to personify a dog whom in reality was left out on the street to fend for himself. Going to the train station each day because let's face it that was where his source of food was! None of his family committed to caring for him, none of his family was interested in engaging him in a productive life whereby bonds of trust could have been established within the remaining family. Totally irresponsible of Hollywood to project this dog as the next cute dog everyone needs to have - no regards for it requiring experienced dog handlers with the skill to socialise and train what otherwise could easily become an aggressive dog towards strangers and other dogs without consistent, positive and knowledgeable dog training skill. Warning next sentence some viewers may find disturbing. Dogs are not humans inside a furry body, they do not speak our language and the reason the dog wouldn't retrieve the ball was because his owner didn't know the first thing about dog training, not because the dog wasn't capable of being trained to retrieve.",

But Hachi shows his true loyalty by coming back every day.I was very happy to see that Hachi, although he was living like a street dog after the death of the professor, was given good care by all the people around the train station. Even the grumpy train tickets sales man showed some affection after a long time.The saddest part for me is seeing old Hachi stumbling to the train station. At some day the wife of the professor is visiting the town again. On her way back to the train station she is so surprised by seeing Hachi still waiting there. It was really satisfying for me to see that she still had the change to say Hachi goodbye because he would die soon after she leaves again.At the end of the movie old Hachi closes his eyes to remember his boss. Running around as a little puppy side by side with the professor. He knows it is finally time for them to meet again. Rest in peace Hachi!",

Such an amazing movie, such an amazing dog, such an amazing story, and such an amazing message. I recommend this to so many people because no movie has ever touched me quite like this one. Hachi has truly inspired me and lifted me like no other. I just got a dog a week ago. His name is Max and he's a beagle/cocker spaniel mix. Since I've gotten him, he's been such a joy in my life.",

Until now I keep on thinking what made this film stood out. I did not cry, I almost wept! This movie is not the kind of film that will move you because of too many dramatic scenes (e.g characters crying a lot), it shows the reality of what normally all of us do everyday and how we relate to our pets. I appreciate how the story was presented, it's hard to tell a story about patience without it being boring at the same time making you feel how hard to wait. More importantly I wanted to praise the sounds that was used, the music itself conveys the story of undying love and devotion. All in all I just love the simplicity of the film that will not give you a doubt that this had happened before. Recommended not just to all pet lovers, but for those who wants to watch a story about faith and love.",

On 15 February 1858, Gray died of tuberculosis. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, the graveyard surrounding Greyfriars Kirk in the Old Town of Edinburgh. Bobby, who survived Gray by fourteen years, is said to have spent the rest of his life sitting on his master's grave. A more realistic account has it that he spent a great deal of time at Gray's grave, but that he left regularly for meals at a restaurant beside the graveyard, and may have spent colder winters in nearby houses.In 1867, when it was argued that a dog without an owner should be destroyed, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, Sir William Chambers\u2014who was also a director of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals\u2014paid for a renewal of Bobby's licence, making him the responsibility of the city council.Bobby died in 1872 and could not be buried within the cemetery itself, since it was regarded as \"consecrated\" ground. He was buried instead just inside the gate of Greyfriars Kirkyard, not far from John Gray's grave.",

I digress...Burn me at the stake, tell me that I need to be put down (because a dog's life isn't equal to a human's, but in fact much more valuable according to many who lash out at those who don't love the film), but this movie could have been 20 minutes and have the same impact. I'm not commenting on the history of the story, but the horrid execution of the telling of it...one which I'm not convinced even needed to be made into a movie.Many of those who have rated this movie a 10 are falling into the same trap as women who think movies like Dear John or A Walk To Remember are great.

            "content": "For some reason, I had not seen \"Hachi\" until late last year. But after I saw the movie, I have seldom gone a day without thinking about the loyal dog. \"Hachi\" has a great cast in Richard Gere, Joan Allen, Jason Alexander, Erick Avari and others, but the real stars of the movie are three Akitas that play the role of Hachi. Chico and Layla play the younger adult Hachi while Forrest plays the older Hachi. And together with the two Shiba Inus that play the role of puppy Hachi, they really steal the show.\"Hachi\" is based on a true story of one dog's loyalty towards his master. The dog is adopted when he was a puppy, by a professor who sees him wandering at a train station. As the dog grows up, he gets into the habit of seeing his master off at the train station every morning, and is back at the station in the evening waiting for the professor when he returns from work. After the master fails to come back on the train one evening, his dog shows up at the train station every evening, day after day, year after year, no matter what - whether it is hot or cold or rainy or snowing. Until finally, one evening, the master finally returns, in a manner of speaking, and takes his beloved dog Hachi with him on a special journey.One of the highlights of the movie is the superb background score by Jan Kaczmarek, who won the Oscar for his work in \"Finding Neverland\". In particular, the closing track, titled \"Goodbye\", is a masterpiece. The beautiful music certainly adds an extra dimension to the movie and heightens its impact on the viewer, and the tunes will linger in the mind long after the movie.While Chico and Leyla, the Akitas that play the younger Hachi are both very impressive, it is Forrest, playing the older Hachi with his melancholy eyes, slow walk and a once-gorgeous coat that has dulled with age, who really tugs at the heartstrings. My heart went out to the 10+ year old Hachi the first time he is seen in the movie. I found myself fervently wishing that something good will happen to him after so many years of waiting for his master! All credit to the actors and the director Lasse Hallstrom for bringing the true story of Hachiko from Japan to an American setting and making a memorable movie of it. I would unhesitatingly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and undoubtedly the best dog movie I have ever seen - even when I consider other beautiful dog movies like \"Marley & Me\", \"Red Dog\" and \"My Dog Skip\".",

There's virtually no character development, the sidestories go nowhere and there's never anything interesting added to the original story. However, we all love dogs so it's hard to even notice these flaws while you look at this quiet Akita being cute. However, it seems the director doesn't know dogs either. For example, the Akita fails to recognize the scent of an important character at one scene. The characters talk to him but the body language doesn't match what they hear as a reply. It's also implied that the dog is somehowe special and loyal to Gere, but for some reason forgot about his previous owner. As soon as you start thinking, every scene falls appart.By the first part of the film I was ready to give it a 3/10, but the ending is actually effective despite the poor execution. For example, there's a scene with a tree over the years. There's this dramatic wind that makes it really work, but on every single other instance you can tell there's absolutely no wind on that place which really breaks the immersion. Either way, I was in tears by the end despite predicting it all so I guess it earned 2 points back.All in all, most of the movie was a complete waste of time. If you wanna cry, just skip to the end.",

And today, when i was roaming on my fb posts, i saw the guide of \"Hachii - A Dog's Tale\". Without talking any second thought, i asked to one of my friends to help me share her Netflix's username & password, with me, to watch this movie, but unfortunately, this movie is not listed on Netflix when i logged in, and it got me left with two wondering words: \"But Why!?\" I checked on Amazon Prime Videos, perhaps, due to an online transaction errror, my cards are blocked for online transactions, i couldn't get this membership. So i asked my another friend to help me whether he has any membership. Luckily, he shared the link with HD quality!! Released back in 2009, though I surfed & watched the movie online in 2020... not just watched but invested the hours with this remarkably scripted \"true story\". Not sure, how i negotiated watching this movie a long back. Silly me. I shan't have underestimated Richard. Richard has been one of the fair & balanced actors. Always a luxury watching his movies.Undoubtedly, it's one of my second fav. movies of Richard's have i just watched. Well written & portrayed. Smoothly touched & directed. And the message to be rendered: \"You should neva forget anyone you have loved\". It's all 'bout loyalty & faith that you put in someone.I can co-relate the message with my or even anyone's real life as well, esp. when it comes to love. Love should be from both sides as it's clearly depicted & shown in Richard's & Joan's case in movie. One sided love is as contagious as any lethal drug eva can be & has nothing to do with loyalty, perhaps good part is, the one you love should be loved with all of your heart. It shows how much you love someone not for getting something in return but having 'em with you. Every day & week & month & a leap of years that you spend with someone gets counted & is always valued.This be another reason why i not just like writing stuffs based on reality, but love watching movies based on reality which are unexceptionally true; & belonged to someone's real life as well. Such movies often make you relate things with ur own life (undisguised), ev'n that has nothing to do with it sometimes. Being a writer, i must say,\nPeople may come & go, but what's remnant behind is their memories. Their love remains alive, esp. the one that you do with all of ur heart without expecting anything in return but their presence in ur life.Happened back in 1925, a true story has this amount of impact to shudder the hearts in 2020. Loved watching this movie. Quite heartfelt & much captivatingly structured in terms or dialogues & characters. Layout, scenes & places have been pretty smoothest as well which made it more finest quality to be watching without getting off track. Looking forward to watching movies more which are more alikely to \"Hachii - A Dog's Tale\".",

            "content": "So I got interested in this movie seeing it had received such good ratings on IMDb and also since people unanimously shared their tearful experiences with this one.My initial gut feeling was: how irrelevant a movie must be that centers such a great deal on an animal character. Was this yet another Lassie type movie? The cover certainly made an impression of this. 1,5 h, also seemed like a pretty modest run time for a movie that is supposed to get you carried away. Despite conflicting thoughts, I decided to not go with my cynical side, caught this movie and loaded it up. Straight away I found my empathy button pushed. The little Hachi is easy to consider cute and I wondered what events would follow the dog's entry in the life of Richard Gere's character, let alone the little creature interacting with the rest of the family- not as thrilled over sudden thrown upon dog ownership. As the movie progressed I got increasingly more unfulfilled, though. There really is not much going on story-wise and the acting is mediocre at best, which makes it hard to feel for any of the characters. Furthermore, the-world-seen-through-Hachi's-eyes-shots are embarrassingly trivial and the absence of these would have made a better film. I guess this story about the dog who waited for his dear master to arrive better suits as an exceptional anecdote, shared on an encyclopedic website, rather than as a full-length feature film. After all, is it possible to depict animal depth with credibility, which this movie tries to do? I started watching this movie with a smile but ended up feeling horribly regressed for having given it a chance. Lessons are to be learned from this, IMDb ratings should be taken with a grain of salt and from this point on I shun movies that feature dogs as main characters. If you wish to get moved, \"The Elephant man\" is a better choice; it has incredible acting and displays immense beauty in the worst ugliness. Moreover, I believe the film \"Turner & Hooch\", which is dog-oriented too, is more enjoyable than his one whilst not claiming to be a masterpiece or as heart-wrenching.",

This is a Japanese tale. Why did it have to transported to America? Why couldn't it be told in Japan, with Asian actors? Why rob more minority actors of roles that should by rights be theirs? Think how much richer and more interesting the movie would have been if it had portrayed an accurate portrayal of Japanese culture for American audiences! But my larger issue is from the animal welfare point of view. Of course Hachi shows great loyalty to his owner - but where is the family's loyalty to him? They abandon him to the streets for 10 years, to survive on scraps and hot dogs, and sleep under rail cars. And then they hug him, and cry, and talk about his amazing loyalty? Then, after Hachi freezes to death, they give the little boy his own akita. Sure, that makes it all better.Thanks, Hollywood, but I expect and demand better.",

It is the story of bonding between the dog and its owner. The film is moving at slow pace following the events of ordinary life and has been kept extremely simple with minimum effort on the scenes. Hachi is found on train platform by a professor (Gere) when it was puppy and the professor wants to keep it with him. It is a faithful companion and friend to Owner, alerting him of potential dangers and accompanying him to the train station each morning and meeting him there after his return trip each evening. One day professor passed away, but Hachi comes every day to the station and waits for him to arrive.This film moves around Richard Gere and the dog. Richard Gere makes awesome performance, he bonds really well with the dog and it never feel like watching an actor at all it genuinely seems to be a movie with his own dog. His bonding with the dog is very authentic in its essence. This is a fantastic, feel good movie and recommendable to people of all ages.",

They are our spiritual teachers - little Zen masters calling us to live in the present moment and attend to whatever rises right in front of us.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a tribute to all these qualities of dogs.

In 1987, the Japanese film Hachiko was released; Halstrem's film is a remake.This simple story for the director is a very difficult task: children and puppies are universal tear squeezers, you have to dose emotion strictly, but Halstr\u00f6m copes. He shows part of the film through the eyes of the dog - washed away colours, the angle from below - and seems to be interested in his character more than in other people's emotions. \"Hachiko\", as its main character, is honest and does not claim anything - how not to love such a thing.",

I don't care how compelled the dog was to wait at the train station, no responsible pet owner would do that.And then the wife visits the town she left nearly ten years after her husbands death and acts like she is so surprised to see the dog living at the train station, like she didn't know that. It was her own daughter who let the dog out to return to the station.The wife didn't seem that distraught at her husbands funeral: the love of her life who died suddenly and prematurely.

You ask a question to yourself \"if the dog has so much love in his heart why the humans are becoming so cold?\"Hallstrom did a commendable job, cinematography is great, portrayal of Hachi's pain and loneliness is very well expressed and Richard gere was flamboyant!

It's one mistake the family did.Second, after Parker died, the family tried to take Hachi to his new home but he wanted to return to the train station, they shouldn't have let him do it. They had to re-train him with professional help and never let him stay there. I hope anyone who have/will have dogs will never act like the Wilson family did. They abandoned Hachi.

A famine or, perhaps, a devastating pyroclastic flow enveloping all in its path could have convinced me of his loyalty, but the director removed these scenes from the final cut for some reason.The dog wasn't credited at the end of the film.

But then, I still love this movie. It was a great movie, if you've ever had a dog or longed for one, you'll find yourself pulled whole-heartedly into this story.Hachi: A Dog's Tale is a 2009 drama film directed by Lasse Hallstrom, based on the true story of a faithful Akita Inu. Written by Stephen P. Lindsey\uff0cKaneto Shindo and stars Richard Gere, Joan Allen, and Sarah Roemer. The subject is a remake of the 1987 Japanese language film, Hachik\u014d Monogatari literally \"The Tale of Hachiko\" .An Akita puppy was born in a Japanese monastery was being shipped to the United States. Along the way his address tag was lost and his wooden crate falls off a cart and breaks open.Parker Wilson (Richard Gere), who has just gotten off the train on his way home from his teaching job at University found the puppy. Parker, who loves dogs, takes him home. A Japanese friend reads the dog tag \"Hachiko\" or \"Eight\" means a lucky number. He then name the dog Hachi, according to the word from his tag.Parker teaches the dog to fetch the ball, but Hachi didn't learned, his friend explained that the dog will forge a different kind of loyalty. As Hachi grows, he bonds more deeply with Parker. The dog is so devoted to the professor that he accompanies him every day to the train station for his commute to work. At night, Hachi waits for him to return just outside the train station doors and together walk home.People around notice and appreciate this loving ritual. The master fails to return to the train station one evening. But his dog continues to wait at the train station every evening, day after day, year after year, no matter whether it is hot or cold or rainy or snowing. Although Parker's daughter and her family try to take care of the dog, Hachi keeps escaping to return to the station to wait for his master. Well-done to all the cast for brilliant acting. I like Richard Gere, the way he acts, it's very natural.I recommend the film for family viewing and for all ages, especially for those who has a dog. Parental guidance is recommended as the film contains some intimate scene.Although the movie is a drama, there are also some funny scene, like, when Parker was teaching Hachi to fetch the ball, he looks stupid demonstrating it hoping that Hachi would understand what he wants him to do.Another one was the scene where in Michael threw the ball and asked Hachi to run and get the ball, but Parker told him he better go and fetch the ball because Hachi won't do it, and when he's about to get the ball he stumble.I am not sure if other viewers noticed the death premonition of Parker through Hachi. I heard a lot of stories from old people and some middle aged people, that sometimes they observed death premonition of one person's death, but they just realized it after the person died. The scene, where the day that Parker died it shows premonition through Hachi, he tried to keep Parker not to go to work by acting strange but since the first attempt didn't work Hachi still did his best by chasing Parker before he get into the train and it works, Parker was delighted to see him , he is surprised but pleased that Hachi is finally willing to play fetch with him. I think that day, Hachi knows or felt that something bad will happen to Parker and he's doing his best to keep Parker stay but unfortunately it didn't happen. I also read in one article, that some dogs can even feel if one person in the family have a serious health problem, those are the dogs who were very attached to the owner. I was also caught in the scene, wherein after Parker died Hachi was waiting outside the train station and the ticket seller approaches him and said \"You don't have to wait anymore, he's not coming back\". It is true that the painful goodbyes are the ones that are never said and never explained. I am just thinking, why is it after Dr.Parker dies and Hachi keeps returning to the train station, no one thought to adopt him or at least help him get over his grief? Even Parker's daughter lets Hachi leave and never bother to visit or check on Hachi again knowing that Hachi will only stay at one place, only outside train station waiting for Parker. And Parker's widow did nothing when she encountered Hachi at the train station 10 years later. I wished someone from the family realized Hachi's longing & grieves for Parker. Why not any of the family thought the idea to build even a small house that may serve as Hachi's shelter in front of train station?After 10years the movie shows that the family has recovered from the death of Parker but poor Hachi until his last breath he's still waiting for his master. It was a great story about the loyalty of a dog to his master. Tragedy tests that loyalty.",

            "content": "This is a timely tale, based on a true story, and truly reaches an all time high in portraying the bond between a man and his dog. It delivers in so many ways telling a simple yet powerful story and Hachiko truly steals the show. This might not be appropriate for children under 12 years of age, and indeed its difficult for anybody of any age. The sadness is riveting. Anyone who has ever owned a dog will appreciate this movie from start to finish and along the way you will become totally consumed with what is in front of you. As many reviewers have warned, be prepared for an evening full of tears and far after that as well. It is a movie classic. Richard Gere and Joan Allen are fine. Her rendezvous with Hachi late in the movie is as emotional as it gets. Jason Alexander does a fine job in his supporting role as always This is an unforgettable movie.",
