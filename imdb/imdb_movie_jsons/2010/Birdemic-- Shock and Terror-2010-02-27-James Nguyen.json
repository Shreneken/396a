            "content": "Don't be fooled by the rating. You have to watch \"Birdemic\" at some point.This movies outshines \"Troll 2\" in every respect. It puts \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" and \"The Room\" to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making \"Birdemic.\" At first, you simply won't be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team's part.The sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn't have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn't even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she's the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is \"give your financial backers a small part\" bad.If you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the \"retirement\" scene. I think that the word \"retirement\" is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It's hard to miss.BUT...it's strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it's not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can't tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren't that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You'll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.So, go rent it. Really. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they're too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as \"Ed Wood quality\" on IMDb) - I wasn't sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.The film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we're made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria's Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there's an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it's global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, 'either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he's quite possible the most sickening hack you've never wanted to meet.' It's one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It's another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).But it's something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you've never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn't know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" for a girl character wearing a \"Imagine Peace\" shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).Now, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a \"Master of the Romantic Thriller\" (Trademarked. I'm not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the \"message\" part of the movie- and it's wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man's harm to the planet, or the \"Tree-Man\" in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don't attack him because he's in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen's hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing \"Springtime for Hitler\" for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: \"I never went to film school,\" Mr. Nguyen said. \"But I did go to what you'd call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.\"). I'll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn't get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh, don't get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It's a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It's so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It's easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn't an intentional anti-film, then it's just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It's not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it's one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable.",

            "content": "Let's be honest, if you even got as far as reading this review, then you're not looking for a good movie, so there's a good chance Birdemic is the movie for you. On the other hand, let me give you some practical advice; just start the movie at minute 47, because nothing of any real importance happens in the first half. It's entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a hot fashion model and a Rod (Alan Bagh), computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies, but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also, the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least *some* dramatic tension. In this case, they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns. Oh yeah, he's also just landed a big business deal that will make him a millionaire. So much more Nathalie's wholesome image, the little gold digger! Anyway, this whole process takes about 5 minutes. Where the other 40 go is a mystery. OK, they do find one dead bird on the beach. Consider yourself foreshadowed.On second thought, start at minute 44 to catch the movie's only redeeming feature: a gratuitous slow pan of Moore in her underwear. But then *immediately* jump to minute 47 to escape the most awkward and unconvincing love scene in the history of cinema. Don't say you haven't been warned.Then the action starts. After a night of passion, they awake to a full scale attack by badly rendered CGI birds which terrorize people and occasionally dive bomb the ground, exploding on impact. I don't mean they burst apart in a shower of bird guts; I mean they actually explode, with fire and smoke, like little Kamikazee pilots! This is never explained.And that's pretty much it. The rest of the movie is basically spent running from these birds and occasionally fighting them off - first with coat hangers and later with the the stash of firearms and (almost) limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces. Sometimes there's a variation on the explosion theme where the birds splatter people with something that appears to burn them like acid. They run into a couple of people in their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming. This shameless pandering to social relevance loses any sympathy the film maker might otherwise have had. Also, I can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive, but could it really make them explode?Just how bad an actor is Alan Bagh? Well, it should tell you something that he couldn't project any credible passion in a love scene with our scantily clad heroine. His dialog is delivered in a uniform stilted monotone, and he seems to avoid eye contact with either the camera or any of his fellow actors. In fact, even the scenes when he and Moore are walking in silence - and there are an annoyingly large number of these - are somehow not at all believable. I mean seriously, how hard is it to *walk* in a convincing manner? If I saw someone walking like that on the street, I would assume he had suffered some sort of head trauma.Almost all of the actors are more or less equivalent to Bagh, with the arguable exception of Moore. Don't get me wrong, she's not great, but since she's the only person in the movie with any acting ability whatsoever, she comes across like Merryl Streep. Really, you find yourself longing for her speaking parts, because it's the only dialog that's doesn't literally make you cringe. Also, did I mention she's got a gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44?A lot has been said about the poor quality of the CGI birds, but nothing can prepare you for how bad they really are. If Ed Wood had made this movie, he would have interspersed stock footage of flocks of birds with stuffed birds thrown in from off screen - and the result would have been much, much more effective!Anyway, since they're worried about bird attacks, you would think they would, I don't know, stay indoors! By no, they're outside as much as possible. Part of this is because in the one day since the birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled, and they're forced to forage for food. Just when you're continuing to wonder how they're going to end this this thing, the birds simply fly away, with no explanation. Huh?Truly, a masterpiece.",

Travesty, horrific, absurd, ridiculous, and mind-numbingly stupid all come to mind but none of 'em quite describe just how awful this \"film\" really is. To see where everyone went wrong, let's break it down!1. It takes 45 minutes until the actual plot begins to develop. By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.4. Read my parental advisory5. \"Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated\"6. What is wrong with Rod's friend? And why can't he get a good looking girlfriend?7. The dialogue. It's like watching a poorly translated foreign film. \"I like you and because you are pretty to me\" \"I thank you this words they make me happy\" \"Yaaaaaayyy...\"8. This quote: \"Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack\" \"......I don't know\"-------The good?1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie.

            "content": "1. Angry birds do, in fact, drop bombs. Only, they explode. Literally. I'm not kidding.2. Shock and Terror? Check and Check.3. All film class's first assignment should be a full length movie, such as Birdemic, so by the semester's end you can see why you really did need the class.4. Make that, if Birdemic was your intro film, then go ahead and pay for the same course for another three semesters. Actually, just drop out.5. Repeating a 30sec music track in order to fill up a 4min opening credit screen does not deserve a \"Music by\" recognition.6. Sometimes 20-minute films that stem from a 2-minute idea can, sadly, be stretched to 90 minutes.7. If Hitchcock was resurrected to watch this remake: 'Birds,' he'd only sue the people who brought him back.8. To close a $1,000,000 sales call, simply thank them for their business, hang up and smile.9. To persuade investors to give $10 million dollars, a one-slide PowerPoint presentation should seal the deal. Remember just to keep pointing at it for emphasis.10. Kids prefer HappyMeals\u0099 over seaweed. Go figure.11. Nintendo's DuckHunt not only had better graphics, but actually produced more realistic birds (and guns) in \"combat.\"12. No real birds were harmed in the production. I repeat: No real birds\u008513. Al Gore not only changed his stance on GlobalWarming following Birdemic's release, but he spit on Director/Writer Nguyen before converting to Republicanism.14. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room was trying to be funny. At least Piranha3D knew what kind of movie it was.15. As bad of actors that were in this feature, they must've learned something for acting scared of these \"birds\" that were as menacing as finches. 16. Sure, it's billed as a Birds redux\u0085it's just as much a Beauty & the Beast remake: Just check out daughter, Nathalie and her monster of a mother. 17. At least M. Night does make the effort to edit something. 18. Twilight now seems surprisingly more romantic. 19. I don't have the $10,000 budget this movie had, but if I did, I'd sooner risk it on one pull of a slot machine than what this movie would net. 20. My guess is: whenever the director yelled \"Cut!\" or \"That's a Wrap!\" the actors, were seeing the connection to their future. 21. It's sad when, while laughing as hard as possible at a movie, you still think this would have worked perfect\u0085as a 15-second Family Guy cutaway. 22. SYFY Channel Productions is in the process of suing for deformation of character. 23. Wearing green does not equate going green. Heck, it's not even a believable subliminal message. 24. Not all blame can be put upon the director. These actors did appear to be conscious. 25. $5/gallon for gas this summer? Ha! Call me when it becomes $100/gallon. 26. In a post-apocalyptic world, credit cards work just fine. 27. A movie about mysterious/unexplained \"bird\" attacks needs some time to get to that. The first 50 minutes out of 90 should be just the right about of time to watch people drive, turn left, fill up their gas tank, dance to a cruise-ship reject singer, fall in love in conjunction with making fake love in a motel, make one company rich enough to sell while simultaneously building another from scratch and land a Victoria Secret gig. 28. MST3k wouldn't know where to begin. 29. If someone tries to steal your gas can, simply wait until they, without cause, begin walking backwards, from you and their own getaway car, so the \"birds\" can \"ironically\" take them out.30. Knocking off $1,000 off a $20,000 home solar panel is a steal. 31. Using two different Thai restaurant fronts in two simultaneous shots doesn't just equate a mistake; it makes you stupid. 32. \"And on with the traffic report: 'Well, traffic is running smoothly on Cabrillo Highway, but make sure you watch out for tons of cars on the shoulder that contains what looks like moving dead people. No\u0085heh\u0085they're not zombies, but even if they were, the couple with the toy guns should take care of them.'\" 33. Find yourself under attack from \"birds\" but that darned tourist bus just isn't holding up? Well, listen to a stranger and gather your thoughts in the fresh air, under the blue sky\u0085in plain view of the very birds you're trying to avoid. 34. If a \"bird scientist\" tells you to stand back, simply walk up to him and just ask him to talk. It will throw him so far off, he'll have no choice in attempting to fill some plot holes in your movie. Unsuccessfully\u0085but still. 35. Dialogue should never be plagiarized from Bazooka Joe Comics. 36. Sound effects and boom mics should be used to enhance the feature, not cause further ridicule. 37. These \"birds\" seem more bent on revenge than Jaws did in his fourth installment. 38. Long before Birdemic was made and someone asked the director when it was supposed to be made, his response should've been: The Day After Tomorrow\u0085repeatedly. 39. \"Why can't we just give peace a chance?\" is not a good movie quote in this weapon of mass destruction of a film that should've been dropped over the Taliban. 40. Dissecting this movie on every\u0085single\u0085flaw is only fruitless to anyone other than a film school teacher \u2013 believe me, it would take me HOURS to scrutinize everything wrong here. Instead: grab a beer or thirty, gather some friends and laugh away an hour and a half of purely hilarious entertainment.",

            "content": "I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it's obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there's way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I'm guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn't the eagles we should be afraid of, it's global warming and mankind's use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes, it's about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it's just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There's also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There's a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it's Duck Hunt: The Movie.",

Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the \"special\" effects aren't worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film's editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you're left feeling quite empty, as if you've been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director's intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933's King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive.

I don't really know if this movie is a joke or not, if they actually went in full force with the intention of actually making a great film with their 10.000 dollar budget, clearly they did not. When the actual film starts, the camera is so horrid I thought the cameraman was drunk, or if I was unwillingly intoxicated. Anyways, I had to check my earphones after a couple of minutes, because the sound suddenly stopped and popped up at random, looks like the sound-mixer of this movie probably is deaf or some sort of modern day Hellen Keller. Let's say something about the acting.. if there is any. I felt my heart wrenching when the protagonist started reading his lines, his act is already so wooden after two minutes of screen-time he'd fit right in the Ents from the \"Lord of the Rings\"-trilogy. When an actor can't even walk straight without showing signs of having something rectangular shoved up his rectum, there's something wrong.After about 45 minutes of clapping (yes, see it for yourself), a love story that makes the Twilight-saga seem like \"The Notebook\" and \"Titanic\" combined, dialouges that are from another planet and all-in- all all I'm thinking: Is this movie the \"Shock and Terror\" the sub-title proclamates? 'Cause I haven't seen a f*cking bird yet!!When the birds arrive.. No, I don't even care to write about it.. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like laying down in the shower with my clothes on and cry while the cold water is running on full.This movie basically makes Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" seem like the new \"Schindler's List\".

            "content": "Birdemic: Shock and Terror has made a splash in the underground community of masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema. With a tag line of \"Why did the eagles and vultures attacked?\" people have mistakenly believed this is the newest \"so bad its good\" title. As evidenced by the midnight screening I attended, these people are or will be very disappointed. The incompetence on display here is remarkable. Director James Nguyen has no idea of simply techniques like: writing a coherent story, including sound in every shot, knowing when to end shots, or incorporation of special effects. Nguyen is a Vietnamese immigrant and had no training of any kind in filmmaking. He was apparently inspired to create this film due to his affection for The Birds.The film opens with an extended driving sequence where the camera hovers at an odd angle for no reason. It is tilted slightly to the right for almost eight minutes before anything at all happens. It's almost a loving homage to the opening of Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was also directed by someone who had no idea of how to make movies. After this unbearable sequence, we are introduced to the main character, Rod. He works for a technology company and has apparently earned stock options. He notifies us of his success about every ten minutes and uses it as a way to pick up an attractive fashion model named Natalie. This was the first role for both actors and they are so artificial in their delivery, it's as if Nguyen told them to eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced. Whitney Moore, who plays Natalie, appears to have a little bit of acting ability. She at least smiles sometimes.The first half of the movie contains no bird attacks. This is the \"romantic\" part of the movie, if you could call it such. Nguyen insists calling his movie a \"romantic thriller\" instead of a horror movie. For seemingly no reason at all, eagles and vultures interrupt the couple while they have sex without removing their clothes. These creatures are floating GIF images and hover over the screen. They are so poorly incorporated into the live action that they never actually give the presence of third dimensionality. They are stuck to the frame until the next scene begins. This is amusing for about five minutes and then becomes monotonous, not only because of the repetition of seeing the birds but also because a looping chirp plays whenever they are on screen. We later learn the birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them. I honestly cannot recall what the explanation was in detail because I had difficulty hearing it. Nguyen didn't use anything to amplify dialog, so you will strain to hear what characters are saying most of the time.Birdemic is an unusually bad, bad movie. It's a lack of imagination mixed with a lack of technical competence only made worse by a runtime of an hour and a half. If that wasn't enough to ensure its infamy, promotional material listed it as \"Bidemic\". It's actually worse than the TV sequel to Hitchcock's film that was later disowned by its director.Not Recommended",

James Nguyen's \"Birdemic\". Birdemic is just plan awful. It's doesn't even belong in the 'it's so bad, it's good' group of bad movies. It's lacks any sense of entertainment. At first, I thought this was a student film, due to it's windows movie maker CGI effects, wooden acting, audio conflict and bad editing shots, but no, this movie was just produce by James Nguyen, the modern day Ed Wood with Tippi Hedren serving as his Bela Lugusi. He never received any formal training in movie-making, but instead grew up watching the movies of Alred Hitchcock, including his 1963 picture 'The birds'. It took the director four years to make this movie, and it's still awful. Please James Nguyen, learn how to make a movie, please. Birdemic: Shock and Terror starts with the shocking and terrifying Rod (Alan Bagh) who the camera loves to show driving and walking over loop music, badly made sound effects, or blank silence. Rod meets up with aspiring fashion model Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and begins dating her. The dialogue between the two wooden actors are just bad. It's like a hurricane blew through the script and devastated every line in it's path. The whole idea of the two main characters being a couple is just awkward as both have no connection with each other, it felt like the actress didn't really wanted to be there. The whole love story is just painfully to watch due to it's dullish. The first part of the movie is so boring with non needed scenes, bad fade in and fade outs, and long pauses when cuts are needed. Most of the audience is just waiting for the birds to attack and kill these folks just because the movie need some type of entertaining value. Rod and Nathalie woke up to find that their town Half Moon Bay is under attack from CGI photoshop eagles and vultures that spit acid, disappear in end of shots and explode into flames upon striking the ground. I'm not a naturalist like Charles Darwin, but I don't think birds explode or spit acid due to Global Warning effects. The movie love to mention Global Warning, but doesn't really do a good job on explaining it. They even had a badly written doctor on a bridge to try to explain it, and he wouldn't do the job. Even Al Gore would hate this movie. The whole plot is directless, and the movie tries to pay tribute to 'The Birds', but felt like a cheap knock off of that. The sound is horrible, there are scenes where the movie go silence, yet in others, such as the one at the beaches. The sound of the waves crashing, makes the movie hard to hear. Don't get me started on the annoying sound during the attack, and things rubbing against the microphone. Oh god the bird screams, my ears are bleeding. I wasn't even aware it was possible to fail this badly. It fails as a romance and it really fails as a horror flick. I try to look for any good notes for the film, and I can't find anything worth noting. That's how bad, I dislike this film. I can't believe that they are even thinking of making a 2nd movie: Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. Birdemic is just pure cinematic failure on absolutely every conceivable level. I'm surprised it wasn't written, produced, directed and starred in by Alan Smithee. This movie makes Troll 2 look like Orson Welles 'Citizen Kane' or Tommy Wiseau 'The Room' look like Godfather. Check it out at your own cost. It's worth watching if you like your eyes prick by GIF clip-art birds.",

The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I'm reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case \"Birdemic\" would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to \"The Birds\"; its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like \"The Room\" and \"Manos: the Hands of Fate\" ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they're good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes).",

(It takes 47 minutes for the birds to start attacking) When they attack, that's when the fun of this movie begins. When they shoot at the birds, it's like the old Nintendo game, Duck Hunt. Rod and Natalie meet up with survivors and help two kids who lost their parents, but don't seem to care enough. Will they survive? This movie is worth a watch.

            "content": "Last night, I went to a local movie rental store with my grandparents to rent some movies to watch. We rented two movies. First, we rented Saving Mr. Banks. It's a fantastic movie, I suggest you watch it. Second, we rented this. This was more for my pleasure because I knew neither of them would like it. So, this morning, I sat down and saw it. Oh boy\u0085 This movie stars a guy named Rod. He's your average marketer until he meets the girl of his dreams. They go out for a little bit, and then all of a sudden, a huge swarm of birds attacks the city! And that is literally the entire plot. The story is just so random. It's almost like a really crappy sitcom for a while then BIRDS! HOLY CRAP BIRDS! What I love most about the \"plot\" of this movie is that the first forty minutes or so is completely worthless. This movie is about birds attacking the series, so why is there so much relationship and work drama? Plus, there are scenes that don't make sense. For example, at one point in the movie, a guy goes to the main character's house about making a deal to install a solar panel to the house. What does that have to do with the plot? Absolutely nothing. Nothing new was added to the plot, none of this is ever mentioned again, so\u0085 why? What's the point? The cinematography is absolute crap. The camera never steadies and focuses on the right thing. Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many, many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus, this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera, only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen- I don't know if you've ever heard of this before. It's called a boom-mike? It's really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI, so what's the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI\u0085 ugh\u0085 the CGI is poop! It's the kind of bad that you can't describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It's just\u0085 bad. All the CGI is put into birds, explosions, and blood effects. Do you think you could've tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap, but they just make no sense. These birds literally dive-bomb towards the city, kamikaze style, and explode on impact. Also, they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story, the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why, they just do. And at the end, they just fly away like it's nothing. There's no reason why they should. There's no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they're phoning it in, and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I've seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren't even acting! I just\u0085 I\u0085 I can't! I can't do this! Overall, Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks, the CGI sucks, the story (or what little there is, anyway) sucks, there are scenes that make no sense, the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler, the audio is grating, the characters are annoying, everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I'm serious. The characters in the movie say that \"global warming\" is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a cop-out! In terms of quality, this movie is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth, though. Score: 1.0/10",

After all, it's about the most amateurish and stupid film I've ever seen. Most kids posting homemade videos on YouTube make more professional looking stuff than this terrible mess. Imagine the joy in watching \"Birdemic\" as you see folks act who have LESS talent than middle school students in a school play! Imagine the use of a home movie camera whose sound is only activated when the 'actors' talk--and cuts on and off loudly and abruptly as they talk! Much of it is like a silent movie!! Imagine weirdly askew camera angles, scenes where lines are flubbed and a glacial pace. Yup, all that awaits you if you bother to watch this film! Oh, and lest I forget...there really is NO PLOT through much of the movie!! Yes, despite supposedly being about killer birds, nothing really happens during almost all the film! It's more like they turned on the camera and simply put EVERYTHING in the movie--even when it was completely irrelevant and you could care less about the characters!! So eventually it's saved when the birds FINALLY attack, right?! WRONG!!! The 'birds' are even more lame than stuffed birds on sticks or guys making shadow puppets of birds! You really have to see and hear them to believe 'em! When I say this is a horrible film, I mean that it is monumentally horrible.

            "content": "I don't know where to begin, so I'll say this. I've heard The Room reviewed as the \"Citizen Kane\" of bad movies. After watching Birdemic: Shock and Terror, The Room will actually seem as good as Citizen Kane.Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a cult film waiting to happen. The low budget, the amateur cast and crew, the goofy, hole-ridden plot, but what this movie has that classic cult films like The Room and Troll 2 for example don't, is a complete ineptitude from the standpoint of all involved in this movie. I could watch Troll 2 and The Room, and I could picture in some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked and they actually weren't half bad, but Birdemic: Shock and Terror is different.First of all, the editing in this movie is worse than your average high schooler's film studies project. Almost every perspective change in a scene is accompanied with a long, awkward pause and an obvious change in sound, even on the television. I'm pretty sure the director/producer/writer of this atrocity (James Nguyen) just used the built-in mic on his digital camcorder. Also, every scene is shot with a pan to the right. Believe it or not though, if there's one thing I'll give credit to in this film, is the music. It's actually decent, considering the small budget. The song played during the (awful) bar scene comes to mind because it's really catchy and actually has some really good musicianship. However, the film score is often repeated, and in the case of the beginning credits, is obnoxiously repeated.Next, the plot and writing. If you haven't seen the movie, the plot is that an aspiring software salesman meets a girl and they hit it off, only to have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds. The plot is somewhat coherent, as it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on with the love story, and it's also pretty clear \"why did the eagles and vultures attacked\" (quoting a movie flier made by Nguyen himself). Thankfully, there aren't any subplots in the movie, unless you count the career ventures the characters make pretty early in the movie, which brings me to the writing.In the pile of steaming crap that is this movie, this has to be the smelliest part. Nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly: Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" and Al Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" I read about that before I watched the movie, and I had a hard time thinking how those two could be combined, then I watched this film. The most out of place, out of context plugs for unrealistic \"green\" technology (absurdly cheap solar panels, 100 mpg Ford Mustang) can are uttered in this movie to the point where it's almost offensive. This is a part of the movie that you need to see to believe because I'd easily be over the word limit if I had to describe all these scenes.Finally, we'll talk about the acting. There's not much to say here, except that they aren't good actors. Thankfully, we don't see awkward characters or overacting like in other bad films that have acquired cult rating, but we do see bad actors nonetheless. I honestly don't feel like I can make a true judgement of their acting because of the terrible script and editing, but I can only imagine what I'd think if I got a \"true\" performance from them. If I had to pick the top 3 actors in this film, I'd pick the \"tree-hugger,\" Nathalie, and the nightclub singer.Basically, I suggest you watch this movie. This is probably the worst feature-length film of all time, and I've seen some bad films.",

My thought is usually, \"You really don't know what 'bad' is, do you?\" \"Birdemic: Shock And Terror\" is bad. It is as bad as what people say it is. It is almost unbelievably bad, and I can believe a lot. It is gobsmackingly awful - this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other, and proceed to fall in love, also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits, where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop, we are treated to deadening acting (although, in defense, Whitney Moore isn't too bad), atrocious dialogue, horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining, for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama, the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but, really, it could have all just been a 'straight' (so to speak) love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen, a self-proclaimed Hitchcock fan, tried to take a leaf out of the Master's book here, where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until, almost casually, things would start to happen and, before we knew it, the thrills were on.The difference is, of course, that Hitchcock did it with style, wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality, they are superimposed on the screen, bouncing up and down, while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it, this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can't be handled above the level of complete incompetence, how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on, our heroes fire guns, with unlimited ammunition, at the birds, while driving around aimlessly, trying to help others, including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet, before long, they're sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games, and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them, and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws, which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It's utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness (not just in movies), \"Birdemic\" transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking (again, with the possible exception of Moore) is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day, Tim Burton will do a sequel to \"Ed Wood\" and call it \"James Nguyen\", although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.",

He'd also direct the films Julie and Jack, Replica and Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. There were plans to make the third film in the series, Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle, but it only raised one percent of its goal on Indiegogo and Kickstarter.This film cost $10,000. Before you see it, you may wonder how that was possible. After you watch it, you'll wonder where the money went.Rod, a Silicon Valley software salesman, and Nathalie, an aspiring fashion model, are living a charmed life. His bonus allows him to start his own business, she's become a Victoria's Secret model and they both are in love with each other. However, the signs of the end of the world are all around them, with unexplained wildfires and dead birds washing up on beaches.After a night of passion, Rod and Nathalie wake up to find that their town is under attack from acid-spitting and constantly exploding eagles and vultures. Joining up with an ex-Marine named Ramsey, his girlfriend Becky and two orphans named Susan and Tony, they go from town to town battling birds.Finally, Rod and Nathalie make their way to a small beach, where our hero battles the birds one more time until doves show up to drive them off. It turns out that the birds want to have peace and decide to give humanity a second chance to fix the environment.It'd help if the birds weren't all the same bird, just endlessly and lifelessly rotating in space, oblivious to reality. Then again, no moment of this film feels rooted in the world that we live in.During filming, Nguyen instructed Whitney Moore (Nathalie) not to socialize with her costar Alan Bagh (Rod) after filming. He also shot without permits and the crew was often kicked out of locations while in the middle of scenes. Nguyen would often flip out at people while filming, which led to Moore telling him not to yell and him refusing to talk to her or direct her for three weeks.To promote the finished movie, Nguyen took the movie to Sundance, handing out flyers from a van that was covered with stuffed birds and a paper sign that read BIDEMIC(yes, he spelled the name of his own movie incorrectly) and WHY DID THE EAGLES AND VULTURES ATTACKED before premiering the movie at a bar. This caught the eye of Severin Films, who distributed the film. You can grab a copy at their site, while you're at it.Tippi Hedren - from the original version of The Birds - appears in the film, but only on a TV via footage from Nguyen's Julie and Jack.This is an absolutely ridiculous film and as such, I love it.

Don't get me wrong I think you should see it, but it is truly the worst movie EVER.Okay the CGI is HORRIBLE, the sound transitions between scenes are so bad you will think somebody switched the channel and none of the actors have any real talent. The plot is more made up of mistakes than an actual story, all characters are one dimensional and boring at best. The best part of the movie is the worst part of a porn movie, seeing the chick in her underwear.Why I still think you should watch this is because of the leading role, Rod (or whatever), played by Alan Bagh. I think a cardboard cutout of the \"They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOOOD!\"-guy from troll 2 (search it on youtube if you haven't seen it) would do a better job than this guy. He can not do a single movement naturally, seriously everything he does looks ridiculous. EVERYTHING. He can't walk, talk, get into a car or even stand still like a normal person.The first half hour of the movie (no birds yet) is hilarious because of him stumbling around like someone who is recovering from a severe stroke and had most of his brain removed. Moore tries to save it and she's actually not half bad (okay she's pretty bad but so much better than Bagh) but it just doesn't work because she has to act like she likes him.

            "content": "Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, \"Birdemic\" looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams UNPROFESSIONAL!!! From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).And then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.The appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 \"survivors\" (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that's safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can't be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.You need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.",

My wife stolen from me by the Government. Everything was going wrong for me. One day, I decide to rent Birdemic: Shock and Terror. The moment the movie started, my spirits lifted. Its four minute intro of only driving made me forget about my wife and children almost immediately. Then, the first words were spoken:\n\"h i\"\nI'd like to pay whoever casted this because they did an amazing job. The audio quality is also the best I've ever seen.\nYes, this movie has gifted me the ability to see sound. Continuing, every word that was spoken inspired me as a person. I also learned, in detail, how to use a gun, which, I now find very helpful. Immediately after the movie ended, I heard a knock at my door. My legs had returned to me, kicking the door down and attaching themselves to my waist. With this first amazing thing happening to me, I had the motivation to fix everything.I flew to the White House, killing the president immediately with my bird-like stare. I grabbed my wife from the clutches of his arms and lifted her into the air with my newly grown wings, holding her with my feet. The children were next.We soon arrived in Ukraine, my children screaming when they saw me. There were tears in their eyes and they were backing away from shock. They missed me so dearly. I grabbed both and put them in my pelican-like beak, and began flying home. Birdemic: Shock and Terror is the reason I am still alive.",

The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it's like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them \"firing\" guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound.

It's bad in a way even Ed Wood or Jerry Warren are not; Wood because his love of his dreck somehow shines through in every frame he shoots; and Warren because Warren at least includes lots of stock footage from other, competent films in his concoctions. \"Birdemic\" evinces neither passion or competence - it just borks along long like a piece of outsider art made by someone who saw a movie once and took notes, but then lost the notes and just winged it. (Hah! See what I did there?That lame pun is STILL better than any of the writing or dialog you'll find in \"Birdemic\".) It's worth watching once just to laugh at the ludicrous special effects and the amateur hour acting. I have seen dozens of low budget science fiction and horror films in the last 40 years, and I have never seen worse examples of either. Seriously, the bird effects look like the product of a talented seventh grader, and I can't believe anyone over the age of six could convince themselves that what appeared on the screen was acceptable. The director would have been better off grabbing stock footage of bird attacks from nature documentaries and alternating them with footage of the actors (and I use the term advisedly) reacting to them, like the old Tarzan and Jungle Jim movies. And he would have been better off raiding the local high school and community college drama departments for his cast. Nothing against the actual cast members, who were probably just regular folks trying something different, but Lord, they're awful. Reasonably photogenic, (especially the heroine),but awful.The one good thing about Birdemic is that it tries to be about something, and it means well. It's dumb and clueless, but it isn't sleazy or creepy, and it doesn't seem to have been made in the spirit of an exploitation movie. Two stars, because I'm feeling generous today.",

Bring your buddies and have a laugh. Also, reading the comment titled \"What is the Birdemic?

The girl would have pepper sprayed him and screamed \"stalker!\" within moments of meeting him. She's a model who's agency is in a strip mall next to a tobacco store. He makes a \"big deal\" by giving a customer half off, making a million dollars...last time I checked, two times a million is two million dollars...he lost his company two million dollars and he's \"WOOOO\"ing?

There is the odd moment that is unintentionally funny about Birdemic: Shock and Terror, but much of it insults you in how incompetently done it all is. The worst movie ever? Might need to think on that one, but if not the worst ever it is easily down there as one of them. Whitney Moore is beautiful and cute, however that's all that halfway decent about Birdemic. It is a very cheaply made film, the constantly choppy editing and cheap shots make it very difficult to like or appreciate the scenery, and the special effects are some of the absolute worst of any movie of recent years. The dialogue is not just awkward sounding but also rambling and heavy-handed, while the story is let down by a very thin structure and interminably dull pacing(in particular the first half-hour is enough to bore the socks off of anybody). The birds feature later on, but they are lacking completely in presence or personality and their attacks are predictable, suspense-less and somewhat too silly also. The characters are completely unengaging, at no point is any effort made to make the audience care for any of them. And the acting is just terrible, Alan Bragh has no charisma whatsoever and looks very ill at ease, while Whitney Moore's beauty isn't enough to make up for her complete lack of acting talent. All in all, may have the so bad it's good factor for some, others will find it too shockingly terrible to enjoy it and the latter camp is where I fall in. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I spent the majority of the hour and thirty minute run time laughing in disbelief that this movie exists. It is a film you have to watch, if only to know how to gauge a bad movie in the future.

Well... maybe on par.I checked the Spoiler Warning box, but I seriously have no clue how this thing ended... A beach or something. It's all very fuzzy to me. I literally went into this realizing it was going to be bad. Expecting it, and waiting for it. I had a discussion with a coworker, and we were reliving all of the fun BAD movies we'd watched as kids... Food of the Gods? Beyond Atlantis? Troll 2? All of them laughably bad, and just kinda fun to watch when you realized their stink going into it... This movie literally takes 45 minutes to get to any humor. Seemingly, the first 10 minutes are nothing but driving shots in Northern California. Then we're treated to the two main characters getting to know one another, being successful in business, etc. It's literally 45 minutes of useless back story.Once the birds get involved, there's much to enjoy (nothing to move the rating from a one...). You know? I'm just going to fore go the review, and list my favorite parts (in no particular order):1) During their date, the stop for a moment to admire the birds landing in the trees... the birds look like they are moving in slow motion, and are our first glimpse into how bad the CGI is going to be... Bubo the Owl from Clash of the Titans looked infinitely more real...2) They meet up with random survivors in the hotel, and oddly enough these folks are armed with an M16, and a spare handgun. 3) They are driving down the road (in a supposedly war torn NoCal) supposedly \"fighting off\" the birds (none of which are in the picture), and they have the M16 and Pistol shooting out the window. There are PLENTY of other cars driving down the road... you have to wonder what these folks thought was going on!4) The birds are capable of explosion inducing dive bombs! They make the sound of a dive bomber from WWII movie, too... No, Really!5) MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE... People are stuck in a bus, and are being terrorized by the birds... our heroes pull in to save the day. They are facing the bus, and the birds are between the bus, and our heroes. What do the heroes do? Pull out their M16, and just start SPRAYING with NO REGARD. In the real world, both bird, and passenger would be dead... In Birdemic? Not so much. 6) The Tree Hugger... he hears a \"mountain Lion\" so he has to get back to his tree!In sum, this movie felt FAR longer than it actually was. Some movies are so bad, that they are enjoyable in a laughable way... This was actually so bad that it wasn't good, it was just worse than you can imagine.",

When the \"birdemic\" finally hits, there's no good reasoning or explanation for anything (and certainly no explanation for why all the birds leave at the end). It's all blamed on global warming. Yep, then the film goes on to shove global warming into the audience's faces at every turn. Because, apparently, it will cause birds to freak out and turn into GIF files that zoom along with airplane sound effects and can spontaneously combust.The actual bird attack is the lamest thing ever committed to film. The birds are so cheap, and they tend to hover in place and incessantly repeat the same stock sound effects over and over again. They go on to dive-bomb everything and explode in cheap-looking explosions.Acting? Terrible across the board. Writing? Just as terrible. Production? This film was probably made with pocket change. Filming? So very pedestrian. Sound quality? My God, the sound was the worst. It kept cutting in and out, with dialogue and sound getting cut off randomly. At first, I thought the disc was screwed up.There are some scenes that go on for far too long. The beginning credits are a hoot; it's like five minutes of nonstop driving and driving and driving, with the same music looping two or three times. Same goes for the film's final shots.There's easily a thousand other things wrong with this picture. You can laugh at it. You can pick it apart and pour all your hatred into it. You can get bored and walk away. For the most part, the former applies the best, so long as you are open to such bad cinema and can find enough good humor to take this film as it is.

Seriously, how hard is it to walk like a human being?!? You should be doing it all the time! The film also features more parking and pulling out than a whole driving classes video collection!The story, well, lets just say it starts out slowly. Super slowly, I mean, the first half of this movie is just watching the lead guy courting the lead girl and going on dates and such. I am being totally serious...you watch them go on dates with the only things hinting at the Birdemic are a couple of newscasts about global warming and a dead bird at a beach. Then after the couple have sex, which we do get to see the lead girl who is cute in her bra and panties, wham, we have birds attacking. No gradual buildup or anything, no the birds are on the attack and hovering at windows screeching. The rest of the film is the hero and his girlfriend stopping every so often to give the birds a chance to attack them again.I am not sure if this movie was made in all seriousness, I almost think it has to have been made as a joke. Once again, the acting is atrocious, the only actor in the film that seems like a fourth rate actor is the main girl. She could be in a horror movie of higher quality, but that isn't too much of a compliment because there is only up to go from this atrocity! The film also keeps getting heavy handed with environmental messages, but coming from this film makes me want to go out and buy the largest gas guzzling machine possible to drive!So, this film is bad, if it was made as some sort of joke I do not know, but I hope so because I can most certainly make a better film even for the paltry 10,000 this film apparently cost. The film starts out as a bad romance and turns into bad nature attack flick about halfway through, but the parking and driving are all throughout the film!

It is inconceivable that this picture could have found backers to bring such a pail of swill to the screen.The acting is bad, but Whitney Moore is good to look at, and that is the only thing positive to report on this dismal flop. The screenplay is dreadful, and, folks, you would have to see the animated birds to fully grasp what an abject failure of a movie looks like, as the animation is so bad it is breathtaking. I am speechless trying to figure out how the animation depicted here could be deemed acceptable to present to mainstream audiences.Banal dialogue, fully clothed sex scenes, ice-cutter speed pacing - I could go on and on. It is worse than \"The Room\", worse even than \"Santa And The Ice Cream Bunny\", and I never thought I could say that. It is a turkey of biblical proportions.",

The shock is there (the birds... which are GIF's stuck in a place on the screen, moving with the camera), but the only terror is... uh...Aprroximatley 90 minutes, the first 45 involve nothing. Unless you call a creepy salesman getting a girls' phone number, same salesman making a sale, announcing it to his job, having other employees applaud him for 95 seconds (even thought he made them lose a couple of a million dollars, but who cares when you sell something) and bad sound quality something. If you are more like me, however, you should watch this part anyways.And then the badly animated birds appear and attack, because of global warming or something like that. They kill people, you know, nothing exiting, really. And wow, those kids must hate their mother.And the ending. I thought when reading reviews, \"I can't be THAT bad.\" Then I accepted the truth. The ending was terrible.But, ending on a positive note, this movie is unintentionally funny. Hilarious. The lines of poorly written dialog make the movie bearable. I would give this 8 out of 10 if it was intentionally bad and funny, but since, it is not, I give a two. It doesn't deserve a good rating, but the outcome makes it more than a one.",

            "content": "It's unbelievable that APPARENTLY 'Birdemic' is unintentionally so inept. After seeing the movie I was borderline convinced that it's a product of ingenious comedy filmmakers but the DVD special features taught me better. One way or the other auteur Nguyen must be consumed with Hollywood movies or rather with all of their clich\u00e9s. Basically what the film does brilliantly throughout is to use movie clich\u00e9s so obviously and so poorly that it exposes those clich\u00e9s. You inevitably realize how the filmmakers are trying to manipulate the viewer rendering its manipulatory attempts ineffective but not without reminding you that it does nothing else than what most action-y big budget movies do and you think to yourself: \"Even if done well, how could I ever fall for such stupidity in other movies?\" It exposes the fabric of movie-making itself and therefore if you watch 'Birdemic' attentively you will never see an overly manipulative or clich\u00e9-ridden movie the same way again.There's the story arc of establishing the hero with a romance before it turns into the movie we actually want to see. This one does it as jarringly as possible, the first 50 minutes are literally a romance almost without any forbidding of impending doom. OK, there's the title sequence music that blobs about repetitively like Torgo's theme in ''Manos' The Hands of Fate' wishing it was Bernard Hermann's 'Psycho' theme that was used so effectively 50 years ago with Janet Leigh behind the wheel. And there's the couple watching parrots fly about a tree and finding a dead eagle on the beach...unnecessarily all done in CGI, by the way, just as is common practice in modern cinema, practical effects just aren't accepted by modern movie going audiences anymore, it must be CGI no matter how bad it looks, it's called suspension of disbelief (while practical effects are just rubbish, period). So there you have it folks. Anyway, so at the 50-minute mark the movie suddenly shriekingly turns into a disaster movie from one second to the next (not counting the one minute \"establishing shot montage\" preceding it).Want more stereotype and clich\u00e9 debunking? Don't worry, 'Birdemic' delivers them relentlessly. The heroic protagonist who gets the bombshell and has not only one big career success in the movie but about three - in, like, two days - is a stoic, stupid black hole of charisma, the stereotypical \"a guy like you and me\" who succeeds anyway. The female lead likes everything he does and she's won over by the guy despite his \u00fcber-dorkyness, personalitylessness and stalker-like behavior but not without lighting up the screen in every frame of the film with her amazing smile as if she was walking a red carpet, yeah, even during the bird attacks. Of course she also strikes a big career success when she gets a cover model for Victoria Secret gig, you know, \"just a regular fashion model like you and me\".Characters who are unlikely to have ever used a gun in their lives (a software salesman and a fashion model?) pull guns out of their \"asses\" and shoot them like pros without fear or remorse. Characters that are only relevant for one scene (if even that) are literally out of the picture when they aren't needed (hey, they are just in the car's back seat and REALLY quiet, that's all) and are back once they have to be. Between bird attacks the characters are as careless as can be. So careless that they take a break from escaping the attacking birds by having a picnic outdoors with their kidnapped children who just lost their parents and whose only purpose in the film (apart from getting \"rescued\" by our the-second-coming-of-Siegfried protagonist) is to bitch that they are hungry and that instead of fresh fish they want a Happy Meal\u00ae.There's a theme that runs through the whole film as is typical for even the most shallow disaster movie but this one really rubs it into the viewer's face. At times (well, for most of its running time, actually) it plays like an ad for solar power or a raising awareness ad for global warming. The main character is shown how he is \"going green\" during the course of the movie without bearing any relevance to the story, and not only figuratively but literally as well, the guy's and the girl's wardrobe gets increasingly greener starting subtly with a light green tie until by the end their clothes are all green. Clearly Nguyen learned about subtext from the greatest of filmmakers.But seriously, 'Birdemic' had me from minute one with production logos and credits being displayed without any sense of rhythm. During the opening credits (which for example credit a \"Patsy vanEttinger\", yes, without a space between van and the last name) we watch a Mustang driving on a country road at a snail's pace. In one scene a small tow truck with a load is stuck behind the Mustang, that's how slow he goes. And he continues to drive this slow throughout the entire film. Did I mention that sometimes the camera operator still is unable to keep the Mustang inside the frame when panning? Now THAT is comedy. 30 minutes in the guy mentions that his Mustang is a hybrid car. Ha, that explains everything. Subtly making the thing that the movie is a commercial for look bad. Nice gag. One among thousands since every other edit in the film is a joke. If you can laugh about horribly poor editing this is the movie for you. Really, it's quite astonishing that a digitally shot movie could have a glaring error like cutting to characters who are supposed to be in the middle of an action but are actually seen at the beginning of the shot for the director to yell action so they can start running.",

            "content": "This review really has no purpose because everybody knows that this movie is terrible, everyone expects me to say that it's terrible because everyone else says it's terrible so I'm here to tell you that it's terrible. But I HAVE to get my thoughts about this movie off my chest. So you're in for spoilers!Even if I never heard of this movie before I would know I'm in for complete s*** from the opening shot! There's really just one way a movie should open - slow-paced shots and subtle music. A great example of a movie that doesn't do it this way but does it right is Rogue One. But in that movie it works because we cut to subtle music and slow-paced shots right after the bang that the movie opens with. This movie on the other hand starts with fast-paced shots and over-the-top music, and this is not the only time the music is completely over the top, it is over the top throughout most of the movie and some of the tracks sound like instrumental versions of children's songs. At times the music is so loud that you can't understand what the characters are saying.This movie opens with very weird shots of a street being shown from the inside of a driving car. For some reason they thought flipping the camera by about 30 degrees for the first half of this sequence is a good idea and showing the edges of the windows and trees for the other half of the sequence were a good idea. During this sequence they show us the opening credits which look like they were edited in Windows Movie Maker. Those opening credits would've been acceptable in the early 80s, but this movie came out in 2010.The sound editing in this movie is the worst! Some of the first scenes sound like they didn't film them in the order they're shown but like they filmed each character's lines in one take and cut the takes together, that's how different the white noise sounds (there's a lot of white noise in this movie). There's a scene where two characters are talking on the phone, but there's a lot of background noise in the environment of one of them. Because there's none in the environment of the other one, the two characters talking being intercut sounds so off, even \"The Room\" put a better phone call scene on screen. Also, so many lines are followed by like half a second of complete silence. Speaking about editing, I noticed there's a simple crossfade during said phone call scene to... I guess indicate a passage of time? No, it's there for no reason at all. The CGI birds are borderline torturously atrocious! If you haven't seen them, google them! Do it now! And the sound they make is hurting my ears. Besides, according to this movie, eagles have acid poop!...The acting is downright horrible. Most people are somewhere in between Greg Ellery and Juliette Danielle. The news lady has the charisma of Hayden Christensen and the \"\"\"best\"\"\" actress in this movie is our main female character's mother whose skills I'd like to compare to those of Robyn Paris. Unfortunately, the worst actress in this movie is the little girl they rescue who for some reason is shouting most of her lines.There's a scene very early on where some woman working at a model agency tells Nathalie on the phone that Victoria's Secret wants her to be their cover girl. I snorted at first because it felt so out of place. Like what I just said, there's an insane amount of subplots, none of which have anything to do with the movie. We see our characters date, we see them driving, we see them playing basketball, we see them buy and discuss solar panels, we see them at work etc. The first half of the movie concerns itself with nothing but the dating life of our characters. The most hilarious thing is that there's a double date where they watch a movie called \"An Unconvenient Truth\", a documentary about global warming. *Must've been romantic*. The only purpose the dating subplot being in the movie is so the director can show off the female characters in underwear and he does that at times. For the first half of the movie I was bored out of my mind.You think maybe the one redeeming quality of this movie would be its message about global warming, but you're wrong. The basic \"\"\"plot\"\"\" that tries to convey this message is absolutely ludicrous and even more so is the way our characters react to the attack of the birds. Every single little moment that tries to convey the message is laughable, such as the news on TV that we cut back to quite often. Every. Single. News. is about the environment or global warming. Later on there's literally a scientist telling us about the \"bird flu virus\" and global warming. There's so many more examples I could point out. This movie is pushing its message way too hard. In fact, the first time we see a bird is 23 minutes into the movie and the first time a bird has anything to do with the plot is 39 minutes into it. And what do you want me to tell you about the dialog? Of course it's nonsensical and atrocious.There's so many plotholes I could point out, like how the characters are so good and precise at shooting, but I will just tell you the obvious that this is the worst atrocity I've ever seen but I will probably say differently when I've seen the sequel. In conclusion, there's no redeeming quality. Not one. I found the first half of this movie boring as hell and the second half of this movie hilariously bad. It's actually worth checking out in the so-bad-it's-good way.",

            "content": "In 1963 Alfred Hitchcock made his cult movie 'The Birds'; in 2010 James Nguyen took the concept to a whole new level. Birdemic is currently the sixth worst movie on the IMDb \"Bottom 100 movies\" list, which is still pretty low. It might just be the worst, most boring movie about killer birds and ecology ever made.Rod (Alan Bagh) is a successful software salesman who has just started dating Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a Victoria's Secret model. As it usually happens in movies, their perfect lives are suddenly threatened by, in this case, killer birds that, interestingly, start attacking them after they've spent their first night together.This movie is so bad it isn't even funny. It begins with endless scenes of Rod driving around town and moves onto horribly edited phone call scenes. If you skip the first hour, you're guaranteed not to miss anything except a really bad and boring introduction to the story. I can't understand why was Alan Bagh chosen to play the lead since he is clearly the worst actor of all and even a tree could have done a better job than he did. Whitney Moore, on the other hand, seems to be constantly embarrassed and therefore can't stop smiling.The occasionally awkward dialogue is also worth mentioning: the scene in which Rod says that Becky \"is taking a s**t. Nathalie is watching her back.\" is certainly going to be remembered as a screen writing masterpiece. But the Oscar goes to Yeung Chang's visual effects, if you dare call them that. He would have done a better job using Microsoft Paint.The music is awful, too. But it's not as relevant as the message of this movie: Nguyen saw 'An inconvenient truth' and thought it would be a good idea to make global warming the cause of the birds' madness, turning this movie into a bad horror with elements of ecological propaganda that nobody cares about. It actually makes you want to go and burn down a forest, just to make Nguyen sad. Which leads us to the obvious conclusion that everything in this movie is awful.Rating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Waw, just wow. U know that feeling when you're having a conversation and then the conversation stops because you don't know anything more to talk about? That is pretty much the dialog for this movie. U can't call it dialog either, it's like 45 minutes of dead silence. This movie is so uncomfortable, it's more comfortable to watch your grandmother making out with a giant pink furry unicorn with a Justin Bieber face then watching this movie.The problem with the acting is that it feels so unnatural. It's like you're watching a bunch of robots who are programmed to walk to this place, then do that. They don't give any motivations for their actions. If u would replace the main actor with a tree, i wouldn't notice it. My guess that they are taken from the p-business ( IMDb is forcing me to censor this word) .That would explain why the bed scene is the best scene in the entire movie.Let's talk about the plot: there is a guy and he earns a million dollars or something. He meets a random blond girl in a caf\u00e9 and he seduces-es her with a creepy smile. So they drive around and they visit her mother, they go to work and visit an Irish pub! Then suddenly........ a random singer sings for them. The bland guy dances the same for 5 minutes. Oh yeah there is something with birds too in the last part. And speeches about global warming , long LONG speeches from the most random people ( a tree-hugger?) The plot and the characters are so stupid. Everybody who worked at this movie should be ashamed. The plot makes no sense and the writers , sorry the writer, who is also the director, probably also the editor, producer, sound editor and donut boy, was permanently high. The most random thing about the movie is that when the birds start attacking the main characters, they just go in a random house to see other random people. Then they start riding with their magic car. A car that randomly spawns stuff that they need. \"Oh look, it's a machine gun!\" \" It's a fishing rod!\" \" And there, a AK47\" \" Oh hey, Godzilla eggs here!\" \" OMG , a nuke\" OK maybe those last ones weren't true but if they indeed would happen i wouldn't be surprised.Let's talk about the biggest problem of the movie. U don't care about the story and neither do the characters and the writer. For example: children just had their parents killed, they don't care, they just want a happy meal? Somebody just died, OK they are sad for like three seconds and then it's OK again. They don't even censor the other cars. It's not an apocalypse when you see everybody driving around. ( maybe the birds learned to drive?) The filmmaker obviously didn't care to make a good movie so why should we care ?This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Everything about it is bad. The ending is terrible; it is all so bad. If i ever watch this movie again i will puke out birds everywhere. The movie's biggest enemy is not the birds but the director itself ( and the hungry kids).( Btw : in case u don't know, the special effects are really bad).",

The acting is absolutely atrocious and there are long pauses in the dialog that make it even worse, but, it's on such a level that bad translates to funny. Same thing with the CGI birds; they are exceptionally poorly done, there are high school students that can do better animations. It is absolutely hilarious to see these badly animated birds flap around. The story however is pretty boring, a large part of the movie is dedicated to this \"slice of life\" kind of stuff that I guess is supposed to establish the characters and the setting but it is thoroughly uninteresting. The only good part about it is how they squeeze in some kind of semi coherent environmental message about global warming, which they later bring up as the cause for the birds attacking.This is some quality bad movie material right here, I am just too aware of how horrendously bad it is that I can not score it higher than 3.",

They couldn't eat in the van instead? Much safer,especially if you have 2 kids with you,right?

For the first 45 minutes or so the movie seems to be a really lame advertisement for solar panels (or solapans as the main characters says it). The first half seems like a romantic comedy minus the comedy. There is no sign of the Birdemic until almost an hour into the movie. From then on the movie shifts gears and becomes a propaganda piece. It appears that global warming has not only caused the birdemic, but also deforestation via bark beetles. We learn this from a weirdo standing on a bridge and an even weirder guy who wears a bad wig and lives in a tree house.

It might have been tolerable if the actual birds featured in the title appeared before halfway through the entire film. The first half is just this guy talking about his job and him meeting this girl. That is literally all that happens. To compare it to a home movie is an insult to well, home movies and everyone who makes them. There were parts of this movie where there was just no audio at all and it synched up terribly. It's one of the worst shot films ever made.The birds stay in the exact same awful CGI shot for the whole film. At the end, most of them are just placed on the air doing absolutely nothing. They don't fly anywhere. They just hover. They use the exact same footage and effects in every single shot. When we first see the birds make their big appearance, they somehow make stuff explode. Yeah, they just randomly fly about and explosions occur. It is beyond awful Photoshop.The film itself is beyond boring. We get shot after shot of just cars driving around or even them staying in the same place over and over. When the birds are shot, we see more terrible CGI with just red stuff floating around. None of the endless talking in the first half amounts to anything at all. It's completely pointless and while not quite as bad as \"Santa And The Ice Cream Bunny\" it's still terrible. It's just people walking and talking for no reason. If I hadn't downloaded the Rifftrax with this, my brain would've turned into spaghetti and I don't if it didn't just by watching it at all.One of the best lines from the Rifftrax version was, \"We popped big zits at the same time\". Another great bit was, \"So you like standing out by this fence?\" with \"Do I!\". I also loved, \"Somebody said hello? This party is out of control!\". There was also, \"Sign your date is going badly when you have to warn your date not to touch a rotting carcass\". When the characters are talking about global warming, I love the line, \"It also makes morons say, 'So much for global warming' when it's slightly cold outside\". Every penny is well worth it to buy the Rifftrax if you have to watch this for any reason. Zero stars",

The first word that was said in this movie pretty much told me what i was in for. At the beginning of this movie I was excited to see a really crappy movie and make me laugh hard. I was terribly wrong. By the first hour I just wanted the movie to end. Not only the audio was the worst I have ever heard, the editing was a joke, the lighting was awful but besides all that it was terribly boring the first about 30-40 minutes. What i was hoping to see was birds attacking people for the whole movie in really ridiculous ways but in the first 30-40 minutes the movie was just a day and the life of a really average and boring guy. The character's acting didn't help at all either. Not only was the character boring but I feel like the film could have been only 30 minutes long if there weren't so many shots of useless and pointless shots, mainly of them main character driving! It was just shot after shot of a car entering and leaving a shot. The worst part of this movie is the audio. The audio was is the most noticeable part of the movie. There are times when the person isn't talking but they are still talking, ambient sound volume was being changed every other second. It was as if sound mixer brought up audio only when a character was talking then brought the sound back down when they finished. The final verdict is that if you are someone that love to laugh at bad movies this might not be for you because its just way to bad, but if you have to watch it then watch it with a ton of people and make jokes during the movie. You will not believe how bad this movie is. Oh and one more thing, prepare for some really lame social commentary over global warming.",

            "content": "I first heard about this movie from my nephew, who told me it was so terrible that I just had to see it. As a fan of bad movies, all I can say is that I wish MST3K were still around so they could lampoon it. Yes, this one is one of the best of the worst movies ever, and should rank right up there with Plan 9 or Manos: Hands of Fate. If you like to watch bad movies, you've got to see Birdemic. It's so horribly bad it's actually got to be seen to be believed. I know that a lot of people call this or that movie \"the worst movie ever made,\" but in this case I have to say that this is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen.First I'll discuss the \"plot.\" Apparently global warming is so bad it makes birds in southern California attack people, even conducting kamikaze attacks against buildings and gas pumps (complete with aircraft sound effects!). Global warming must be really bad when dive-bombing birds explode into flame. Just how hot is it, anyway? And the plot holes are so huge it's a wonder all the actors don't just fall into them. For example, one moment the group in the van is running away and shooting at killer birds, the next minute they're out having a picnic at a state park. The heroine smiling at different points in the movie after the bird attacks. Kids playing with a ball and having a good time while they're on the run from killer birds (and after their parents were killed by same).The first 45 minutes or so of this \"movie\" center around the hero, Rod, who finds the woman of his dreams, Nathalie, and starts to develop a relationship with her. For some unknown reason, she is totally attracted to his lack of personality, and they begin a no-conflict relationship. In fact, even Nathalie's mother is totally supportive of her modeling career, even happy that she's going to appear on the cover of a Victoria's Secret catalog. Everything's going great. Rod and Nathalie have an intimate moment in a hotel, and wake up the next morning when the birds start attacking. They find another couple in the hotel who just happen to have a van full of automatic weapons (which is never explained except later that the guy was an ex-Marine), so they go around shooting the birds and trying to help people. The ending is just as confusing as the premise of the movie, with Rod's girlfriend asking a question that starts with \"Why?\" which I half expected her to finish \"did I take this role in this cheesy movie?\" Or perhaps, \"Why was this movie even made?\" OK, let's talk about why the movie is so incredibly bad. The plot, for one. Secondly, the editing is incredibly amateurish. You could drive a Mack truck through some of the cues. The opening camera shots from the front seat of a car were all tilted so that it looked like they were driving on the side of a mountain. In fact, most internal car shots were slanted like this for some reason. Couldn't they find a cameraman who could hold a camera upright? When characters are talking to each other on the phone, the scene constantly switches back & forth between each character as they give their one or two word replies, which became annoying.The quality of the filming is extremely poor. Poor lighting left some actors entirely in the dark on a few occasions. The sound quality was horrendous, dropping out completely at times, and you couldn't hear the actors speaking while on the beach because of the loud ocean sounds. The background music was terrible, and in some spots where there should have been music there was none.Then, you have to take into account the incredibly horrendous acting from just about everyone in the movie. The lead character walks like he's got a stick up his butt. Which isn't surprising, because all the acting is so stiff and wooden they couldn't have done worse than replacing the actors with department store mannequins. In fact, the extras seem to be the best actors in the entire movie, whether just walking into a building or laying around dead. Watch the scene early in the movie where Mr. Stick-butt is walking into the building, and then contrast that with how naturally the extras are walking.And the piece de resistance is the incredibly cheesy special effects birds in the form of what appears to be animated GIFs added to the video post filming. It reminded me of viewing a Geocities website back in 1999. In fact the cheesy CGI was probably the funniest thing in the whole movie, especially when some of the birds dive-bombed and then fell over dead. When the actors were shooting the birds down, it took me back to playing Duck Hunt on the Nintendo back in 1990, though the birds in Duck Hunt at least flew around instead of hovering in one spot while flapping their wings. They couldn't even put together fake bird props for the dead birds, but had still .gif images of birds laying on the ground.I was tempted to give this movie 2 stars instead of just one because this movie was so incredibly bad it made me laugh. But I rate movies on their own merits here, so it has to be only 1 star. But I do recommend it for the hilarity factor. At the time of this writing, the entire full length movie is available on Youtube, so I recommend seeing it there instead of renting or buying it. If you don't want to sit through the whole thing, watch the trailer or see the video showing the \"best\" action scenes from the movie.I understand they've made a Birdemic 2. I can't imagine why.",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine the poor writing of mad mastermind Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\", the production values of Nick Millard's completely mindless \"Crazy Fat Ethel 2\", the inept direction of a Coleman Francis piece, a dash of on-the-nose environmental preaching and a budget that wouldn't pay for a high-school lunch?You get James Nguyen's magnificent and brutally arresting unintentional-comedy classic \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror.\" It's not only a prime example of that old stand-by descriptor \"so bad, it's good\"... it one of the best examples you could possibly imagine. Every single facet of the film is so horrifyingly \"incorrect\", that you can't help but howl from laughter from the first frame to the last. It's right up there with \"Troll 2\" and the aforementioned \"The Room\" as one of the finest \"best-worst\" movies ever made. Fans of trashy Z- grade movies, camp releases and bad flicks won't be able to help but completely and utterly adore \"Birdemic.\"We follow two leads who are both on the brink of breakthroughs in their respective careers... software salesman Rod (Alan Bagh), and aspiring fashion model Nathalie. (Whitney Moore) As both find themselves finally living out their dreams and attaining wealth and recognition for their accomplishments, a romance grows after they meet one-another in a chance encounter. However, their newfound relationship will be put to the ultimate test when suddenly and out of nowhere... birds begin to attack the public as a result of global warming. They will be forced to band together with other survivors to try and stay alive during the \"Birdemic!\"The film is almost indescribable in its awful-ness. Everything goes wrong at all times. Right off the bat, the audio and video quality is exceptionally poor (I shot high-school student-films on Digital-8 in 2002 that looked better!) and the editing is atrocious with glaring continuity gaffes and dialog that cuts in and out constantly. But it only gets better (well, worse... but in a good way) from there.From wooden acting to hilariously holier-than-thou dialog to \"special\" effects that look like they were ripped right out of Microsoft Paint... everything continues a downward spiral in a sort-of brilliant oblivion of insanity. The film is trying to push a noble enough message about living a greener lifestyle and diminishing one's carbon footprint... but it does this by beating us over the head with long-winded speeches about the dangers of Global Warming about once every-other scene in increasingly hilarious fashion. Most movies understand that you need to be subtle about such themes... but to Nguyen, the word \"subtlety\" means having ancillary characters show up for one scene, give five-minute-long musings about climate change that sound like they were ripped right out of the driest high-school science textbook, and then vanish. There's even one particularly hilarious scene where Rod and Nathalie go out for a double-date and chose to see \"An Inconvenient Truth\", just so Rod can spout the dialog \"That was a good movie, 'An Inconvenient Truth!'\" while his friend retorts with \"That is it, I am getting myself a car that's more environmentally friendly!\" The film is liberally peppered with awkward and out-of-place moments like that, and it's brilliant picking up on them with repeated viewings.Our entire cast seems completely clueless, save for a bizarrely honest and well-natured performance by Patsy van Ettinger in a supporting role as Nathalie's mom and Stephen Gustavson as a frankly kind of eerie \"tree-hugger\" (that's how he's credited) that the gang runs into. Everyone else, though? Flat as a pancake and stiff as a board. In the case of Alan Bagh, literally stiff as a board. I've never seen an actor who looks more uncomfortable and nervous and uptight in my life. Microsoft Sam has better range. Also of note is More, who is quite likable and is at least trying, but just seems kind of lost and confused. I'm sure she's probably a decent actress, but she's dragged down in the best of ways here by the outlandish writing.But I know why you're all here... the birds. My god. The birds.About halfway through the film, there is a sudden attack as birds begin to descend on humanity in a murderous rage. And that's where the movie goes from merely being charmingly-bad to being a new cult- classic! And it's almost beyond words. You almost just have to see it to believe it. The birds (all digitally animated) look like free clipart you'd find online. Often with only a few frames of animation that loop infinitely. And never animated quite right. They'll just... hover in place on-screen or zoom by in the blink of an eye. And they honestly look like cartoons. There's no realism to the digital model, nor any attempt made to light-match them to the background. It's like Nguyen found some free GIF images of birds online and just dropped them over the top of the scene. Oh, and did I mention that randomly, sometimes the birds in the background will dive-bomb the ground with an airplane sound effect and then explode? Because that happens. And when you finally notice it, you will never stop laughing. Ever.\"Birdemic\" is a special kind of bad. It's a \"you gotta see it to believe it\" kind of bad. A \"you might just laugh yourself to death\" kind of bad. A \"this only comes once in a lifetime\" kind of bad. And I whole-heartedly recommend it.I'm giving it 10 stars at a 50% discount.",

            "content": "I cant quite begin to explain the magnitude of why this film is most definitely the most diabolical example of cinematography I have ever seen in my life....It started when a group of my friends stumbled across the trailer. After watching we thought \"man this film looks so bad it must be worth a watch even if its to laugh at!\" But oh no people this is not a film so bad its good... its just plain dreadful, and if any of you have seen the trailer then I say to you that its even worse than it looks(somehow, which I could never have dreamed was possible).Lets state the obvious: The acting was disastrous. I really hope these actors got paid in barley water or some other worthless item. I have seen primary school plays with more conviction. Any emotion that could have been displayed in the romantic scenes was so clearly fake its unreal. I mean the actors couldn't even pretend to shoot properly, they just vaguely lifted up their guns and threw them about. Now this is probably something to do with the fact that this is without a doubt the worse example of the use of CGI in the history of man. I think men in bird suits would have done a better job. The birds were so fake they quite literally moved exactly with the camera as if stuck on even though they were done by computer!As for the story line I'm not sure how or why James Nguyen thought of the reasons given in the film but they are barely worth mentioning. And why there was a seemingly random crusade about global warming is beyond me as it made no sense as to why it was causing the birds to attack. Even worse than this was the little details. For example multiple times in the film the main cast decided to get out of their car and begin strolling around having picnics, without a care in the world. Then surprise surprise birds attacked. If the writer cannot think of legitimate reasons for the characters action he should perhaps go back to the drawing board (all though I'm pretty sure he spent about 5 seconds pondering if he could get away with this excuse for a screenplay). Now the not so obvious stuff: In the trailer you don't even get a sense for how terrible the editing is. Events seem to occur at random times and in some scenes you can see the actors waiting for the director to shout \"action!\" (no joke you really can its like their all zombified for a few seconds, and this doesn't happen just once!). When it comes to the lyrical component of the film you might as well give up now. Every few seconds back ground noise would change from complete silence to over powering fuzz where some shots were so obviously done at different times. It was like the actors were in different rooms, it was mad!Now the ending is possibly the worse bit. I wont completely ruin it but all in all the birds go away. That's it! Why, we will never know.So unless you are on crack cocaine, are thinking of doing something slightly more fun than suicide or just plain out of your mind, please, I beg of you, don't watch this film. No seriously don't! You will wind up like me wishing that you had kicked your own mother's head in or done some other task that was of more value than watching Birdemic.One last thought: How does flu make birds explode?",

Will the duo make it out alive and will humans realize that Global Warming is a very serious threat? BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is an extremely low-budget movie that pretty much came out of nowhere, hit the midnight circuit and became a cult favorite to thousands of people across the globe. Obviously, the film has gained its reputation due to how incredibly bad it is and there's no doubt that whatever you read or hear can't really prepare you for how rotten this thing is. Lets just say that there's really not a single good thing in this picture other than the fact that it's hard to make a movie so you can at least give director-writer James Nguyen credit for doing that. The rest of this thing is just downright awful from the screenplay to the cinematography to the sound effects to the acting to the special effects and everything else that takes up space here. I mean, the illogical nature of the story is something that truly deserves comparisons to Edward D. Wood, Jr.. Yes, I know it's the hip thing to do these days, comparing something to the work of Wood but this film deserves it. So, birds are attacking people everywhere yet our group of heroes decide to stop and have a picnic? The group of heroes are trying to escape the birds so they go to the woods where there's nothing but trees? There are so many logical issues with this film that you really can't help but laugh. Even worse are the countless speeches in the film where people talk about the dangers of Global Warming. Then, for an unknown reason, the first fifty or so minutes of the movie are devoted to this incredibly bad love story that is just creepy to say the least. I think the worst thing in the picture would have to be the editing. When you watch a movie it's supposed to have a natural flow to it but the editing here is so poor that you really can't believe what you're watching. BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is without question one of the worst movies ever made and I haven't even started talking about the awful CGI birds. Without question this here is a must-see.",

And that is what keeps this boat from sinking brutally as I have yet to find such an inept attempt at recording something. Anything.It was interspersed with boring bits and some headache inducing moments. They were worthy adversary but if you can manage to go through them you will be rewarded as I was.As a lot of reviewers mentioned, lead character is the funniest. Even the most mundane actions such as walking and talking seem strange to him as he tries to mimic these actions.All in all, a must see film, either for laughing at it or watching it in disbelief.Belongs in Top 5 Bottom barrel (for now).",

This things kinda a bore.Don't get me wrong. There ARE some (unintentionally) hilarious parts (mostly when our \"heroes\" get attacked by a particularly vengeful Playstation game...er I mean \"birds\") However the GCI atrocities don't even show up until the movies halfway point and only pop up occasionally afterwords. Like many other bad movies, this has massive pacing problems making the film a very dull slog. So what do we get while we're waiting for the Winged Clip-Art of Doom to strike? We get an ENDLESS supply of driving and parking scenes that, if cut, would render the remaining footage about 15 minutes long. (And bad driving scenes to boot. These have all the thrill of Driving Miss Daisy, even AFTER the squawking GIFs start attacking.) And then about 13 of THOSE minutes is filled with pointless character after pointless character filibustering about global warming or some environmentalist issue told in that oh-so exciting \"Guess-what-I-copied-directly-from- Wikipedia-without-actually-reading?\" tone of voice. I kept waiting for Captain Planet and the Ferngully fairy to show up and rant about how unsubtle it all is. For the lover in you we even get a turgid \"romance\" between two pieces of plywood...er our heroes (You'll never look at a pumpkin festive the same again.)But like I said there are SOME amusing moments to dull the pain, if you like seeing marble-mouthed dull-witted leading man who walk with the limber gait of the Frankenstein monster, plenty of flubbed lines that show that the word \"retake\" is not in directors vocabulary, the most jaded assemble of extras ever (a Birdemic is no reasons traffic in the background can't proceed as normal, right?), inept salesmen who CHEER when they lose one million dollars on a sale, and of course site of our no-talent cast pretending to interact with special (ed?) effects eagles that would look poorly rendered on a circa-1997 Geocities website. But those are just an oasis of hilarious ineptitude in a painfully dull sea of padding. Maybe it's easier to deal with as a group or \"audience\" to share the misery, but otherwise this is slow, plodding mess.",

The low rating and the shoddy reviews should have raised my alarms. But still, I like to watch all kinds of movies and even give questionable movies a chance.But \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" was just beyond bad. The storyline is slow, dumb and mindbogglingly unappealing. For starters you have to get very far into the movie before anything starts to happen, and even when it does start, it is just horrible to bear witness to.I have seen many a questionable movies in my time, but \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" definitely takes the lead in regards of lousy editing, both in sound and visual. The cutting was awful, and the sound was all over the place - sometimes proper sound, other times with a great deal of interfering static sound layer on it. It was as if the movie had been filmed with ordinary home video camera equipment.The dialog in the movie was forced, wooden and staggering, delivered without any conviction by anyone in the movie. Which leads to the next aspect; the acting. Wow, this was low budget and B-movie to the extend where your eyes were on the brink of bleeding.Then lets stop for a while and take a look at the CGI effects. I am of course talking about the CGI animated birds. Wow! Are you kidding me? It was so awfully fake and horrible to look at that you just sit there dumbstruck and thinking 'oh no they didn't, I didn't just witness that...'Super poorly animated birds that wouldn't even fool a blind man! Really? And just when you thought you had seen everything, this movie puts a new definition to the term 'bad'. Would it be considered poorly-animated-bird-cruelty when you see the same bird being killed four times within one minute? This was just bad, they used the same clip of questionably animated bird being shot four times within one minute, but it gets better; one scene they mirrored the image.The scene where Rod, Nathalie and Ramsey were fighting off the birds with tools had me going back to see it twice. It was just that poor! It is unfathomable that something this bad could see the light of day in 2010. And for some reason people die in this movie when a bird flies in front of their face for a couple of seconds.\"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" makes Troma movies look grand and astonishing. And it is just an appalling thought to know that there is a part 2 to this disaster. \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" makes it to the top three of horrible movies that I have seen, without a doubt.",

            "content": "Birdemic has all the requisite components that make up a delightfully bad movie: bad acting, bad dialog, plot holes, bizarre directorial and script decisions, and extreme awkwardness. For an outbreak of killer birds, everybody seems so resolutely casual about this aviary apocalypse. There is no sense of urgency or danger; characters will stroll in their walks and frequently make outdoor pit stops. One female character is killed after she wanders needlessly far from the safety of the van to pee. They didn't decide that an indoor bathroom would be safer? The gang also decides to wander through a crowded forest, a habitat that might, you know, attract birds. Then there's the careless frolic on the beach, again needlessly far from the refuge of the van. Rod is held up by one motorist for gas (yes, society has broken down that far in hours, and yet you can watch hundreds of cars pass along the other half of the road, foolishly driving toward the birdemic and their doom). But then Rod leaves behind the full gas container and hops back into the van, escaping a not so imminent bird attack. They keep venturing to outdoor areas to escape an enemy that utilizes the sky. They even have a picnic! In short, these people are dumb.Now comes the inevitable, and somewhat subjective part, where the critic must place Birdemic upon the scale of Absolute Awful ranging worst of the worst (Manos: The Hands of Fate) to the best of the worst (The Room). The people behind Birdemic are trying to streamline the cult phenom process. It premiered in New York City in early 2010 and is already being funneled to many markets. It all feels a little too manufactured for my tastes, like the media is so eager to be ahead of the hipster curve. Birdemic is a perfectly enjoyable, laugh-out-loud experience best had with a bunch of your friends and perhaps some adult beverages. It's a fine piece of derisive entertainment thanks to the sincerity of Nguyen. But in the world of bad, The Room still reigns supreme. Whereas Birdemic has plenty of bad housed in 90 minutes, it's pretty much the same bad decisions and limitations. I look forward to Nguyen's next film, Peephole: The Perverted. You just can't go wrong when a movie has a subtitle, \"The Perverted.\" He may not be Tommy Wiseau, but this man knows how to make some tasty trash.",

The EFFECTS.. you have to see to believe.It already starts painful, with endless driving during the opening credits and the same piece of music is repeated 3 or 4 times. I won't rewind to check again. 40 minutes not much more happens than this wooden Gordon Gecko jun. making million dollar sales, driving around more with his car and him meeting and dating an upcoming Vic's Secret model. Check out the company conference room scene!SPOILER ALERT!!! We're around 40 min into the film, and our lovebirds (pun intended) are in a bar. ALONE. No other guests. See, he's so successful he booked the whole restaurant. He's boring us with another (yawn) story of his million dollar business and then there's this cool guy singing this cool song \"Having ourselves a party\". Yeah, he's raising the roof. Awesome lyrics: Big mama's in the kitchen, everybody's wishin' that she's fixing (not understandable) and the dips (well that's what I understood). With them dancing hilariously to it. No other guests.After some shmusing during a love song, we get to the (please no) inevitable (ugh) love scene - she stands in her underwear, and he says (fully dressed) some immortal dialogue. (Maybe he was thinking of his car, or aping Homer Simpson seeing a dough nut). Thankfully soon, but still not fast enough, the scene fades before I lose my appetite forever. Anyway, after a night of passion she wakes him up and he's STILL FULLY DRESSED!Finally, bird \"action\". Sound effects taken from some war movie, you know, the whistle sound of a bomb falling through the air. Only thing missing was the \"Flight of the Valkyries\" music. An explosive bird dropping falls on a car at a gas station (!) and albeit the nice little cloud of smoke there's no damage. No scratch on the car, must be that new polish.No plants were harmed in this movie (you'll see what I mean).I think I'll even watch it again when I'm blue. 5 because of it's comedic quality.",

And it's called \"Birdemic\"\u0085 what to say about this, this\u0085 horrendous, depraved, garbled and extremely awful gem of today's cinema? This cinematic piece of movie perversion just shows us that today's films have no limits. Everybody can be a director, everyone can make their own movie, and everyone can express themselves\u0085 well, not this film, oh, no. I just don't know where to start first? Well, let's start with the director and the writer \u2013 James Nguyen. I really don't know\u0085 is this guy serious? No, really, is this guy serious? Is he even aware of the film that he made? Did he even watched it? Well, of course he have, silly me. I saw him in some interviews, where he talked about the film, and it is official\u0085 this guy is not serious, he is unbelievable! He had no training in making films, he has no talent\u0085 I think he is just a Vietnamese Tommy Wiseau, who came to Hollywood to make people dumber. He stated few times, that his movie is a hit\u0085 well, hardly, it's more\u0085 a failure. Does this guy realize that his movie is laughable? Does this guy realize that people everywhere are making fun of his film? And he also stated that he is a master in 3D CGI\u0085 oh really? Well, if he is\u0085 then I am a best internet reviewer ever\u0085! And I am not. Well, this guy is just bad and I think that he should be just\u0085 removed from the movie world, that would be a noble thing for humanity.So let's start with the film, we will concentrate on the actors and characters from now on, but first let's discus screenplay, plot, camera work, music score, editing and CGI. The film opens with the slowest credit ever and slowest driving ever, our leading character is so careful. It says Moviehead pictures. What kind of name is that for a production studio? They just give strange, awful names for every newborn production house. Like\u0085 Braincell pictures, Glowing Ear Jam pictures, Green Tooth pictures, Granny Tit Pictures, Wiseau Films\u0085 Nguyen said that this is a romantic/horror film, so I am already shocked by that statement. Well all from the above\u0085 is just bad. What to say about screenplay? It's simply amateurish. Music score is boring and silly. I usually love musical scores in so many films, even in the bad ones, but here\u0085 it's just boring, and it doesn't even fit to a scene properly. When it comes to camera work and editing\u0085 I really don't know, maybe even from the first few scenes, I don't know what am I watching? A documentary? Or a porn film? And for fu*k sakes\u0085 what the hell is wrong with audio? It's not even properly rendered to a scene, it's like Nguyen was filming himself as a stalker right on the spot and then went home to his creepy basement and do his poor editing. CGI is definitely\u0085 I just can't find words to describe this kind of CGI\u0085 well compared to this\u0085 old 70s and 80s low budget special effects from monster films are all Kubrick films compared to this devil's testicle.Now, characters and actors\u0085 Characters are badly written, lifeless and dumb. There's nothing else to say about them. You just need to watch the film. Our leading romantic hero is Rod, played by Alan Bagh. He is just Rod. And that's it. A good name for a porn star. Alan is probably the most wooden\u0085 no, scratch that, he is \"The Actor of Steel\"! His performance is so steel like, that is so cold, that doesn't even move. Yep, that's a real Bronze Age performance here ladies and gentleman\u0085 this guy is a robot, but I think Nguyen digitally removed antenna from the top of his head. Alan's character Rod is actually, not that far from him, it's the same stuff. Our leading lady is Nathalie, played by Whitney Moore. This girl's performance was plastic, although her body was not, well that's refreshing\u0085 but this girl can't do more than just waving head and hands and do a few silly grins on her face, I don't consider her acting porn-like, but she just didn't do anything, she was just\u0085 there. Other actors for example\u0085 Nathalie's mom\u0085 a sweet woman who did her role\u0085 I don't know\u0085 if that was acting or what the hell was it, it was more like an interview for a job, or maybe that was her audition for the role. She likes to travel and to watch TV, she loves her retirement\u0085 Rod's friend Tony\u0085 a mumbled, horny retard that loves to hump chairs\u0085 nuff said. Other actors were not that special, but I will say something about few of them more. Those rescued kids\u0085 lifeless, spoiled little brats that wants happy meal. It's birdemic, you'll eat your own sh*t if you have to, you little toe-sucker! And that guy Ramsey, an US soldier who was in Iraq, so lazy and uninterested. And that\u0085 guy who wants to buy a gasoline so much\u0085 oh my\u0085 and two more and I promise, I'll wrap it up. The doctor from the bridge\u0085 and the creepy naturalist/tree hugger. The doctor from the bridge is actually a scientist who says that global warming is fault for everything that is happening around us. The same is uttered by that tree hugger, the guy was so creepy, he looked like a lazy version of Crispin Glover. Yep, the movie has an environment issues. It send us an environmental message\u0085 oh for fu*k's sake\u0085 Don't worry environmentalists, the planet doesn't going anywhere\u0085 you are. And that's \"Birdemic\", An awful film that sends a bad and lazy environmental message\u0085 Remember, kids\u0085 that happens when you live in a dumb fantasy",

But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking \"didn't you go to high school with me?\" Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That's basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it's up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that's not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don't even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you'll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock's The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they're going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren't taking this too seriously, because it's such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\u2033 with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: \"Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.\" When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I'm all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made\u2013to bring in more social gatherings.",

While the movie is admittedly amusing at the beginning, it quickly becomes tiresome and annoying, to the point of being boring, the worst crime a movie can commit.

James Nguyen spent a total of four years making Birdemic, and he proved the opposite. This movie, is one of the worst movies ever made, if not the worst. But I think people should watch this. I especially think that this is something that should be shown at different film schools, instead of movies like Citizen Kane. You learn by your mistakes right? Well, then you learn by watching a bad movie and not masterpieces.Birdemic is about a small Californian town which gets attacked by deadly birds one day. These birds don't appear until 45 minutes into the film, so there's also a lot more to this film. The most notable thing is that the movie follows the main character's full day, and I'm not kidding. You get to see him driving, working and eating. And these sequences are long, and also pointless. Already after the introduction, you start noticing how poorly made this film is. The sound quality is very bad, and the track often goes to very quiet to very loud. The video quality isn't very good either, but since I'm a indie movie maker myself I don't have any problems with that. But the script, directing and most of all acting is so poor.Alan Bagh who plays the main character in Birdemic, is the worst actor I've ever seen in a movie. He just looks so bored and uninspired in all of his scenes. The supporting actors are still a bit better, but that doesn't save the movie. It is when the birds arrives that you really start noticing how poorly made this film is.The birds looks awful. They look so fake and they're all the same. The birds literally just attack the humans by basically flying in front of them. These special effects are also what makes the movie so funny and bad. The scenes are so far away from horror as possible. And the birds make a sound that gives you an headache within a second.The movie continues to be a bad film throughout. Everything about this movie is so bad. But as I said, I think everyone should still watch this. It is the best worst movie ever, but someone actually spent time doing this. And I appreciate it more than modern art.",

I thought it was bad during the early conversations, but the boardroom and then on the beach it got progressively worse, and at times the dialogue is even drowned out.Everything is super heavy handed, ranging from the constant environmental/anti-war messages to via news reports and dropped into conversations, as well as frequent comments about of money - A hundred dollar fuel, a twenty thousand dollar solar panel, a million dollar contract, a 10 million dollar investment, a billion dollar takeover! I have to say though these both got funnier throughout.I takes over 45 minutes to get to the actual birdemic, and the CGI is the next level bad you're expecting (maybe hoping for) by that stage of the film. The scene where they fight them off with coat hangers is one of my personal highlights of the film, along with pretty much every death scene.I will give credit to the female lead, she has a bit of charm, and I find her daily activities of walking, cutting food etc. as believable as her being a model. Beyond that the extras are largely better than the main cast. The young girl in particular has clearly never acted before.I won't go into more specifics or spoilers as you really need to watch it and be as shocked and entertained as I was.

Cartoon explosions happen for no reason! Doom has arrived on CGI wings of awful death! Rod and Nathalie are joined by another couple. Hangers are used as cartoon bird swatters.

Bus passengers are \"bombed\" with flesh-eating waste. Take that, human monsters! Let's see you pollute the air, now! Ha! Listen to the cartoon birds, man!

There's a quality that the movie has that made me laugh uproariously at how awkward the entire movie was. My friend and I were in tears, and we kept cheering for the actors throughout the movie.That being said, the movie is notoriously bad. The special FX birds and gore were an afterthought, the sound was either muddled or rerecorded ADR in a studio with different actors, some of the shots went on for way too long, the direction of the actors was jarring and made the characters feel creepy towards each other, the plot is an abomination, and every step these characters take, you're screaming at them as the audience, \"what are you doing?!\" The main blonde actress has been interviewed about the film where she explained that the director would often run out of money and call them back to shoot scenes randomly.I had a great time watching it, though. My 5-stars I'm giving this goes towards the quality of the experience watching the movie. It's not a good movie, but it's a great cult movie with a misguided, heartfelt message that only the director can understand. And that's fine. Lost Highway and El Topo were confusing to me, yet those movies remain cult classics. Maybe it's the fact we were watching a couple older John Waters films beforehand, but EVERYONE who has streaming video and is on the internet today in 2012 has had to have at least heard the legend this movie has behind it. I think it's worth upgrading the stars on the film to get more of a reputation for how insane this movie is instead of focussing on the lowered quality of the production.",

            "content": "Okay. So I have now seen Birdemic and my feelings are a big chaos. I don't know where to begin. If you take the most stiff actors of the century, making them speak a lot of lines of total bullshit (such as surrealistic pick-up lines and strange dialogues), in a story without any point at all, combined with movie effects that not even the 90's can be excused for, and mash it up with the most terrible sound you could ever imagine and music that could be taken directly from The Sims, then you get Birdemic: Shock and Terror.To begin with new nothing happens for approximately 45 minutes. It all seems to be about a guy who meets a future Victoria's Secret Model, something he does not seem to be impressed about. At least not from the acting. The actors' facial and talking expressions seem to be a nothing but a desperate \"take me out of here!\", thinking about their total lack of enthusiasm. Anyway, they fall in love, and that's all you need to know since barely anything else happens.Somewhere in these 45 minutes you will see a total of three birds. The story is said to be about birds, so you will sit there for a while wondering whenever something related to birds will happen. Or if it ever will happen. Anyway, these three birds are weirdly bad made. We know this movie only had a budget of 10 000$ but I don't even know if that can be an excuse. The effects from gun shots and the wildfire that suddenly breaks out look like something that was made in Paint in 5 minutes, and the animated birds at the rest of the movie when they appear seem to be breaking the laws of physics, with the terrible and unrealistic motion of theirs.But the worst thing with this movie might be the sound. I don't even think they actually had any microphone except for the one at the camera. Some lines disappear into all noise that the sound technician totally forgot to clean up, the volume changes all throughout the movie, and sometimes there is no sound at all. The music, from which I almost got feels from my childhood where I sat making families and pretending to be some kind of architect, doesn't fit with the story or scenes at all, and the entire film might be better if you just could delete it all.Birdemic is a film in the genres horror, thriller, and romance, and the director James Nguyen is describing himself as \"the Master of romantic thrillers\". Well.To sum it up, this is the most terrible movie I've ever seen and any movie is better than this. I don't even see how this could be distributed since it all feels more like some kind of parody. An incredibly bad one. But strangely, the film actually does entertain. You will probably laugh your ass off.Peace.",

Even Al Pacino would look awful if that was done to him. Not that the lead actor is any good (Obviously the director owed him a big favour & whats with his stiff as a board walk? I bet he has great posture). We first see him creepily ogling the female lead in a coffee shop. then chases her down the street to make some very awkward conversation while she seems very happy to see him. then when she continues down the street, he chases her down again! gives his number which strangely she seems very keen on getting. After a lot or random product placement for a website (written on peoples T shirts & walls) & preaching that we should be better to the environment birds start dive bombing the city like its Dunkirk (with the same sound effects & exploding, taking down buildings!) but don't worry, they only do this once for a min, the rest of the time, they are just badly super imposed on the screen & seemingly do nothing (when the camera moves they stay in the same position) while the actors wave coat hangers at the non existent birds.\nThe Director & editor (who might be the same person) don't have a clue & this is genuinely a case of I could make the film better just with a little editing (the CGI birds are just truly woeful).\nStill My Mate & I both had a laugh watching it on our bad movie night with beer & crisps & if you think it'll entertain from that description it probably will.",

It's gorgeously terrible movie-making it hurts.Birdemic is an exercise that f###ing ANYTHING is possible when it comes to movie-making: nothing's off limits in terms of ambition or quality regardless of the end product. Birdemic is the below rock-bottom result of that effort; it makes The Room look like Vertigo.Seriously: Birdemic is like that pretentious film student's pet-project where he homages his favourite movie directors only to squander the things that matter most like direction, story, competent editing and/or acting, and broken English that makes bootleg film subs from the Asian black market look like goddamn William Shakespeare.

The only other movie I have ever seen that affects me as strongly is Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like Bird-attack movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking Birdemic out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.The allusions to real-life are both subtle and prophetic. Non-stop action combines with stunning special effects to portray the inherent struggle that humans face against killer eagles and vultures around the world on a daily basis; this film might just be the inspiration needed for governments to tackle this global problem.Birdemic and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that the Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Birdemic to touch the soul.",

            "content": "THE BIRDS, Alfred Hitchcock's legendary doomsday film. Taken from a short story, equally terrifying, it depicts an epidemic of bird attacks. In that film, we had seagulls, eagles, hawks, and the iconic crows all attacking people without any reason. It left audiences feeling haunted, especially with the downbeat finale. Between 1963 and 2010, filmmakers have been trying to return to that grandiose sense of avian terror. The closest they've ever come is RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION. But the difference between the two? RE:E featured CGI whereas Hitchcock used real birds. And when it's done well, it's extraordinary. BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is a film about an apocalypse of birds. But it features laughably bad CGI. (Come on, birds don't fly with their feet hanging down!) And that's just the tip of the iceberg. In the story, our hero asks a girl out on a date. And after some asinine dialogue, they have a romantic night. Only to wake up and discover... AH, THE BIRDS ARE ATTACKING! Now, they're on the run, and trying to survive the flying pixels. Firing their guns (where'd they suddenly get those?) that are clearly toy guns. Once in a while, one of the survivors will die from being stupid. Leaving us rolling in the aisles, literally. I think there might have even been a character or two who died twice. The acting is excruciating, as you can probably imagine. Along with cinematography (they filmed with cheap video cameras), editing, music, scriptwriting, and directing. Sadly, the copy I stopped working about fifty minutes in. But that was more than enough. Maybe that was a sign from above? Now I see why this earns the NUMBER 1 spot as the WORST FILM OF ALL TIMES!",

As something of a connoisseur of terrible movies, you can tell the difference between a film that is so bad it's good intentionally like Sharknado and a film trying its hardest to be good and falling utterly short. Birdemic falls into the latter category, and it is a work of art. It is a treatise on incompetence and being blind to your own inability. It is not just dumb, it is poorly executed on practically every level.If you stay awake through the opening credits' riveting traffic footage, the first line of dialogue will tell you what kind of movie you are watching. The line is \"hi.\" They couldn't get it right. The first voice you hear is the poorly dubbed word \"hi\" cranked up to max volume and minimum audio quality, delivered by what appears to be the world's most awkward extra.The dialogue is nonsensical, the cinematography is awful, the pacing is nonexistent, the effects are comically bad, the audio editing in particular is an affront to humanity, But nothing, I tell you nothing on this planet can stand next to the acting of Alan Bagh in terms of terribleness. This man, the lead actor, is the human equivalent of a piece of balsa wood. He has one tone of voice, one emotion, one facial expression, and zero talent. Everything he does in the movie would lead you to think this couldn't be a human being, it must be a robot, but robots surely would have a better approximation of humanity than this man.The movie does have some upsides, but luckily they are just minor enough to make the glaring defects stand out that much more. There are two authentic characters in the entire movie, each is only in it for one scene. Nathalie's mom is simply a treasure. She is so sweet and comfortable in front of the camera, I would watch a movie that is just 90 minutes of her baking cookies. The solar panel installment scene is completely unnecessary and provides nothing but pacing issues. And it has the other believable character. He does nothing and provides nothing to the story. Nathalie herself is played by Whitney Moore, who is not talented herself but at least she tries and has more talent than the rest of the cast combined. She doesn't make the authentic character list because the writing for Nathalie is so atrocious.There is so much more to talk about with this movie, but trust me, if you like bad movies, or want to learn what not to do as an aspiring filmmaker, watch this movie. It is the worst thing you will ever see, and that is why it is my favorite movie of all time. Jostling for the position with Sharktopus vs Pteracuda.",

            "content": "I hate this film. I don't even want to give this film my attention by reviewing it but I feel like I have to in order to warn anyone thinking of watching it. I suppose I can try to enjoy this as much as possible by tearing this film apart.I'll start by saying that this is the worst film ever made. This film is impossibly bad. In fact whilst watching this I did consider how it's possible to make a film so terrible, unless you were doing it on purpose... But alas this wasn't intentional. I've seen interviews with the director of this film, James Nguyen, where he states that this film is a 'serious romantic thriller', and that it is 'shocking and terrifying' and looks like a 'one hundred million dollar picture'. Shut up James.I despise everything about this film. Firstly the acting is of course abysmal. Nguyen made this film with the less than $10000 dollars he had saved from his day job so obviously the actors are not exactly professional. Also to be fair at times (mostly during the 'bird' attacks) it is extremely obvious that the actors have absolutely no idea what they are meant to be doing because the directing is basically none existent in this film. Briefly I'll mention the camera work. It's bad. It's really, really bad. You know that you're about to witness an awful movie when the opening shot is of a car moving painfully slowly which the camera fails to catch in the tracking shot, despite the slow speed of the car. Seriously, how could you miss the car! Also there are time where the camera is held at a dutch angle, and I really don't believe that this was done on purpose, I simply think that Nguyen or whoever was holding the camera was just accidentally tilting the camera because they didn't know how to hold it. I might as well talk about the lighting quickly whilst I'm here. I'm not sure any kind of additional lighting was used so some scenes are dull and some are painfully bright. Brilliant, just brilliant.Oh no, the editing. Well the cuts are timed poorly. Two characters may finish talking because they have ran out of script for that scene but instead of cutting out the strange silence that follows this like any sane person would do, this lull is just left in, and so the final product it filled with moments where the actors stand awkwardly waiting for the camera to be turned off. Also the sound drops out constantly. Two people are credited as being 'boom operators' in this film. What?! Were boom mics even used? If they were, how could the audio be so dreadful? You can't even hear the last line of this film because of the wind! Were the boom operators facing the wrong way? Were the mics turned off? Finally, I would like to address the special effects. It honestly looks like the actors are being attacked by JPEGs of birds. Nguyen couldn't get one real bird for any of the film, not one. However it's always good to see random real birds just flying around in the background which aren't dive bombing anyone because most of the film is shot outside, a very smart move on Nguyen part there. The slash wounds from the bird attacks are quite horrible as well as they are clearly done with Halloween makeup bought from a costume shop. All of the victims have exactly the same cuts on their cheeks and sometimes their necks, which is just so lazy! Come on could you seriously not be more creative than that?! Overall I struggle to fathom how this movie came into existence. Did no one involved with the making of this film think whilst it was being made that maybe it was simply a huge failure? Did none of the actors question the script? During the editing process was it not clear that there were audio and visual issues with almost every shot of the film? However despite it being an atrocity, like other bad films such as 'The Room' Birdemic has garnered a cult following because many people view it as being so bad that it's good. I've still not entirely decided if I believe that anything can be so bad that it's good, but I know that Birdemic could never be deemed as good, not in any sense of the word. It is disgraceful.P.S. The sound effect of the birds will make your ears bleed.",

Entertain the possibility that there are people this quixotic and open about a dream who will just throw themselves into it, risking time and money.They may fail of course, dismally so, in the same way most of us would if we were insane and spontaneous enough to quit our day jobs. But you have to consider the option that Hal Warren was as honest as can be when he said \"Always give 110% in everything you do, if you don't give it your all, there is no sense in doing it at all.\", and this is the same guy who made Manos.The other option to consider is that there are people like PT Barnum around, savvy business minds who know we're suckers for idiotic monstrosity of every sort. These are not modern-day holy fools who will venture beyond common sense to return with a vision of the sublime ridiculous, or village idiots who now and then show an intuition in their ramblings. They're cunning peddlers plying a deliberate trade for money. Bad movies. As good as any other craft.This latter case is a more recent phenomenon, I believe in keeping with all the other junk of postmodern ironic culture. Highly self- conscious patchwork exploiting tribal communication. Knowing something like this makes you one of a shared, preferably small group. This is more like The Room and less than Plan 9. It's woeful in every respect but trusts we're ironic enough to cheer every exploding digital bird (!). We cheer on, hoping it actually gets worse and more senseless. Plan 10 is deliberate badness.

These people have everything in the win column and have no obstacles.2. The actual plot doesn't come into play until nearly halfway into the movie, you have to wade through several minutes of awkward dialogue, long pointless scenes of people driving, long pointless scenes of people walking, a full song being performed for only two people in a bar, and plenty of shoe horned global warming preaching.3. When not preaching on global warming, the film switches to preaching on the war in Iraq. We get it, war bad, environment good.4. Lots of soundtrack cut offs, uneven dialogue, and CGI birds so bad that I'd say the filmmakers throwing bird beanie babies at the actors would be more convincing.5. \"We're in danger but let's still take our time pulling out of a spot or parking.\"If you love long monologues about spruce bark beetles, global warming, and solar panels then this is the movie for you.

About the only thing enjoyable with this one is the fact that there's a lot of bird encounters in the last half which really generates a modicum of excitement compared to the bland beginning. From the attack at the motel to the gunfight with the creatures trying to get away and the later sequences on the beach-side picnic area which has a bit of action thrown in to raise this one up slightly. With these providing the film with some decent gore effects for the aftermath of their attacks, these here are the film's positives as it does have many factors that bring it down. The main issue here is the absolutely atrocious bargain-basement level CGI that passes as acceptable in the film. The attacks are laughable in how inept they appear due to the work in here, as the birds not only look completely inorganic and nowhere close to interacting within their environment that just makes for a frustrating watch. These creatures perform the most rudimentary actions possible and seems to think that passes for horrific attacks here as they seemingly hover around the location placed on-screen in a random manner which really turns these into being silly rather than scary as this occurs for every single one of these action scenes. Likewise, the other big issue with this one is the atrocious pacing on display here which really does hamper this one considerably. There are way too many scenes of this one being dragged out with extra moments that do nothing for the film as a whole. It's not that important to witness every step of his journey into work from taking the freeway to the side-streets and walking to his desk or his date with her at the restaurant that goes on forever which really struggles to make this one become interesting at the very beginning. As well, there's also plenty of useless scenes inserted simply to add more time to the film as the boardroom meeting showing everyone individually applauding or trying to place all the useless environmental messages that are shoehorned into the film with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and together these elements really hold back the action to the last half of the film and rarely gives this any kind of enjoyment whatsoever. The other big flaw is the lack of reasoning or rationale for anything that happens, from the start of the bird attacks to why items in their possession continually appear or reappear or why the film follows the same general storyline that makes it predictable. These here really do lower this one so significantly that it's just as awful as its reputation suggests.Rated R: Violence and Language.",

On the one hand, I can appreciate that some guy was so keyed up on global warming that he went out and made a movie to spread that message - in spite of the absurdly heavy handed delivery of said message. And he clearly financed this whole thing himself, so good on him. But the results are . . . oh, man . . .Few (if any) bad movies are this technically incompetent. Have you ever seen a dutch angle POV driving shot? And it's gotta be the worst recorded film in history; the sound ranges from muted to blaring, an assault on the ears when cutting between shots in a conversation. And the big terror threat in the movie are a series of bird attacks that can best be described as .gif animations. I'm serious.Things happen in this movie that don't make any sense and the acting is hilarious. But I have to tell you I got a kick out of Rod (Alan Bagh). Dude's got one facial expression (bewildered) throughout the movie; doesn't matter if he's being laid or terrorized. And experience would tell you that most of these actors know what sort of garbage they're shoveling, but it just seems to bounce off of Bagh. That guy's awesome.As far as film craft goes, this movie is atrocious, and I can understand the low IMDb rating. But for me, this is just too damned entertaining.8/10",

            "content": "I had an inkling that this film would scale the heights of hilarity that Tommy Wiseau's film \"the Room\" did for so many people - but boy was I WRONG.This movie is TERRIBLE, it's not a botched, unintentionally funny film, it's just a bad student/amateur project, complete with shots that aren't locked off (they couldn't afford, or didn't bring a tripod), terrible special effects (they couldn't afford, or didn't learn how to make passable CGI renders), and appalling, stilted performances. (They couldn't afford, or didn't have any friends that could make for an appealing, watchable gig on screen. Not even some local guy from an amateur play or standup show that turned out pretty good. No one.).OK wait: to be honest, Whitney Moore (the pretty girl that appears in the film) does have a natural on screen presence, and given some worthwhile dialog, could be described as \"an actress\". No-one else in this film earns such a description.BUT WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?? I hear you ask. UM, a guy that's come into some money via a stock option following his tech companies upscale takes a pretty girl he used to know in high school on a date. Not long after, giant deadly \"birds\" attack from above, murdering random people, making \"Birdemic\" something of an entry in the \"zombie apocalypse/dystopia\" genre.Except not really, because there's only about 22 birds in the air in the entire film. It's initially hilarious because the visual effects appear to have been done by a fourteen year old with an intellectual disability on some very outmoded Adobe software. The ineptness of director Nguyen's ability to get depth in a shot, continuity or an error-free soundtrack is overwhelmingly apparent throughout. In hindsight, some of the absurdity of the film might strike viewers as funny, but wading through ninety minutes to appraise how bad it was isn't really cooking my boat. Seriously, this is the 2010's and people make 1.40 YouTube clips with more hilarity than this entire production.I have one caveat for this film: in two places, random characters that don't fit into the story appear to deliver bulky, unwieldy bits of dialogue concerning sustainability, ecosystems and the threat of global warming. This alone doesn't really save the picture from being 90% terrible filler and generally an embarrassment. Some people think failure is inherently hilarious. Such people are referred to as \"dorks\".",

It is so terrible it's almost funny. The animation is terrible, the birds literally float in mid air while barely flapping their wings. The acting is almost as bad as the animation, we won't even talk about it. And the first 50 min. of the film has absolutely no point and doesn't have anything to do with the rest of the film. I've made better films with 3 kid actors, Nerf guns, and a $30 video camera in my back yard... and I have proof.

The camera moves about but you can tell the birds are stuck on with CGI not moving the right angles with the camera.

However both of those films at least were somewhat competently produced and therefore can actually be enjoyed as the accidental comedies they are.Birdemic's issue is that it is neither well put together or fun. The first hour or so is unbelievably boring. Nothing happens!In the second half when stuff actually starts happening and the suicidal bomber birds turn up out of nowhere (not kidding) the sound design is so bad that it actually damaged my ears. The issue being that they clearly used one camera to record the audio and video at all times, even for wide shots. So in long shots no matter how loud your volume is you simply cannot hear what the actors are saying. This is usually followed up immediately by an unbelievably loud sound effect like a gun firing or a bird call which is deafening.The editing of this film is pretty bad as well, as at one point a group of people are clapping in a meeting and it dies down. Then the camera angle changes and suddenly everyone is clapping again. This happens about five times in a row... This is like film making 101 and not something that you would find in the high quality productions of Tommy Wiseau and Neil Breen!Everything else about this film like the plot and acting is also terrible, which is likely down to the fact that James Nguyen both wrote and directed this film.There are some so bad they're good moments in the film, like the above mentioned suicide dive bombing birds, but none of it makes sitting through the rest of the film worthwhile. This is one of those films that is just worth skipping entirely. It's simply not worth your time when there's far better so bad they're good films like The Room and Fateful Findings.

Oh no... you did..... and it's with this film \"Birdemic: Shock and Terror\" that a stunning new level of cinematic ineptitude has truly been been achieved. Warning: Sitting through Birdemic is quite the chore, though Rifftrax commentary can make it somewhat more bearable. Lazily plotted, terribly acted and then throw in some of the worst special effects ever seen and there you have it. Birdemic is perhaps the best known example of why amateur film-makers (such as James Nguyen) should stop what their doing and try something else - something entirely different. Because more Birdemic's - The World Needs NOT!This movie is hilariously terrible on all fronts and the awesome level of incompetence that's exhibited by it's writer/director James Nguyen and his cast and crew makes for a rare and uniquely terrible movie experience and like so many other movies I've reviewed Birdemic's only real entertainment value is derived from it's confounding levels of incompetence and ineptitude. The film starts out in the lamest possible way, s-l-o-w-l-y limping to life with the lamest opening credits sequence you will ever see, which is also accompanied by the lamest music you will ever hear. As it turns out it's our hero of the movie \"Rod\" sedately tooling down a winding road, how they thought including his boring daily commute to work would make for a scintillating start to the film is anyones guess, but that is how it is - so with that you're basically bored before it's even really begun. Good going! With as few as words as possible Birdemic is this: Rod, a software salesman, meets a fashion model named Natalie, a few lame dates follow (the type that are loaded with lots of stupid facial expressions, forced smiles, much lame and awkwardly delivered \"getting-to-know-you\" dialog and capped-off with some bad \"white-person dancing\") then a motel room enters the picture where Rod scores (!), the next morning Rod and Natalie awaken to see the worst special effects ever, I mean....... birds, their under-siege by lot's and lot's of birds and as they fumble n' bumble along the way, their epic saga of avoiding this sudden and explainable wrath of avian aggression begins. THE BIRDEMIC IS ON! FINALLY! Factually speaking, it takes over half of Birdemic, for THE Birdemic to actually begin. Yet another example of how terrible this movies sense of pace is, as we observe Rod and Natalie stumbling through time and space, it's pacing remains terrible throughout - and such is the case for every other aspect of this epically wretched movie.What's funny about the whole idea that the world is victim to wide-spread avian scourge, is the fact, that the rest of the people in the movies backgrounds, are just fine and clearly aren't being attacked by anything. This glaring inconsistency is revealed several times throughout the movie, often occurring along roadways in a series of mid and long shots. Nguyen did a terrible job in creating the illusion of mass panic and The Birdemic is strangely localized to Rod and his followers, as they putz along in their happenin' wheels - a dark green Ford Astro Van complete with peeling paint. Consistent with other movies of James Nguyen's, be prepared to see countless many mundane scenes of cars, slowly and tediously pulling off to the side and parking OR (AND FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!) slowly (always very,very slowly) pulling back onto the road. It seems to be something of a directors trademark for Mr. Nguyen - then again many amateur film directors, have been padding the play lengths of their ineptly made films, with just this type of vehicular repetitiveness for decades - but yet somehow, Nguyen has managed some fresh new angles on how to film vehicular monotony. These tedious and frequently recurring scenes contribute greatly to how -insanely boring- Birdemic ultimately is. On the other side of the coin, in the hands of a talented director (someone who is not James Nguyen) Birdemic: Shock and Terror could have been an exciting and entertaining, suspense and action-filled horror film, but.......The actors in this movie are plain terrible - especially the actor who plays Rod, he's particularly slow and awkward when in front of the camera. For instance he can't even walk in a natural looking way and throughout the entire movie his laughably terrible acting has a way of stirring up a lot of unintended humor, it's one of the very few charms of Birdemic - unintentional or not.Something needs to said about the films problematic sound, Birdemic is plagued throughout by a couple of glaring sound issues. First off, on at least half a dozen occasions the sound of the movie COMPLETELY drops out for a few seconds every now and then. Less egregious is the differences in it's ambient sound, for instance, the movie has lots footage that is mired by high levels of background noise and in light of how the film was edited, the noisy footage jarringly cuts back and forth with footage that has a quiet background. These noise issues are very effective in creating a very choppy and uneven, amateurish sound quality - but what the hell else would you expect from the likes of James Nguyen.Then finally we have Birdemic's special effects..........these are easily some of the worst looking optical effects ever seen (save for one certain made-for-TV movie I saw years ago), be it CGI or some other older brand optical FX. I've heard the bird effects are, hilariously enough, nothing more than Gif. file's, that anyone with a PC can download off the internet. Whatever their origin maybe THEY ARE TERRIBLE and redefine what cheap/overtly-faking looking effects are all about. For me it's the effects department, where this film is at it's worst and that is really saying a lot. Conclusion: Birdemic, bad in every possible way.",

I guess they are the biggest and most scariest birds they could find.I think Tommy Wiseau was at least attempting to make at least a decent movie with The Room. I gave this movie 5 out 10 of just because of how crazy this movie is. I really liked the bad CGI in this movie. It's funny seeing those birds just Floating in Air. It's like they levitating or something.",

They force this stupid moral of the save the environment in to your head that you just wanna mash your television. The sound makes an Atari 2600 game sound like HD surround sound for Crysis 2. You can barely hear what people are saying mainly because of background some effects. Music as well is pure crap, it's all free down loadable music from the internet. Only watch this for RiffTrax.

            "content": "Birdemic is the worst movie I've ever seen. Actually, since it has no acting, story or direction, it might not even be called a movie. There's so much wrong with it that I'll just briefly summarize, but it's really better if you watch it yourself, because only then will you believe the bad press this \"movie\" gets.\"Plot\" (Spoilers!!!) So the movie begins with a dude driving (this environmentalist movie has more driving in it than Mad Max and no, those aren't hybrids) aimlessly until he gets to a restaurant. Clearly the sound guys already left to go striking or something because the waitress messes up saying \"Hi!\" (because it's the first line of the movie I thought it was my sound that was off). And from here the movie goes downhill. The lead male then stalks the lead female, who of course gives the creep her number, they go on a date that will forever be called CringeFest 2010. They then go to an abandoned club with a fake singer, then to a hotel where they\u0085sort of\u0085do it\u0085? Then, thank God, the worst CGI birds in recorded history attack by dropping down, crashing into stuff, causing an\u0085explosion? I've seen birds hit windows and explosion isn't among the most likely results. But whatever.They escape swinging coat hangers like back alley abortion doctors and escape, meet some people, people die, they move on, meet a doctor, who tells them it's all caused my man-made global warming without explaining how that turns birds into killer zombie kamikaze demons with explosive wings. Then, my favorite part, they convince 2 recent orphaned children that their car is the safest place (I'm not making this up, it felt like a prequel scene to Child Molestation 3, which would be a better movie than this). They meet a hippie tree hugger who blames humanity some more, they drive of, reach the shore, go fishing, and watch peacefully as the birds\u0085just\u0085 sort of fly away\u0085?Bad stuff All of it is bad. The acting, the lighting, camera work, directing, editing, special effects. It's all just so\u0085inadequate, but not in a good way. The main character is the worst (The Room, for all its flaws, had Johnny, who may have looked like a mix of rock-star, meth-addict and rapist but was still oddly likable): he's literally a Ken-doll piece of plastic with bad timing and a high creep factor. A soldier who has been shooting every time we see him actually says: \"Why don't we give peace a change?\" Was this written by a child? The plug for An Inconvenient Truth is so unsubtle they might as well just have played the trailer. And the birds, oh the birds, they elevate Birdemic from a really, really bad movie to a crime against humanity. But I lost my temper the most (even more than when they need gas, get gas, and drive off without it a little later after the most underwhelmed robbery attempt) when they went fishing. Fishing! Can you imagine ANY ACTIVITY more likely to attract birds than pulling a struggling fish out of the water? Conclusion: I like bad movies. Every month I meet up with friends, we eat pizza and drink beer, and watch 2 or 3 of the worst sounding movies we can find. Since I'm really not such a bad guy and I really do love bad movies, I'm not inclined to give them the lowest marks. The Sharknado's have a few laughs; The Room is oddly charming; Kung Fury was hilarious, Rubber was weirdly intriguing and so on. But Birdemic? I'm sitting behind my laptop thinking of anything good I saw but I'm literally blanking out. If I was forced at gunpoint to name two good things about the movie I'd say that the girl was kinda cute and the cute girl's mother is so sweet she brings some much needed likability in this desperately unlikeable flick. But that's not enough to make a 2 out of a 1. If they had made it as an anti-environmentalist joke it would have been somewhat funny, but it's serious about itself whilst failing and flailing at everything. I'm sorry but this is a 1/10.",

Whilst I don't want to seem to be mocking Birdemic, poor eggsecution makes this aviary hard film to swallow.The dialogue throughout is hawkward, and at times it feels like they are winging it. The cheep special effects are reminiscent of NES classic Duck Hunt, and although they quacked me up they are far from pheasant. The soundtrack is peckuliar at best, and largely consists of long stretches of silence - a cardinal sin sure to ruffle some feathers.

Not only are the birds poorly edited in .gif files, but they explode on impact half the time. And Alan Bagh needs to start conveying emotions. He always sounds disinterested or sarcastic. And I'm not so sure people can die from a bird scratching their face a little bit. And that poster in the movie that said, \"Imagine Peace: Imaginepeace.com\" Don't go there. I went there for 3 seconds, and saw the name Yoko Ono.The plot to this movie is so inconsistent. A man makes success in the stock market. He meets a girl. They start dating. Birds attack. A scientist confirms that the birds have bird flu. Then warns the cast about global warming, but that's not why the birds attacked. They wander into the forest. A tree hugging mountain man warns them about global warming and bark beetles. They get 4 people on a bus killed. The birds fly out to sea despite the fact they're not eagles. I think Alan Bagh was just using this movie as a pick-up line. He met Whitney Moore, asked her if she wanted to be in a movie, and hoped that would be enough to convince her to sleep with him. I doubt it worked.In short: James Nguyen is the France of cinema. Bad movie, fun to watch. Can't wait for Birdemic II: The Resurrection in 3-D.",

We get to see the credits for the actors at the begin of the movie as he drives. And it looks like he has given the camera to someone else to hold luckily but you do see that it is hold. Also obvious.. in the whole movie even during scenes where it should be quite and silent around... other cars drive around with people doing their normal daily things. So during this big nasty even where supposedly people are being attacked by birds. Everybody still drives as normal as if nothing happened. If that was just the only problem...No the worst is shared by three things, the special effects are truly horrible but I guess for the budget I shouldn't complain. No the pushing of Eco Terrorism, I call it that way at almost every point where it is possible. We get a small tirade that we should be better for the planet. And that we should work on better energy methods and we should we should we... kalimero anyone? I don't mind a good thing put into a movie but pushing it in our faces like this makes me want to buy a Hummer H2, And park it right before the house of the director! Also the hero is not truly believable. I Guess he is a friend of the writer or director because lets just say that he can't act. No emotion! It is a walking Mannequin, the first scenes where he meets his love I left feeling as if I watched a Creep! Good done movie! Look I love bad movies, cheap effects sure, acting from Mars hey perfect. Stories that are so not working go ahead love it. This movie is just is a preachy basket full of bovine excrements. All this ECO this ECO that just stalls the movie. And well I am severely unshaken by the Monster. Through I have to kinda like a few things about it..like birds that dive like stuka bombers crash into a fireball and leave a nice fire. Of course all CGI! No yes this movie is bad, but you know the Girl can act! Give her something better then this! She even looks pretty I mean a girl a next door type of Pretty! I would like to see her in movies where she can play with other actors that actually can act. This is not THE ROOM, this is not an enjoyable Monster Movie. In a decent Monster Movie at least the Monster has some screen time. Here the effects are so bad and limited that most of it must have been cut! I don't know if no! Give that girl a better movie that is all I ask. This is not equal to The Room, or even Manos the Hands of Fate. This is.. not even decently riffable! This is a boring Eco Flick of the worst most forced kind. I mean really they did go out on a double to a movie. Guess what movie .. An Inconvient Truth! I rest my case, now I leave to warm up my T34 for my daily shopping trip. Mmm the scent of diesel in the morning!",

Cinemasins sums it up nicely, with his personality being described as \"blank and stalkery\". The girl is better but you can tell she's not taking any of it seriously.

            "content": "Hmm, well this is an interesting film to review, I usually have a lot of fun reviewing films, which aren't exactly at the top of the pile; this is way below anything I have watched before.So let's start off and build our way up to how bad this film truly is; I've seen homemade porn not as bad as this is.1. Camera Work: Now, this is quite minimal in terms of how shoddy the rest of the film is, this is about as good as it gets. But even the camera work is flawed, sometimes the camera even misses the shot of the car it's meant to be shooting; even got some suspicious looking wonky shots too (this could be due to the scenery, but I honestly swear and to be honest it wouldn't surprise me; that some of the camera shots were not level). Overall the camera work was definitely filmed by an amateur or worse, it's like watching a homemade movie filmed by your druggie uncle; who makes a living recording his seedy homemade sex videos and sells them on for heroine; but that's another story.2. Editing: This slowly creeps its way up the ladder in terms of severity, camera work of course being the least worse, in this melting pot of 'shock and terror', ha, see what I did there? Anyway, the editing is very bad indeed. It's like watching a film made by a 15 year old, pizza faced teenager at secondary school (high school for you flash Americans). One scene which shows this the most is with the celebrating-in-the-office-board-meeting thing, it's quite vague; but I can't for the life of me actually remember what that scene was about; apart from a lot of clapping and applauding (literally a lot of clapping and applauding, with lots of dodgy cuts in between). Overall, not good, I mean I can do better with my video editing skills. I may sound really big headed, but I KNOW I can, and film it better.3. Sound: This is very bad, in the first opening line spoken by two of the actors in the caf\u00e9, the audio straight away clips and breaks. I mean, I would give this film some credit and possibly 3 stars if everything else was but the sound was okay, but that's not going to happen, I can bet my left nut on it.4. Acting/Directing/Writing: Decided to include this together, as to be able to make five points, instead of seven. The acting is very wooden, all the actors used are unknown or new talent picked up from the street; where they got them from I don't know, it's as if the Director just popped down the supermarket and thought, \"she's got a nice pair of breasts, let's use her!\" not that he did that with his male casting too. The overall writing from what I can tell is very basic, most of the dialog is basically one line sentences; with very limited plot development among the characters. This film just basically says, \"look birds!\" and, \"oh quick, got to shoot the birds and run away!\" Don't even get me started on the directing...5. Special Effects (lack of): Finally, the best of the best! Well worst of the low in this scenario. The special effects look as though they have been made by a child with a hard on for GIF animation. The birds in this film are ridiculous, when I first saw the film trailer, I originally thought it was someone's film project from college which was being linked to me; was only until I checked here at IMDb that I got the full picture. It's full of over the top muzzle flashes too, when I say over the top; I should probably say very little. I mean okay, the special effects look fake anyway, but the muzzle flashes are too small for a start anyway; don't add insult to injury James!Jesus Christ, I mean I have never had so much to say for one film in my entire life, this doesn't even get anywhere near the infamous Silent Night Deadly Night 2, in terms of production value and acting. This film beats every bad film I know of out there. But let's not get too hasty shall we, for example this film has it's uses, I watched this film knowing it was going to bad; I almost died from laughing too much at the film. This is a film to watch with a group of friends, some pizza and preferably some alcohol; maybe even some hard class a drugs if you're feeling rebellious!So yeah, watch it, but be warned, this is terrible, it's quite boring too. After the sensation of laughing at how bad the film is, you tend to find your hand reaching for the fast forward button.But yeah, well done James, you made an amazing film. (Please don't quote this in your next film trailer).",

If you've never seen Birdemic: Shock and Terror, do yourself a favor - don't wait as long as I did to catch it. It's a movie that has be seen to be believed. Words cannot do it justice. All at once, it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but one of the most fun. Film classes should use Birdemic: Shock and Terror to demonstrate how not to make a movie. Everything you think you've seen done poorly in a movie is most likely done worse here. It's a nightmare. Sound, lighting, cinematography, continuity, acting, and on and on are epically abysmal. It's like watching a slow-motion train-wreck. The two best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) examples of what I'm talking about are the dialogue and special effects. The dialogue sounds so completely unnatural. No one talks like this. It sounds like someone took a foreign language script and ran it through an online translator. And the way the actors deliver these ridiculous lines with a straight face is truly priceless. As for the special effects . . . well, there's really no way to describe them. My vocabulary doesn't include adjectives that can possibly paint a mental picture to adequately describe what's on-screen. You'll just have to watch it to see what I mean. Racking my brain, the only positive I can come up with is Whitney Moore as the female lead, Nathalie. She has more screen presence than the rest of the cast combined.As bad as Birdemic: Shock and Terror is, it's still an absolute blast to watch. I can't remember ever having this much fun with a movie that is otherwise so Gawd awful. I laughed so hard at the birds exploding on impact that I had to stop the movie more than once.

The second part only differs through the addition of about four different animated GIFs of birds superimposed on the screen.Although I could not manage to watch the thing in its entirety for fear of getting an aneurysm, from what I have seen and read in other reviews it must either be intended as ecological propaganda, or it is made intentionally bad to ridicule ecologists. It works in neither way because it is simply too awful to watch. The only \"Shock\" is how this film managed to get as far as it did, and the only \"Terror\" is the sheer awfulness of its production.",

Now after watching it, can say it is truly as terrible as people claim.First the acting is awful. The lead character Rod's delivery and overall tone on which he says his lines are completely unconvincing where he is supposed to come off as across charming or cool yet comes across as idiotic and offbeat. Nathalie is easily the highlight of the film, although she doesn't have the best acting but clearly better than Rod and the other actors.The birds don't actually come into place until 47 minutes. And when they do appear, it is random with no explanation and the cgi looks blatantly fake.A lot of pointless and foolish nonsensical scenes. Including one scene where Rod, and Nathalie stop to help a stranded man yet it turns out the man has a gun and tries to stick them up for gas. What was silly is, right after the man sticks up Rod and gets him to come out of the vehicle to give him the gas tank, a bird appears from nowhere and seemingly attacks the man killing him (we see that the bird was in no reach of the man). Then what makes less sense is Rod leaving the gas tank (and the gun) on the ground then driving away. This was completely irritating for no reason.People compare Birdemic to Tommy Wiseau's The Room, but in no way is Birdemic better, more entertaining, enjoyable or funny. This movie is just all around awful, irritating, forgettable characters, less funny dialogue (no memorable quotables) and the special effects and cgi look awful.Even with a relatively short runtime (less than one hour, thirty minutes), it really feels like it was nearly two hours or longer. It dragged on.",

You know it's not going to get any better, but you keep watching out of morbid curiosity, intrigued by what travesty will occur next.The environmental message adds a moral point, but is delivered in such a heavy, ham-fisted way it can't be taken seriously. The terrible audio issues such as background traffic being louder than the actors, the awful dialogue delivered in broken English, the choice in background music, no attempt at balancing lighting, editing, eliminating background noises, or audio levels shows incompetence in every respect.

Mostly due to the fact that this movie could be used as a torture device for any human being that is a fan of the cinematic art form known as moving pictures. Their are some movies so god awful that they are fun to watch I.E. Sharknado and The Happening. The main difference between those pieces of dog sh*t and this piece of dog sh*t is that this movie thinks its being artsy and delivering a brilliant subtle world altering message while assuming that the audience has the intelligence level of the week old splooge inside the jeans of a ten year old boy tragically born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The movie proves how dumb it believes its audience to be by making all of Rod's business deals with NTC software end in nice even round numbers like 1 million dollars and 1 billion dollars. Then he creates a company in a week and its immediately financed by the dumbest and or laziest venture capitalist group in the world for a nice even 10 million dollars. Then when literally out of nowhere the Birdemic hits for no plausible reason whatsoever the movie starts bashing us over the head with global warming propaganda that was written by that same ten year old with fetal alcohol syndrome I mentioned earlier. This movie was made slightly bearable by the guys at RiffTrax because at least they made me laugh but this movie has made me hate people named Rod and if ever a Victoria Secret cover model walks up to me I'm running away in fear and immediately relapsing on a lethal dose of Heroin you know just in case she even slightly reminds me of this waste of 1.3 GB that the servers of the world will never get back! Oh and yeah forgot to mention that Rod's girlfriend for the movie is a Victoria Secret cover model because we wouldn't know she was a hot soulless mouth breathing waste of oxygen unless the movie told us she was a model! P.S. I'm also an Afghanistan veteran and they manage to throw a why can't we all just get along line from an marine and Iraqi war veteran which is the only realistic part of the movie Army rules Marine Corp. drools na ni na ni boo boo!

Most importantly they will wonder if anyone working on this movie even tried. Birdemic has so many problems it makes the audience wonder if it is a joke. The laughably unrealistic special effects piled upon the underdeveloped plot and stiff acting makes the movie hilariously unrealistic and seems more like a comedy than the horror movie the director, James Nguyan, intended. The plot is basically that of The Birds. Birds go crazy and attack people for no apparent reason, except they are mad at people for not being environmental and something with bird flu. When they attack people they do so by shrieking while making a plane sound, and suicidally crashing into things, such as houses and gas stations, and exploding. The birds do not actually show up until about half way though the movie, and so many things never get explained. Birdemic starts with the main character Rod (Alan Bagh) driving. It shows him driving for almost 5 minutes, and every other little boring detail from his life, like filling his car with gas. He eventually meets up with an old classmate from high school, Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who turns out to now be a model. He then creepy follows her as she leaves the restraint but she agrees to go out with him any ways. Alan Bagh acts as stiff as a sim, like from The Sims 2, as he reacts very robotically to everything, like the way he walks and the way his face appears so stiff and blank all the time. Whitney Moore's acting is average but there is a point where she must have realized how ridiculous the whole movie seemed because at one point when everyone is trying to fend off the birds you can see how hard she is trying to not smile or laugh. The special effects might be the worst part in the movie. The birds do not even appear a little realistic. When on screen they stay in the same spot, squawking and occasionally flapping their wings, and then when the camera moves the birds move as though they are stickers stuck to the same spot on the lens. When the movie shows fire it looks like a fire started on the film instead of the intended target burning. The camera work is poorly done. In the beginning while Rod drives the camera records at a sideways angle. The film and sound editing in the movie is terrible too. The first line spoken in the movie is where the first problem appears. It is a simply a waitress saying \"hi\" but it does not meet up with her talking and there is static audible in the background. With the film editing, multiple times the film will randomly jump skipping a few lines of dialogue. Overall this movie does not have many, if anything, good in it. I do not know they made it. Honestly I wonder if they realized how bad the movie was when they were making it. The only reason I think anyone should, could, or would watch this movie is to enjoy how delightedly terrible bad this movie is in every aspect.",

I'm typing this extremely, extremely slowly, just searching for a way to approach this. I guess I had better start with the most prominent feature of the film.Alan Bagh. I act as a hobby, and I've seen my fair share of terrible actors. But Alan Bagh is worse than the worst actor I've ever seen. Ever. Not just on screen - he's worse than the kid who played the innkeeper in my school Christmas play when I was 5 (his only line was 'No. Goodnight,' and he forgot it). He puts Tommy Wiseau to shame. Whitney Moore is slightly better, but not by much - the most realistic thing about her is that she plays a model for Victoria's secret. I don't even want to talk about James Nguyen, the 'director' and 'writer'. But James, if you're reading this, I want you to know: You're a sick, depraved man. This film has shattered my faith in the art of film-making. I wish I was exaggerating. I wish this was just some joke, but it's not. I think the scariest bit about the film is that... everyone was trying their best. This was the best James Nguyen could do. His best shot. Alan Bagh wasn't acting like that because he was joking. He was acting like that because that's what he thought acting was like. And at the end of the day, they all patted themselves on the back, and congratulated each other on a good day's work. Just let that sink in.Sure, the first 30 minutes are funny. But it slowly turns sour, as you just watch your faith in humanity crumble before your eyes. It's like getting drunk with friends - at first, it's all laughs and in good spirit, but slowly over time it turns into something which threatens your entire wellbeing and the wellbeing of everyone you love. That's what it's like watching Birdemic. At the end of the day, it'll never reach the same cult status as The Room, because while The Room is some semi-playful BDSM, this is like someone holding a blowtorch to your balls. I'm giving this a 1/10 officially, but right after this, I'm going to email IMDb and ask them to put a 0/10 rating in place. Because what was the one point for? What in this film warranted the point? Where was the part of the film where I though 'yeah, this deserves a point'? I'm going to take a nice long shower and have a bit of a cry, now. I'm done.0/10",

In fact the original classic the birds despite being mad many, many years before still has birds that are a trillion times more realistic that the trash in this film (and no that wasn't an exaggeration) They probably would have been better off using kindergarten drawings of chickens than what they used in the film.No matter how unbelievably bad that was, the editing was the worst part of all. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have an editor at all and just used every second of footage they shot. Endless boring scene takes place after endless boring scene, half this movie is the main character driving around in his car! The sound is just as bad, I've seen and heard better from 0$ budget High School films than this.This movie is unbearably awful and boring, it's not like the room for example which is so bad it entertaining, this is just plain stupid. The Director Nguyen should never be allowed to make another movie, and although the film tries to use the noble themes of humanities dependence on fossil fuel and the need to save nature, nothing can save this.

            "content": "Wow. First off, let me point out that there exist two kinds of cinematographic geniuses in the film industry; the best movie makers (ex: Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg etc) and the worst movie makers (ex: James Nguyen). James Nguyen is a genius because no living being in this world has or will ever be able to create a horrible movie nearly comparable to this 90 minute piece of crap.This 'movie' contains every single error or mistake that can possibly be made in the process of making a film, every thing that should definitely never happen in a movie is found in this one, it's almost as though the production team had a checklist of all aspects of film they should disgrace for reasons unknown to me. I bet you if there was a \"make the worst movie\" competition none would come near the level of atrociousness Birdemic: Shock And Terror possesses. The acting is disastrous; Alan Bagh (who plays Rod our hero in the movie) is easily the worst 'actor' in the history of mankind. Acting might be a bit challenging, i know, but you can't even simply walk in a convincing manner? My God, the way he walked towards that restaurant (very obviously prior to the director yelling action!) in the opening scene after the painful ten minutes of pointless and meaningless driving shots through California was just unacceptable. He should be sued for insulting us, nobody should be that bad it just simply does not happen. Then numerous other scenes were he awfully delivers his lines like a robot (His character's name says it all) and performs some the most terrible and absurd actions ever seen on screen. If i had to fully talk about Bagh's awkwardness in this joke of a movie you'd finish your days in front of the computer.Another thing i found hard to believe is the scene where they're in a conference room and when the lecturer announces the good news they start clapping for nearly two minutes nonstop, fading a bit but then picking it up over and over again. Jesus Christ. I understand good CGI is expensive and all since Birdemic's budget was only $10,000 (obviously), but how in God's name can you not perform a minuscule task as simple as a handclap? Do you need ground breaking CGI software for that too? I will never comprehend the secret behind the badness of this film. Birdemic is full of completely pointless and useless plots, subplots and scenes that contribute absolutely nothing or add any knowledge to the life of the movie; it's aim doesn't begin until after 50 minutes of nonsense subplot when the bird attack actually takes place, and the way the latter is introduced is utter disaster. Scenes like when Rod goes to the gas station to get some gas and then continues his way afterwards without anything happening regardless of how greatly it was emphasized are a mystery.Let's see how many worst's Birdemic has: Worst acting, directing, editing, CGI, screenplay, plot, sound effects & mixing, special effects, script, camera operating...Jesus the list goes on and on. I told you they had a checklist...Anyway its directors like James Nguyen who make us realize the huge impact that better movie makers like Quentin Tarantino or Spike Lee have on the film industry. After all, they say you would never notice the beauty of light had you not seen obscurity right? Or something along the lines. Birdemic left me traumatized, seriously, and I by no means refer to its genre. It is an experience I shall probably never overcome and the wound it left me will never heal.So there you have it, make your own judgement on this one.",

But I can't.The reason WHY I can't is hidden in the background of the movie. Deep within actor interviews, 90's style websites and the two commentaries on the DVD (which I saw, by the way) lies the story of long hours, broken promises and probably several felonies.*cue dramatic music*First off, to date director James Nguyen (nu-INN) has paid none of the actors what they were offered. A cursory glance behind the scenes reveals forum posts like \"Still owes me $500\" on the IMDb page for his unreleased movie \"Replica\". The candy bars the children were picking out in the back half of the movie were supposed to partially cover their $100 payment.This leads me into the second point, and that is the multitude of child labor laws broken in making Birdemic. On top of the whole 'never got paid' part, the children worked actually criminally long hours, and without the legally required child acting safety overseer.The scene where the children were rescued even caused police officers showing up while they were filming. Of course, that's bound to happen when you're working with a skeleton crew shooting a scene that involves two guys jumping out of a van while waving automatic weapons around and abducting two kids hiding underneath a car and in its trunk, while two people with fake blood pretend to be dead in the front of the car, and shooting the scene over and over for hours RIGHT NEXT TO A BUSY ROAD.Third point: Mr. Nguyen isn't a very polite man. He was supposedly very controlling of how the movie was created, shooting down questions like \"Why are we cooking the fish raw, without gutting it first?\" mainly by saying \"It's just a movie\". Further questioning of his methods could/would result in threats of removal from the credits or movie entirely, an offer that I'm sure they were all tempted to take up. It's a little-known fact that the character Becky was killed off only because the actress playing her had to leave for art school and Nguyen was miffed about it. So if that scene seemed to come out of nowhere, this is why. The actors were probably highly competent at their jobs, but were forced to act in the method Nguyen insisted upon.I got my copy second-hand from eBay, and I suggest you do the same if you intend to see Birdemic. I don't plan to see Birdemic 2: The Resurrection anytime soon, mostly because of the topless women scene and the intentional overacting. The sequel definitely lacks the charm the original. Also, in case you're wondering, yes, he is in legal troubles now. There's a lawsuit in the works over sexual harassment that allegedly occurred during the shooting of the sequel.",

Minimal funds were spent to enhance the action around the actors.Surrounding the characters, instead of unimportant elements like character development, storyline, or even anything interesting, is a series of far left wing environmentalist messages.There is an entire scene about a solar-panel installation. This wastes some 5 to 7 minuets of the audiences time speak about the sale, haggling over the price and then the camera shows the roof of the house where, presumably, the panel will be installed. Genius! That a solar panel would be installed on the roof. Did the director really have to show us this? Really? Wow...Then we have to listen to green races, green automobiles the actors drive, polar bears starving, the ice caps melting and so forth and so on. I wanted to watch a movie, no bet pelted with radical political rhetoric.This movie makes me want to NOT do environmentally friendly things so the world might end and no more tepid movies like this are EVER made again.One of the worst films I have ever seen.",

Birdemic has redefined human accomplishment; redefined it so thoroughly that I feel a slight sense of disappointment whenever I'm watching something that is not Birdemic. I would pay anything to recapture the feeling I had when I watched this movie for the first time. It's indescribable.The main character, Rod (Alan Bagh), is a computer guy who falls in love while saving the world. The viewer gets a sense of every part of Rod's life, from the nuances and specifics of his computer job to the wild, romantic passions coursing through his veins, to the desperate urgency that only comes when the fate of humanity rests on your shoulders. Every syllable of Rod's dialogue is another perfect note in the melody of this national treasure, written crisp and sharp, delivered with gravitas and precise comedic timing. The fact that Bagh has not received some kind of recognition for his performance speaks volumes about the snobbery and despicable self-congratulatory nature of the various modern film academies.The plot is beautifully conceived and executed. Exploding acid birds are attacking humanity because they don't like cars, and Rod happens to be in the position to stop the madness because he meets a wise scientist who understands what's going on. Look, the specifics aren't that important. What's important is that the plot makes a lot more sense -- more sense, in fact, than any movie I've ever seen. There is not a single plot hole or inconsistency to be found.The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and the animation puts Hollywood blockbusters to shame. The movie conveys its thoughts on such topics as environmentalism, corporatism, relationships, human connection, and knowledge with a poignant elegance that is almost shocking. The film made me laugh, it made me cry, it made my skin crawl, it made me feel emotions I've never felt before, emotions I never knew I even had.Every human being, regardless of circumstance, needs to watch this movie.",

            "content": "For those who suffered this movie, I am here to explain the horror you witnessed and for those who don't want to see it, here's what would have awaited you!This movie is basically a horribly botched version of The Birds by Alfred Hitchcock! YES! I SAID THAT! This movie actually qualifies as a remake, or else there is absolutely no explanation for how this atrocity of a movie came into existence! Just look at it! What planet did this movie come from? They say it's a romantic horror movie, well that's absolute horse****!So the movie begins, and we're already shown a badly filmed car driving into another location! And that is one thing I will actually give it credit for is that this movie somehow had the production budget to film various settings! So anyway, the movie starts off with a complete male nobody stalking a female nobody they have fake sex and then the news report has people talking about global warming and how it can screw up the world and then the birds start screwing up the world. And keep in mind that this is a horror movie so it has a reason to have \"slow buildup\" as if the director is saying \"Hey guys, look at me, this is a horror movie without jump scares! It's a real terror! I'm the next John Carpenter!\" Here's the explanation, birds are killing people because global warming!Just when you thought the most sorry pathetic excuse for a horror movie was Jaws the Revenge, oh no! Imagine watching that movie, without sound editing and unfinished CGI!!!!!!!Good lord! You thought I was kidding, and saw it didn't you! But no, it's true, this actually happened! Unlike Troll 2 which managed to have actual makeup and monsters, this film doesn't have anything! The sound editing is so bad you have to put the TV at max volume to hear anything or put in headphones.By the way, the movie sucks and it has an incoherent plot. Thought there would be character arcs? Yeah, right! People shift personalities and violate established characters with the flip of a coin even if the coin landed on the side you wanted it to be.This is one of the rare cases where the title is 100% accurate in regard to the movie. Look at those words: Birdemic, shock and terror. That sounds horrifying! And when you watch it your brain will be screaming in agony! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!Was this film intended as a torture device? What made anybody think this was a good idea? They did it, because Hitchcock did it! It couldn't have been a coincidence, both films follow the same premise. The world is peaceful and calm with a blond female lead who falls in love a bunch of birds start killing people and attack people violently without reason! If the Birds was about bats I'm sure it would have been the same thing.The reason the Birds works as a movie is because we have characters we care about and we are gripped by the ominous setting and dark tone. The visual effects may be a little dated by today but they were groundbreaking and at times they still look really good! Well, Birdemic, got as far away from this as possible. Every creative decision from the bad sound editing and awful visuals to the dumbass story and boring characters and the overall awful pacing elevate this film to a complete waste of human effort. It's so far from reality it's baffling! How did this come into existence? I don't know! But whatever the case, it's very simple. It failed!0/10. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!",

Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Alan Bagh's excellent portrayal of Rod, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Colton Osborne's mysterious Tony, and even the creepy eagles, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action \"hero that kicks butt\" and \"cannon fodder\" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the eagles with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

And its a pretty big compliment for a mediocre project like this. I had to call Birdemic a project, not a film, not on the merits of production quality but for the ambiguous intentions of the filmmaker.Its not fun, funny, cult or interestingly bad, its just rubbish. Big mistake someone decided to produce and distribute this piece of work. Filmmaker could be an attention seeking muppet or over-confident prick, but distributing, watching and helping others to watch this movie does not justify any of this.Also people should be warned that this movie is not what it seems to be: a mockery of Hitchcocks' Birds, a criticism to polished film making or a tribute to B-movies (such as often mentioned Manos: Hands of Fate, rightfully labelled as one of the worst movies of all times).Lets be clear, it is not one of the 'too good because its too bad' movies. Its downright boring. Amateur acting, constant panning of dull locations in establishing shots, lazy SFX and mediocre script. If it were to be extremely bad (or obviously tried to be bad), we could have a laugh. But not even that happens. I wont argue individuals right to disagree, and there is a bunch of people who find this movie entertaining. Educational, cultural, social and economic backgrounds create great depths between IMDb users.However, the only thing that Birdemic got right is 'the shock and terror'.. which came from the boredom and idiocy it creates. Its a total waste of time, and does not stand to the buzz it creates. Im giving a 3*, because it doesn't deserve the lowest rating.Final words: you have been awarned!

I know nothing about cinematography or stuff like that, but I'm positive I could make a better movie.The actors are awkward and uncomfortable on camera and frequently forget their lines or have periods of uncomfortable silence. The camera lingers on random scenes that have little/nothing to do with the actual plot. There's white noise whenever there's audio that randomly cuts out and starts back up again. The camera is perpetually tilted and the editing is choppy. There are times when you can barely even tell what the characters are saying. All of the conversations and interactions are unrealistic and awkward.The overall plot and characters are flat, the CGI is AWFUL, and nothing makes sense. Everything is completely unrealistic. I mean, they use COAT HANGERS. AS WEAPONS.Watch out for a few scenes, such as:\n1.He goes to get gas and we get to look at the gas station sign for about 10 seconds.\n2.Rod and Natalie go for a walk on the beach. In the background is a guy using a metal detector to comb the shore.\n3.Rod and Natalie go to a crappy hotel (even though he's now a billionaire) and he WATCHES THE NEWS until she comes out. As they kiss, we get a glimpse of her feet, blackened from walking around on the hotel floor.\n4.As they go to the cars, birds attack them and they literally stand their swinging hangers at these terrible CGI birds that aren't really moving.\n5.After the birds start coming, Rod and the others HAVE A PICNIC.\n6.An ornithologist talks about why the birds are attacking and gets a lot of facts wrong.\n7.Whenever Rod way he's the news, the reporter has better audio than any character.\n8.The entire flippin' movie.There's so much more, but the entirety of this movie could never be contained in a single review.There are a few sex scenes where women are seen in their underwear.The entire thing is hilariously awful and you should definitely watch it if you want a laugh.

Anyway after 3 days of heckling I agreed to watch it although a quick internet review search led me to believe this could possibly be the worst film ever made - so I forced him to sit through (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbGkxcY7YFU) as pre-emptive revenge (after I had watched birdemic he said he would have endured watching it 10 times over get me to watch Birdemic even though he did feel sick after the first time).Anyway.. I kicked back one evening and sat through this movie. What emotions didn't hit me as I ploughed through. I felt motion sickness by the end of the opening sequence. Anxious for action to begin after just 5 mins however after 40 mins I wasn't even sure I was watching the right film as it still didn't seem to have started. There were too many scenes that made me feel embarrassed as it was soo bad. At one point I laughed soo hard at the ridiculousness of the plot and storyline that I woke up my wife and baby daughter(which didn't go down very well at all). Absolutely flabbergasted by the special effects, in fact I don't even know what kind of effects they were - revolutionary sprang to mind as I was trying to figure out if it was animation, 3D or .. what?. The coat hanger action sequence was unbelievable (as was most of the film). Confusion over why anyone would have a picnic given the situation. I almost cried with relief at the end.Altogether this film left me in a most peculiar state - Anger aimed at my friend was the initial response however this emotion slowly (Very Slowly buddy!) transcended into something else. Not empathy for the underlying plot - not empathy, something else. I realised what had happened - I was traumatised! I realised that sitting through this movie is an experience that you emerge from a better human being. I could mention Roller-coaster however that clich\u00e9 makes me feel sick nowadays so lets try and elaborate - its like you were given a magic pill before you were allowed to watch the movie. It causes you to shrink until you could fit in an empty Jam Jar and then sealed. Through the see-through glass you are handed to a happy 3 year old who believes your a rattle and violently shakes you until you pass out. When you come to, your back to normal and the end credits are rolling, however you know something just happened to you but you don't know what and you cant find any proof that you were just abused - maybe I should have stuck with Roller-coaster.I believe what happened to me was similar to what can happen in certain hostage situations. The Hostages over a period of time feel adulation and feel positive feelings towards their captors - the technical term for this is the 'Stockholm Syndrome' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome). The Stockholm Syndrome hit me hard and the next day I was ranting about what a master piece of modern film this was to anyone who would listen - in fact I have got 3 people to watch it since that weekend and they are now passing on the message to their friends. Why? The purpose is that you cant share your experience with someone who hasn't seen it, as they just don't understand, they may read a review and say - \"why would I want to watch that\".Until you watch it you can never understand what the genius of this actually is. My view on this movie is that the director wanted you to feel his pain, wanted you to understand how difficult it was to make a movie on Tesco vouchers, wanted you to experience all the feelings of watching his masterpiece movie that he knew he could never make so he gave you all those feelings by reversing the 'good film, plot, special effect' guide developed by Hollywood and translated it into Birdemic. I think all the worst parts of this film was preconceived and deliberately made bad to prompt the reactions it does from the audience - that in itself is the genius! Anyone who has watched this film is in an elite club, they know and they cant wait to pass on the word.Despite what anyone else thinks my short summary is: I love many movies however I don't write a god damn review about them. Anyone who hasn't seen this ought to as you cant talk about it until then. Any movie that can make me take an hour out of my life to write about my experience from watching it cant be that bad.",

I don't think there is any world where the film makers where making this and said to themselves, this is going to be the most realistic movie out there with some of the best performances anyone has ever seen. No, that just didn't happen. It has to be this bad on purpose.The movie is bad, in fact its so bad that in some aspects it's funny. You will be laughing throughout the whole movie i mean the logic is bewilderin bad and the birds... omg the birds have to be the best part of this movie. Every time you see them you can't help but laugh. It's so mind numbingly bad that it's genuinely funny.The more i think about it, the more it hits me that i can not remember a scene that is genuinely boring. It manages to keep you entertained throughout all of its goofiness and flaws.

The dialog makes no sense and doesn't move the story forward at all. This is also the most slow-paced movie ever. Every scene is painstakingly dragged out. After watching for ten minutes it will seem like thirty. At the same time it feels like you've only been watching for one minute because absolutely nothing has happened. Not until half way through the movie does any action start. And when it does, you'll wish it hadn't. It's horrible and indescribable. Before you decide to watch this movie try to watch a clip on youtube or something just so you know what you're getting into. One last thing; the propaganda.

I don't regret watching the movie, but I don't see myself wanting to watch it again.The birds are the same two poorly animated models (an eagle and a sea gull), they flap around making the same annoying sound, the guns are obviously air soft guns, the birds only have about 2-3 dying animations.

Not even \"The Room\" comes close.The acting is equivalent to something you'd find in porn. The soundtrack consists of cheesy stock music, and both the sound and visual effects are mediocre. They also chose some really poor locations for the scenes. The characters are not pricks like in The Room, but most of them are fillers, especially Rod's friend and Mai (the Asian girl). Speaking about characters, Rod and Nathalie are super successful. Nathalie is a model and Rod is a software engineer/salesman. Everything is going well in their lives. They were also one of the only people to survive the attacks. \"Birdemic\" was made to teach people about environmental causes like global warming, forest fires, etc... so the film is full of blatant propaganda. For example, Mai wears a shirt with \"IMAGINE PEACE\" written on it, and Rod buys and sells solar panels. The characters also find a ornithologist on their journey and a \"tree hugger\" with a $1.99 wig.So, in short, \"Birdemic\" is truly awful, and the worst of all is that it's completely serious.",

First off, the actors, they can't walk properly. I'm not joking. During the intro scene it is most obvious; the main character Rod, when he exits his car in the first scene after the long and boring credit sequence, walks as if he has a stick shoved in his backside. The rest of the actors are no different, their movement is not fluid, which leaves out many scenes awkward and generally boring. Besides movement, the actors are incapable of making spontaneous conversations, nor convey proper human emotion. There is no character development within the story, this movie really wants you to feel connected to the characters, but it fails miserably due to bad acting. Talking about story, I can summaries the whole plot in a few words. Guy meets girl and takes her out. Guy gets filthy rich, somehow. Guy and girl go out and have sex. Guy and girl meet killer birds. Guy and girl try to survive bird apocalypse with other people. Short tragedy happens, movie ends abruptly. Yeah, the story isn't complex in any stretch of the imagination, but simplicity does have beauty if its presented well; sadly the movie is not presented well, by the performance of the actors, as well as the overall cinematography, which has the quality of a school video project. The music, there is very little of it, it's not nice to the ears and it loops. There are story segments that don't make sense; as I said earlier, Rod and the girl meet up with a bunch of people, a man and a woman. The man has a 9mm pistol and a assault rifle, yes, a assault rifle, stashed in his car, which they use to kill the birds. By the way, the guns have unlimited ammo. And nice muzzle flashes. As final note, the movie is filled with goofs. You can tell that this done with quickly with no real effort put in. One of the characters the woman, vanishes, then comes back out of nowhere. No really, she does.Save your brain cells, don't watch this movie.",

It was like watching the campy old Batman television series during the villain scenes, as the camera was almost never level. In order to make it seem level, I had to almost constantly tilt my head slightly to the left or the right. Mostly the left. I was also amused to see the occasional finger getting in front of the lens, or the shadow of the hand blocking the lower left portion of the shot. Of the sound, much could be said, but none of it would be good. The dialogue, when it could be heard over the background noise, was trite and preachy environmentalist drivel pulled off whatever web site happened to be convenient at the time the script was written. Seldom could the actors be heard clearly, and much fun can be had in trying to make up dialogue that goes with the scene at hand.On the plot . . . It is incoherent and inexplicable. If my neck were in less pain, I might be able to piece together some sort of explanation from the few words I could hear spoken during the film. The basic impression is that the birds of the region have gotten angry about man's use of fossil fuels and are taking their revenge by learning to hover, making airplane sounds, and taking kamikaze dives (complete with explosions upon impact) at gas stations and random buildings. Or maybe they just snapped under the pressure of being endangered species trying to reproduce enough to maintain their population.The movie clearly has access to the fourth dimension, as the first forty minutes of it seem to take somewhere between two and sixteen hours, plodding from scene to inexplicable scene of mundane living in the life of Rod the super-software-solar-paneling salesman and part-time creepy stalker. Similarly, there is no indication of how much time passes in the movie, save that our intrepid (and mind-numbingly boring) heroes seem to keep running out of water (but never gas).Countless slow driving scenes on side roads, endless bad editing cuts, tilted camera, awful sound quality, and anatomically impossible hovering birds with inexplicable motives rendered this movie almost intolerable, save that, with enough alcohol and a few good friends to laugh along with you, it can have some merit. Enough to earn it a 0.5, but the voting doesn't go that low.",

It is a true horror-movie classic.At the beginning of this film, Rod, who is a highly successfully computer-software salesman meets Natalie, an equally successfully fashion model. They start dating and soon, their friendship evolves into a passionate romance. Rod and Natalie along with their friends and family seem to be living an absolutely perfect life where nothing could possibly go wrong.However, a news report about a flock of seagulls causing a major traffic accident makes it abundantly clear that they and so many others will soon be suffering unspeakable hardships.The suspense builds as Rod, Natalie and their friends go about their lives totally oblivious to the extreme danger they will soon face.Then the birds attack and kill large numbers of people! It becomes a grim struggle for survival as Rod, Natalie and their friends try to defend themselves from the attacking birds while rescuing people they meet along the way. Just when it appears that their situation couldn't get any more desperate, they become stranded in a forest just as a raging forest fire breaks out! They must escape from the rapidly spreading flames while at the same time defend themselves from large flocks of attacking birds. Will they be able to survive such unimaginable disasters? Watch this film and find out! The great thing about this film is that it starts off slow with steadily building suspense followed by sheer terror! James Nguyen will definitely be remembered as the Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st Century! Be sure to see this film if you get a chance. It is truly amazing!",

Then it is followed by a scene where our heroin Nathalie says \"hi\" without even moving her lips.Fast forward almost 40 minutes of a boring, intrascendent subplot about sex, pumpkins and a nonsensical deal. Our heros are trapped on a cheap motel (despite Rod being a millionaire) when all of a sudden and out of the blue, birds start attacking and exploding. What do they do? Grab some coat hangers as weapons and run to a van.After some minutes of annoying chirping sounds and random events, our heros stop by some pullover cars. They find a girl (Susan) hiding below a car and a boy (Tony) trapped in a trunk. Now, why is this kid trapped there? I remember being a kid, and I'll never choose a trunk that cannot be opened from inside as a temporary shelter against angry birds.Cut to all our friends riding in the van. The kids are in the back seats, and we assume they're mourning the losses of their fathers. Right? Well, not quite. They are timid at first, but soon we can see Tony holding a handheld videogame of sorts, and sharing it with Susan. So much for kids that just lost their parents. And, how they knew the name of the boy? In the movie, they don't ask.Now our heros are pulling over to take some water and food. Birds appear high in the sky, chirping. Our heros go back to the van and leave. But where's Becky?A cowboy appears after our friends decide it's time to buy some gas (seriously, who stays in a gas station when outside there's a bird apocalypse?). He demands to buy some gas (when he clearly can just steal it, as he got a gun). That cowboy receives an insta-karma from the birds, but what our hero do? He leaves both the gun and the gas canister on the side of the road, when he clearly can pick both items up.After all this nonsense, my brain hurts. The only thing that I remember is our group arriving at a coast to watch how the birds are flying away into the open sea.This entire movie is just a bunch of events put together without any criteria. I feel sorry for the kids; they were part of such an awful thing, their careers are ruined forever.",

It's so incredibly boring, you can miss like twenty minutes of the movie and come back and you would not have missed anything at all.\"When I actually watched the movie, I didn't expect it to be so bad. But twenty minutes in, I got bored and started reading a book with the movie as background noise. As soon as I remembered the movie was still on, I was 40 minutes in on the movie, and absolutely nothing had happened. I didn't miss a thing when I got distracted.If you're taking a class on film-making and you need to know what NOT to do when you make a movie, this is the movie for you. It's 42 minutes of literally nothing. The conversations are awkward and the acting is worse than sitting through an elementary school's play/musical of the year.Opening scene of the movie! FIVE. SOLID. MINUTES. OF A CAR DRIVING WITH CREDITS ON THE SCREEN. Accompanied with the same 15 second clip of music looping over and over. I think the editor thought they could get away with not actually creating a song for the credits and just looping the same 15 second jungle over and over instead. After this horrid opening, the first half of this movie was spent on establishing a relationship between Rod and Natalie. Rod, a man horrible conversational skills and rizz SO BAD that a woman would probably want to sew her legs together, and Natalie, the world's most airheaded model, had met in high-school and bumped into each other in a restaurant as adults. When Natalie leaves, Rod chases after her and asked Natalie to stay in touch, which she agreed to. They both get accomplishments at work, yay! They call each other and Rod asks Natalie on the most random date ever. I'm pretty sure I just summed up the first 15 minutes of this movie. They go on a date, they go on another double date with her friend and her friend's boyfriend, there's a random sex scene with her friend and the boyfriend, she introduces him to her mom.Oh, and I forgot to mention the previous foreshadowing, referring to the birds. One scene of the news reporting dead birds. Okay, moving on.Rod and Natalie go to the beach... The audio quality in this scene is truly DREADFUL. You can't understand a single word, even if you were trying to. I think they recorded this movie on a Samsung S3 with dollar store bluetooth headphones for the microphone. Because my childhood iPhone FOUR had better quality than this entire movie.Honestly? If you want to save precious minutes of your life that you'll never get back, skip 42 minutes into the movie. Because you'll get to see the absolutely most abominable scene in the history of cinema. The sex scene between Ron and Natalie. We start on a slow pan of Natalie wearing nothing but underwear and a bra, paired with unfortunate camel toe. So nice that they at least got her a matching set... And then we cut to a scene of them making out. And let me tell you, I don't think EITHER of these actors have ever kissed anyone in their lives. Because if they did, I wish 20 years of therapy on whoever either of them have kissed before the production of this movie. The kissing was horrible. It was so clear to tell that neither of them knew how to kiss. They looked like they were just mashing their faces against each other and opening and closing their mouths. I literally gagged. The amazing camera man panned down their bodies as this scene happened, going from their heads to their toes. WHY WERE THEY RUBBING THEIR FEET AGAINST EACH OTHER LIKE THAT??!!! I NEED TO KNOW WHAT COMPELLED THE FEET RUBBING BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MOST GRIM THING IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE. THE *TRUE* SHOCK AND TERROR OF THIS MOVIE WAS THAT HORRENDOUS SCENE..... JESUS CHRIST...Anyways, after my favorite scene, they cut to the following morning. Calmness, showing the town. AND OUT OF THE BLUE, THE MOST CONFUSING THING EVER?? UGLY CGI BIRDS FLYING AROUND AND EXPLODING AND SCREAMING.... THE CGI IN THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD OH MY GOD, and I don't think they even ATTEMPTED to make the birds scary. It was just looping gifs of fake 3d birds flapping their wings. AND FOR SOME REASON THEY EXPLODE TOO?? WHAT WAS THE REASONNN!!!?? The rest after the birds were revealed, the rest of the movie was just bird cawing, screaming and gun shots.Frankly, I turned off the movie 10 minutes after the birds came in. It was sensory hell for me, as an autistic person who's sensitive to loud noise and too much noise at once. I truly do recommend this wretched movie. I refuse to believe that it isn't satire, I refuse to believe that it is a genuinely serious movie. You need to watch this movie at least ONCE if you appreciate the art of cinema.",

The birds in this movie look just awful. These birds apparently have the ability to hover in front of people because reasons. Also little known fact you can fight off birds with coat hangers. All the people that die in this movie die of stupidly as everyone seems to pullover and roll there windows down and let the birds claw them to death. On top of that they try to hit you over the head with anti global warming and Iraq bull that your really not in the mood to hear at this point. This movie is one of those special films that make other movies look better. Watch this and you'll never complain about how bad a movie is again this makes the catwoman, the room, and sharknadio look astounding. By the way the ending is bad to.

The only good things about this \"film\" were seeing locations that I recognized, and seeing a few attractive actresses in bikinis. Thank God they didn't do any nude scenes. These poor young ladies would have lost chunks of their souls had they exposed themselves for the sake of absolutely the worst cinematic creation possible. Watching it made me ashamed to be human. I knew Birdemic would be bad, but I thought it might be fun to watch a cheesy horror film. It wasn't. And I know you will think that what I'm about to write next is an exaggeration, but I swear to you it is not: I recently got a molar pulled in the dentist's office, and this experience was far more enjoyable and far less painful than watching Birdemic.

The foreshadowing of the Health Care Stimulus and global warming under the Obama administration was intelligently crafted into the harrowing story of Alan Bagh's character, Rod, and his adventure fighting the suicidal and vicious eagles and hovering vultures. This movie clearly shows why our country needs a leader as fearless as Sarah Palin, a maverick above her peers.

Somehow I have managed to get this far into the review without mentioning the birds, possibly because they take 45minuites to show up, they are quite possibly some of the worst computer generated birds I think I've ever seen, I'm assuming they were made with 'Microsoft paint 1976 edition' as that seems to be the quality I'm receiving from the utter trash.

I love hearing the same 10 second clip over and over for three minutes straight. Also, the camera man seems to hold the camera with one hand, causing the entry sequence to ruin any respect it had. -Dialogue is extremely stale. While the creator attempt to spread awareness for global warming, just about everything was uninteresting and horrible. The audio was unbalanced with the surroundings to the point where i had to turn up and down the volume on several occasions. The main actor seemed extremely uninspired and mostly in it for the cash. -The disappointing CGI hurt my soul.

The audio is so bad that the quality changes in the middle of scenes; outdoor scenes at the beach are inaudible because there is absolutely no editing of the audio. The entire plot is pointless, with the first bird attack happening halfway through the movie. The effects....wow. There is one terrible scene with birds attacking in the absolute worst imaginable animation of all time, clip art from Microsoft Office essentially. They couldn't even get a stuffed bird to serve as a dead bird, they use clipart instead. There are 3 animations for the birds throughout the entire film, the first 2 which are reused over 10 times. I can't actually....I can't finish the review. This movie is an abomination...it's an insult to everyone that watches it, it's so bad it's not even worth watching for the laughs.

The initial movement's main ideology (Pan-Serbism) was to unite all Serbs (or all territory historically ruled or populated by Serbs) into one state, claiming, depending on the version, different areas of many surrounding countries. The Greater Serbian ideology includes claims to territories in modern-day Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and the Republic of Macedonia. In some historical forms, Greater Serbian aspirations also include parts of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece (Thessaloniki, Macedonia), Hungary and Romania. Its inspiration comes from the memory and existence of the relatively large and powerful Serbian Empire that existed in 14th century Southeastern Europe prior to the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans.

If its bad on purpose then wow, maybe this is the greatness of this director because you really get the sense that this is not a mockery but that they are earnest in there presentation of this story.There are some events where this movie works great, like an all night youth party or just projected silently on the wall at a dance party or something.Have fun and enjoy this movie.",

I watched this film with my two kids, and now they are demanding a birdemic theme room. The cinematography in this film was second to none, there were even some parts of the movie where I was wondering if they trained real birds to play the birds shown in the movie. The love story between the main characters displayed a pure and tender love between two characters that we are gifted the pleasure of watching grow in front of our eyes. The passionate love scenes were enough to bring a tear to a glass eye. This is a movie that I look forward to returning to in the years to come, and I have a feeling that April 20th, 2022 will forever be instilled in my mind as the day that my life changed for the better. I would like to personally thank James Nguyen for opening my eyes to a new genre of film, I feel as if I owe him my life.",

From the world building to the setting, everyone in this movie has their own enjoyable qualities and characteristics. Starting off as an enjoyable romantic comedy then going straight into a horrifying masterpiece. James Nguyen is truly one of the most amazing directors in the world, featuring a truly uprising and spectacular soundtrack provided by the likes of Andrew Seger. These outrageous and biased critics giving this movie an 18% on metacritic who go against all of my opinions towards this beautiful beautiful movie.

            "review_title": "Barrier Breaking",
            "content": "Birdemic: Shock and Terror, where to begin. This film is on a whole new level. No one has ever attempted something so risky before, but the results are phenomenal. Director James Nguyen mastered the art of a romantic horror movie. I cried, I screamed, I hid under the covers, but I couldn't look away. I have never seen something so beautiful in my life. In this review I will break down every aspect of this barrier breaking film, so please join me on this journey through Birdemic: Shock and Terror.\nLet's start with the main part of every film, the acting. It is the best acting I have ever seen in any film. Rod (played by Alan Bagh) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore) had a real love connection in this film. After the film ended I wiped the tears from my eyes and had to know if these two actors were married. I was heartbroken when I found out they weren't truly together in real life. They were perfect for each other and I was angry that the birds had to attack them and ruin these two who showed true emotions for one another. I cannot even begin to fathom how much practice and skill all of the people in this film had. They knew every line. They spoke with confidence and pride. The phone scene for example, these actors showed how much they were interested in each other's lives. You could learn a thing or two from Rod and Nathalie's relationship. And the basketball scene too. The NBA better get to Rod before he gets too involved in acting because he has some great skills on the court. But emotions were another big part of this movie. (!SPOILER ALERT!) When Becky (Catherine Batcha) was killed by an eagle I collapsed onto the floor. I felt the world crumbling down around me. I felt like I knew Becky on a personal level and it was like one of my closest friends getting killed by an eagle. But it doesn't end there. The emotion demonstrated by Ramsey (Adam Sessa) was overwhelming. I had to pause the film and I was apologizing to Ramsey. I cried out, \"Why? Why did they have to take Becky away from Ramsey? I am so sorry Ramsey! I wish I could be there with you!\" And in a way I did feel like I was there with him. I can't make you watch this film, but if you saw any number of great Oscar winning movies you must see this. I thought I knew what good acting was until I saw Birdemic: Shock and Terror.\nLet's move on to the next category, the sound and editing. I don't know what camera they used in Birdemic: Shock and Terror, but I wish I did. I know that the quality wasn't too great, but if you watch Birdemic: Shock and Terror and then watch another movie that came out in 2010 you will know what I mean when I say, the way they filmed this revolutionized the whole film industry. The film moves so smoothly. Like a knife cutting through warm butter. It almost appears as if the whole film was taken in one long shot. Amazing. The sound was also absolutely incredible. Every word these amazing actors and actresses spoke was crystal clear. This amazing audio adds to the effect of this film and its greatness. And the music. How could I ever explain to you the music in this film? I can't. You must listen to its soundtrack to know what I mean. My favorite song from this movie was sung by the Nightclub Singer (Damien Carter). This song is hands down my all-time favorite song ever. And with Rod and Nathalie dancing to it made it even better. They knew some great moves and demonstrated them perfectly in this film.\nOnto the next category, the plot. Never have I been so intrigued with a plot. It had so many twists and turns in this movie. And much like the filming it went so smoothly. Everything the characters did made total sense. I really made a lot of connections with the real world because of this plot. I think it is amazing how a film, like this one, can transport you to a whole new reality. Many great films have plot holes, or they lag at some point. This movie had neither. And director James Nguyen brought attention to the global warming crisis. If we don't start using hybrid cars or solar panels birds will soon start flying into the streets exploding on impact. This film isn't only a work of art, it is also a warning. Do you want your eyes to be eaten out by a CGI bird? I think not, so we need to change, and this film taught me that. The theme of this movie was much deeper. It hit me right in the heart. The theme of course being, if birds ever attack get a lot of gas before the gas prices go up to $100.00 a gallon. In the end I learned that we need to clean up our Earth or prepare for a full blown Birdemic. We would be filled with shock and terror.\nNow the final point in my review, the special effects. While watching this film I was generally concerned for the safety of these actors (but luckily they had totally real guns and coat hangers). I thought the birds were real this entire movie. It wasn't until after the movie when I did some research that I found out the birds were (!SPOILER ALERT!) FAKE! That's right all you moviegoers, the birds you saw in Birdemic: Shock and Terror were all fake. They were just animated. I had to watch Birdemic: Shock and Terror a second time because I couldn't believe they were animated birds. Can you believe that they were fake? I sure can't. I think that is one thing they are lying about. They just looked too realistic. I mean the sounds alone made me think there were birds flying around my own home! It was crazy. Speaking of sounds I want to warn you: you do NOT need to call the police when you hear them fire their guns in Birdemic: Shock and Terror. I will repeat myself: you do NOT need to call the police when you hear them fire their guns in Birdemic: Shock and Terror. When I heard the first gun shot I hid behind my coach thinking someone was firing at me. I was about to call the police when I realized that it was only more special effects. My mind was blown. I couldn't believe it.\nWhen the credits started rolling at the end of Birdemic: Shock and Terror I stood up and started clapping. Tears were streaming down my face. I couldn't believe it was over. James Nguyen never ever received the credit he deserved for this revolutionary film. I tell you if you haven't seen this movie you NEED TO. Children in schools should be required to watch this film because it is part of our history and soon to be part of our future if we don't change our ways. I would like to say one thing to all the people mocking this movie, how dare you? How dare you mock this masterpiece? Could you do better? NO. YOU COULD NOT. Any movie made after Birdemic: Shock and Terror is just trying to achieve something they will never be able to achieve because Birdemic: Shock and Terror has already claimed it. Please watch this movie, it has changed me, and it will change you. I urge you to also bring a box of tissues with you wherever you go to see this movie. You'll need them. Thank You.",

But it's time for her to go to work, and they part ways. By the way, about the professions of our heroes. She is a fashion model who shoots in cheap rags in a basement (you can't call their 'studio' any other way). He is a sales manager, a typical \"office plankton\" who sometimes makes big deals and chats with a colleague in the office during breaks. But this is not the most important thing. Unlike the movie \"Birds\", which did not specify the cause of bird rabies, in \"Berdemika\" everything is chewed to the maximum, even a baby will understand. Our main characters are the only ones in the whole city who lead (or try to lead) a lifestyle without harming the environment. Judge for yourself: Rod installs a solar panel on the roof of the house, drives a hybrid car (but refuels with gasoline for some reason), and also seems to like to walk in nature (although this is a controversial statement). His girlfriend, apparently, is from the same test, there is nothing more to say about her. Everything else in this film is secondary, has a crooked production and looks stupid. Well, maybe even that weirdo who lives in unity with nature in the forest.Let's summarize. Poor work of film and sound engineers, sluggish acting, weak script, long dances, long ovations in the office, long car rides, a protracted bed scene, special effects at the elementary school level, predictability of the plot, abuse of clich\u00e9 phrases, a forced climax and the same mediocre ending of the film.

The death scenes are not scary or sad at all, and the most emotion I got out of this movie was laughing when a bird just randomly falls on the protagonist's car. I'm not critic, but frankly this is a bad movie. In case you want to watch this for the bad bird CG-I, I wouldn't recommend that either. The first 30 minutes of this movie is an absolute slump to go through. No birds until about 45 minutes in, and you'll waste about 4% of your day watching this. Overall, 1/10. If you want to watch a bad movie and make fun of it, I would recommend this only if you are prepared to make fun of constant reuse of ArrowHead Water, and real companies being used and shown in this movie.

It's so freaking(not going to swear cause I might not be allowed to) bad! How bad do you ask? So 100,000,000 times bad! Looking at a rock all day would be better than this movie. Here are my reasons:1.) Terrible effects, since it had no studio support.2.) The conflict of the plot occurs 40 minutes later in the movie. And the conflict scene just shows up. *Sighs* Where did they even get this idea?3.) The acting was bad, but the guy who played Rod did his acting horrifically terrible. I've seen wood, but nothing is terrible than this guy.4.) The birds are just floating around doing nothing when they attack. They just hover around. Even when they attack the main characters while they try to get in their car. Comeon Becky! Turn those god darn keys! 5.) \"So you're a tree hugger?\" lol6.) They forgot the gas tank while they were trying to get away. No wonder he ran out of gas. Should've thought of that...7.) You also get to see everything this guy does. (Warning: Spoiler!) You don't do that in a horror movie.8.) The main characters' names are just Rod and Nathalie... No last names? 9.) The ending sucks. The birds just get chased away by doves. Doves... Yeah they just fly away. What is the point of that. 10.) Out of the most ridiculous of this, is the sex scene. The way he looks at her in her underwear just kills me. \"No! Oh god! Nope stop! Now you stop that foot s*** right now!\" -Jontron Those are the reasons why this movie is terrible. Also the scene on the bridge does remind me of the hermit that asks questions on the Bridge of Death in Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail. \"What....is your favorite color?\" This is what I think of the movie.

This, and the poor dialogue in the beginning made us burst out laughing and gave us high hopes for what was to come.The first half of the movie prior to the \"birdemic\" itself was pretty much what we expected, it was so bad it was really quite entertaining. However, when the apocalypse finally started we were quite disappointed... The scenes were really, really long and extremely repetetive, and there was no real goal or plan? They were just driving around, trying to save people and killing birds (this whole sequence could have been either a lot better or a lot shorter). Of course, it was lovely to see the worst animation of birds in the history of the cinematic universe, but it was not for as long as we ended up doing it.Another big disappointment was not hearing the great song used in the trailer in the movie itself. We were both expecting to hear it when the disaster began. That would have made the movie slightly better and probably less repetetive in the apocalyptic scenes, they probably could have used the song several times (like they did with some other parts of the soundtrack, playing it twice in a row).So all in all, it is definitely worth a watch! Would be nice if someone could trim down the bird scenes and fix that part a little, but overall one of the best worst movies ever. Still not entirely sure if the movie was made as a joke or not, the rather surprising environmentalist theme makes me lean towards that it wasn't.",

Despite this, I think everyone should watch this movie. It's probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, although this humor is unintentional. It has many memorable scenes, and the first half is boring, but once the action starts it gets a whole lot better. I spent the entire second half of the movie laughing. So as bad as it is, Birdemic is worth the watch.",

And I am here to say that this movie is nowhere near those in terms of entertainment value.Why? This movie is entertaining at first, but when it becomes obvious that the makers of this movie purposely tried to make a bad movie and create a 'cult' following and have screenings the way The Room has, it loses all credibility. James Nguyen is a complete phony and its really easy to see through what he is trying to do here. I could get a camera and take it outside and try to make a movie and make it really bad, but that doesn't count. It only counts if there is some heart in the movie and the makers actually tried to make it a good movie. If you want to see a movie like that, watch The Room, Manos: The Hands of Fate, Troll 2, Garbage Pail Kids, or Glen or Glenda, not this rip-off.",

There is one thing that bothers me though. Memes?? Why did they put a MEME in the middle of the movie? It totally ruins the atmosphere. Anyway, I must give props to the camera man as well. The use of multi-camera shooting and editing was also well present. Thank you for this fantastic movie.",

The acting, editing, camerawork, writing, special effects, pacing, all come together to make a terrible movie that is, essentially, two different movies put together: The first half is a poorly written romance where nothing of meaning happens and the second half is a terrible \"horror\" movie with eagles and vultures that are portrayed using the worst CGI plastered haphazardly onto the worst green screen, both of which have a convoluted environmental message that is just thrown in. I'm only giving it 1 star because that is the lowest score the site would allow, but if I could give this film a zero, I would give a zero. Don't watch this movie, life is too short and precious to waste on this trainwreck.",

            "content": "this movie has been called \"the worst movie ever\" and it seems like that is the public opinion. but to really appreciate the film you have to look past the dodgy acting, effects that look like copy and pasted Gifs found on google, and the severe lack of explanation in the films plot.despite the film being titled Birdemic, and the plot being \"a horde of mutated birds attack the quiet town\" no birds even appear until 47 minutes in, almost half way through the movie. And in the first 47 minutes there is also no mention of birds. at all. the film does absolutely no job of explaining how the birds became mutated, why they are attacking people or even that the birds are mutated at all. the film is labelled as a Horror, Romance and Thriller movie, but the most appropriate label would be comedy, as the lame effects, and tedious acting and script combine together to make the movie as funny as it is hard to watch. it is obvious the film had a low budget (most likely 4 thumbtacks and a crumpled up $1 note the director found in pocket the morning of filming) and it really shows throughout. the film has the visual quality like the cameraman was using a potato with a smudged camera lens loosely duct taped to the front and the audio quality is not much better.the scene 51 minutes into the movie is the best example of the films quality. it shows the main characters leaving from a hotel room out to a car they have outside, and while one of the characters makes a feeble attempt to unlock the car, the others flail coat hangers in such a pathetic way it looks like they are trying to swat flies with air. while they are doing this the birds attack them outside the car, the lack quality of the birds here is fully shown, with only 2 models of birds used, differing in only colour, the birds flap their wings almost in unison as they hover, perfectly still (of course as birds can do) in front of the \"actors\". the lack of quality here is also shown by the merging of the bird effects and the film of the actors swinging coat hangers incredibly poorly, as you can see in the film, the birds are just openly pasted in front of the film and no attempt to match the quality of the film or provide any additional effects to make them look any less out of place has been done, making the scene hilarious where they clearly intended it to be frightening. overall this movie is poorly edited, combined with unbearable acting and a tedious script and created the so called \"worst movie ever\".the movie itself has been released for several years and has birthed sequels that have also failed to deliver. this movie is far from what it claims to be, and despite all the negative things said about this film, and the 1.8 rating given on the film's IMDb page. i recommend this film to everyone, on it's sheer comical side alone. when taken seriously this movie is a disaster, but if you head into this film prepared to laugh,it is a great film to sit around with your friends and watch for a good laugh. 10/10 would watch again (for cringe value alone)",

I'll show you where you can shove your sno-caps.\"But that's not all, you'll also get to meet \"pair of children who randomly disappear between shots,\" \"couple who still manages to feel like a third wheel,\" and of course, an ending even more disappointing than Revenge of the Nerds 5This beautiful work of art will no doubt be regarded as the greatest masterpiece humanity has ever given to the world.Review 3: No. Seriously. This is the worst movie ever. I feel the glorious hand of Satan in every written word, in every bit of \"acting.\" My keyboard is short-circuiting from the tears I cried and the blood leaking from my eyes.

            "content": "I don't even know what to say about Birdemic. It was a roller coaster of a movie seeming to change at every turn. There were many scenes that were just...uncomfortable to watch. Multiple times throughout this visual experience actors just disappear, and wackass narrative decisions are consistently made by the \"writer\" (if there even is one). I think an illiterate man could write a better script. The plot is a crime against film and it is proven when the first line of the movie is finally spoken after the 4 minute drive to nowhere: \"hi\". The acting in this film was so vulgar that I was gagging in the middle of this movie. Whoever played Rob has no talent. Nathaline is always smiling, even when she's in danger. No one holds their weapons right and Rod shows off his mustang so much that the mustang has more emotion than him. Nathaline is like a member of a cult who would kidnap children, which she does by the way. The lack of critical thinking of the actors within this movie is extremely concerning. The worst scene in this movie was when Rod and Natalie were at the beach with the two kids and Rod had to go fishing. This is the worst scene because Rod catches a fish about twenty seconds later, boils the entire, whole, raw fish, and Natalie then proceeded to pick seaweed and cook it in the pot with the fish. They would absolutely die in a real world crisis. Birdemic is a painful film to watch, mostly stemming from the actors' robotic voices and movement. It felt like English was not the actor's first language; however, that might not even be the worst part.Watching the film gives me second hand embarrassment, as well as a migraine due to the awful use of sound. The audio quality really made the cherry on top of this horrible movie. There were parts in the movie where the audio would cut in and out of just loud, white noise. Nobody would be talking and you would hear painfully loud radio sounds. Also, the edited gun and bird sounds were cattywampus. The lighting was always either glaring because it was too bright, or you were squinting to try to make out the actors through the shadows. The amount of time the camera spent following the car around was way overly excessive, and the oblique angles for no reason were making me nauseous. My main concern goes to the person responsible for the editing, I'm wondering \"Is he okay? Is he going through something?\" That's because the editing of Birdemic made me feel as if I was experiencing a fever dream. The camera and sound quality weren't even on the scale of being anywhere good and knowing that they are actually thought it was good makes it worse. It would be different if the director intended the film to be bad; but, I'm just scared for him.I had no intention in loving this film, but it prevailed. Birdemic is not competent in really any form, but there are a few bright spots. The makeup artist who worked on this film is easily the most talented of the whole crew, giving the only reasonable contribution in the entire movie. Nobody should've put time and effort into this film considering how bad the directing was, but everybody in it stuck around, and thanks to this, we all get a film to absolutely obliterate in the reviews. It is very obvious this film was bad. The movie was so bad it was comical. I do want to show other people this just because I watched it and other people also have to suffer.",
